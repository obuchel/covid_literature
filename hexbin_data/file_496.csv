6050,Exantheme nach Auslandsreisen,2019-10-09,"Leukotoxin is a linoleic acic oxide produced by leukocytes and has been associated with the multiple organ failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome seen in some severe burn patients. Leukotoxin has been reported to be toxic when injected into animals intravenously. Herein, we report that this lipid is not directly cytotoxic in at least two in vitro systems. Using a baculovirus expression system we demonstrate that leukotoxin is only cytotoxic in the presence of epoxide hydrolases. In addition, it is the diol metabolite that proves toxic to pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting a critical role for the diol in leukotoxin-associated respiratory disease. In vivo data also support the toxicity of leukotoxin diol. For the first time we demonstrate that soluble epoxide hydrolase can bioactivate epoxides to diols that are apparently cytotoxic. Thus leukotoxin should be regarded as a protoxin corresponding to the more toxic diol. This clearly has implications for designing new clinical interventions.","Moghaddam, Mehran F.; Grant, David F.; Cheek, Jeffrey M.; Greene, Jessica F.; Williamson, Kristin C.; Hammock, Bruce D.",Nat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095900/,496
6623,Subject Index to Volume 45 (2008),2008-11-16,"The excitement of molecular biology and of genetic knowledge and their possibilities must be balanced against our limitations in using this information for the care of our patients. There is a great discrepancy between what we know and what we can do. There are many reasons for this. A major one is that science must simplify/reduce the variables in experimentation and then generalize in terms of a specific factor or effect, whereas patients are complex with variables that we do not yet understand completely. This powerful science is now teaching us about the genetic diversity in both susceptibility and outcome of disease, and the diversity in life experiences and antigen exposures. Clinicians have tried to lump together and treat in a similar way many diverse human diseases. This has not worked well. Pancreatitis and perforated diverticulitis both produce inflammation and sepsis, but they are different processes and may both lead to multiple organ failure. This lumping together has contributed to the failure of so-called magic bullets. There are new contributors to organ damage. Gender, lifestyle and prior disease differences also complicate the care of patients. Despite this, we are slowly and gradually improving the care of our surgical patients by careful pre-, intra- and postoperative support and better, simpler and safer operations.","Baue, Arthur E.",Langenbecks Arch Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101854/,496
6955,Impact of comorbidity on outcomes and overall survival after open and minimally invasive esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer,2013-07-12,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The expanding population of immunocompromised patients coupled with the recognition of a growing number of different species of fungi responsible for diseases in such hosts makes the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection (IFI) a challenging task. The recent advances and challenges in the diagnosis of IFI in the setting of immunocompromised hosts are reviewed. The advantages and limitations of histopathology and the role of culture-independent methods, such as those based on the use of nucleic acids applied to fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, besides culture- and non-culture-based diagnostic methods, to obtain a timely and correct diagnosis of IFI are highlighted. RECENT FINDINGS: The therapeutic implications of identifying the genus and species of the fungus present in the specimen with the molecular diagnostics applied to tissue specimens are reviewed. No method alone is efficient in correctly identifying fungi and it is essential to combine the traditional histochemical staining with molecular methods to achieve a rapid and genus-/species-specific diagnosis of IFI. SUMMARY: We review the recent findings and challenges in the hystopathologic diagnosis of IFI in the setting of immunocompromised hosts. Non method alone is efficient in correctly identify fungi and pathologists should combine classic staining with molecular methods to achieve a rapid and genus/species fungal diagnosis.","Antinori, Spinello; Corbellino, Mario; Parravicini, Carlo",Curr Fungal Infect Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102396/,496

9777,NEWS,2014-10-28,"This paper presents the results of the New Zealand Poverty Measurement Project's analysis of the effects of the 1990s social reforms in New Zealand on the incidence and severity of poverty, and assesses the impact of five social and economic policies introduced by the Labour‐led coalition governments since 1999: New Zealand superannuation, income‐related rents on state houses, active labour market policies for an employment‐rich economy, the Primary Health Care Strategy and the planned income support policy to reduce child poverty. Superannuation is assessed as both adequate and sustainable, rents for state houses are found to be affordable, and GDP growth and employment have increased incrementally as unemployment and benefit numbers have decreased. The Primary Health Care Strategy is an innovative initiative that will increase affordable access to general practitioners, but it and the proposed child assistance initiatives are too new to be adequately assessed. Of the challenges that remain, policy priorities should centre on housing alternatives, including home ownership for low‐income households not in state houses; income support for poor households, particularly those with children; and multi‐sector development of education and training aimed at lifting economic and social capacity.","Waldegrave, Charles; Stephens, Robert; King, Peter",Aust J Soc Issues,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159747/,496
9778,An overview of Australia's poultry industry in 1989,2008-03-10,"Schultz ([1949] Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 7:401–424) presented a conundrum: among primates, sexual dimorphism of the pelvis is a developmental adjunct to dimorphism in other aspects of the body, albeit in the converse direction. Among species in which males are larger than females in body size, females are larger than males in some pelvic dimensions; species with little sexual dimorphism in nonpelvic size show little pelvic dimorphism. Obstetrical difficulty does not explain this relationship. The present study addresses this issue, evaluating the relationship between pelvic and femoral sexual dimorphism in 12 anthropoid species. The hypothesis is that species in which males are significantly larger than females in femoral size will have a higher incidence, magnitude, and variability of pelvic sexual dimorphism, with females having relatively larger pelves than males, compared with species monomorphic in femoral size. The results are consistent with the hypothesis. The proposed explanation is that the default pelvic anatomy in adulthood is that of the female; testosterone redirects growth from the default type to that of the male by differentially enhancing and repressing growth among the pelvic dimensions. Testosterone also influences sexual dimorphism of the femur. The magnitude of the pelvic response to testosterone is greater in species that are sexually dimorphic in the femur than in those that are monomorphic.

Although the majority of current vaccine strategies focus on the induction of neutralizing antibodies, there is substantial evidence that cellular immunity mediated by CD8(+) T cells can sustain long-term disease-free and transmission-free HIV control and may be harnessed to induce both therapeutic and preventive antiviral effects. In this Review, we discuss the increasing evidence derived from individuals who spontaneously control infection without antiretroviral therapy as well as preclinical immunization studies that provide a clear rationale for renewed efforts to develop a CD8(+) T cell-based HIV vaccine in conjunction with B cell vaccine efforts. Further, we outline the remaining challenges in translating these findings into viable HIV prevention, treatment and cure strategies.","Collins, David R.; Gaiha, Gaurav D.; Walker, Bruce D.",Nat Rev Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222980/,496

In recent years, significant progress has been made in this research area. A major breakthrough was the improvement and development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies. The application of these technologies resulted in the generation of large datasets derived from various environments such as soil and ocean water. The analyses of these datasets opened a window into the enormous phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of microbial communities living in a variety of ecosystems. In this way, structure, functions, and interactions of microbial communities were elucidated. Metagenomics has proven to be a powerful tool for the recovery of novel biomolecules. In most cases, functional metagenomics comprising construction and screening of complex metagenomic DNA libraries has been applied to isolate new enzymes and drugs of industrial importance. For this purpose, several novel and improved screening strategies that allow efficient screening of large collections of clones harboring metagenomes have been introduced.","Simon, Carola; Daniel, Rolf",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2773367/,496

14028,"Initial introduction of robot-assisted, minimally invasive esophagectomy using the microanatomy-based concept in the upper mediastinum",2020-11-10,"Au(PEt(3))I (AF-I hereafter), the iodide analog of the FDA-approved drug auranofin (AF hereafter), is a promising anticancer agent that produces its pharmacological effects through interaction with non-genomic targets such as the thioredoxin reductase system. AF-I is endowed with a very favorable biochemical profile showing potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against several cancer types including ovarian and colorectal cancer. Remarkably, in a recent publication, some of us reported that AF-I induces an almost complete and rapid remission in an orthotopic in vivo mouse model of ovarian cancer. The cytotoxic potency does not bring about highly severe side effects, making AF-I very well-tolerated even for higher doses, even more so than the pharmacologically active ones. All these promising features led us to expand our studies on the mechanistic aspects underlying the antitumor activity of AF-I. We report here on an integrated experimental and theoretical study on the reactivity of AF-I, in comparison with auranofin, toward relevant aminoacidic residues or their molecular models. Results point out that the replacement of the thiosugar moiety with iodide significantly affects the overall reactivity toward the amino acid residues histidine, cysteine, methionine, and selenocysteine. Altogether, the obtained results contribute to shed light into the enhanced antitumoral activity of AF-I compared with AF.","Tolbatov, Iogann; Cirri, Damiano; Marchetti, Lorella; Marrone, Alessandro; Coletti, Cecilia; Re, Nazzareno; La Mendola, Diego; Messori, Luigi; Marzo, Tiziano; Gabbiani, Chiara; Pratesi, Alessandro",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7531625/,496
18875,Antimicrobial prescribing guidelines for poultry,2021-03-29,"Rapid urbanisation of Afghan cities without proper construction regulation has exposed their population to a high risk of damage from disasters such as earthquakes. With the growing construction of local non-engineered buildings and an existing level of hazard of 0.8 g, a high risk of casualties and building damage threatens Kabul in the event of a disaster. This study reports and evaluates a recent retrofitting project in Kabul City by ‘Project for City Resilience’, carried out under the supervision of the United Nation Human Settlements Program (UN-Habitat) for 48 retrofitted sun-dried clay brick masonry buildings in Kabul. The project was executed by local masons and welders who were trained as a part of the project, and the main tasks included installation of an additional steel frame, additional reinforced concrete foundation ring, ceiling replacement and wall strengthening (via mesh and plaster). After a visual assessment of retrofitted buildings considering the original retrofitting design and actual work done, a vulnerability index for retrofitted buildings was developed based on a behaviour modifier factor, which was assigned to each retrofitting activity using a combination of values and a proportion of scores for each retrofitting activity. The results indicate that training of local masons and welders to undertake retrofitting activities could decrease the damage ratio by 15% – 20% for peak ground acceleration values of 0.3 g and higher. The methods mentioned in this study can be used to make existing sun-dried clay brick masonry buildings sufficiently resistant to earthquakes of moderate-to-severe intensity.","Mohammadi, Mohsen; Fujimi, Toshio",Jamba,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252141/,496

It is true that in many cases an inherited disposition may lead to a severe disease; however, it is also true that the number of genetic defects with a treatment option is continuously increasing and in some of them the onset of disease symptoms can even be totally prevented. Knowledge of the precise molecular pathomechanism is often the basis for a treatment concept. Genome-wide sequencing has tremendously increased the possibility to identify a genetic defect and its broad application has meanwhile made a decisive contribution in routine diagnostics. After identifying a genetic alteration, it is still necessary to investigate the pathobiochemical consequences on the cellular and systemic level. This can be a time-consuming process since not all functional consequences can be immediately recognized. In the case of metabolic defects the treatment strategy can either be a supplementation of missing products or a removal of toxic substrates. The residual function of affected pathways can also often be improved. Recently, the direct correction of the affected genetic defects has become a treatment option for a selected number of diseases.

Studies in Qatar and elsewhere have provided evidence that dromedary camels are a reservoir for the virus, but the exact modes of transmission of MERS-CoV to humans remain unclear. In February 2014, an assessment was made of the suitability and sensitivity of different types of sample for the detection of MERSCoV by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for three gene targets: UpE (upstream of the E gene), the N (nucleocapsid) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a.

In addition, the highest viral load, expressed as a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 11.27, was obtained from a nasal swab. These findings lead to the conclusion that nasal swabs are the candidate sample of choice for detecting MERS-CoV using RT-PCR technology in apparently healthy camels.","Mohran, K A; Farag, E A B; Reusken, C B E; Raj, V S; Lamers, M M; Pas, S D; Voermans, J; Smits, S L; Alhajri, M M; Alhajri, F; Al-Romaihi, H E; Ghobashy, H; El-Maghraby, M M; Al Dhahiry, S H S; Al-Mawlawi, N; El-Sayed, A M; Al-Thani, M; Al-Marri, S A; Haagmans, B L; Koopmans, M P G",Revue scientifique et technique,https://doi.org/10.20506/rst.35.3.2578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28332641/,496

Tissue damage resulting from inflammation is often mitigated by resolving factors that limit the scope and duration of the inflammatory response. Both inflammatory and resolving processes require the actions of a vast array of lipid mediators that can be rapidly synthesized through a variety of airway resident and infiltrating immune cells. Eicosanoids and endocannabinoids represent two major classes of lipid mediators that share synthetic enzymes and have diverse and overlapping functions. This review seeks to provide a summary of the major bioactive eicosanoids and endocannabinoids, challenges facing researchers that study them, as well as their roles in modulating inflammation and resolution. With a special emphasis on cystic fibrosis, a variety of therapeutics are discussed that have been explored for their potential anti-inflammatory or pro-resolving impact toward alleviating excessive airway inflammation and improving lung function.","Yonker, Lael M; Barrios, Juliana; Mou, Hongmei; Hurley, Bryan P",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.2165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423293/,496

The FET assay enables the assessment of multiple morphological endpoints during the development of zebrafish early life stages, showing high impact to the field of ecotoxicology on risk assessment of chemicals and pollutants. Moreover, it is also applied to screening drug-induced toxicity and human diseases, due to the high genetic and physiological orthology between zebrafish and humans. Here, we describe FET test, with all steps and several adaptations involved in the methodological procedures. To demonstrate the efficiency of this method, results using the reference substance 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA) were included to demonstrate sublethal and teratogenic malformations on zebrafish embryos. Thus, there is a strong tendency for using FET tests as a replacement strategy of traditional tests in toxicology and ecotoxicology.","Abe, Flávia Renata; Accoroni, Klaus Alvaro Guerrieri; Gravato, Carlos; de Oliveira, Danielle Palma",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1091-6_7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423228/,496

In this study, a congenic strain carrying a functional Oas1b gene, B6.MSM-Oas, was used to evaluate the pathogenicity of Far-Eastern TBEV. Although intracerebral infection of B6.MSM-Oas mice by Oshima 5-10 resulted in limited signs of illness, infection by Sofjin-HO resulted in death with severe neurologic signs. While Oshima 5-10 was cleared from the brain, Sofjin-HO was not cleared despite a similar level of expression of the intact Oas1b gene. Necrotic neurons with viral antigens and inflammatory reactions were observed in the brain infected with Sofjin-HO. These data indicate that the different susceptibility to the antiviral activity of Oas1b resulted in a difference in neurovirulence in the two TBEV strains.","Yoshii, Kentaro; Moritoh, Kanako; Nagata, Noriyo; Yokozawa, Kana; Sakai, Mizuki; Sasaki, Nobuya; Kariwa, Hiroaki; Agui, Takashi; Takashima, Ikuo",Archives of virology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-012-1579-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23266832/,496

Complementary to immunotherapies, drug repurposing is possibly the best option to arrive at COVID-19 treatments in the short-term. Areas covered: Repurposing prospects undergoing clinical trials or with some level of evidence emerging from clinical studies are overviewed. The authors discuss some possible intellectual property and commercial barriers to drug repurposing, and strategies to facilitate equitable access to incoming therapeutic solutions, highlighting the importance of collaborative drug discovery models. Based on a critical analysis of the available literature about in silico screens against SARS-CoV-2 main protease, the authors illustrate how frequently overconfident conclusions are being drawn in COVID-19 related literature. Expert opinion: Most of the current clinical trials on potential COVID-19 treatments are, in fact, drug repurposing examples. In October 2020, the FDA approved a repurposed antiviral, remdesivir, as the first treatment for COVID-19. Considering the high expectations invested in approaching therapeutic solutions, the scientific community must be careful not to raise unrealistic expectations. Today more than ever, the conclusions drawn in scientific reports have to be fully supported by the level of evidence, avoiding any sort of unfounded speculation.","Bellera, Carolina L; Llanos, Manuel; Gantner, Melisa E; Rodriguez, Santiago; Gavernet, Luciana; Comini, Marcelo; Talevi, Alan",Expert opinion on drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2021.1863943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345645/,496

Both innate and adaptive immunity contribute to the heterogeneous inflammatory pathogenesis of CRS, which is driven by genetic and environmental factors and the microbiome. CRS is classified by the presence of polyps. Molecular mechanisms in CRS with nasal polyps are similar to those in atopic diseases. AREAS COVERED This review focuses on the immune pathogenesis of CRS, differences between the two CRS subtypes, and latest treatments that may aid in the provision of personalized medicine. EXPERT OPINION Basic research in the last decade has helped significantly in enhancing our knowledge of the pathophysiologic processes of CRS, due to which there is now a better understanding of the associated natural history, physiopathology, novel treatments, and prevention strategies. Treatment success depends on the clarification of the underlying pathogenesis and disease-contributing factors. The exploration of disease endotypes and introduction of novel agents are important advancements. Prior studies performed without disease-endotyping resulted in the inefficiency of certain drugs and insignificant results. The identification of biomarkers, development of personalized approaches, and utilization of disease algorithms are required for CRS therapy success.","Kucuksezer, Umut Can; Ozdemir, Cevdet; Akdis, Mubeccel; Akdis, Cezmi A",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2018.1527904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30345822/,496

62108,Comparison of short-term outcomes following minimally invasive versus open Sweet esophagectomy for Siewert type II adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction.,2020-04-01,"PURPOSE Acquired perineal hernias through the reconstructed pelvic floor can complicate radical pelvic operations including abdominoperineal resection of rectum. Operative intervention is indicated for symptomatic hernias. There is a lack of consensus as to the best operative technique. Here we present a novel method for repairing perineal herniation using saline-filled tissue expanders. METHODS Perineal hernia repair may be affected either via an abdominal or via a perineal approach. After adhesiolysis to remove small bowel from the pelvis, a Natrelle™ 150SH tissue expander (Allergan Inc., California, USA) or Siltex™ Round Becker (Mentor Medical Systems, Holland) of appropriate size is inserted in the pelvis and the button placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the perineal skin. The tissue expander is then filled with saline until it fills the true anatomical pelvis without bladder compression. The volume may be increased or decreased postoperatively by accessing the subcutaneous button. RESULTS We have performed this procedure in three patients with some success, all of whom have experienced symptomatic relief. The tissue expander may subsequently be removed without recurrence of symptoms, due to the fibrous capsule which forms. One patient required re-operation to elevate a herniating tissue expander. The tissue expander was removed earlier than anticipated to avoid deep pelvic infection in another. CONCLUSION Our early experience suggests that using saline-filled tissue expanders to fill dead space in the pelvis after radical surgery may prove to be a valuable approach to perineal herniation, particularly if adjuvant radiotherapy is planned.","Ali, J M; Stabler, A; Hall, N R; Irwin, M; Miller, R; Fearnhead, N S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-012-0939-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22739981/,496
62375,Controversy: A Fundamental Ingredient for Gynecologic Surgical Progress.,2021-01-15,"Various hydroxyethyl starch (HES) preparations have been used for decades to augment blood volume. There has been concern recently regarding possible adverse outcomes when using HES in the intensive care setting, especially in patients with septic shock. However, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of HES preparations depend on their chemical composition and source material. Thus, different clinical conditions could result in differing effectiveness and safety for these preparations. Consequently, we assessed the safety of tetrastarches when used during surgery, using a formal search, that yielded 59 primary full publications of studies that met a priori inclusion criteria and randomly allocated 4529 patients with 2139 patients treated with tetrastarch compared with 2390 patients treated with a comparator. There were no indications that the use of tetrastarches during surgery induces adverse renal effects as assessed by change or absolute concentrations of serum creatinine or need for renal replacement therapy (39 trials, 3389 patients), increased blood loss (38 trials, 3280 patients), allogeneic erythrocyte transfusion (20 trials, 2151 patients; odds ratio for HES transfusion 0.73 [95% confidence interval = 0.61-0.87], P = 0.0005), or increased mortality (odds ratio for HES mortality = 0.51 [0.24-1.05], P = 0.079).","Van Der Linden, Philippe; James, Michael; Mythen, Michael; Weiskopf, Richard B",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31827175da; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23115254/,496

OBJECTIVE To compare the prevalence of HCoV species among children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and/or fever (ARI/fever) with that among asymptomatic controls and to assess the severity of outcomes among hospitalized children with HCoV infection compared with other respiratory viruses. METHODS From December 2003 to April 2004 and October 2004 to April 2005, we conducted prospective, population-based surveillance of children <5 years of age hospitalized for ARI/fever in 3 US counties. Asymptomatic outpatient controls were enrolled concurrently. Nasal/throat swabs were tested for HCoV species HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43 by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Specimens from hospitalized children were also tested for other common respiratory viruses. Demographic and medical data were collected by parent/guardian interview and medical chart review. RESULTS Overall, HCoV was detected in 113 (7.6%) of 1481 hospitalized children (83 [5.7%] after excluding 30 cases coinfected with other viruses) and 53 (7.1%) of 742 controls. The prevalence of HCoV or individual species was not significantly higher among hospitalized children than controls. Hospitalized children testing positive for HCoV alone tended to be less ill than those infected with other viruses, whereas those coinfected with HCoV and other viruses were clinically similar to those infected with other viruses alone. CONCLUSIONS In this study of children hospitalized for ARI/fever, HCoV infection was not associated with hospitalization or with increased severity of illness.","Prill, Mila M; Iwane, Marika K; Edwards, Kathryn M; Williams, John V; Weinberg, Geoffrey A; Staat, Mary A; Willby, Melisa J; Talbot, H Keipp; Hall, Caroline B; Szilagyi, Peter G; Griffin, Marie R; Curns, Aaron T; Erdman, Dean D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31823e07fe; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22094637/,496

Aim To assess the psychological status of the Indian population during the initial phase of lockdown. Method It was a cross-sectional online survey where the questionnaire was disbursed by snowballing. The link to the survey was shared in different social networking platforms between 6th and 22nd of April 2020. The questionnaire collected responses related to the sociodemographic variables, exposure history, precautionary measures used, and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) score. Results A total of 541 participants responded to the questionnaire. Only 422 respondents' responses from 23 states of India who completed the questionnaire were included for assessment. The mean age of the participants was 30.5 (SD=10.9) years. Female constituted 60.4% (n=255) of the respondents. The pre-existing medical illness that the respondents had were diabetes mellitus, four per cent (n=17), hypertension, five per cent (n=21), thyroid dysfunction, nine per cent (n=38), and mental illness, five per cent (n=21). The median (IQR) of the DASS-21 item scale was found to be 16 (4-32). The percentage of the respondents who reported stress was 35.5% (n=149), anxiety, 32% (n=135), and depression, 34.7% (n=146). Respondents with sociodemographic variables like being single, student status, competed education till graduation, homemakers, working in public sector, and history of mental illness were more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. A majority of the respondents were practicing hand hygiene and social distancing. Respondents who were unaware of their exposure status were more likely to have depression. Conclusion The Indian population is experiencing the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which may increase with the spread of the infection. India needs to gear up to face mental health consequences. People with a pre-existing physical and psychological illness needs extra care and precaution to prevent any relapse or development of complications.","Hazarika, Mythili; Das, Shyamanta; Bhandari, Samrat Singh; Sharma, Phulen",Open journal of psychiatry & allied sciences,https://doi.org/10.5958/2394-2061.2021.00009.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123627/,496

AIM Our goal was to assess the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on Hungarian acute ischemic stroke care. METHOD We compared demographical and clinical characteristics, rate of intravenous and endovascular therapies and therapeutic time parameters of acute ischemic strokes admitted to a university stroke centre in a COVID-epidemic period (01/03/2020-30/04/2020) and an identical period of 2019. RESULTS 86 patients were admitted during the COVID-period and 97 in the control period. Demographical and clinical characteristics of these periods were well-balanced. In the COVID-period, the proportion of patients arriving beyond 24 hours after onset increased by 13% (p = 0.046), the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged (8%), the rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased from 26% to 16%, the mean onset-to-treatment time of thrombolysis increased by 20 minutes, while the mean door-to-treatment time increased by only 5 minutes. Behind the shift of arrival time categories, multivariable (year of examination, NIHSS, age) logistic regression shows that the year of examination might play a leading role (p = 0.096). CONCLUSION In the COVID-period, admissions for acute ischemic strokes decreased by 11% and the proportion of cases certainly untreatable by reperfusion therapies (arriving beyond 24 hours after onset) increased significantly. While the rate of endovascular interventions remained unchanged, the absolute rate of intravenous thrombolysis decreased by 10% and the mean onset-to-treatment time showed a tendency to increase. In these changes, the COVID-epidemic itself and related out-of-hospital factors might play a leading role.

The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the organization and execution of activities in the clinical sector. Asymptomatic infections are increasingly being identified when patients seek medical advice for nonrespiratory system illnesses, particularly digestive system symptoms. This has posed a significant challenge for clinical diagnosis and treatment. Based on the clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 reported to date, patients with typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with symptoms associated with the digestive system. Digestive illness symptoms in patients with COVID-19 are underscored by a bidirectional relationship between respiratory and digestive systems. Because the clinical diagnosis and treatment of digestive illnesses caused by COVID-19 have been challenging so far, we hypothesized that investigating the pathogenesis of digestive system diseases in patients with COVID-19 will provide potential novel targets for its prevention and treatment, and concurrently reduce COVID-19 virulence and sociosanitary burden. This review summarizes the relationship between the digestive and respiratory systems in patients with COVID-19 from the perspective of the ""gut-lung"" axis. We discuss extant literature on the pathogenesis of COVID-19-related digestive symptoms, which may facilitate differential diagnosis and treatment of this condition.","Li, Juan; Li, Chunmei; Wang, Xiaojun; Wang, Yuping; Zhou, Yongning",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832321/,496

The number of new cases reported nationally this fortnight was 764, a 61% decrease from the previous fortnight (1,948). On average this represented 55 cases diagnosed each day over the reporting period, a decrease from 125 cases per day over the previous reporting period. 84% of all cases (640/764) were reported in Victoria, with a smaller number of cases reported from New South Wales (95), Queensland (22), Western Australia (4) and South Australia (3). In Victoria, 97% of cases (621) were locally acquired and were mostly reported from residential aged care facilities; and 3% of cases (19) were reported as under investigation at the date of extract this reporting period. Excluding Victoria, 124 cases were reported nationally, 32% (40) were overseas acquired; 65% (81) were locally acquired, predominantly in New South Wales (62); and 2% (3) of cases were under investigation at this time, all reported in Queensland. The continued decrease in new cases observed this fortnight in Victoria is likely associated with the enhanced public health measures that are currently in place in Victoria. Locally-acquired cases which were predominantly associated with several interconnected clusters continued to be reported in New South Wales. In Queensland, 82% of cases (18/22) were reported as locally acquired from two clusters associated with immigration centres or correctional facilities.

Transcriptomics is an essential part of modern biomedical research based on highly sophisticated and reliable technology. Transcriptomics can aid clinical practice and improve the precision of clinical diagnoses and decision-making by complementing existing clinical best practice. The power of which will be increased when combined with genomic variation from genome wide association studies and next generation sequencing. We are witnessing the implementation of RNA-based technologies in clinical practice that will eventually lead to the establishment of transcriptional medicine as a routine tool in diagnosis. Progress in genomic analytical technologies has improved our possibilities to obtain information regarding DNA, RNA, and their dynamic changes that occur over time or in response to specific challenges. This information describes the blueprint for cells, tissues, and organisms and has fundamental importance for all living organisms. This review focuses on the technological challenges to analyze the transcriptome and what is the impact of transcriptomics on precision medicine. The transcriptome is a term that covers all RNA present in cells and a substantial part of it will never be translated into protein but is nevertheless functional in determining cell phenotype. Recent developments in transcriptomics have challenged the fundamentals of the central dogma of biology by providing evidence of pervasive transcription of the genome. Such massive transcriptional activity is challenging the definition of a gene and especially the term ""pseudogene"" that has now been demonstrated in many examples to be both transcribed and translated. We also review the common sources of biomaterials for transcriptomics and justify the suitability of whole blood RNA as the current optimal analyte for clinical transcriptomics. At the end of the review, a brief overview of the clinical implications of transcriptomics in clinical trial design and clinical diagnosis is given. Finally, we introduce the transcriptome as a target for modern drug development as a tool for extending our capacity for precision medicine in multiple diseases.","Koks, Gea; Pfaff, Abigail L; Bubb, Vivien J; Quinn, John P; Koks, Sulev",Experimental biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1535370220954788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915637/,496

Clearly the virus could affect the brain in some ways, but it wasn't, Thomas thought then, anything serious. But this report sounded much more concerning. Symptoms like this patient's would mean the virus was accessing more of the nervous system than scientists originally thought.","Berglund, Jennifer",IEEE pulse,https://doi.org/10.1109/mpuls.2021.3052591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606616/,496

65305,Randomized clinical trial comparing two vessel-sealing devices with crush clamping during liver transection.,2016,"Acute pancreatitis (AP), an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas with a high hospitalization rate, frequently leads to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). However, therapeutic targets for effective treatment and early intervention of AP are still urgently required to be identified. Here, we have observed that the expression of pancreatic lincRNA-EPS, a long intergenic noncoding RNA, is dynamically changed during both caerulein-induced AP (Cer-AP) and sodium taurocholate-induced severe AP (NaTc-SAP). The expression pattern of lincRNA-EPS is negatively correlated with the typical inflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-1β, CXCL1, and CXCL2. Further studies indicate that knockout of lincRNA-EPS aggravates the pathological symptoms of AP including more induction of serum amylase and lipase, severe edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and acinar necrosis in both experimental AP mouse models. Besides these intrapancreatic effects, lincRNA-EPS also protects against tissue damages in the extra-pancreatic organs such as lung, liver, and gut in the NaTc-SAP mouse model. In addition, we have observed that more serum pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in the lincRNA-EPS-/- NaTc-SAP mice and more extracellular HMGB1 around injured acinar cells in the pancreas from lincRNA-EPS-/- NaTc-SAP mice, compared to their respective controls. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB activity by BAY11-7082 significantly abolishes the suppressive effect of lincRNA-EPS on TLR4 ligand-induced inflammatory genes in macrophages. Our study has described a protective role of lincRNA-EPS in alleviating AP and SAP, outlined a novel pathway that lincRNA-EPS suppresses HMGB1-NF-κB-dependent inflammatory response in pancreatic macrophages, and provided a potential therapeutic target for SAP.","Chen, Shengchuan; Zhu, Jingfei; Sun, Li-Qiong; Liu, Siying; Zhang, Tan; Jin, Yuepeng; Huang, Chaohao; Li, Dapei; Yao, Haiping; Huang, Jian; Qin, Yanghua; Zhou, Mengtao; Chen, Gang; Zhang, Qiyu; Ma, Feng",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.13313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512718/,496
65571,Safety and location analysis of transumbilical endoscopic submucosal dissection with single-basin lymph node dissection in the upper gastric body: a porcine model.,2019,"AIM To describe the common elements of Graduate Entry Master of Nursing curricula and identify a set of standards and quality indicators for benchmarking purposes within and across jurisdictions. BACKGROUND Internationally, there has been an increase in universities offering Graduate Entry Masters programs in Nursing. Such programs specify a bachelor degree as an entry requirement and then offer an intensive program of study that prepares graduates for registration as a nurse. To date, no formal standards exist to guide evaluation of these curricula. DESIGN A two phased sequential mixed-methods design comprising thematic content analysis of curricula and a Delphi study. The setting was the Australian and New Zealand tertiary education sectors. Participants were nurse academics who were recruited to participate in the Delphi study. Quota sampling was used to identify educators from the education providers meeting organisational inclusion criteria (program coordinator and one lecturer working as a subject coordinator of the program) and nominated by their Head of Department. METHODS Phase One of the study involved a thematic analysis of the curricula of nine Graduate Entry Master of Nursing programs to identify common elements of curricula and domains of quality. In Phase Two these themes were used in a series of Delphi rounds to identify a set of agreed quality domains, statements and indicators. RESULTS Participants (n = 16) responded over three Delphi rounds. A total of nine domains of quality were determined, a set of 26 quality statements were identified based on the acceptance threshold of > 75% level of agreement and 27 quality indicators were established. CONCLUSIONS Our research provides an agreed set of indicators for evaluating the quality of Graduate Entry Master of Nursing programs. This work will also make it possible to measure the immediate and longer-term impacts of Graduate Entry Master of Nursing programs for the nursing workforce. Future work must focus on testing feasibility and optimising utility while refining indicators across jurisdictions.","Gerdtz, Marie F; Seaton, Philippa; Jones, Virginia; Tomkins, Zerina; Stacey, Gemma; Brooks, Ingrid Ann; Kapp, Suzanne",Nurse education in practice,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nepr.2021.103151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399306/,496
65922,Effect of laparoscopic splenectomy on portal haemodynamics in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension.,2014,"BACKGROUND Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics/Latinos. Thus, understanding health-related quality of life (HRQOL) needs among this diverse racial/ethnic group is critical. Using Ferrell's multidimensional framework for measuring QOL, we synthesized evidence on HRQOL needs among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors. METHODS We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, for English language articles published between 1995 and January 2020, reporting HRQOL among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors in the USA. RESULTS Of the 648 articles reviewed, 176 met inclusion criteria, with 100 of these studies focusing exclusively on breast cancer patients and no studies examining end-of-life HRQOL issues. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics/Latinos reported lower HRQOL and a higher symptom burden across multiple HRQOL domains. Over 80% of studies examining racial/ethnic differences in psychological well-being (n = 45) reported worse outcomes among Hispanics/Latinos compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors were also more likely to report suboptimal physical well-being in 60% of studies assessing racial/ethnic differences (n = 27), and Hispanics/Latinos also reported lower social well-being relative to non-Hispanics/Latinos in 78% of studies reporting these outcomes (n = 32). In contrast, reports of spiritual well-being and spirituality-based coping were higher among Hispanics/Latinos cancer survivors in 50% of studies examining racial/ethnic differences (n = 15). DISCUSSION Findings from this review point to the need for more systematic and tailored interventions to address HRQOL needs among this growing cancer survivor population. Future HRQOL research on Hispanics/Latinos should evaluate variations in HRQOL needs across cancer types and Hispanic/Latino subgroups and assess HRQOL needs during metastatic and end-of-life disease phases.","Samuel, Cleo A; Mbah, Olive M; Elkins, Wendi; Pinheiro, Laura C; Szymeczek, Mary Anne; Padilla, Neda; Walker, Jennifer S; Corbie-Smith, Giselle","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02527-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430782/,496

Protective ileostomy (PI) during anterior resection (AR) for rectal cancer decreases the incidence of anastomotic leakage (AL) and its subsequent complications, but it may itself be the cause of morbidity. The aim is to report our protocol in the management of selected patients with borderline risk to develop AL after laparoscopic AR and ghost ileostomy (GI) creation. Methods. Patients who underwent AR were stratified based on the risk to develop AL. Steps to avoid PI were splenic flexure mobilization, reduced pelvic bleeding, to employ different stapler charge if neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy is performed, to perform a horizontal section of the rectum, to evaluate the anastomotic vascularization with a fluorescence angiography, to perform a side-to-end anastomosis, intraoperative methylene blue test, pelvic and transanal drainage tubes placement, and the GI creation. After surgery, inflammatory blood markers were monitored to detect potential leakages. Results. Twelve patients were included. In one case, the specimen proximal section was changed after fluorescence angiography. There were no conversions in this group of patients. One postoperative AL occurred and was treated with radiological drainage placement, not being necessary to convert the GI. PI was avoided in 100% of cases. Conclusions. Patients' characteristics cannot be changed, but several steps were used to avoid routine PI creation. The present protocol could be a valuable option to avoid PI in selected patients. Further studies with a wider sample size, and defined criteria to stratify the patients based on the risk to develop AL, are required.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Alarcón, Isaias; Yang, Tao; Licardie, Eugenio; Balla, Andrea",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350619890720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31789117/,496

METHODS The study used a quantitative, cross-sectional approach. Data was collected online using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18); the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-6 (CAS-6) and a questionnaire that included psychological and sociodemographic questions. The total sample size consisted of 1559 respondents from Honduras (34%), Chile (29%), Costa Rica (17%), Mexico (11%), and Spain (9%). RESULTS The most common stress domains correspond to family (22.97%), financial (22.53%), academic (16.47%), leisure time constraints (14.23%), health (12.48%), peer group (7.63%), and religious concerns (3.69%). These domains are significantly associated with the respondent's country, sex, employment status, and being or not a health worker. Respondents who reported confinement stress also reported higher scores in anxiety, depression, and somatization. The Global Severity Index was significantly predicted by confinement stress, health, academic, and leisure time-related stress, sex, age, being a health worker, COVID-19 Personal Concern, and Perceived Seriousness. Non-significant predictors were employment status, the number of people at home, presence of older adults and children at home, financial, peer group, family, and religious concerns; the regression model had an R2 of 0.26. Similar analyses were conducted for somatization, depression, and anxiety subscales. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on the mental health of the general population, particularly regarding anxiety, depression, and somatization. Specific populations, such as women and healthcare workers, are at particular risk of suffering a deterioration in mental wellbeing.

67165,Equine disease surveillance: quarterly update.,2019,"UNLABELLED Coronaviruses (CoVs) are unique in encoding a 3'→5' exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is required for high-fidelity replication, likely via proofreading. nsp14 associates with the CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp), and nsp14-ExoN activity is enhanced by binding nsp10, a small nonenzymatic protein. However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(+)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(+), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(+), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(+). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(-) relative to MHV-ExoN(-), indicating that the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(-) is linked to the presence of ExoN activity. Our results demonstrate that nsp10 is important for CoV replication fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10 functions to regulate nsp14-ExoN activity during virus replication. IMPORTANCE The adaptive capacity of CoVs, as well as all other RNA viruses, is partially attributed to the presence of extensive population genetic diversity. However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.","Smith, Everett Clinton; Case, James Brett; Blanc, Hervé; Isakov, Ofer; Shomron, Noam; Vignuzzi, Marco; Denison, Mark R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00110-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855750/,496
67525,Transthoracic repair of an incarcerated diaphragmatic hernia using hexamethylene diisocyanate cross-linked porcine dermal collagen (Permacol).,2012,"BACKGROUND Catheter-associated deep venous thromboses (CADVTs) are a common occurrence in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), necessitating central venous catheter (CVC) removal and replacement. Previous studies evaluating risk factors for CADVT in SICU patients are limited, and most lack a true denominator of all CVC days. We sought to determine the true incidence of and risk factors for CADVT based on patient characteristics as well as CVC site, type, and duration of insertion. METHODS The following data from all SICU patients in two urban Level I trauma centers were prospectively collected from 2009 to 2012: demographics, risk factors for DVT, CVC site/type/duration, and duplex results. Sites included the subclavian (SC), internal jugular (IJ), arm (for peripherally inserted central catheter [PICC] lines), and femoral. Types included multilumen (ML), introducer/hemodialysis (I/HD), and PICC. High-risk patients received weekly screening duplex examinations and a CADVT was defined as a DVT being detected on duplex with a CVC in place or within 7 days of removal. Rates of CADVT were normalized per 1,000 CVC days, and independent predictors of CADVT were determined using logistic regression. RESULTS Data were complete for 184 patients, 354 CVCs, and 2,128 CVC days. Fifty-nine CADVTs were diagnosed in 28% of patients. Rates of CADVT were 9 per 1,000 catheter days for SC, 61 for IJ (p < 0.01 vs. SC), 27 for arm (p < 0.01), 36 for femoral (p < 0.01), 22 for ML, 57 for I/HD (p < 0.01 vs. ML), and 27 for PICC (p = 0.24). After adjusting for patient risk factors, predictors of CADVT included the IJ and arm sites (odds ratio, 6.0 and 3.0 compared with SC) and the I/HD type (odds ratio, 2.6 compared with ML, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The IJ and arm sites and I/HD type are associated with increased CADVT. These data may be used to determine the optimal site and type of CVC for insertion.

67668,Geodemographies of Breastfeeding Support.,2020-07-31,"BACKGROUND Incisional hernias repaired with mesh can be expected have a lower recurrence rate than with primary repair. Biologic implants have replaced synthetic meshes in certain complex settings. We compared two porcine-dermis derived implants--cross-linked Permacol™ biologic implant and non-cross linked Strattice-firm™ tissue matrix--in a ventral hernia animal model. Our hypothesis is that cross-linked biologic implants are remodeled differently and thus behave differently than non-cross-linked biologic implants. METHODS Eighty-nine, female Sprague-Dawley rats had a 3 × 3 cm full-thickness segment of the abdominal wall excised. A 3 × 3 cm biologic mesh, either Permacol™ or Strattice™, was secured and the skin was closed. At 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-month time intervals, rats in each group were sacrificed and the mesh was excised. The number of adhesions, surface area, mesh thickness and tensile strength were determined, and immunohistochemical analysis performed. RESULTS Permacol™ biologic implant maintained thickness while Strattice™ thickness decreased significantly starting at 3 months. Adhesion area and tenacity were not significantly different between Permacol™ and Strattice™ at all time points. The tensile strength of the Permacol™ biologic implant was greater than that of Strattice™ at 3, 6 and 12 months. Migration of host cells and neo-vascularization was observed in both implant groups.

DESIGN Systematic review and external validation. DATA SOURCES PubMed and Embase. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Studies describing the development of a model to predict the risk of nephropathy, applicable to people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were done in duplicate. Eligible models were externally validated in the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) cohort (n=11 450) for the same outcomes for which they were developed. Risks of nephropathy were calculated and compared with observed risk over 2, 5, and 10 years of follow-up. Model performance was assessed based on intercept adjusted calibration and discrimination (Harrell's C statistic). RESULTS 41 studies included in the systematic review reported 64 models, 46 of which were developed in a population with diabetes and 18 in the general population including diabetes as a predictor. The predicted outcomes included albuminuria, diabetic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease (general population), and end stage renal disease. The reported apparent discrimination of the 46 models varied considerably across the different predicted outcomes, from 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 0.64) to 0.99 (not available) for the models developed in a diabetes population and from 0.59 (not available) to 0.96 (0.95 to 0.97) for the models developed in the general population. Calibration was reported in 31 of the 41 studies, and the models were generally well calibrated. 21 of the 64 retrieved models were externally validated in the Hoorn DCS cohort for predicting risk of albuminuria, diabetic kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease, with considerable variation in performance across prediction horizons and models. For all three outcomes, however, at least two models had C statistics >0.8, indicating excellent discrimination. In a secondary external validation in GoDARTS (Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland), models developed for diabetic kidney disease outperformed those for chronic kidney disease. Models were generally well calibrated across all three prediction horizons. CONCLUSIONS This study identified multiple prediction models to predict albuminuria, diabetic kidney disease, chronic kidney disease, and end stage renal disease. In the external validation, discrimination and calibration for albuminuria, diabetic kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease varied considerably across prediction horizons and models. For each outcome, however, specific models showed good discrimination and calibration across the three prediction horizons, with clinically accessible predictors, making them applicable in a clinical setting.

68900,Safe management of anastomotic leakage after gastric cancer surgery with enteral nutrition via a nasointestinal tube.,2012,"Recent studies have investigated bilateral gaits based on the causality analysis of kinetic (or kinematic) signals recorded using both feet. However, these approaches have not considered the influence of their simultaneous causation, which might lead to inaccurate causality inference. Furthermore, the causal interaction of these signals has not been investigated within their frequency domain. Therefore, in this study we attempted to employ a causal-decomposition approach to analyze bilateral gait. The vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) signals of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy control (HC) individuals were taken as an example to illustrate this method. To achieve this, we used ensemble empirical mode decomposition to decompose the left and right VGRF signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from the high to low frequency bands. The causal interaction strength (CIS) between each pair of IMFs was then assessed through the use of their instantaneous phase dependency. The results show that the CISes between pairwise IMFs decomposed in the high frequency band of VGRF signals can not only markedly distinguish PD patients from HC individuals, but also found a significant correlation with disease progression, while other pairwise IMFs were not able to produce this. In sum, we found for the first time that the frequency specific causality of bilateral gait may reflect the health status and disease progression of individuals. This finding may help to understand the underlying mechanisms of walking and walking-related diseases, and offer broad applications in the fields of medicine and engineering.","Peng, Xiaohang; Feng, Yukun; Ji, Shengjie; Amos, Joan Toluwani; Wang, Wenan; Li, Min; Ai, Shaolong; Qiu, Xiangzhe; Dong, Yeyun; Ma, Dan; Yao, Dezhong; Valdes-Sosa, Pedro A; Ren, Peng",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2021.3082936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029190/,496

BACKGROUND For every individual in the United States who died of a firearm injury in 2017, three survived, living with the burden of their injury. Current firearm research largely focuses on mortality and short-term health outcomes, while neglecting the long-term consequences. METHODS We contacted adult patients with a moderate-to-severe injury from a firearm or motor vehicle crash (MVC) treated at 3 level I trauma centers in Boston between 2015 and 2018. Patients were contacted 6 to 12 months postinjury to measure: presence of daily pain; screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); new functional limitations; return to work; and physical and mental health-related quality of life. We matched each firearm injury patient to MVC patients using Coarsened Exact Matching. Adjusted Generalized Linear Models were used to compare matched patients. RESULTS Of 177 eligible firearm injury survivors, 100 were successfully contacted and 63 completed the study. Among them, 67.7% reported daily pain, 53.2% screened positive for PTSD, 38.7% reported a new functional limitation in an activity of daily living, and 59.1% have not returned to work. Compared with population norms, overall physical and mental health-related quality of life was significantly reduced among firearm injury survivors. Compared with matched MVC survivors (n = 255), firearm injury survivors were significantly more likely to have daily pain [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-4.87], to screen positive for PTSD (adjusted OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.42-6.58), and had significantly worse physical and mental health-related quality of life.

Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) and importin 8 (IPO8), were the best reference genes among the 16 genes in the LDAs with coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.51 and 4.55%, respectively. However, when the LDAs data were further analyzed by the geNorm and NormFinder softwares, IPO8, a nuclear protein mediating import of proteins, was the first and the third better reference gene, respectively. IPO8 and FBXL10 were further validated by real-time PCR in additional OM and SC fat samples and primary cultured preadipocytes. According to their CV, IPO8 resulted more suitable than FBXL10 in both adipose tissue depots and SC preadipocytes, whereas FBXL10 performed better than IPO8 in OM cultured preadipocytes. Both genes expression levels did not change throughout adipogenesis. Thus, we provide clear evidence that IPO8 and FBXL10 are good candidates to use as reference genes in gene expression studies in human OM and SC adipose tissues as well as differentiated primary preadipocytes.","Hurtado del Pozo, Carmen; Calvo, Rosa M; Vesperinas-García, Gregorio; Gómez-Ambrosi, Javier; Frühbeck, Gema; Corripio-Sánchez, Ramón; Rubio, Miguel A; Obregon, Maria-Jesus",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2009.374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19876011/,496

69060,Ecoepidemics overcoming the species barrier and being subject to harvesting.,2013,"BACKGROUND When 30 s of initial positive pressure ventilation fails to stabilize the heart rate (HR) of newborns in the delivery room, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation guidelines recommend initiation of cardiac compressions. However, it may take longer than 30 s to establish effective pulmonary gas exchange. Whether a longer period of initial ventilation to reverse asphyxia would result in less need for cardiac compressions is unknown. OBJECTIVES Our purpose was to investigate the effect of three different initial ventilation intervals prior to initiation of cardiac compressions on hemodynamic parameters, arterial blood gases, oxygen saturations and markers of inflammation and hypoxic damage in a piglet model of asystole due to asphyxia. METHODS Noroc piglets were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. Progressive asphyxia was induced until asystole occurred. Randomization was made to ventilation with 21% O(2) for (1) 30 s (n = 16), (2) 1 min (n = 16), or (3) 1.5 min (n = 8) before initiation of cardiac compressions. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was defined as HR ≥100 min(-1). RESULTS Piglets initially ventilated for 30 s and 1 and 1.5 min achieved ROSC in a median of 150 (interquartile range 115-180),163 (124-177) and 282 (199-364) s, respectively. p value for group 1 versus group 2 was 0.51 and <0.001 for group 1 versus group 3. There were no differences in temporal changes in oxygen saturations, mean arterial blood pressure, HR, pH, pCO(2), interleukin-1β or lactate/pyruvate ratios between groups. CONCLUSION Although an additional 30 s to ensure effective ventilation does not impair the speed or success in achieving ROSC, delaying circulatory support for as long as 1.5 min of initial ventilation may be harmful.","Dannevig, Ingrid; Solevåg, Anne L; Wyckoff, Myra; Saugstad, Ola D; Nakstad, Britt",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000302718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20829634/,496

69585,Short-term perioperative outcomes after robot-assisted and laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy.,2014,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β cells. BDC2.5 T cells in BDC2.5 CD4+ T cell receptor transgenic Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice (BDC2.5 + NOD mice) can abruptly invade the pancreatic islets resulting in severe insulitis that progresses rapidly but rarely leads to spontaneous diabetes. This prevention of diabetes is mediated by T regulatory (Treg) cells in these mice. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the inhibition of diabetes in BDC2.5 + NOD mice by generating Il-10-deficient BDC2.5 + NOD mice (BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice). Our results showed that BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice displayed robust and accelerated diabetes development. Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice promoted the generation of neutrophils in the bone marrow and increased the proportions of neutrophils in the periphery (blood, spleen, and islets), accompanied by altered intestinal immunity and gut microbiota composition. In vitro studies showed that the gut microbiota from BDC2.5 + Il-10 -/- NOD mice can expand neutrophil populations. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrated that the depletion of endogenous gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment decreased the proportion of neutrophils. Although Il-10 deficiency in BDC2.5 + NOD mice had no obvious effects on the proportion and function of Treg cells, it affected the immune response and activation of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the pathogenicity of CD4+ T cells was much increased, and this significantly accelerated the development of diabetes when these CD4+ T cells were transferred into immune-deficient NOD mice. Our study provides novel insights into the role of IL-10 in the modulation of neutrophils and CD4+ T cells in BDC2.5 + NOD mice, and suggests important crosstalk between gut microbiota and neutrophils in type 1 diabetes development.","Huang, Juan; Tan, Qiyuan; Tai, Ningwen; Pearson, James Alexander; Li, Yangyang; Chao, Chen; Zhang, Lucy; Peng, Jian; Xing, Yanpeng; Zhang, Luyao; Hu, Youjia; Zhou, Zhiguang; Wong, F Susan; Wen, Li",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.702955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394099/,496
69680,Initial experience in uniportal subxiphoid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for major lung resections.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Traumatic intracranial pseudoaneurysms present a challenge for treatment. Traditionally these lesions have required a deconstructive approach consisting of vessel sacrifice since their fragile nature often makes direct microsurgical repair or coil embolization hazardous. As a high-viscosity liquid embolic agent that results in immediate, vessel sparing aneurysm occlusion, Onyx-HD 500 represents a uniquely efficacious tool for this clinical situation. CASE SUMMARY We report the case of a 56-year-old right-handed gentleman who suffered a vascular injury to the ICA during revision transsphenoidal surgery for a recurrent pituitary macroadenoma. The patient was initially treated with nasal packing, but after recurrent episodes of epistaxis and a CT angiogram demonstrating a large traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysm, the patient was referred for invasive treatment. Given the presumed fragility of the lesion, embolization with Onyx-HD 500 was chosen in order to safely achieve immediate aneurysm occlusion without the need for vessel sacrifice. After an early recurrence due to incomplete initial embolization, the patient went on to complete occlusion without further hemorrhage. CONCLUSION This case illustrates the utility of a high-viscosity liquid embolic agent in providing immediate protection from rehemorrhage by occluding a large ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the proximal intracranial ICA, while sparing the parent artery.","Patel, Akshal S; Horton, Tristram G; Kalapos, Paul; Cockroft, Kevin M",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25682851/,496

69793,Cosmesis and body image after single-port laparoscopic or conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a multicenter double blinded randomised controlled trial (SPOCC-trial).,2011,"Because of the outbreak of COVID-19, most countries have implemented measures aimed at reducing the number of infected people. However, these measures only work if they are generally accepted by the public. We conducted a two-wave longitudinal survey in Switzerland (n = 1,223) to study the factors that would influence perceived risks and the acceptance of the measures. Our findings showed that people with individualistic worldviews, high general interpersonal trust, low social trust, a low level of perceived risks, and the conviction that risks other than health risks were neglected had less acceptance of the implemented measures compared with people who held the opposite views on the mentioned variables. The number of infected people declined between survey waves 1 and 2. This desired effect not only reduced people's perceived risks but also decreased their social trust and increased the conviction that other risks were neglected. Finally, the acceptance of the measures declined. Our data also support the idea that reduced risk perceptions and a decline in social trust are important drivers for the reduction in the acceptance of the measures in survey wave 2. Our results suggest that as soon as the measures attain success or the public is tired of the implemented restrictions, public acceptance declines, and it seems difficult to prolong the measures as may be desirable from an epidemiological standpoint. The importance of worldviews and trust for public acceptance of the measures further suggests the necessity of a political discussion about the implemented measures.","Siegrist, Michael; Bearth, Angela",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100411118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045360/,496
69852,Factors affecting renal function preservation among patients not achieving trifecta after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for clinical T1a renal masses.,2019-12-09,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a relatively high mortality rate of approximately 40%. MERS is caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, and no specific drugs or vaccines are currently available to prevent MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV is an enveloped virus, and its envelope protein (S protein) mediates membrane fusion at the plasma membrane or endosomal membrane. Multiple proteolysis by host proteases, such as furin, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and cathepsins, causes the S protein to become fusion competent. TMPRSS2, which is localized to the plasma membrane, is a serine protease responsible for the proteolysis of S in the post-receptor-binding stage. Here, we developed a cell-based fusion assay for S in a TMPRSS2-dependent manner using cell lines expressing Renilla luciferase (RL)-based split reporter proteins. S was stably expressed in the effector cells, and the corresponding receptor for S, CD26, was stably coexpressed with TMPRSS2 in the target cells. Membrane fusion between these effector and target cells was quantitatively measured by determining the RL activity. The assay was optimized for a 384-well format, and nafamostat, a serine protease inhibitor, was identified as a potent inhibitor of S-mediated membrane fusion in a screening of about 1,000 drugs approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nafamostat also blocked MERS-CoV infection in vitro Our assay has the potential to facilitate the discovery of new inhibitors of membrane fusion of MERS-CoV as well as other viruses that rely on the activity of TMPRSS2.","Yamamoto, Mizuki; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Li, Xiao; Takeda, Makoto; Kawaguchi, Yasushi; Inoue, Jun-Ichiro; Matsuda, Zene",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01043-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27550352/,496

The debate is an old one and the lesson we have yet to learn was tragically apparent a century ago during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic. Any history of structural racism in America must begin with the chronicles of African Americans, Native Alaskans, and Indigenous North Americans as they were the originally enslaved and displaced people, subjected to overt and covert policies of oppression ever since. The experiences of Native Alaskans of Bristol Bay Alaska in 1918-1919 present a parallel, illuminating a wrenching example of structural racism that cost lives and impoverished society, then as now. Proven policy solutions exist to remove the structures that produce inequitable health outcomes, but implementing them will require public health officials and policymakers to take multidisciplinary policy actions, to find policy opportunities for change to be made, and, likely, a change in the political environment. The first exists now, the second is afforded because of the current pandemic and the urgent need for policy solutions, and the third is likely coming soon.","de Valpine, Maria Gilson; Lewis, Erica J",Public health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.12872; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538353/,496

These experiences demonstrate not only telehealth's utility during a viral pandemic, but also its potential as a powerful tool for expanding access to care and promoting health equity over the coming years. With this said, telehealth is not without limitations. Patients and clinicians alike have expressed concerns regarding the challenge of performing a physical exam and maintaining emotional connection across physical distance.

A study of greenhouse tomato plants in Israel revealed severe new viral disease symptoms including open unripe fruits and yellow patched leaves. PepMV was only detected in mixed infections with ToBRFV in all 104 tested sites, using serological and molecular analyses. Six PepMV isolates were identified, all had predicted amino acids characteristic of CH2 mild strains excluding an isoleucine at amino acid position 995 of the replicase. High-throughput sequencing of viral RNA extracted from four selected symptomatic plants showed solely the ToBRFV and PepMV, with total aligned read ratios of 40.61% and 11.73%, respectively, indicating prevalence of the viruses. Analyses of interactions between the co-infecting viruses by sequential and mixed viral inoculations of tomato plants, at various temperatures, showed a prominent increase in PepMV titers in ToBRFV pre-inoculated plants and in mixed-infected plants at 18-25 °C, compared to PepMV-single inoculations, as analyzed by Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR tests. These results suggest that Israeli mild PepMV isolate infections, preceded by ToBRFV, could induce symptoms characteristic of PepMV aggressive strains.","Klap, Chen; Luria, Neta; Smith, Elisheva; Hadad, Lior; Bakelman, Elena; Sela, Noa; Belausov, Eduard; Lachman, Oded; Leibman, Diana; Dombrovsky, Aviv",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12080879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796777/,496

Clinical cases with work stress-induced burnout (n = 65), and demographically matched, healthy reference subjects (n = 65), were given six neuropsychological tests and a self-rating scale for cognitive problems. Diurnal salivary cortisol was measured among burnout cases and an external reference group (n = 174), including a dexamethasone suppression test (DST) among burnout cases. Compared with referents, the burnout group under-performed in a cognitive speed test (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol), but not in any other test of sustained attention, episodic memory, or vocabulary. Burnout cases had considerably more subjective cognitive problems, but ratings were unrelated to test performance. Compared with referents, burnout cases had similar morning salivary cortisol levels and similar awakening response, but lower evening cortisol. Among burnout cases, lower diurnal cortisol variability was related to slower performance in several tests. The DST response showed no consistent relationship with any cognitive parameter. Hence, despite considerable subjective cognitive problems, the burnout group showed only a partial, mild deviation in cognitive performance. A flatter diurnal cortisol profile was related to lower cognitive processing speed, but diurnal cortisol pattern and DST response were normal, suggesting a maintained HPA axis flexibility.","Osterberg, K; Karlson, B; Hansen, A M",Stress,https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890802049699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18951245/,496

Methods: Using insurance claims data, we identified 48,657 adults who underwent ACL reconstruction from 2010-2015, had prescription drug insurance and had ≥1 year of continuous insurance enrollment postoperatively. Chronic opioid use was defined as filling ≥120 days' supply from 3-12 months postoperatively. Logistic and linear regression, controlled for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index value, were used to determine associations of preoperative depression with binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. Results: Preoperatively, 2,237 patients (4.6%) had depression and 2,387 (4.9%) were taking opioids; patients with depression had 6.5 times the odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.8, 7.3) of taking opioids than patients without depression. Postoperatively, 25% of patients filled ≥1 opioid prescription; mean duration of use was 13 ± 11 days, and 362 patients (0.7%) had chronic use. Patients with preoperative depression were less likely than patients without depression to fill an opioid prescription postoperatively (OR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.2). Of patients who filled opioid prescriptions postoperatively, those with preoperative depression were more likely to refill that prescription at least once (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.9, 2.2) but did not have greater odds of chronic use (OR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.5). Preoperative depression was not associated with greater cumulative opioid consumption from 3-12 months postoperatively (β = -40, 95% CI: -226, 146). Conclusion: Although patients with preoperative depression were more likely to take opioids preoperatively and to obtain ≥1 opioid refill postoperatively, they did not have greater odds of chronic postoperative opioid use or greater cumulative opioid consumption after ACL reconstruction.","Best, Matthew J; Harris, Andrew B; Mohler, Jessica M; Wilckens, John H",The Physician and sportsmedicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/00913847.2020.1851158; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197357/,496

RESULTS There were found 10 articles with a total of 15 newborn infected with SARS-CoV-2 according to positive PCR at birth or in the first days of birth. Eleven newborn birth by cesarean section and 4 vaginally. Of the 11 cases with cesarean section, two presented premature rupture of the membranes. Seven newborns developed pneumonia, of which two had ruptured membranes and one was born by vaginal delivery. CONCLUSION This review shows that there is perinatal or neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2 by finding a positive PCR in the first days of birth. In addition, that there is more possibility of neonatal infection if the birth is vaginal or if there is premature rupture of the membranes before cesarean section.

Moreover, it is one of the most destructive infections of small fruit crops such as pepper (Capsicum annnum L.). C. sativum is a species belonging to the Solanaceae family and Turkey is one of the main producers in the World. In the present work, aiming to obtain information useful for pest management, fifty B. cinerea isolates collected from Turkey and a reference isolate (B05.10) were characterized using molecular markers and fungicide resistance genes. Morphological and molecular (ITS1-ITS4) identification of B. cinerea isolates, the degree of virulence and mating types were determined. Since one or several allelic mutations in the histidine kinase (Bos1) and β-tubulin genes generally confer the resistance to fungicides, the sequences of these target genes were investigated in the selected isolates, which allowed the identification of two different haplotypes. Mating types were also determined by PCR assays using primer specific for MAT1-1 alpha gene (MAT1-1-1) and MAT1-2 HMG (MAT1-2-1) of B. cinerea. Twenty-two out of 50 isolates (44%) were MAT1-2, while 38% were MAT1-1. Interestingly, out of whole studied samples, 9 isolates (18%) were heterokaryotic or mixed colonies. In addition, cluster and population structure analyses identified five main groups and two genetic pools, respectively, underlining a good level of variability in the analysed panel. The results highlighted the presence of remarkable genetic diversity in B. cinerea isolates collected in a crucial economical area for pepper cultivation in Turkey and the data will be beneficial in view of future gray mold disease management.","Polat, İlknur; Baysal, Ömür; Mercati, Francesco; Gümrükcü, Emine; Sülü, Görkem; Kitapcı, Aytül; Araniti, Fabrizio; Carimi, Francesco","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.02.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29505818/,496

Abstracts were screened for articles in English and articles on human subjects yielding 130. Further searches revealed 121 titles to be unrelated to gastric plication. The remaining nine abstracts were analyzed for their full texts. Two articles were excluded because, one was a commentary on another article, and the other was a released ASMBS policy on gastric plication. In the end, there were seven articles published on gastric plication. RESULTS A total of 307 patients had undergone gastric plication. The mean operative time range was 40 to 150 min.

In ten experiments (N = 399) we find that an individual's non-conscious visual prioritization speed (NVPS) is ubiquitous across a wide variety of stimuli, and generalizes across visual masks, suppression tasks, and time. We also find that variation in NVPS is unique, in that it cannot be explained by variation in general speed, perceptual decision thresholds, short-term visual memory, or three networks of attention (alerting, orienting and executive). Finally, we find that NVPS is correlated with subjective measures of sensitivity, as they are measured by the Highly Sensitive Person scale.

However, why electric eels evolved three electric organs to generate two forms of EOD and how these three organs work together to generate these two forms of EOD have not been clear until now. Here, we present the third form of independent EOD of electric eels: middle-voltage EOD. We suggest that every form of EOD is generated by one electric organ independently and reveal the typical discharge order of the three electric organs. We also discuss hybrid EODs, which are combinations of these three independent EODs.

The specific aim was to evaluate the scientific support for laboratory diagnosis of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, rickettsiosis, neoehrlichiosis, babesiosis, hard tick relapsing fever, tularemia and bartonellosis, as well as tick-borne co-infections and persistent LB in spite of recommended standard antibiotic treatment. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in 11 databases for research published from 2007 through 2017, and categorized potentially relevant references according to the predefined infections and study design. An expert group assessed the relevance and eligibility and reviewed the articles according to the QUADAS (diagnostic studies) or AMSTAR (systematic reviews) protocols, respectively. Clinical evaluations of one or several diagnostic tests and systematic reviews were included. Case reports, non-human studies and articles published in other languages than English were excluded. Results: A total of 48 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria for evaluation. The majority of these studies were based on small sample sizes. There were no eligible studies for evaluation of tick-borne co-infections or for persistent LB after antibiotic treatment. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for larger evaluations of laboratory tests using clinical samples from well-defined cases taken at different time-points during the course of the diseases. Since the diseases occur at a relatively low frequency, single-center cross-sectional studies are practically not feasible, but multi-center case control studies could be a way forward.","Henningsson, Anna J; Aase, Audun; Bavelaar, Herjan; Flottorp, Signe; Forsberg, Pia; Kirkehei, Ingvild; Lövmar, Matilda; Nilsson, Kenneth; Nyman, Dag; Ornstein, Katharina; Sjöwall, Johanna; Skogman, Barbro H; Tjernberg, Ivar; Aaberge, Ingeborg",Frontiers in public health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.580102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616701/,496

METHODS Fity-five COVID-19 patients were admitted to the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi from January 23rd to March 31st, 2020 as the research object. The demographic characteristics of the cases and the methods of immunotherapy were analyzed, focusing on the immunized indicators, positivity of pathogens and clinical indicators of critically ill COVID-19 patient, and the effects of immunotherapy and stem cell transplantation were evaluated. RESULTS Aged, male and people with comorbidities were the main risk factors in the development of severe and critical COVID-19. All of confirmed COVID-19 cases (n = 55) had been treated with interferon-α (IFN-α), of which 81.8% (n = 45, mild and ordinary) of the patients were recovered, 14.6% (n = 8) of the patients were converted to severe, 3.6% (n = 2) of the patients were converted to critical, and some severe patients were treated with gamma globulin and albumin as adjuvant treatment. Critically ill patients were not only treated with IFN-α, gamma globulin and albumin, but also treated with convalescent plasma and MSC transplantation. Due to pulmonary hemorrhage and persistently low blood oxygen saturation, terminal lung transplantation therapy was implemented. The total number of lymphocytes, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and B cells in peripheral blood of the two critical COVID-19 patients were significantly reduced, and the functions of lung, liver, and kidney were severely damaged on admission, manifested as significant increase of the levels of blood C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), etc. and decrease of blood oxygen saturation, and type I respiratory failure, and the noninvasive assisted ventilation was needed to improve. After adjuvant immunotherapy such as gamma globulin, the nucleic acid of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) turned into negative. The CRP of one critically ill patient was significantly lower than the value at admission (minimum of 21 mg/L). But the lung inflammation progressed rapidly, and the pathological results of the lung tissue from the lung transplantation showed hemorrhage and irreversible fibrosis. The ability to secrete immunoglobulin A (IgA) was significantly reduced. Liver function had been significantly improved and stabilized after treatment with convalescent plasma during the recovery period. MSC transplantation treatment reduced the BUN level by > 50% compared with the previous period, and the total number of lymphocytes in the patient increased by more than 2 times (rose from 0.23×109/L to 0.57×109/L), but the total amount of lymphocytes was still lower than the normal reference value (< 1.1×109/L). The lung inflammation lesions were obviously absorbed, and the vital signs were stable. CONCLUSIONS In addition to IFN, gamma globulin, antiserum and MSC transplantation therapy can help clear the virus and reduce inflammation. Although MSC transplantation fail to completely change the immunecompromised state of critically ill patients, it controlled the progression of inflammation in the liver and kidneys.","Yan, Yan; Jiang, Xiufeng; Ding, Difei; Huang, Jiehui",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20201113-00714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729129/,496
72549,One hundred and fifty-six cases of anatomical pulmonary segmentectomy by uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery: a 2-year learning experience.,2018,"Robotic level III inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombectomy was described recently. We present ongoing robotic advances in this arena in a case series of six patients with Mayo level II-III thrombi who underwent robotic caval thrombectomy, radical nephrectomy, and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. In four patients, proximal intra- or retrohepatic IVC control was obtained solely with an intracaval Fogarty balloon catheter; in one patient, robot-guided flexible cystoscopy of the IVC lumen was performed to rule out any residual or secondary skip thrombi. In one patient, the caval wall defect after thrombus excision was reconstructed robotically using a bovine pericardial patch. Finally, a patient with concomitant renal and adrenal tumors had two distinct thrombi of levels I and III; a robotic double thrombectomy was performed. Mean renal tumor size was 8.4cm (±1.6). Four thrombi (66%) were level III. Mean operative time was 6.4h (±1.7); IVC clamp time, 53.5min (±29.8); blood loss, 668ml (±692); and hospital stay, 5.5 d (±3.8). Two patients required blood transfusions. Complications included Clavien grade 1 (n=2), grade 3a (n=1), and grade 5 (n=1). Mean follow-up was 5.8 mo (±4.3). Robotic IVC thrombectomy is a viable alternative to open surgery for appropriately selected cases by experienced teams.

72685,Retained Needle in the AirSeal Trocar During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: Lessons Learned.,2018,"A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of plant stress resistance in the face of ever-changing environmental stimuli will be helpful for promoting the growth and production of crop and forage plants. Investigations of plant responses to various single abiotic or biotic factors, or combined stresses, have been extensively reported. However, the molecular mechanisms of plants in responses to environmental stresses under natural conditions are not clearly understood. In this study, we carried out a transcriptome analysis using RNA-sequencing to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms of Onobrychis viciifolia responding and adapting to the extreme natural environment in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The transcriptome data of plant samples collected from two different altitudes revealed a total of 8212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 5387 up-regulated and 2825 down-regulated genes. Detailed analysis of the identified DEGs uncovered that up-regulation of genes potentially leading to changes in hormone homeostasis and signaling, particularly abscisic acid-related ones, and enhanced biosynthesis of polyphenols play vital roles in the adaptive processes of O. viciifolia. Interestingly, several DEGs encoding uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases, which putatively regulate phytohormone homeostasis to resist environmental stresses, were also discovered. Furthermore, numerous DEGs encoding transcriptional factors, such as members of the myeloblastosis (MYB), homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP), WRKY, and nam-ataf1,2-cuc2 (NAC) families, might be involved in the adaptive responses of O. viciifolia to the extreme natural environmental conditions. The DEGs identified in this study represent candidate targets for improving environmental stress resistance of O. viciifolia grown in higher altitudes of the QTP, and can provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of this plant species to the extreme natural environmental conditions of the QTP.","Yin, Hengxia; Zhou, Huakun; Wang, Wenying; Tran, Lam-Son Phan; Zhang, Benyin",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10060967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604957/,496

Platelets and the lungs have interrelated activities. Previous studies provide evidence that platelets contribute to pulmonary vascular barrier function and are required for defense against pulmonary hemorrhage, and that the lungs can influence platelet number and distribution. There is also evidence that platelets contribute to pathologic syndromes of pulmonary inflammation and thrombosis. Thus, platelets have an ""amicus or adversary"" relationship with the lung. Recent observations and discoveries have established new paradigms relevant to influences of platelets on lung cell and molecular biology. These new findings are in a variety of areas including thrombopoieis, nontraditional activities of platelets, new synthetic capabilities and mechanisms of post-translational gene expression, interactions of platelets with endothelial cells and contributions to alveolar capillary barrier permeability, interactions of platelets with myeloid leukocytes, and platelet involvement in stem cell signaling and vascular repair.

73082,The protocol of low-impact laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the combination of mini-laparoscopy and low-pressure pneumoperitoneum.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Temperature changes are common in patients in a neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU): fever is frequent among severe cases and hypothermia is used after cardiac arrest and is currently being tested in clinical trials to lower intracranial pressure (ICP). This study investigated cerebral hemodynamics when body temperature varies in acute brain injured patients. METHODS We enrolled 26 patients, 14 with acute brain injury who developed fever and were given antipyretic therapy (defervescence group) and 12 who underwent an intracranial neurosurgical procedure and developed hypothermia in the operating room; once admitted to the NICU, still under anesthesia, they were re-warmed before waking (re-warming group). We measured cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF-V) and pulsatility index (PI) at the middle cerebral artery using transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCDS). RESULTS In the defervescence group mean CBF-V decreased from 75 ± 26 (95% CI 65 to 85) to 70 ± 22 cm/s (95% CI 61 to 79) (P = 0.04); the PI also fell, from 1.36 ± 0.33 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.50) to 1.16 ± 0.26 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.26) (P = 0.0005). In the subset of patients with ICP monitoring, ICP dropped from 16 ± 8 to 12 ± 6 mmHg (P = 0.003). In the re-warming group mean CBF-V increased from 36 ± 10 (95% CI 31 to 41) to 39 ± 13 (95% CI 33 to 45) cm/s (P = 0.04); the PI rose from 0.98 ± 0.14 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.04) to 1.09 ± 0.22 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.19) (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Body temperature affects cerebral hemodynamics as evaluated by TCCDS; when temperature rises, CBF-V increases in parallel, and viceversa when temperature decreases. When cerebral compliance is reduced and compensation mechanisms are exhausted, even modest temperature changes can greatly affect ICP.","Stretti, Federica; Gotti, Miriam; Pifferi, Silvia; Brandi, Giovanna; Annoni, Federico; Stocchetti, Nino",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-014-0552-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25311035/,496

73222,Validation of a pediatric single-port laparoscopic surgery simulator.,2015,"National efforts to address the diversity dilemma in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) often emphasize increasing numbers of historically underrepresented (HU) students and faculty, but fall short in instituting concrete changes for inclusion and belonging. Therefore, increasing the pool of senior faculty who wish to become guides and advocates for emerging scientists from HU populations is an essential step toward creating new pathways for their career advancement. As a step toward achieving this goal, we created a novel eight-hour intervention on Culturally Aware Mentoring (CAM), a program of the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) targeted to faculty and administrators. A previous report of surveys at the end of the CAM sessions revealed substantial awareness and knowledge gains, with participants expressing intentions to use and implement new skills they had learned. In this paper, we provide the results of our thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with academic administrators and faculty, 18-24 months after participation in CAM. Interviews were designed to determine: 1) What changes in self-perceptions and interactions occurred as a result of participation in CAM? 2) What specific components of CAM are associated with changes in individual beliefs and practices? 3) How did participants actively make changes after the CAM workshop? 4) What barriers or challenges do participants encounter after the CAM intervention? The results demonstrate the lasting influences of CAM on participants' awareness of cultural differences, their assumptions about and approaches toward interactions with colleagues and students, and their efforts to change their behaviors to promote inclusive practices in their mentoring and teaching of HU students in STEM. Our findings provide evidence that CAM can be incorporated into existing mentor training programs designed to improve the confidence and capacity of senior research faculty mentors to make culturally-informed, scholar-centered decisions to more deliberately recognize and respond to cultural differences within their mentoring and collegial relationships.","Womack, Veronica Y; Wood, Christine V; House, Stephanie C; Quinn, Sandra C; Thomas, Stephen B; McGee, Richard; Byars-Winston, Angela",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764768/,496

This study illustrates strategies used when the ophthalmic artery is difficult to catheterize or not visible, and it ascertains the effectiveness and safety of these strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was performed on a series of 108 eyes affected by intraocular retinoblastoma and selected for intra-arterial chemotherapy (follow-up range, 6-82 months). We recognized 3 different patterns of drug delivery: a fixed pattern through the ophthalmic artery, a fixed pattern through branches of the external carotid artery, and a variable pattern through either the ophthalmic or the external carotid artery. RESULTS We performed 448 sessions of intra-arterial chemotherapy, 83.70% of them through the ophthalmic artery and 16.29% via the external carotid artery. In 24.52% of eyes, the procedure was performed at least once through branches of the external carotid artery. In 73 eyes, the pattern of drug delivery was fixed through the ophthalmic artery; for 9 eyes, it was fixed through branches of the external carotid artery; and for 17 eyes, the pattern was variable. Statistical analysis did not show any significant difference in the clinical outcome of the eyes (remission versus enucleation) treated with different patterns of drug delivery. Adverse events could not be correlated with any particular pattern. CONCLUSIONS Alternative routes of intra-arterial chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma appear in the short term as effective and safe as the traditional drug infusion through the ophthalmic artery.","Bertelli, E; Leonini, S; Galimberti, D; Moretti, S; Tinturini, R; Hadjistilianou, T; De Francesco, S; Romano, D G; Vallone, I M; Cioni, S; Gennari, P; Galluzzi, P; Grazzini, I; Rossi, S; Bracco, S",AJNR.

73858,Feasibility of total laparoscopic living donor right hepatectomy compared with open surgery: comprehensive review of 100 cases of the initial stage.,2019,"BACKGROUND From November 2018 through February 2019, person-to-person transmission of Andes virus (ANDV) hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurred in Chubut Province, Argentina, and resulted in 34 confirmed infections and 11 deaths. Understanding the genomic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of person-to-person transmission of ANDV is crucial to designing effective interventions. METHODS Clinical and epidemiologic information was obtained by means of patient report and from public health centers. Serologic testing, contact-tracing, and next-generation sequencing were used to identify ANDV infection as the cause of this outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and to reconstruct person-to-person transmission events. RESULTS After a single introduction of ANDV from a rodent reservoir into the human population, transmission was driven by 3 symptomatic persons who attended crowded social events. After 18 cases were confirmed, public health officials enforced isolation of persons with confirmed cases and self-quarantine of possible contacts; these measures most likely curtailed further spread. The median reproductive number (the number of secondary cases caused by an infected person during the infectious period) was 2.12 before the control measures were enforced and decreased to 0.96 after the measures were implemented. Full genome sequencing of the ANDV strain involved in this outbreak was performed with specimens from 27 patients and showed that the strain that was present (Epuyén/18-19) was similar to the causative strain (Epilink/96) in the first known person-to-person transmission of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by ANDV, which occurred in El Bolsón, Argentina, in 1996. Clinical investigations involving patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this outbreak revealed that patients with a high viral load and liver injury were more likely than other patients to spread infection. Disease severity, genomic diversity, age, and time spent in the hospital had no clear association with secondary transmission. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, high viral titers in combination with attendance at massive social gatherings or extensive contact among persons were associated with a higher likelihood of transmission.

All trees >1.0 cm DBH (diameter at breast height, 1.37 m in height) on each plot were visually inspected from the ground 4 m from the tree with binoculars. Egg masses found on trees were separated into six within-tree positions (lower trunk, middle trunk, upper trunk, first branch, second branch, above second branch) and recorded by cardinal directions, whereas those laid on shrubs/vines and stones were recorded without such separation. In total, 146 trees were inventoried at 28 plots over seven study sites (four plots per site). Egg masses were found on 19 tree species plus summer grape (Vitis aestivalis) and stone. Of the 421 total egg masses recorded, 31.1% were on Norway maple (Acer platanoides), followed by tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima; 14.7%), black birch (Betula lenta; 12.6%), tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera; 11.9%), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia; 10.2%). Egg mass density per tree was positively correlated with tree diameter, and egg mass density per plot was positively correlated with plot basal area. Egg mass density after conversion ranged from 600 to 3,930 eggs masses/ha with no significant difference among study sites. Cardinal direction had no effect; however, significantly more egg masses were found on the first branches and upper trunks than other within-tree positions. Overall, branches were better than trunks in predicting egg mass number for the tree.

It may resolve spontaneously; however, it may be a potential life-threatening condition. Hypertension may be considered the most important finding in combination with hypokalemic paralysis for raising the suspicion of primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA). A 55-year-old hypertensive Mexican woman was admitted to the Emergency Unit with a sudden onset of generalized paralysis. An endocrinological workup and an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed PHA with a 1.5 cm left adrenal tumor. After preoperative medication, left adrenalectomy was performed with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). The duration of the surgery was 45 min, and no postoperative complication was encountered. The patient was discharged after 24 h. Hypokalemic paralysis may be due to different conditions, but it may raise the suspicion of PHA in combination with a history of generally mild hypertension. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the preferred operation for unilateral adrenal adenomas that cause PHA. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a step-forward technique that improves the cosmesis, decreases access-related morbidity, and increases the postoperative recovery.

The purpose of our study is to assess the feasibility and safety of concurrent Micra leadless transcatheter pacemaker implantation and AVJ ablation. METHODS We retrospectively assessed patients who underwent Micra implantation and concurrent AVJ ablation at three institutions between August 2014 and March 2016. All patients and devices were followed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postimplantion. RESULTS Twenty-one patients with permanent AF (median age 77 [range: 62-88], female 15 [71.4%]) underwent successful Micra implantation followed by concurrent AVJ ablation. There was no device dislodgement or malfunction during the 12-month follow-up. Complete 12-month electrical performance data were available in 14 patients (67%). Among patients with the complete data set, median pacing thresholds at implant and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months were 0.5 V (range: 0.25-0.88), 0.44 V (range: 0.25-2.0), 0.5 V (range: 0.25-1.63), 0.5 V (range: 0.25-1.13), and 0.5 V (range: 0.25-1.13) at a pulse width of 0.24 msec, respectively. Two patients died due to noncardiac causes during follow-up. There were no patients with major device-related complications. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent Micra implantation and AVJ ablation is feasible and appears safe. There was no device dislodgement, malfunction, or significant pacing threshold rise requiring device reimplantation during the 12-month follow-up. This combined approach can be considered for patients with AF with suboptimal rate control who have failed AF catheter ablation and/or pharmacotherapy.","Okabe, Toshimasa; El-Chami, Mikhael F; Lloyd, Michael S; Buck, Benjamin; Gornick, Charles C; Moore, JoEllyn C; Augostini, Ralph S; Hummel, John D",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,https://doi.org/10.1111/pace.13312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29476660/,496
77280,Unaided Stapling Technique for Pure Single-Incision Distal Gastrectomy in Early Gastric Cancer: Unaided Delta-Shaped Anastomosis and Uncut Roux-en-Y Anastomosis.,2015,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Molecular epidemiology is a powerful tool to decipher the dynamics of viral transmission, quasispecies temporal evolution and origins. Little is known about the pH1N1 molecular dynamics in general population. A prospective study (CoPanFlu-RUN) was carried out in Reunion Island to characterize pH1N1 genetic variability and molecular evolution occurring in population during the pH1N1 Influenza pandemic in 2009. METHODOLOGY We directly amplified pH1N1 genomes from 28 different nasal swabs (26 individuals from 21 households). Fifteen strains were fully sequenced and 13 partially. This includes pairs of sequences from different members of 5 separate households; and two pairs from individuals, collected at different times. We assessed the molecular evolution of pH1N1 by genetic variability and phylogenetic analyses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We found that i) Reunion pH1N1 sequences stemmed from global ""clade 7"" but shaped two phylogenetic sub-clades; ii) D239E mutation was identified in the hemagglutinin protein of all Reunion sequences, a mutation which has been associated elsewhere with mild-, upper-respiratory tract pH1N1 infecting strains; iii) Date estimates from molecular phylogenies predicted clade emergence some time before the first detection of pH1N1 by the epidemiological surveillance system; iv) Phylogenetic relatedness was observed between Reunion pH1N1 viruses and those from other countries in South-western Indian Ocean area; v) Quasispecies populations were observed within households and individuals of the cohort-study. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance and/or prevention systems presently based on Influenza virus sequence variation should take into account that the majority of studies of pH1N1 Influenza generate genetic data for the HA/NA viral segments obtained from hospitalized-patients, which is potentially non-representative of the overall viral diversity within whole populations. Our observations highlight the importance of collecting unbiased data at the community level and conducting whole genome analysis to accurately understand viral dynamics.","Pascalis, Hervé; Temmam, Sarah; Wilkinson, David A; Dsouli, Najla; Turpin, Magali; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Dellagi, Koussay",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0043742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22952752/,496
77284,Visualization versus neuromonitoring of recurrent laryngeal nerves during thyroidectomy: what about the costs?,2012,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the differences in arterial flow after flow diverter placement using quantitative flow measurements based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHODS Between November 2013 and November 2015, all patients who had flow diverters placed for distal internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysms were reviewed. Patients in whom the stent was placed across the ostia of the ophthalmic artery (OphA) and anterior choroidal artery (AChA) were enrolled. Five regions of interest were selected: the proximal ICA (as a reference), terminal ICA, middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), OphA, and AChA. The values of the peak, time-to-peak (TTP), and area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed using a quantitative DSA technique. RESULTS The study enrolled 13 patients. The quantitative flow analysis showed improved flow in the terminal ICA (peak and AUC, p=0.036 and p=0.04, respectively), MCA (AUC, p=0.023), and ACA (AUC, p=0.006), and decreased flow in the OphA (peak and AUC, p=0.013 and p=0.005, respectively) and AChA (peak and subtracted TTP, p=0.023 and p=0.050, respectively) after flow diverter placement. Larger aneurysm volume was significantly correlated with decreased OphA flow after the procedure (peak and AUC, p=0.049 and p=0.037, respectively). Larger aneurysm volume also had a marginal correlation with increased distal ICA flow after the procedure, but this did not reach significance (peak and AUC, p=0.195 and p=0.060, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Without using extra contrast medium or radiation dosages, color-coded DSA enables quantitative monitoring of the cerebral circulation after flow-diverting treatment.","Chen, Chien-Wei; Wong, Ho-Fai; Ye, Yu-Ling; Chen, Yao-Liang; Chen, Wei-Liang; Ou, Chang-Hsien; Tsai, Yuan-Hsiung",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27932668/,496

We sought to determine the effect of prone positioning on mortality among patients with ARDS receiving protective lung ventilation. METHODS We searched electronic databases and conference proceedings to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through August 2013. We included RCTs that compared prone and supine positioning during mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS. We assessed risk of bias and obtained data on all-cause mortality (determined at hospital discharge or, if unavailable, after longest follow-up period). We used random-effects models for the pooled analyses. RESULTS We identified 11 RCTs (n=2341) that met our inclusion criteria. In the 6 trials (n=1016) that used a protective ventilation strategy with reduced tidal volumes, prone positioning significantly reduced mortality (risk ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.95; I2=29%) compared with supine positioning. The mortality benefit remained in several sensitivity analyses. The overall quality of evidence was high. The risk of bias was low in all of the trials except one, which was small. Statistical heterogeneity was low (I2<50%) for most of the clinical and physiologic outcomes. INTERPRETATION Our analysis of high-quality evidence showed that use of the prone position during mechanical ventilation improved survival among patients with ARDS who received protective lung ventilation.","Sud, Sachin; Friedrich, Jan O; Adhikari, Neill K J; Taccone, Paolo; Mancebo, Jordi; Polli, Federico; Latini, Roberto; Pesenti, Antonio; Curley, Martha A Q; Fernandez, Rafael; Chan, Ming-Cheng; Beuret, Pascal; Voggenreiter, Gregor; Sud, Maneesh; Tognoni, Gianni; Gattinoni, Luciano; Guérin, Claude",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.140081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863923/,496

77629,Laparoscopic surgery for obese patients with colon cancer: a case-matched control study.,2013,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) induces numerous changes to the host metabolic network that are critical for high-titer viral replication. We find that HCMV infection substantially induces de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic flux. This activation is important for HCMV replication because inhibition of pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes substantially decreases the production of infectious virus, which can be rescued through medium supplementation with pyrimidine biosynthetic intermediates. Metabolomic analysis revealed that pyrimidine biosynthetic inhibition considerably reduces the levels of various UDP-sugar metabolites in HCMV-infected, but not mock-infected, cells. Further, UDP-sugar biosynthesis, which provides the sugar substrates required for glycosylation reactions, was found to be induced during HCMV infection. Pyrimidine biosynthetic inhibition also attenuated the glycosylation of the envelope glycoprotein B (gB). Both glycosylation of gB and viral growth were restored by medium supplementation with either UDP-sugar metabolites or pyrimidine precursors. These results indicate that HCMV drives de novo-synthesized pyrimidines to UDP-sugar biosynthesis to support virion protein glycosylation. The importance of this link between pyrimidine biosynthesis and UDP-sugars appears to be partially shared among diverse virus families, because UDP-sugar metabolites rescued the growth attenuation associated with pyrimidine biosynthetic inhibition during influenza A and vesicular stomatitis virus infection, but not murine hepatitis virus infection. In total, our results indicate that viruses can specifically modulate pyrimidine metabolic flux to provide the glycosyl subunits required for protein glycosylation and production of high titers of infectious progeny.","DeVito, Stefanie Renee; Ortiz-Riaño, Emilio; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; Munger, Joshua",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1415864111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25472841/,496

A 60-year-old man with multiple small hemorrhagic foci and mild IVH in the occipital horn. A 63-year-old woman with large left parietooccipital intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and IVH. A 56-year-old man with left hemispheric and midbrain ICH, lateral ventricular IVH, and hydrocephalus. A 85-year-old woman with right parietal hemorrhagic infarct. The coagulation profile was normal in all of them. The chest CT scan showed the typical ground-glass appearance of COVID-19.

Methods The pupil size (miosis, intermediary or mydriasis) and bilateral pupillary light reactivity (present or absent) were monitored in sedated and paralysed patients treated by eCPR. Mortality was assessed on Day 28. Results A total of 46 consecutive patients with ROHCA were included in the study. Thirty (65%) patients died on Day 28. Twenty-seven (90%) patients had pupils non-reactive to light, and 18 (60%) had mydriasis at the ICU admission. Using logistic regression, including age, gender, no flow, low-flow, size and pupil reactivity to light, only the pupillary reactivity to light remained associated with death on Day 28 (Odds ratio=0.12, 95%CI=[0.01-0.96]). Conclusion Pupils not reacting to light at the ICU admission were associated with mortality on Day 28 in patients with ROHCA. Pupillary light reactivity is a simple and easy tool that can be used to early detect a poor outcome in patients with ROHCA treated by eCPR.","Jouffroy, Romain; Saade, Anastasia; Philippe, Pascal; Guyard, Alexandra; Carli, Pierre; Vivien, Benoit",Turkish journal of anaesthesiology and reanimation,https://doi.org/10.5152/tjar.2019.75418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864644/,496

In this approach, an accurate basis set is used to compute the vibrational spectra at the harmonic level. The results are used to scale the potential surface from a more modest but much more efficient basis set. The scaling is such that at the harmonic level the new, scaled potential agrees with the one of the accurate basis set. The approach is tested in application of the micro-solvated, protected amino acid Ac-Phe-OMe , by using the scaled anharmonic hybrid potential in the VSCF and VSCF-PT2 algorithms. The hybrid potential method yields results in good accord with experiment, and very close to these obtained in calculations with the high level, very costly potential from the large basis set. At the same time, the hybrid potential calculations are much less expensive. The results of the hybrid calculations are much more accurate than these computed from the potential surface corresponding to the modest basis set. The results are very encouraging for using the hybrid potential method for inexpensive yet sufficiently accurate anharmonic calculations for the spectra of large bio-molecules.","Roy, Tapta Kanchan; Gerber, R Benny",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991804/,496
78622,Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy: early unclamping technique.,2011,"The Covid-19 pandemic is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and case fatalities. Covid-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease. Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, abbreviated hereafter to ACE2, MERS-CoV utilises dipeptidyl peptidase 4, abbreviated hereafter to DPP4, and recent modelling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, immune and endocrine systems. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and non-enzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in Covid-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of Covid-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of Covid-19. Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilised to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we describe the first case of coil embolization using a simple, non-adjunctive technique for an aneurysm at this rare location. CASE DESCRIPTION A 74-year-old man with an asymptomatic, unruptured aneurysm of the right DACA was followed up annually for 3 years by medical checkup. Endovascular treatment was proposed because of a slight angiographic change in the shape of the aneurysm in the past year. The aneurysm at the non-branching site of the right calloso-marginal artery was 2 mm distal to the origin, and measured 3 mm in height and 3.3 mm in width, with a neck measuring 1.7 mm wide; the calloso-marginal artery diameter was 1.6 mm. The aneurysm was successfully embolized with a simple technique using a Pre-Shaped S Microcatheter and two coils. CONCLUSIONS The simple, non-adjunctive technique for coil embolization of saccular side-wall type aneurysm in the non-branching segment of the DACA could be performed using the appropriate catheter and a softer coil.","Maeda, Kazushi; Kawano, Yosuke; Maehara, Naoki; Michiwaki, Yuhei; Nagaoka, Shintaro; Uno, Junji; Gi, Hidefuku; Kanemoto, Yukihide",The neuroradiology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1971400920902537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32019400/,496

We assessed the prevalence and characteristics of RHs in children with increased ICP. METHODS We conducted a prospective, multicenter study of children <4 years old with newly diagnosed increased ICP as determined by using direct measurement and/or clinical criteria. Infants who were premature, neonates, and suspected survivors of abusive head trauma were excluded on the basis of nonocular findings. Fundus examinations were performed; extent, number, and type of RH in each of 4 distinct retinal zones were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-six children (27 boys) were studied (mean age 15.4 months; range 1-43 months). All of the children had elevated ICP that required intervention. One child had papilledema. No child (0%; 95% confidence interval: 0%-6.4%) or eye (0%; 95% confidence interval: 0%-3.3%) was found to have an RH. Causes of increased ICP included hydrocephalus, intraventricular hemorrhage, congenital malformations, malfunctioning shunts, and the presence of intracranial space-occupying lesions. CONCLUSIONS Although acute increased ICP can present in children with a pattern of peripapillary superficial RHs in the presence of papilledema, our study supports the conclusion that RHs rarely occur in the absence of optic disc swelling and do not present beyond the peripapillary area in the entities we have studied.","Shi, Angell; Kulkarni, Abhaya; Feldman, Kenneth W; Weiss, Avery; McCourt, Emily A; Schloff, Susan; Partington, Michael; Forbes, Brian; Geddie, Brooke E; Bierbrauer, Karin; Phillips, Paul H; Rogers, David L; Abed Alnabi, Waleed; Binenbaum, Gil; Levin, Alex V",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2018-1182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30630868/,496

All MCFA (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were guaranteed ≥ 98% purity, including hexanoic (C6:0), octanoic (C8:0), and decanoic (C10:0) acids. Treatment diets were formulated in two phases (7 to 11 and 11 to 23 kg BW) and formulated to meet or exceed NRC requirement estimates. Treatments (n = 8) were a dose response including 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% added MCFA blend (1:1:1 ratio C6:0, C8:0, and C10:0), as well as treatments with individual additions of 0.5% C6:0, C8:0, or C10:0. Fecal samples were collected from pigs fed control and 1.5% MCFA blend diets on d 0 and d 14 and analyzed using 16s rDNA sequencing. Following feed manufacture, feed was stored in bags at barn temperature and humidity for 40 d before laboratory inoculation with PEDV. Subsamples of retained feed were inoculated with PEDV to achieve a titer of 104 TCID50/g and separate sample bottles were analyzed on 0 and 3 days post-inoculation (dpi). Overall, average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were increased (linear, P ≤ 0.010) and feed efficiency (G:F) improved (linear, P = 0.004) with increasing MCFA blend. Pigs fed 0.5% C8:0 had greater (P = 0.038) ADG compared to pigs fed the control diet, and G:F was improved (P ≤ 0.024) when pigs were fed 0.5% C6:0, 0.5% C8:0, or 0.5% C10:0 compared to control. An inclusion level × day interaction was observed (quadratic, P = 0.023), where PEDV Ct values increased (quadratic, P = 0.001) on 0 dpi with increasing levels of MCFA blend inclusion and also increased on 3 dpi (linear, P < 0.001). Fecal microbial diversity and composition were similar between control and 1.5% MCFA blend. In summary, the use of MCFA in nursery pig diets improves growth performance, provides residual mitigation activity against PEDV, and does not significantly alter fecal microbial composition.","Gebhardt, Jordan T; Thomson, Katelyn A; Woodworth, Jason C; Dritz, Steve S; Tokach, Michael D; DeRouchey, Joel M; Goodband, Robert D; Jones, Cassandra K; Cochrane, Roger A; Niederwerder, Megan C; Fernando, Samodha; Abbas, Waseem; Burkey, Thomas E",Journal of animal science,https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skz358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31758795/,496

A matched case-control comparison.,2012,"Heparan sulfate (HS) is ubiquitously expressed on the surfaces and in the extracellular matrix of virtually all cell types, making it an ideal receptor for viral infection. Compared with wild-type viruses, cell culture-adapted laboratory strains exhibit more efficient binding to cellular HS receptors. HS-binding viruses are typically cleared faster from the circulation and cause lower viremia than their non-HS-binding counterparts, suggesting that the HS-binding phenotype is a tissue culture adaptation that lowers virus fitness in vivo. However, when inoculated intracranially, efficient cell attachment through HS binding can contribute to viral neurovirulence. The primary aim of this review is to discuss the roles of HS binding in viral pathogenicity, including peripheral virulence and neurovirulence. Understanding how heparan sulfate functions during virus infection in vivo may prove critical for elucidating the molecular mechanism of viral pathogenesis, and may contribute to the development of therapeutics targeting HS.","Zhu, Wuyang; Li, Jiangjiao; Liang, Guodong",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,https://doi.org/10.3967/0895-3988.2011.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21440844/,496

In the United States, changes in the dialysis reimbursement structure by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are expected to result in the increased use of PD, a less costly dialysis modality that offers patients the opportunity to receive dialysis in the home setting and to have more independence for travel and work schedules, and that preserves vascular access for future dialysis options. Placement of PD catheters by interventional radiologists might therefore be increasingly requested by nephrology practices, given that recent publications have demonstrated the favorable impact on PD practices of an interventional radiology PD placement capability. Earlier reports of interventional radiology PD catheter placement came from single-center practices with smaller reported experiences. The need for a larger consensus document that attempts to establish best demonstrated practices for radiologists is evident. The radiologists submitting this consensus document represent a combined experience of more than 1000 PD catheter placements. The authors submit these consensus-proposed best demonstrated practices for placement of PD catheters by interventional radiologists under ultrasonographic and fluoroscopic guidance. This technique might allow for expeditious placement of permanent PD catheters in late-referred patients with end-stage renal disease, thus facilitating urgent-start PD and avoiding the need for temporary vascular access catheters.","Abdel-Aal, Ahmed K; Dybbro, Paul; Hathaway, Peter; Guest, Steven; Neuwirth, Michael; Krishnamurthy, Venkat",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.3747/pdi.2013.00029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584622/,496

The aim of our study was to validate combined preoperative Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR)-Platelet-to-Lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in predicting overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) in patients who underwent curative resection for HCC. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of HCC patients underwent liver resection with curative intent from January 2010 to December 2013. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off values for NLR and PLR. Patients with both NLR and PLR elevated were allocated a score of 2; patients showing one or neither of these indices elevated were accorded a score of 1 or 0, respectively. Results 132 patients with a median age of 66 years (range 18-87) underwent curative resection for HCC. Overall morbidity was 30.3%, 30-day mortality was 2.3%, and 90-day mortality was 6.8%. At a median follow-up of 24 months (range 1-88), 25% patients died, and 40.9% had recurrence. On multivariate analysis, elevated preoperative NLR-PLR was predictive of both OS (HR 2.496; CI 1.156-5.389; p=0.020) and RFS (HR 1.917; CI 1.161-3.166; p=0.011). The 5-year OS was 76% for NLR-PLR=0 group, 21.7% for the NLR-PLR=1 group, and 61.1% for the NLR-PLR=2 group, respectively. The 5-year RFS was 39.3% for the NLR-PLR=0 group, 18.4% for the NLR-PLR=1 group, and 21.1% for the NLR-PLR=2 group, respectively. Conclusion The preoperative NLR-PLR is predictive of both OS and RFS in patients with HCC undergoing curative liver resection.","Kabir, T; Ye, M; Mohd Noor, N A; Woon, W; Junnarkar, S P; Shelat, V G",International journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/4239463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31065387/,496

METHODS We systematically reviewed the literature for ECGs of patients with diLQTS and subsequent TdP. We assessed T-wave morphology in each lead and measured the longest QT interval in the limb and chest leads in a standardized fashion. RESULTS Of 84 patients, 61.9% were female and mean age was 58.8 years. QTc was significantly longer in chest versus limb leads (mean (standard deviation) 671 (102) vs 655 (97) ms, p=0.02). Using only limb leads for QT interpretation, 18 (21.4%) ECGs were non-interpretable: 10 (11.9%) due to too flat T-waves, 7 (8.3%) due to frequent, early PVCs and 1 (1.2%) due to too low ECG recording quality. In the chest leads, ECGs were non-interpretable in 9 (10.7%) patients: 6 (7.1%) due to frequent, early PVCs, 1 (1.2%) due to insufficient ECG quality, 2 (2.4%) due to missing chest leads but none due to too flat T-waves. The most common T-wave morphologies in the limb leads were flat (51.0%), broad (14.3%) and late peaking (12.6%) T-waves. Corresponding chest lead morphologies were inverted (35.5%), flat (19.6%) and biphasic (15.2%) T-waves. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that QT evaluation by limb leads only underestimates the incidence of diLQTS experiencing TdP and favors the screening using both limb and chest lead ECG.

81830,Open ventral hernia repair with component separation.,2013,"Healthcare workers are the group with the highest risk of COVID-19 transmission. The illness of healthcare workers poses a risk to patients admitted to the hospital, colleagues and households besides their own health. In this study, it was aimed to determine the risk assessment and the factors associated with risk status of an university hospital healthcare workers after risky COVID-19 contact. The data of the descriptive study were obtained from 773 follow-up records of 555 healthcare workers who applied with COVID-19 risky contact between 06.04-10.05.2020. Employees who were positive for RT-PCR evaluated as ""patients"" and others as ""risky contact"". Risk assessment was classified as no risk, low, medium and high risk contact according to the ""Algorithm of Assessment of Health Workers with COVID-19 Contact"" of the Ministry of Health. The relationship between the risk levels of the participants and their demographic and workplace characteristics and their usage of personal protection were evaluated. Mean, standard deviation, percentage, chi-square and ANOVA tests were used in the analysis of the data. The average age of the healthcare workers was determined as 34.4 ± 7.6 years. It was determined that 56.2% of those who had contact were female, 62.9% were married and 17.5% had an additional disease. It was determined that 45.6% of the risky contacts were nurses, 18.4% were supportive personnel and 16.9% were doctors. While 46.5% of the contacts were found as medium, 28.0% low, 17.1% high risk and 8.4% risk free. 38.2% of risky contacts occurred while working in internal/surgical clinics. While 66.0% of the employees had risky contact during patient care and treatment, 25% had risky contact with colleagues in social settings. High-risk contact was higher in social relations between employees. The source of the contact was a colleague in 73.2% of the employees. The average age of high-risk employees was smaller than those of low-risk. While 54.5% of the employees wore surgical masks during contact, 67.8% of the patients did not have a mask. Of 555 employees followed, 37 (6.7%) were diagnosed as COVID-19; 48.6% of the patients were nurses and 18.9% were doctors. It was determined that 48.6% of the healthcare workers were working in the COVID-19 service, outpatient clinic or intensive care unit at the time of diagnosis. The source of the infection was thought to be a colleague in 51.6% of the patients. COVID-19 was more common in nurses and doctors. It was determined that risky contact also occurred in services other than the units where COVID-19 patients were treated and risky contact often took place while providing healthcare to the patients and during social relations between the employees. Unprotected contact of the employees with each other in the workplace was identified as an important risk source. Inadequate use of personal protective equipment by healthcare workers led to an increase in medium and high risk contacts. The use of masks by patients and their relatives during the health service delivery and the proper use of personal protective equipment by healthcare professionals will reduce the risk. With the physical improvement of the rest areas of the employees and the arrangement of the breaks, the risky contact between colleagues in the social areas will be reduced.","Yapıcı, Gülçin; Kurt, Ahmet Öner; Solmaz, Elif Tuğçe; Yeniocak Tunç, Aylin; Bozdağ, Fatma; Buğdaycı Yalçın, Bengü Nehir; Kaplan, Ekin; Uğuz, Burcu Ecem; Dülger, Eray; Özkayalar, Hülya; Aslan, Gönül; Ersöz, Gülden",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,https://doi.org/10.5578/mb.20219904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882649/,496

Methods In the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community study, we prospectively enrolled 2254 children hospitalized with radiographically confirmed pneumonia from January 2010-June 2012 and tested nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for Mp using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clinical and epidemiological features of Mp PCR-positive and -negative children were compared using logistic regression. Macrolide susceptibility was assessed by genotyping isolates. Results One hundred and eighty two (8%) children were Mp PCR-positive (median age, 7 years); 12% required intensive care and 26% had pleural effusion. No in-hospital deaths occurred. Macrolide resistance was found in 4% (6/169) isolates. Of 178 (98%) Mp PCR-positive children tested for copathogens, 50 (28%) had ≥1 copathogen detected. Variables significantly associated with higher odds of Mp detection included age (10-17 years: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 10.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.4-21.1] and 5-9 years: aOR, 6.4 [95% CI, 3.4-12.1] vs 2-4 years), outpatient antibiotics ≤5 days preadmission (aOR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.5-3.5]), and copathogen detection (aOR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.3-3.3]). Clinical characteristics were non-specific. Conclusions Usually considered as a mild respiratory infection, Mp was the most commonly detected bacteria among children aged ≥5 years hospitalized with CAP, one-quarter of whom had codetections. Although associated with clinically nonspecific symptoms, there was a need for intensive care in some cases. Mycoplasma pneumoniae should be included in the differential diagnosis for school-aged children hospitalized with CAP.","Kutty, Preeta K; Jain, Seema; Taylor, Thomas H; Bramley, Anna M; Diaz, Maureen H; Ampofo, Krow; Arnold, Sandra R; Williams, Derek J; Edwards, Kathryn M; McCullers, Jonathan A; Pavia, Andrew T; Winchell, Jonas M; Schrag, Stephanie J; Hicks, Lauri A",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29788037/,496

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Population-based longitudinal analysis of electronic health records from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to hospital admissions and the mortality registry (1998-2017). We included 100 722 adult patients without diabetes history, diagnosed with giant cell arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica (n=32 593), inflammatory bowel disease (n=29 272), rheumatoid arthritis (n=28 365), vasculitis (n=6082), or systemic lupus erythematosus (n=4410). We estimated risks and HRs of type 2 diabetes associated with time-variant daily and total cumulative prednisolone-equivalent glucocorticoid dose using Cox regression methods. RESULTS Average patient age was 58.6 years, 65 469 (65.0%) were women and 8858 (22.6%) had a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2. Overall, 8137 (8.1%) people developed type 2 diabetes after a median follow-up of 4.9 years. At 1 year, the cumulative risk of diabetes increased from 0.9% during periods of non-use to 5.0% when the daily prednisolone-equivalent dose was ≥25.0 mg. We found strong dose-dependent associations for all immune-mediated diseases, BMI levels and underlying disease duration, even after controlling for periods of active systemic inflammation. Adjusted HR for a <5.0 mg daily dose versus non-use was 1.90, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.50; range 1.70 for rheumatoid arthritis to 2.93 for inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS We report dose-dependent risks of type 2 diabetes associated with glucocorticoid use for six common immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

82275,Vaginal cuff dehiscence after robotic total laparoscopic hysterectomy.,2009,"Science literacy is often held up as crucial for avoiding science-related misinformation and enabling more informed individual and collective decision-making. But research has not yet examined whether science literacy actually enables this, nor what skills it would need to encompass to do so. In this report, we address three questions to outline what it should mean to be science literate in today's world: 1) How should we conceptualize science literacy? 2) How can we achieve this science literacy? and 3) What can we expect science literacy's most important outcomes to be? If science literacy is to truly enable people to become and stay informed (and avoid being misinformed) on complex science issues, it requires skills that span the ""lifecycle"" of science information. This includes how the scientific community produces science information, how media repackage and share the information, and how individuals encounter and form opinions on this information. Science literacy, then, is best conceptualized as encompassing three dimensions of literacy spanning the lifecycle: Civic science literacy, digital media science literacy, and cognitive science literacy. Achieving such science literacy, particularly for adults, poses many challenges and will likely require a structural perspective. Digital divides, in particular, are a major structural barrier, and community literacy and building science literacy into media and science communication are promising opportunities. We end with a discussion of what some of the beneficial outcomes could be-and, as importantly, will likely not be-of science literacy that furthers informed and critical engagement with science in democratic society.","Howell, Emily L; Brossard, Dominique",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1912436117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33876739/,496

BACKGROUND Burnout of healthcare professionals can be a major cost to the Australian economy and public healthcare sector. According to the social exchange theory, when healthcare professionals perceive that their organisation proactively allocates resources to caring for its employees, then they are more likely to reciprocate and become more engaged in their work roles. DESIGN The study used a pre and post survey of healthcare professionals who participated in the wellbeing initiative. METHODS Between February and June 2019, 172 healthcare professionals were surveyed before and after a wellbeing initiative. The survey included questions on workplace engagement, workplace wellbeing, and job satisfaction. Paired t-tests were used to determine if the difference between before and after averages were significant. The TREND statement was utilised to ensure the quality reporting of this study. RESULTS The wellbeing initiative had a positive impact on the healthcare professionals involved in the initiative. Nursing staff benefitted the most from the wellbeing initiative while the full-time staff members and highly experienced demonstrated an increase in engagement. CONCLUSION Wellbeing initiatives can be a targeted strategy to help alleviate burnout amongst healthcare professionals and build a mutually beneficial relationship between management and employees. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study shows how implementing a staff wellbeing initiative increases workplace engagement, which benefits both the individual and the organisation.","Almeida, Shamika; Bowden, Alera; Bloomfield, Jason; Jose, Besty; Wilson, Valerie",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32619287/,496

The Lombardy region was among the areas most affected by COVID-19 infection worldwide; the Lombardy Emergency Medical System (EMS) responded immediately to this emergency. We analyzed several critical aspects to understand what occurred in that region.Methods. This retrospective study compares the events managed by the dispatch center and the characteristics of the patients transported to the hospital -age, sex, SpO2, deaths- managed by the EMS in Brescia and Bergamo provinces between March-April 2020 and March-April 2019. Ambulances' waiting time at the hospitals before discharging patients and the patients' severity at emergency department admission were also analyzed.Results. EMS managed 37,340 events in March-April 2020, +51.5% versus 2019. ""Breathing"" or ""Infective"" events reported to the dispatch center increased more than ten-fold (OR 25.1, p < 0.0001) in March 2020 and two-fold in April 2020 compared to 2019 (OR 3, p < 0.0001). Deaths increased +246% (OR 1.7, p < 0.0001), and patients not transported to hospital +481% (OR 2.9, p < 0.0001) in March 2020 compared to 2019. In some hospitals, ambulances waited more than one hour before discharging the patients, and the emergency departments doubled the admission of critically ill patients. Transported patients for ""Breathing"" or ""Infective"" events were primarily males (OR 1.5, p < 0.0001). The patients had lower SpO2 in 2020 than in 2019 and they were younger.Conclusions.

83497,Differing risk factors for incisional and organ/space surgical site infections following abdominal colorectal surgery.,2011,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of plasma membrane receptors in nature and mediate the effects of a variety of extracellular signals, such as hormone, neurotransmitter, odor, and light signals. Due to their involvement in a broad range of physiological and pathological processes and their accessibility, GPCRs are widely used as pharmacological targets of treatment. Orphan G protein-coupled receptors (oGPCRs) are GPCRs for which no natural ligands have been found, and they not only play important roles in various physiological functions, such as sensory perception, reproduction, development, growth, metabolism, and responsiveness, but are also closely related to many major diseases, such as central nervous system (CNS) diseases, metabolic diseases, and cancer. Recently, many studies have reported that oGPCRs play increasingly important roles as key factors in the occurrence and progression of autoimmune diseases. Therefore, oGPCRs are likely to become potential therapeutic targets and may provide a breakthrough in the study of autoimmune diseases. In this article, we focus on reviewing the recent research progress and clinical treatment effects of oGPCRs in three common autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), shedding light on novel strategies for treatments.","Zhao, Mingming; Wang, Zheyu; Yang, Ming; Ding, Yan; Zhao, Ming; Wu, Haijing; Zhang, Yan; Lu, Qianjin",Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-020-08829-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411320/,496

83725,Lung hernia after video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.,2010,"INTRODUCTION The yield of epileptiform EEG abnormalities is lower in unselected Paediatric populations than in prospective studies of incident seizures or prevalent epilepsy studies. At a time of limited capacity, it is important to match available EEG resources to children who are most likely to benefit. In this study we evaluated a prospective triage tool for estimating the likelihood of epileptiform abnormality in children's first out-patient EEG. METHODS We prospectively triaged 1865 out-patient referrals to the largest Paediatric EEG laboratory in Ireland. Based on a structured algorithm, we dichotomized first EEG referrals into priority and non-priority groups and assigned one of 5 sub-levels based on anticipated EEG yield. EEGs were reported by a single Consultant in Clinical Neurophysiology. RESULTS Triage designated 757 (41 %) EEG referrals as non-priority. Priority exceeded non-priority referrals for all age groups except children between 18 months and 3.5 years. EEGs showed a two-fold higher incidence of interictal epileptiform abnormalities for priority referrals (36 % vs 18 %, p < 0.001). Rates of interictal epileptiform abnormality correlated with the 5 sub-levels of triage (p < 0.01). Epileptiform yield was highest (39 %) for children over 5 years vs 17 % for those under 5 years (p < 0.00001); these rates increased to 49 % and 20 % respectively for priority referrals. CONCLUSION Structured pre-test triage of EEG referrals can identify children who have the greatest likelihood of epileptiform abnormality. In a mixed population of Paediatric referrals, the epileptiform yield of first time EEG is 49 % for children over 5 years who are referred with an appropriate EEG indication. This is subject to much variability with epileptiform yields as low as 13 % in younger children with non-priority referrals. The use of a structured triage algorithm can help to optimise utility of EEG in situations of limited laboratory capacity.","McHugh, John C; Daly, Nicole; Colfer, Ailish",Seizure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seizure.2021.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33515907/,496

However, it is still unclear why some parasites are shared by many species, while others have only one host. Using a new measure of 'phylogenetic host specificity', we find that most primate parasites with more than one host are phylogenetic generalists, infecting less closely related primates than expected. Evolutionary models suggest that phylogenetic host generalism is driven by a mixture of host-parasite cospeciation and lower rates of parasite extinction. We also show that phylogenetic relatedness is important in most analyses, but fails to fully explain patterns of parasite sharing among primates. Host ecology and geographical distribution emerged as key additional factors that influence contacts among hosts to facilitate sharing. Greater understanding of these factors is therefore crucial to improve our ability to predict future infectious disease risks.","Cooper, Natalie; Griffin, Randi; Franz, Mathias; Omotayo, Moshood; Nunn, Charles L; Fryxell, John",Ecology letters,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01858.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22913776/,496

Much to our surprise these homoleptic cuprates, argentates, and aurates are stable enough to be isolated even in the absence of any strongly binding phosphines or N-heterocyclic carbenes as coligands. Their metal atoms are coordinated by two silylchalcogenido ligands in a linear fashion. The silyl moieties of all anions show an unexpected gauche conformation of the silyl substituents with respect to the central axis Si-[E-M-E]-Si in the solid state. The energetic preference for the gauche conformation is confirmed by quantum chemical calculations and amounts to about 2-6 kJ/mol, thus revealing a rather shallow potential mainly depending on electronic effects of the metal. Furthermore, 2D HMQC methods were applied to detect the otherwise nonobservable NMR shifts of the 29Si and 77Se nuclei of the silylselenido compounds. Preliminary investigations reveal that these thermally and protolytically labile chalcogenido metalates are valuable precursors for the precipitation of binary coinage metal chalcogenide nanoparticles from organic solution and for coinage metal cluster syntheses.","Guschlbauer, Jannick; Vollgraff, Tobias; Xie, Xiulan; Weigend, Florian; Sundermeyer, Jörg",Inorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c02808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197182/,496

There is a need to preoperatively identify candidates who will benefit from surgery as there is no strict correlation between POP anatomical abnormalities and changes in symptoms and quality of life (QOL) after surgical treatment. Therefore, our objectives were to evaluate the changes in QOL after laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) for POP using validated questionnaires and to assess their relevance in selecting women for surgery. METHODS This was a prospective study of 48 women with advanced stages of POP treated by LSC from March 2005 to January 2015. We developed a recursive partitioning model from QOL PFDI-20 and PFIQ-7 questionnaire scores to determine a preoperative cut-off score for predicting improvement after surgery. The model was then validated in 84 consecutive women. RESULTS Optimal anatomical results were obtained in 129 of the 132 women (97.7%). Both questionnaires revealed a significant improvement after LSC (p < 0.01). The probability of improvement after surgery was 0% in women with a preoperative PFIQ-7 score of <45.25, and 84% in women with a PFIQ-7 score of ≥45.25. The probability of improvement after surgery was 0% in women with a preoperative PFDI-20 score of <52.15, 88.2% in those with a PFDI-20 score of ≥ 98.45, and 42.9% in those with a PFDI-20 score between 52.15 and 98.45. In the validation set, the discriminatory accuracies of the model were 0.96 (95% CI 0.925-0.998) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.64-0.85) for the PFIQ-7 and PFDI-20 questionnaires, respectively. The performance was accurate with a significant difference between observed outcome frequencies and predicted probabilities (p = 1).

From the heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence tests, the study's panels were heterogeneous and cross-sectionally dependent. Also, all the series were non-stationary at levels, but gained stationarity after first difference. Further, the Fisher test and the Westerlund and Edgerton bootstrap test found the variables to be cointegrated in the long run. The CCEMG and the DCCEMG estimators were used to explore the long-run equilibrium relationship amid the series, and from the results of the whole sample, CO2 emissions and renewable energy consumption (REC) had no vital influence on economic growth (GDP) in both estimators. However, the results were a bit different in the sub-panels. Also from the whole sample, control variables urbanization (URB) and population growth (POP) had no material effect on GDP in both estimators. The results were, however, dissimilar in the sub-panels. Finally, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin test was employed to examine the causalities amid the series, and the results were diverse in the various panels.

METHODS The clinical course of two brothers with pathogenic variants in the methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS)1 gene was compared to previously published patients, functional studies in patient-derived fibroblasts were performed, and therapeutic options evaluated. RESULTS The younger brother was diagnosed with PAP at the age of one year. Exome sequencing revealed the homozygous MARS1 variant p.(Arg598Cys), leading to interstitial lung and liver disease (ILLD). At two years of age, following surgery hypoglycemia was detected, the pulmonary condition deteriorated, and the patient developed multiorgan failure. Six therapeutic whole lung lavages (WLL) were necessary to improve respiratory insufficiency. Methionine supplementation was started and a high protein diet ensured, leading to complete respiratory recovery. The older brother, homozygous for the same MARS1 variant, had a long-known distinct eating preference of methionine-rich food and showed a less severe clinical phenotype. Decreased aminoacylation activity confirmed the pathogenicity of p.(Arg598Cys) in vitro. In agreement with our review of currently published ILLD patients, the presence of hepatopathy, developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, and anemia support the multisystemic character of the disease. CONCLUSIONS Catabolic events can provoke severe deterioration of the pulmonary situation in ILLD with a need for repetitive WLL. Although the precise role of oral methionine supplementation and high protein intake are unknown, we observed an apparent treatment benefit, which needs to be evaluated systematically in controlled trials.

85037,Thank You to Our 2020 Peer Reviewers.,2021-03-01,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) continues to be an economically important infectious disease of swine. Mechanisms governing activation of the innate immune response to PRRSV remain to be elucidated. Virulence differences observed between PRRSV isolates have been attributed to replication ability in vivo, though immunogenic differences likely contribute to virulence also. The current study utilized a single PRRSV isolate given at two different challenge doses to investigate the effect of viral replication and load on immune responses, including type I interferon activation. Body temperature, viral load, antibody levels, cellular infiltration into pulmonary tissue, and the interferon response were measured in animals receiving either a low (10(2) CCID(50)) or high (10(6) CCID(50)) dose of inoculum to understand the role of challenge dose in acute immune responses. Initial PRRSV dose did not correlate with serum levels of PRRSV vRNA or antibody titers during the acute stage of infection (days 2-12 PI), but did have an effect on the immune response and mortality. Type I interferon responses, measured by transcriptional changes in IFN-beta, IFN-alpha, Mx, and PKR, were uniquely different when assessed relative to viral dose or cell type, but no overall trend existed to discern responses based on challenge dose. Serum IFN-gamma levels correlated with serum viral RNA load at day 19 PI. Overall, between days 2 and 12 PI, serum vRNA load was not significantly different between pigs challenged with a low or high dose of PRRSV. Animals receiving high-dose inoculum were viremic longer and eventually succumbed to respiratory disease. IFN-gamma may play a role in PRRSV pathogenesis, as serum levels increased significantly in pigs challenged with the high dose of PRRSV.","Loving, Crystal L; Brockmeier, Susan L; Vincent, Amy L; Lager, Kelly M; Sacco, Randy E",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2008.0038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18788940/,496
85060,Minimally invasive thyroid nodulectomy reduces post-operative hypothyroidism when compared with thyroid lobectomy.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Infections caused by respiratory viruses are important problems worldwide, especially in children. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory pathogen and causes severe infections with nonspecific symptoms. This study reports the hMPV occurrence and dissemination in southern Brazil and compares the frequency of occurrence of this virus and the human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) in the epidemiological weeks in a three-year period (2009-2011). METHODS In total, 545 nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens from individuals with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) who were negative for other seven respiratory viruses were analyzed for the presence of hMPV. Human metapneumovirus was detected by direct immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS hMPV was detected in 109 patients from the main geographic regions of the southernmost state of Brazil, presenting similar overall prevalence in males (46.8%) and females (53.2%). Among children who were less than six years old, hMPV was detected in 99 samples of all age groups, with a higher frequency in infants who were less than one year old (45.7%) compared to all other age groups until six years. hMPV and hRSV infection occurred in almost the same epidemiological weeks (EWs) of each year, with peaks of incidence between EW 31/37 and EW 26/38 for the years 2009 and 2011, respectively. hMPV was further detected in several cases of SARS and it was the only virus detected in three deaths. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that hMPV is in circulation in southern Brazil and highlight the importance of diagnosing hMPV for influenza-like illness in the population.","Gregianini, Tatiana Schäffer; Seadi, Claudete Farina; Menegolla, Ivone; Martins, Letícia Garay; Ikuta, Nilo; Wolf, Jonas Michel; Lunge, Vagner Ricardo",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0435-2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29513839/,496

DATA SOURCES The Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were systematically searched until October 2009 using ""single-incision laparoscopic surgery"" and related terms as keywords. References from retrieved articles were reviewed to broaden the search STUDY SELECTION The study included case reports, case series, and empirical studies that reported SILS in abdominal and pelvic operations. DATA EXTRACTION Number of patients, type of instruments, operative time, blood loss, conversion rate, length of hospital stay, length of follow-up evaluation, and complications were extracted from the reviewed items DATA SYNTHESIS The review included 102 studies classified as level 4 evidence. Most of these studies investigated SILS in cholecystectomy (n=34), appendectomy (n=24), and nephrectomy (n=17). For these procedures, operative time, hospital stay, and complications were comparable with those of conventional laparoscopy. Conversion to conventional laparoscopy was seldom performed in cholecystectomy (range, 0-24%) and more frequent in appendectomy (range, 0-41%) and nephrectomy (range, 0-33%). CONCLUSION The potential benefits of SILS include superior cosmesis and possibly shorter operative time, lower costs, and a shortened time to full physical recovery. Careful case selection and a low threshold of conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery are essential. Multicenter, randomized, prospective studies are needed to compare short- and long-term outcome measures against those of conventional laparoscopic surgery.","Ahmed, Kamran; Wang, Tim T; Patel, Vanash M; Nagpal, Kamal; Clark, James; Ali, Mariam; Deeba, Samer; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara; Athanasiou, Thanos; Paraskeva, Paraskevas",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1208-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20623239/,496

Regular testing of all afflicted individuals may not be feasible due to limited resources, as is true with HIV monitoring in resource-limited settings. Pooled testing methods have been developed in order to allow regular testing for all while reducing resource burden. However, the most commonly used methods do not make use of covariate information predictive of treatment failure, which could improve performance. We propose and evaluate four prediction-driven pooled testing methods that incorporate covariate information to improve pooled testing performance. We then compare these methods in the HIV treatment management setting to current methods with respect to testing efficiency, sensitivity, and number of testing rounds using simulated data and data collected in Rakai, Uganda. Results show that the prediction-driven methods increase efficiency by up to 20% compared with current methods while maintaining equivalent sensitivity and reducing number of testing rounds by up to 70%. When predictions were incorrect, the performance of prediction-based matrix methods remained robust. The best performing method using our motivating data from Rakai was a prediction-driven hybrid method, maintaining sensitivity over 96% and efficiency over 75% in likely scenarios. If these methods perform similarly in the field, they may contribute to improving mortality and reducing transmission in resource-limited settings. Although we evaluate our proposed pooling methods in the HIV treatment setting, they can be applied to any setting that necessitates testing of a quantitative biomarker for a threshold-based decision.","Brand, Adam; May, Susanne; Hughes, James P; Nakigozi, Gertrude; Reynolds, Steven J; Gabriel, Erin E",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.9022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046930/,496

METHODS Every 4 years and as part of the Fifth International Collaboration on Incontinence we reviewed the English-language scientific literature after searching PubMed, Medline, Cochrane library and Cochrane database of systematic reviews, published up to January 2012. Publications were classified as level 1 evidence (randomised controlled trials [RCT] or systematic reviews), level 2 (poor quality RCT, prospective cohort studies), level 3 (case series or retrospective studies) and level 4 (case reports). The highest level of evidence was utilised by the committee to make evidence-based recommendations based upon the Oxford grading system. Grade A recommendation usually depends on consistent level 1 evidence. Grade B recommendation usually depends on consistent level 2 and/or 3 studies, or ""majority evidence"" from RCTs. Grade C recommendation usually depends on level 4 studies or ""majority evidence from level 2/3 studies or Delphi processed expert opinion. Grade D ""no recommendation possible"" would be used where the evidence is inadequate or conflicting and when expert opinion is delivered without a formal analytical process, such as by Delphi. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Transvaginal mesh has a higher re-operation rate than native tissue vaginal repairs (grade A). If a synthetic mesh is placed via the vaginal route, it is recommended that a macroporous polypropylene monofilament mesh should be used. At sacral colpopexy mesh should not be introduced or sutured via the vaginal route and silicone-coated polyester, porcine dermis, fascia lata and polytetrafluoroethylene meshes are not recommended as grafts. Hysterectomy should also be avoided (grade B). There is no evidence to recommend routine local or systemic oestrogen therapy before or after prolapse surgery using mesh. The first cases should be undertaken with the guidance of an experienced surgeon in the relevant technique (grade C). Expert opinion suggests that by whatever the surgical route pre-operative urinary tract infections are treated, smoking is ceased and antibiotic prophylaxis is undertaken. It is recommended that a non-absorbable synthetic mesh should not be inserted into the rectovaginal septum when a rectal injury occurs. The placement of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh into the vesicovaginal septum may be considered after a bladder injury has been repaired, if the repair is considered to be satisfactory. It is possible to perform a hysterectomy in association with the introduction of a non-absorbable synthetic mesh inserted vaginally, but this is not recommended routinely.","de Tayrac, Renaud; Sentilhes, Loic",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-013-2177-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24142061/,496
86591,Clinical significance of mediastinoscope-assisted transhiatal esophagectomy in patients with esophageal cancer.,2015,"Introduction The use of implants in inguinal hernia repair has reduced its recurrence rate. However, postoperative groin pain still remains an unresolved problem. There are suggestions that in totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (TEP-IHR) two of the likely factors responsible for pain are use of fixation and the type of fixation used. Aim To evaluate the impact of mesh fixation on the incidence of postoperative pain, restriction of physical activities, hernia recurrence risk, return to normal activities and demand for analgesics in patients after unilateral TEP-IHR. Material and methods Unilateral TEP-IHR was performed in 139 male patients randomized to three groups: self-gripping mesh (SG), lightweight mesh (L) and lightweight mesh with fixation (LF). Full study-inclusion criteria were met by 110 patients; 43, 18 and 49 in groups SG, L and LF respectively. Follow-up occurred on the 1st, 2nd, and 7th day and 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively. The numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess pain and the EuraHS-QoL (European Registry for Abdominal Wall Hernias Quality of Life Score) questionnaire to compare quality of life (QoL) prior to surgery and one year later. Results No statistically significant differences were observed between study groups with regard to the incidence rate and intensity of acute post-operative pain, chronic pain, analgesic demand, return to normal activity, hernia recurrence rate and post-operative QoL. Conclusions Lack of fixation in TEP-IHR does not increase the risk of hernia recurrence, and its presence does not significantly worsen the treatment results; especially it does not increase the incidence of chronic pain.","Pielaciński, Konrad; Puła, Bartosz; Wróblewski, Tadeusz; Kuryłowicz, Michał; Szczepanik, Andrzej B",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2019.83611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32117479/,496

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study tested the potential role of Rab small GTPase 5a (Rab5a) in the process. We tested mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) in THP-1 macrophages by qPCR and ELISA assays, respectively. In the primary colonic epithelial cells, Cdt treatment induced CdtB-Rab5a-cellugyrin association. Rab5a silencing, by target small hairpin (sh) RNAs, largely inhibited CdtB-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in colon epithelial cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Rab5a knockout also attenuated CdtB-induced colon epithelial cell death. Conversely, forced overexpression of Rab5a intensified CdtB-induced cytotoxicity. In THP-1 human macrophages, Rab5a shRNA or knockout significantly inhibited CdtB-induced mRNA expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6).

METHODS MEDLINE and Embase were systematically searched in August 2019 (updated July 2020) for studies fulfilling the following criteria: intubated adult patients (Population); high fractions of oxygen (Intervention) versus low fractions of (Comparison); atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and/or duration of mechanical ventilation (Outcome); original studies both observational and interventional (Studies). Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was done by two independent reviewers. RESULTS Out of 6120 records assessed for eligibility, 12 were included. Seven studies were conducted in the emergency setting, and five studies included patients undergoing elective surgery. Eight studies reported data on atelectasis, two on ARDS, four on pneumonia and two on duration of mechanical ventilation. There was a non-significant increased risk of atelectasis if an oxygen fraction of 0.8 or above was used, relative risk (RR): 1.37 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.96). One study showed an almost threefold higher risk of pneumonia in the high oxygen fraction group (RR: 2.83 (95% CI 2.25 to 3.56)). The two studies reporting ARDS and the two studies with data on mechanical ventilation showed no association with oxygen fraction. Four studies had a high risk of bias in one domain. CONCLUSIONS In this systematic review, we found inadequate evidence to identify a safe upper dosage of oxygen, but the identified studies suggest a benefit of keeping inspiratory oxygen fraction below 0.8 with regard to formation of atelectases.

To understand the epidemiology especially the dynamic pattern of EBV disease, we analyse the EBV case notification data for confirmed cases and reported deaths of the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) between 2018 and 2019, and examined the impact of reported violence on the spread of the virus. Using fully Bayesian geo-statistical analysis through stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) allows us to quantify the spatial patterns at every point of the spatial domain. Parameter estimation was based on the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). Our findings revealed a positive association between violent events in the affected areas and the reported EBV cases (posterior mean = 0.024, 95% CI: 0.005, 0.045) and deaths (posterior mean = 0.022, 95% CI: 0.005, 0.041). Translating to an increase of 2.4% and 2.2% in the relative risks of EBV cases and deaths associated with a unit increase in violent events (one additional Ebola case is associated with an average of 45 violent events). We also observed clusters of EBV cases and deaths spread to neighbouring locations in similar manners. Findings from the study are therefore useful for hot spot identification, location-specific disease surveillance and intervention.","Adegboye, Oyelola; Gayawan, Ezra; James, Adewale; Adegboye, Adedayo; Elfaki, Faiz",Zoonoses and public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780159/,496

We studied T cell memory in 42 patients following recovery from COVID-19 (28 with mild disease and 14 with severe disease) and 16 unexposed donors, using interferon-γ-based assays with peptides spanning SARS-CoV-2 except ORF1. The breadth and magnitude of T cell responses were significantly higher in severe as compared with mild cases. Total and spike-specific T cell responses correlated with spike-specific antibody responses. We identified 41 peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ epitopes, including six immunodominant regions. Six optimized CD8+ epitopes were defined, with peptide-MHC pentamer-positive cells displaying the central and effector memory phenotype. In mild cases, higher proportions of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were observed. The identification of T cell responses associated with milder disease will support an understanding of protective immunity and highlights the potential of including non-spike proteins within future COVID-19 vaccine design.","Peng, Yanchun; Mentzer, Alexander J; Liu, Guihai; Yao, Xuan; Yin, Zixi; Dong, Danning; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Rostron, Timothy; Supasa, Piyada; Liu, Chang; López-Camacho, César; Slon-Campos, Jose; Zhao, Yuguang; Stuart, David I; Paesen, Guido C; Grimes, Jonathan M; Antson, Alfred A; Bayfield, Oliver W; Hawkins, Dorothy E D P; Ker, De-Sheng; Wang, Beibei; Turtle, Lance; Subramaniam, Krishanthi; Thomson, Paul; Zhang, Ping; Dold, Christina; Ratcliff, Jeremy; Simmonds, Peter; de Silva, Thushan; Sopp, Paul; Wellington, Dannielle; Rajapaksa, Ushani; Chen, Yi-Ling; Salio, Mariolina; Napolitani, Giorgio; Paes, Wayne; Borrow, Persephone; Kessler, Benedikt M; Fry, Jeremy W; Schwabe, Nikolai F; Semple, Malcolm G; Baillie, J Kenneth; Moore, Shona C; Openshaw, Peter J M; Ansari, M Azim; Dunachie, Susanna; Barnes, Eleanor; Frater, John; Kerr, Georgina; Goulder, Philip; Lockett, Teresa; Levin, Robert; Zhang, Yonghong; Jing, Ronghua; Ho, Ling-Pei; Cornall, Richard J; Conlon, Christopher P; Klenerman, Paul; Screaton, Gavin R; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; McMichael, Andrew; Knight, Julian C; Ogg, Graham; Dong, Tao",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0782-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887977/,496

Topic models are unsupervised natural language processing methods that analyze nonnumeric data (i.e., text data) in abundance. These tools aggregate, and make sense of, those data making them interpretable to interested audiences. In this perspective piece, we briefly describe topic models, including their purpose, function, and applicability for health education researchers and practitioners. We note how topic models can be applied in several contexts, including social media-based analyses, and mapping trends in scientific literature over time. As a tool for studying words, and patterns of words, topic models stand to improve our understanding of events prior and those occurring in the moment and help us look ahead into the future.","Valdez, Danny; Picket, Andrew C; Young, Belinda-Rose; Golden, Shelley",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839921999050; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759597/,496

89144,Flipped Classrooms in Physician Assistant Education.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE Restenosis following endovascular treatment of the femoropopliteal segment is associated with the inflammatory response produced in the artery wall at the time of the procedure. Although local drug delivery to the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries promises improved patency, data are currently limited. We hypothesized that improved percutaneous delivery of an anti-inflammatory compound into the adventitia of the femoropopliteal at the time of endovascular treatment would be safe, feasible, and decrease the inflammatory response. METHODS This was a prospective, investigator-initiated, phase I, first-in-man study testing the safety and feasibility of percutaneous adventitial delivery of dexamethasone. Following successful intervention, an adventitial microinfusion catheter was advanced over a 0.014-inch wire to the treated segment. Its microneedle (0.9 mm long × 140-μm diameter) was deployed into the adventitia to deliver dexamethasone (4 mg/mL) mixed with contrast agent (80:20 ratio), providing fluoroscopic visualization. The primary safety outcome measure was freedom from vessel dissection, thrombosis, or extravasation while the primary efficacy outcome was duplex-determined binary restenosis defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio >2.5. RESULTS Twenty patients with Rutherford clinical category 2-5 enrolled in this study. The mean age was 66, and 55% had diabetes mellitus. Treated lesion length was 8.9 ± 5.3 cm, and 50% were chronic total occlusions. Eighty percent of treated lesions were in the distal superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. All lesions were treated by balloon angioplasty with provisional stenting (n = 6) for suboptimal result. Three patients were treated with atherectomy as well. A mean of 1.6 ± 1.1 mg (0.5 ± 0.3 mL) of dexamethasone sodium phosphate was injected per centimeter of lesion length. In total, a mean of 12.1 ± 6.1 mg of dexamethasone was injected per patient. The mean number of injections required per lesion was 3.0 ± 1.3 cm, minimum one and maximum six injections. There was 100% technical success of drug delivery and no procedural or drug-related adverse events. The mean Rutherford score decreased from 3.1 ± .7 (median, 3.0) preoperatively to .5 ± .7 at 6 months (median, 0.0; P < .00001). Over this same time interval, the index leg ankle-brachial index increased from .68 ± .15 to .89 ± .19 (P = .0003). The preoperative C-reactive protein in this study was 6.9 ± 8.5 indicating severe baseline inflammation, which increased to 14.0 ± 23.1 mg/L (103% increase) at 24 hours following the procedure. However, this increase did not reach statistical significance of P = .14. Two patients met the primary efficacy end point of loss of primary patency by reoccluding their treated segment of the index lesion during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Adventitial drug delivery via a microinfusion catheter is a safe and feasible alternative to intimal-based methods for adjunctive treatment in the femoropopliteal segment. The 6-month preliminary results suggest perivascular dexamethasone treatment may improve outcomes following angioplasty to the femoral and popliteal arteries, and support further clinical investigation of this approach.","Owens, Christopher D; Gasper, Warren J; Walker, Joy P; Alley, Hugh F; Conte, Michael S; Grenon, S Marlene",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2013.10.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24423476/,496

89353,"Duodenal stump fistula after gastrectomy for gastric cancer: risk factors, prevention, and management.",2016,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Natural-orifice approaches for nephrectomy have included access via the stomach, vagina, bladder, and rectum. Recently, the feasibility of using the ureter as a natural orifice for natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy has been demonstrated in a nonsurvival porcine model. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcomes of transureteral laparoscopic natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy in a survival porcine model. METHODS Three pigs underwent hybrid transureteral natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy. An experimental balloon/dilating sheath was inserted over a wire to dilate the urethra, ureteral orifice, and ureter. Through a bariatric 12-mm laparoscopic port, the ureter was opened medially and the hilar dissection was performed. Next, 2 needlescopic ports were placed transabdominally to facilitate hilar transection. The kidney was morcellated using a bipolar sealing device and extracted via the ureter using the housing of a bariatric stapling device. The ureteral orifice was closed with a laparoscopic suturing device. The bladder was drained by a catheter for 10 to 14 days postoperatively. Pigs were euthanized on postoperative day 21. RESULTS All surgical procedures were successfully completed, with no intraoperative complications. One pig had an episode of postoperative clot retention that resolved with catheter irrigation. Each pig was healthy and eating a normal diet prior to euthanasia. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the feasibility of a hybrid transureteral approach to nephrectomy in a survival porcine model. This technique avoids the intentional violation of a second organ system and the risk for peritoneal contamination. Improved instrumentation is needed prior to implementation in the human population.","Anderson, Kirk M; Alsyouf, Muhannad; Richards, Gideon; Agarwal, Gautum; Heldt, Jonathan P; Schlaifer, Amy E; Baldwin, D Duane",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25489210/,496

RESULTS In Genetics and PE, the quiz scores were significantly higher for flipped classrooms (Genetics 95.00 ± 6.56; PE 83.09 ± 11.47) compared to the traditional lectures (Genetics 90.00 ± 10.53; PE 55.43 ± 16.66). In HPP, students performed better with traditional lectures (86.54 ± 8.82) compared to the flipped classrooms (75.12 ± 8.54). In CM, students' gain score was significantly higher for flipped classrooms (37.85 ± 16.73) than for traditional lectures (20.97 ± 15.55).

89599,Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for esophageal cancer.,2016,"The clinical presentation of COVID-19 due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable with the majority of patients having mild symptoms while others develop severe respiratory failure. The reason for this variability is unclear but is in critical need of investigation. Some COVID-19 patients have been labeled with 'happy hypoxia,' in which patient complaints of dyspnoea and observable signs of respiratory distress are reported to be absent. Based on ongoing debate, we highlight key respiratory and neurological components that could underlie variation in the presentation of silent hypoxaemia and define priorities for subsequent investigation. Abstract figure legend. Genesis of air hunger. In a working model of mechanisms giving rise to air hunger, brainstem respiratory centers send projections (corollary discharge) to the forebrain, giving rise to breathing discomfort in proportion to the magnitude of corollary discharge (Banzett et al., 2020). These brainstem respiratory centers also send descending projections, driving respiratory motor neurons and respiratory muscle activity to generate ventilation. Inputs to the brainstem centers include chemoreceptor inputs, exercise, and voluntary inputs from the motor cortex. Afferent feedback from lung stretch receptors modulate different qualities of dyspneic sensation. Slowly adapting lung stretch receptors (SAR) are inhibitory to air hunger. Pulmonary C-fiber receptors contribute to air hunger, but precise neural projections are not well understood. Whenever corollary discharge reaches a certain threshold, or when ventilation fails to meet demand, dyspnoea ensues. Inputs contributing to dyspnoea are indicated by blue arrows; inputs that inhibit dyspnoea are indicated with blue circles. Black arrows indicate homeostatic regulation of breathing.

Intraoperative sedation levels are a possible modifiable risk factor for postoperative delirium. Objective To determine whether limiting sedation levels during spinal anesthesia reduces incident delirium overall. Design, Setting, and Participants This double-blind randomized clinical trial (A Strategy to Reduce the Incidence of Postoperative Delirum in Elderly Patients [STRIDE]) was conducted from November 18, 2011, to May 19, 2016, at a single academic medical center and included a consecutive sample of older patients (≥65 years) who were undergoing nonelective hip fracture repair with spinal anesthesia and propofol sedation. Patients were excluded for preoperative delirium or severe dementia. Of 538 hip fractures screened, 225 patients (41.8%) were eligible, 10 (1.9%) declined participation, 15 (2.8%) became ineligible between the time of consent and surgery, and 200 (37.2%) were randomized. The follow-up included postoperative days 1 to 5 or until hospital discharge. Interventions Heavier (modified observer's assessment of sedation score of 0-2) or lighter (observer's assessment of sedation score of 3-5) propofol sedation levels intraoperatively. Main Outcomes and Measures Delirium on postoperative days 1 to 5 or until hospital discharge determined via consensus panel using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revision) criteria. The incidence of delirium was compared between intervention groups with and without stratification by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Results Of 200 participants, the mean (SD) age was 82 (8) years, 146 (73%) were women, 194 (97%) were white, and the mean (SD) CCI was 1.5 (1.8). One hundred participants each were randomized to receive lighter sedation levels or heavier sedation levels. A good separation of intraoperative sedation levels was confirmed by multiple indices. The overall incident delirium risk was 36.5% (n = 73) and 39% (n = 39) vs 34% (n = 34) in heavier and lighter sedation groups, respectively (P = .46). Intention-to-treat analyses indicated no statistically significant difference between groups in the risk of incident delirium (log-rank test χ2, 0.46; P = .46). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, when stratified by CCI, sedation levels did effect the delirium risk (P for interaction = .04); in low comorbid states (CCI = 0), heavier vs lighter sedation levels doubled the risk of delirium (hazard ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1- 4.9). The level of sedation did not affect delirium risk with a CCI of more than 0. Conclusions and Relevance In the primary analysis, limiting the level of sedation provided no significant benefit in reducing incident delirium. However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, lighter sedation levels benefitted reducing postoperative delirium for persons with a CCI of 0.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, blinded, randomized experimental study in two centres. ANIMALS Eighty-three healthy New Zealand White rabbits undergoing tibial or ulnar osteotomy. METHODS Medetomidine (0.2 mg kg-1) with 10 mg kg-1 ketamine (MK) or 5 mg kg-1 S(+)-ketamine (MS) was administered IN to each rabbit in a randomized fashion. In Centre 1 (n = 42) rabbits were held in sternal recumbency, and in Centre 2 (n = 41) in dorsal recumbency, during drug instillation. Adverse reactions were recorded. If a rabbit swallowed during endotracheal intubation, half of the initial IN dose was repeated and intubation was re-attempted after 5 minutes. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. Heart rate, blood pressure, endtidal carbon dioxide concentration and blood gases were recorded. Data were analysed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS In all, 39 animals were assigned to the MK group and 44 to the MS group. Two rabbits in the MS group held in dorsal recumbency died after instillation of the drug. Eight (MK) and 11 rabbits (MS) were insufficiently anaesthetized and received a second IN dose. One rabbit in MK and three in MS required an isoflurane mask induction after the second IN dose. There were no significant differences between treatments for induction, intraoperative data, blood gas values and recovery data. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study indicated that medetomidine-ketamine and medetomidine-S(+)-ketamine were effective shortly after IN delivery, but in dorsal recumbency IN administration of S(+)-ketamine led to two fatalities. Nasal haemorrhage was noted in both cases; however, the factors leading to death have not been fully elucidated.","Weiland, Linda C; Kluge, Katharina; Kutter, Annette P N; Kronen, Peter W",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/vaa.12408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27374385/,496

Despite concerns, many have adopted the impact factor of journals for this purpose. The objective of this study was to explore the conditions that have been created within Taiwan as a result of such national and institutional policies. A case study design was used. Information was sought from five senior faculty members, who responded to a questionnaire with items derived from the literature. A key participant provided context within the country. The data were summarized and described. The respondents confirmed the presence of governmental and university policies for publication in high-impact factor journals; they saw some positive aspects, yet described the obstacles faced by many scholars, felt that the policies led to competition rather than cooperation, and viewed national, compared to international, publications in opposing terms. The findings are discussed within the context of current nursing literature. It is recommended that, where impact factors are used, they not be the only quality measure.

Boson sampling is such a task and is considered as a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We perform Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix-the whole optical setup is phase-locked-and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples are validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is ~1014 faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers.","Zhong, Han-Sen; Wang, Hui; Deng, Yu-Hao; Chen, Ming-Cheng; Peng, Li-Chao; Luo, Yi-Han; Qin, Jian; Wu, Dian; Ding, Xing; Hu, Yi; Hu, Peng; Yang, Xiao-Yan; Zhang, Wei-Jun; Li, Hao; Li, Yuxuan; Jiang, Xiao; Gan, Lin; Yang, Guangwen; You, Lixing; Wang, Zhen; Li, Li; Liu, Nai-Le; Lu, Chao-Yang; Pan, Jian-Wei",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abe8770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273064/,496

However, most primary care physicians are not managing patient weight as a standard of care due to lack of knowledge, skills and reimbursement. Generating more physicians who are familiar and comfortable with providing weight management is essential in leveraging a global change. In our university free clinic, medical students provide healthy lifestyle counselling using shared decision making to each patient at every clinic visit. OBJECTIVE Improve the efficacy of behaviour change interventions via increased patient responsiveness and adherence. METHODS The needs assessment demonstrated a subpar patient response rate to check-ins regarding behavioural change goals. In the first and second interventions, check-in message structure and contact schedule were varied to maximize patient responsiveness and goal achievement. RESULTS In the needs assessment, 58% of patients responded to follow-ups and 58% of patients accomplished their goal. The first intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 70% and accomplishment of goals to 59%. The second intervention cycle resulted in an improvement of responsiveness to 78% and accomplishment of goals to 74%. CONCLUSIONS Messages that were frequent, unique, succinct and delivered within 4 weeks after the clinic visit resulted in the highest response rate and goal attainment. Other primary care clinics can use these interventions to increase patient completion of implemented behaviour changes for a healthier lifestyle.","Lessans, Spencer; Vega, Xamil; Foley, Brandon; Bossan, Alexia; Baker, Alexandra; McElroy, Mitchell; Crouse, Eloisa; Pasarica, Magdalena",Family practice,https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmaa057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667977/,496

91516,Study of the Pathogen Inactivation Mechanism in Salt-Coated Filters.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND In 2015, a large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in the Republic of Korea. Half of the cases were associated with a tertiary care university hospital. OBJECTIVE To document the outbreak and successful control measures. DESIGN Descriptive study. SETTING A 1950-bed tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS 92 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS and 9793 exposed persons. MEASUREMENTS Description of the outbreak, including a timeline, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the control measures. RESULTS During the outbreak, 92 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases were associated with a large tertiary care hospital, 82 of which originated from unprotected exposure to 1 secondary patient. Contact tracing and monitoring exposed patients and assigned health care workers were at the core of the control measures in the outbreak. Nontargeted screening measures, including body temperature screening among employees and visitors at hospital gates, monitoring patients for MERS-related symptoms, chest radiographic screening, and employee symptom monitoring, did not detect additional patients with MERS without existing transmission links. All in-hospital transmissions originated from 3 patients with MERS who also had pneumonia and productive cough. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective single-center study. Statistical analysis could not be done. Because this MERS outbreak originated from a superspreader, effective control measures could differ in endemic areas or in other settings. CONCLUSION Control strategies for MERS outbreaks should focus on tracing contacts of persons with epidemiologic links. Adjusting levels of quarantine and personal protective equipment according to the assumed infectivity of each patient with MERS may be appropriate.

OBSERVATION A 22year old man with mild von Willebrand disease presented with two occipital CCM, one of them with acute hemorrhage. Genetic testing for CCM1-3 did not reveal a mutation. Over a period of 54months, the patient suffered 26 new CCM hemorrhages despite multiple treatment attempts including thalidomide, simvastatin and hemostatic factors. Only after initiation of propranolol, which has already been successfully used in three children with giant cerebral cavernoma, the occurrence of new CCM with hemorrhages was completely stopped already at dose of 30mg daily - now for a period of 26months and without any other medications. CONCLUSION This case suggests a protective role for propranolol in preventing the occurrence of new cerebral cavernoma with hemorrhages in adults with multiple CCM.","Reinhard, Matthias; Schuchardt, Florian; Meckel, Stephan; Heinz, Jürgen; Felbor, Ute; Sure, Ulrich; Geisen, Ulrich",Journal of the neurological sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2016.04.053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423555/,496
92638,Single center experience in single-incision laparoscopic surgery in children in Turkey.,2011,"Hypertension has been listed in several case series and retrospective cohorts as a potential risk factor for the incidence and severity of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-associated disease (COVID-19). The debate is noteworthy because almost one billion people around the globe are estimated to have hypertensive diseases, according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Considering the SARS-CoV-2's high infectivity rates, a possible interaction between COVID-19 and hypertension is worrisome. Additionally, antihypertensive drugs, especially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, could also influence the natural course of COVID-19 infection. Not only can these associations hold from an epidemiologic standpoint, a mechanistic scenario possibly exists. Hypertension and antihypertensive drugs can increase the expression of transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, the entry target of the viruses, thus facilitating infectivity. On the other hand, an increase in ACE-2 could be protective considering the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic effects of the ACE-2-angiotensin 1-7/Mas pathway. So far, little is known about the whole picture. Observational studies appear to indicate at least a twofold increased risk of mortality for hypertensive patients with COVID-19; however, the previous and continued use of RAAS inhibitors may be protective in this subgroup of patients. The scarcity of randomized clinical trials precludes evidence-based decision-making. At least one randomized study in a non-specified sub-analysis demonstrated no relationship between an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and incidence or severity of the disease. It is reflected mainly by observational studies and, therefore, by international cardiology societies' guidelines, which state that antihypertensive drugs, particularly RAAS inhibitors, should not be discontinued unless necessary on a case-by-case basis.","Quinaglia, Thiago; Shabani, Mahsima; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973183/,496

By March 11, this outbreak was designated as a pandemic by World Health Organization. So far, it has affected 213 countries and territories around the world. It is an infectious disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread. In the present paper, we discuss the various non-pharmacological approaches that have to be adopted at the personal or community level and by the healthcare providers to win against this virus.","Verma, Madhur; Aydin, Hasan",JPMA.

METHOD A retrospective, single-centre, consecutive case series of RVO patients receiving injections who were LTFU >6 months was conducted. Data were collected from the visit before LTFU; return visit; 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after return; and the final visit. RESULTS Ninety eyes of 83 patients were included. Fifty (55.5%) eyes had branch RVO and 40 (44.5%) had central RVO. Mean LTFU duration was 277.8 days with additional mean follow-up for 748.1 days after return. Mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity (VA) (Snellen) at the visit before LTFU was 0.72 (20/105) which worsened on return [1.04 (20/219), p<0.001) and remained worse at all timepoints after return: 0.92 (20/166) at 3 months (p<0.001), 0.97 (20/187) at 6 months (p<0.001), 0.94 (20/174) at 12 months (p<0.001) and 1.01 (20/205) at final visit (p<0.001). Mean central foveal thickness (CFT) increased from 252 µm at the visit before LTFU to 396 µm at the return visit (p<0.001). No difference in CFT was noted by 3 months (258 µm, p=0.71), 6 months (241 µm, p=0.54) or 12 months after return (250 µm, p=0.95). CFT was thinner at the final visit (215 µm, p=0.018).

92883,Video-assisted left lower lobectomy with intrapericardial pulmonary vein isolation.,2020-09-25,"The most common type of pituitary neoplasms is benign pituitary adenoma (PA). Clinically significant PAs affect around 0.1% of the population. Currently, there is no established human PA cell culture available and when PA tumor cells are cultured they form two distinct types depending on culturing conditions either free-floating aggregates also known as pituispheres or cells adhering to the surface of cell plates and displaying mesenchymal stem-like properties. The aim of this study was to trace the origin of sphere-forming and adherent pituitary cell cultures and characterize the potential use of these surgery derived cell lines as PA model. We carried out a paired-end exome sequencing of patients' tumor and germline DNA using Illumina NextSeq followed by characterization of corresponding PA cell cultures. Variation analysis revealed a low amount of somatic mutations (mean = 5.2, range 3-7) in exomes of PAs. Somatic mutations of the primary surgery material can be detected in the exomes of respective pituispheres, but not in exomes of respective mesenchymal stem-like cells. For the first time, we show that the genome of pituispheres represents genome of PA while mesenchymal stem cells derived from the PA tissue do not contain mutations characteristic to PA in their genome, therefore, most likely representing normal cells of pituitary or surrounding tissues. This finding indicates that pituispheres can be used as a human model of PA cells, but combination of cell culturing techniques and NGS needs to be employed to adjust for disability to propagate spheres in culturing conditions.","Peculis, Raitis; Mandrika, Ilona; Petrovska, Ramona; Dortane, Rasma; Megnis, Kaspars; Nazarovs, Jurijs; Balcere, Inga; Stukens, Janis; Konrade, Ilze; Pirags, Valdis; Klovins, Janis; Rovite, Vita",Frontiers in endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528411/,496

OBJECTIVE To characterize the ventricular repolarization indexes which are associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and concomitant azithromycin for COVID-19. METHOD A total of 81 patients who had hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy because of possible or reverse-transcription polymertase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included in the study. Baseline and control electrocardiograms (before and after treatment) were analyzed retrospectively. Tp-e interval, Tp-e/QT and Tp-e/QTc ratios, which are ventricular repolarization indexes, were calculated. RESULTS While there was no significant increase in QTc interval in patients receiving combination therapy, there was a significant increase in ventricular repolarization indexes. CONCLUSION The increase in ventricular replarization indexes is associated with the risk of arrhythmia. In patients using QTc prolonging medication for COVID-19 treatment, QTc monitoring alone may not be sufficient to follow-up for arrhythmia. Even if there is no prolongation in QTc, an increase in ventricular repolarization indexes may be seen (Tab. 5, Ref. 37).","Gunay, S; Caliskan, S; Sigirli, D; Sahin, E",Bratislavske lekarske listy,https://doi.org/10.4149/bll_2020_134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164544/,496

Our aim was to assess the effect of Heller myotomy on IRP in achalasia patients. METHODS We prospectively collected data on achalasia patients who underwent HRM between 2009-2014. Barium swallow was used to assess esophageal diameter and shape. Manometric diagnoses were performed by using the Chicago Classification v3. All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of achalasia were treated surgically with Heller Myotomy RESULTS One hundred thirty-nine consecutive achalasia patients (M:F = 72:67) represented the study population. All the patients had 100% simultaneous waves but 11 had an IRP < 15 mmHg. At median follow-up of 28 months, the median of IRP was significantly lower after surgery (27.4 [IQR 20.4-35] vs 7.1 [IQR 4.4-9.8]; p < 0.001), and so were the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) resting pressure (27 [IQR 18-33] vs 6 [IQR 3-11]; p < 0.001). At univariate analysis, IRP correlated with the gender, LES resting residual pressure, and dysphagia score. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to have examined the role of IRP in achalasia, and how it changes after surgical treatment. An increased preoperative IRP correlated directly with a more severe dysphagia. The IRP was restored to normal by Heller myotomy.","Salvador, Renato; Savarino, Edoardo; Pesenti, Elisa; Spadotto, Lorenzo; Capovilla, Giovanni; Cavallin, Francesco; Galeazzi, Francesca; Nicoletti, Loredana; Merigliano, Stefano; Costantini, Mario",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-015-3006-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26519153/,496

This study electrophysiologically confirmed the topography of the internal anal sphincter nerve supply during laparoscopic-assisted transanal minimally invasive surgery for total mesorectal excision. METHODS This prospective study was conducted at two large multispecialty referral centers. Six patients (five males and one female) aged between 45 and 65 years with low rectal cancer (≤5 cm from the anal verge) were enrolled. Surgery was performed under electric stimulation of the pelvic autonomic nerves with observation of the electromyographic signals of the internal anal sphincter. RESULTS The minimally invasive transanal surgical approach enabled advantageous visualization of the pelvic autonomic nerves in all patients. In particular, extrinsic innervation to the internal anal sphincter near the levator muscle was consciously spared under electrophysiological confirmation. The evoked absolute electromyographic amplitudes of the internal anal sphincter during transanal minimally invasive surgery were significantly lower than the initial results of the laparoscopic approach [3.7 μV (interquartile range 2.4; 5.7) vs. 4.3 μV (interquartile range 3.1; 8.6); p = 0.002]. Five key zones of risk for pelvic autonomic nerve damage were identified. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS The electromyographic results of this preliminary study indicate advantages for sparing the internal anal sphincter innervation during transanal minimally invasive mesorectal dissection considering the specific in situ neuroanatomical topography.","Kneist, Werner; Rink, Andreas D; Kauff, Daniel W; Konerding, Moritz A; Lang, Hauke",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-014-2026-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25310925/,496
94279,Myotomy length informed by high-resolution esophageal manometry (HREM) results in improved per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) outcomes for type III achalasia.,2019,"The eukaryotic initiation translation factor 2 (eIF2) represents a key point in the regulation of protein synthesis. This factor delivers the initiator Met-tRNA to the ribosome, a process that is conserved in all eukaryotic cells. Many types of stress reduce global translation by triggering the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2, which reduces the formation of the preinitiation translation complexes. Early during rotavirus infection, eIF2α becomes phosphorylated, and even under these conditions viral protein synthesis is not affected, while most of the cell protein synthesis is blocked. Here, we found that the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of eIF2α in rotavirus-infected cells is PKR, since in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in the kinase domain of PKR, or in MA104 cells where the expression of PKR was knocked down by RNA interference, eIF2α was not phosphorylated upon rotavirus infection. The viral component responsible for the activation of PKR seems to be viral double-stranded RNA, which is found in the cytoplasm of infected cells, outside viroplasms. Taken together, these results suggest that rotaviruses induce the PKR branch of the interferon system and have evolved a mechanism to translate its proteins, surpassing the block imposed by eIF2α phosphorylation.","Rojas, Margarito; Arias, Carlos F; López, Susana",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00625-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20631127/,496

METHODS From January 2012 to June 2013, we prospectively performed D-cultures on postoperative day (POD) 1 in consecutive gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy. The univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for intra-abdominal abscess formation without anastomotic leakage. RESULTS The rate of positive D-cultures was 6.4 % on POD 1. According to a univariate analysis, the use of combined organ resection (P = 0.011), the drain amylase level on POD 1 (P = 0.016) and the D-culture status on POD 1 (P = 0.004) were found to be significantly associated with the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that D-culture positivity on POD 1 was the only independent predictor of intra-abdominal abscess formation (P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrated that bacterial culture positivity of drainage fluid during the early postoperative period has a significant impact on the development of intra-abdominal abscesses after gastrectomy.","Migita, Kazuhiro; Takayama, Tomoyoshi; Matsumoto, Sohei; Wakatsuki, Kohei; Tanaka, Tetsuya; Ito, Masahiro; Nakajima, Yoshiyuki",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-014-0881-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633956/,496

Accordingly, we aimed to examine their potential relationship with the novel biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, such as endocan in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), since there are no studies concerning this issue. PATIENTS AND METHODS This case-control study included a total of 42 individuals with T2D and 64 diabetes-free participants. Serum endocan, lipid parameters, and lipoprotein subclasses were measured. RESULTS Patients with T2D exhibited higher proportion of the smallest high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles HDL 3c, as compared with diabetes-free participants (p=0.047). Higher serum endocan levels in T2D patients with low small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (sdLDL) %, as compared with corresponding group of diabetes-free subjects was shown (p<0.01). Univariate binary logistic analysis revealed significant positive association of endocan and LDL diameter (OR=1.686, p=0.004), and negative associations of endocan with proportions of sdLDL (OR=0.928, p=0.007) and HDL3b (OR=0.789, p=0.009) particles. In a multivariate analysis, LDL diameter and proportions of sdLDL and HDL3b subclasses remained independent predictors of endocan levels in tested population. CONCLUSIONS The results of our study showed that larger LDL diameters, but lower sdLDL and HDL3b proportions were associated with higher endocan levels in population with T2D. More studies in the future are needed to confirm the observed relationship and to examine its causal nature.","Klisic, A; Kavaric, N; Vujcic, S; Mihajlovic, M; Zeljkovic, A; Ivanisevic, J; Spasojevic-Kalimanovska, V; Ninic, A; Kotur-Stevuljevic, J; Vekic, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22499; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767341/,496

We found that the LC properties of these compounds does not only depends on the number of hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound 1 leads to no LC properties, while the use of four amide groups induces the formation of long temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound 4 . Remarkably, compound 3, bearing two amide groups in the inner part of the structure stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer 2 , with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. In the same direction, we found that only compounds 1 and 2 , with no H-bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.","Soberats, Bartolome; Bujosa, Sergi; Greciano, Elisa E; Martínez, Manuel A; Sánchez, Luis",Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202102446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323342/,496

96350,Castration in the standing horse combining laparoscopic and conventional techniques.,2017,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious, and economically important viral disease of chickens. The S1 subunit from Spike (S) protein plays the major role in protective immunity and is involved in the host-virus interactions, as well as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) serotyping. Aim of the present study was multi-aspect analysis of the molecular and immunological features of 5' part belonging to the S1 glycoprotein sequence of Iranian 793/B IBV strain isolates. This might ideally help in characterization, prevention, and vaccine development. The tissue samples were prepared, followed by virus isolation, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In addition, sequencing and registration of the sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information were performed. Moreover, 12 sequences were retrieved from Fars province, Iran. The next steps included evaluation of conservation/variability along the sequences, phylogenetic analysis, estimation of the average evolutionary divergence over all the sequence pairs, predicting the phosphorylation/N-glycosylation/palmitoylation sites, and the final analysis of antigenicity. The findings of alignment, entropy plot, and pairwise similarity analysis revealed 17 hypervariable regions. The isolates belonging to Tehran were clustered in phylogenetic tree, and the most similar isolates to them were ADW11182 and ADW11183. Location of some of the N-glycosylation/phosphorylation/palmitoylation points indicated that these sites were conserved among the isolates. Furthermore, the frequency of epitopes and their scores reflect the high immunogenicity of S1 protein in 793/B serotype. Analysis of the primary and secondary structures demonstrated that their parameters had variable values and were different regarding the number and location of α-helix, β-strand, and coils. According to our findings, the Iranian isolates of 793/B serotype change their molecular characteristics during time and in different geographical regions. These alterations might account for failure in prevention programs and differences in virulence and pathogenicity.","Vasfi Marandi, M; Malekan, M; Ranjbar, M M; Dadashpour Davachi, N; Alamian, S",Archives of Razi Institute,https://doi.org/10.22092/ari.2018.120305.1192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30280838/,496

OBJECTIVE To determine whether telephone-based reality orientation therapy (T-ROT) can improve cognition, mood, and neuropsychiatric symptoms among patients with major neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) who are forced to isolate and also whether T-ROT can relieve the burden of distress among their caregivers. DESIGN Nonrandomized interventional comparison study. SETTING Individual telephone calls between practitioners and patients and their caregivers. PARTICIPANTS Twenty-seven patients (14 in the experimental group, 13 in the control group) with a major NCD and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION Ten T-ROT sessions and a pretest-posttest neuropsychological evaluation over 4 wk. OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes measured included cognitive and behavioral symptoms of patients with major NCDs and correlations between changes in patient clinical condition and caregiver stress. Primary outcome measures were two measures of depressive symptoms, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire and the Telephone Mini-Mental State Examination, administered at baseline and program discharge. RESULTS T-ROT significantly outperformed nontreatment on all measures of depression, behavior, cognition, and caregiver burden.

96462,Neonatal outcome of preterm delivery.,2010,"OBJECTIVE Anhedonia, disrupted reward processing, is a core symptom of major depressive disorder. Recent findings demonstrate altered reward-related ventral striatal reactivity in depressed individuals, but the extent to which this is specific to anhedonia remains poorly understood. The authors examined the effect of anhedonia on reward expectancy (expected outcome value) and prediction error- (discrepancy between expected and actual outcome) related ventral striatal reactivity, as well as the relationship between these measures. METHOD A total of 148 unmedicated individuals with major depressive disorder and 31 healthy comparison individuals recruited for the multisite EMBARC (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care) study underwent functional MRI during a well-validated reward task. Region of interest and whole-brain data were examined in the first- (N=78) and second- (N=70) recruited cohorts, as well as the total sample, of depressed individuals, and in healthy individuals. RESULTS Healthy, but not depressed, individuals showed a significant inverse relationship between reward expectancy and prediction error-related right ventral striatal reactivity. Across all participants, and in depressed individuals only, greater anhedonia severity was associated with a reduced reward expectancy-prediction error inverse relationship, even after controlling for other symptoms. CONCLUSIONS The normal reward expectancy and prediction error-related ventral striatal reactivity inverse relationship concords with conditioning models, predicting a shift in ventral striatal responding from reward outcomes to reward cues. This study shows, for the first time, an absence of this relationship in two cohorts of unmedicated depressed individuals and a moderation of this relationship by anhedonia, suggesting reduced reward-contingency learning with greater anhedonia. These findings help elucidate neural mechanisms of anhedonia, as a step toward identifying potential biosignatures of treatment response.","Greenberg, Tsafrir; Chase, Henry W; Almeida, Jorge R; Stiffler, Richelle; Zevallos, Carlos R; Aslam, Haris A; Deckersbach, Thilo; Weyandt, Sarah; Cooper, Crystal; Toups, Marisa; Carmody, Thomas; Kurian, Benji; Peltier, Scott; Adams, Phillip; McInnis, Melvin G; Oquendo, Maria A; McGrath, Patrick J; Fava, Maurizio; Weissman, Myrna; Parsey, Ramin; Trivedi, Madhukar H; Phillips, Mary L",The American journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14050594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26183698/,496

DAD is characterized by an acute phase with edema, hyaline membranes and inflammation followed by an organizing phase with pulmonary fibrosis and hyperplasia. The degree of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension is different in the pathological stages of DAD. The effects of pulmonary fibrosis and surface tension on alveolar sac mechanics in DAD are investigated by using the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) method. The human pulmonary alveolus is idealized by a three-dimensional honeycomb-like geometry, with alveolar geometries approximated as closely packed 14-sided polygons. A dynamic compression-relaxation model for surface tension effects is adopted. Compared to a healthy model, DAD models are created by increasing the tissue thickness and decreasing the concentration of the surfactant. The FSI results show that pulmonary fibrosis is more influential than the surface tension on flow rate, volume, P-V loop and resistance. The lungs of the disease models become stiffer than those of the healthy models. According to the P-V loop results, the surface tension plays a more important role in hysteresis than the material nonlinearity of the lung tissue. Our study demonstrates the differences in air flow and lung function on the alveolar sacs between the healthy and DAD models.","Chen, Long; Tao, Weiwei; Ji, Wei; Yan, Lu; Zhao, Xia",Journal of biomechanical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4050789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33817746/,496

However, its role as a causative agent of respiratory disease is not determined. METHODS We investigated the presence of HBoV by real-time polymerase-chain reaction of nasal swab specimens obtained from 228 healthy children followed in the community from birth to 1 year of age for a 2-year period from 2004 to 2006. Nasal swabs and symptom diaries were collected at monthly home visits. RESULTS HBoV was detected in 57 (8.2%) of 697 nasal swab specimens from children with ARTI, in 1 (2.3%) of 44 swabs from children with diarrhea, and in 13 (8.6%) of 152 swabs from asymptomatic children. HBoV was present mainly during the winter months. An additional respiratory virus was identified in 27 (47.4%) HBoV-positive samples. Thirty-four (68%) of 50 children with ARTI shed HBoV for less than 1 month, 13 (26%) for 2 months, 2 (4%) for 3 months, and 1 (2%) for 4 months. Seven asymptomatic children shed HBoV for less than 1 month, 2 children for 2 months, and 1 asymptomatic child had 5 HBoV-positive nasal swabs detected for 6 consecutive months. HBoV infection was associated with maternal smoking, being born in the winter, and predisposition to asthma. CONCLUSIONS Asymptomatic carriage of HBoV is common in infants <1 year of age, and an HBoV-positive test result does not imply that HBoV is the cause of the illness.","von Linstow, Marie-Louise; Høgh, Mette; Høgh, Birthe",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181757b16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18756188/,496

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) patients have a high IA incidence and risk of rupture. Dysfunction/absence of primary cilia in PKD endothelial cells (ECs) may impair mechano-transduction of WSS and favour vascular disorders. The molecular links between primary cilia dysfunction and IAs are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS Wild-type and primary cilia-deficient Tg737orpk/orpk arterial ECs were submitted to physiological (30 dynes/cm2) or aneurysmal (2 dynes/cm2) WSS and unbiased transcriptomics were performed. Tg737orpk/orpk ECs displayed a 5-fold increase in the number of WSS-responsive genes compared to wild-type cells. Moreover, we observed a lower trans-endothelial resistance and a higher endothelial permeability, which correlated with disorganized intercellular junctions in Tg737orpk/orpk cells. We identified ZO-1 as a central regulator of primary cilia-dependent endothelial junction integrity. Finally, clinical and histological characteristics of IAs from non-PKD and PKD patients were analysed. IAs in PKD patients were more frequently located in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory than in non-PKD patients. IA domes from the MCA of PKD patients appeared thinner with less collagen and reduced endothelial ZO-1 compared with IA domes from non-PKD patients. CONCLUSION Primary cilia dampen the endothelial response to aneurysmal low WSS. In absence of primary cilia, ZO-1 expression levels are reduced, which disorganizes intercellular junctions resulting in increased endothelial permeability. This altered endothelial function may not only contribute to the severity of IA disease observed in PKD patients, but may also serve as a potential diagnostic tool to determine the vulnerability of IAs.","Diagbouga, Mannekomba R; Morel, Sandrine; Cayron, Anne F; Haemmerli, Julien; Georges, Marc; Hierck, Beerend P; Allémann, E; Lemeille, Sylvain; Bijlenga, Philippe; Kwak, Brenda R",Cardiovascular research,https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvab165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974072/,496

Deletions removing the entire gene or enhancers and point mutations in the coding region represent a well-established cause of haploinsufficiency. During diagnostic genetic testing on ISS/LWD patients, in addition to classic SHOX defects, five 5'UTR variants (c.-58G > T, c.-55C > T, c.-51G > A, c.-19G > A, and c.-9del), were detected whose pathogenetic role was unclear and were thus classified as VUS (Variants of Uncertain Significance). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of these noncoding variations in SHOX haploinsufficiency. The variants were tested for their ability to interfere with correct gene expression of a regulated reporter gene (luciferase assay). The negative effect on the mRNA splicing predicted in silico for c.-19G > A was assayed in vitro through a minigene splicing assay. The luciferase assay showed that c.-51G > A, c.-19G > A, and c.-9del significantly reduce luciferase activity by 60, 35, and 40% at the homozygous state. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA showed that c.-51G > A and c.-9del might interfere with the correct SHOX expression mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The exon trapping assay demonstrated that c.-19G > A determines the creation of a new branch site causing an aberrant mRNA splicing. In conclusion, this study allowed us to reclassify two of the 5'UTR variants identified during SHOX diagnostic screening as likely pathogenic, one remains as a VUS, and two as likely benign variants. This analysis for the first time expands the spectrum of the genetic causes of SHOX haploinsufficiency to noncoding variations in the 5'UTR.","Babu, Deepak; Vannelli, Silvia; Fanelli, Antonella; Mellone, Simona; Baffico, Ave Maria; Corrado, Lucia; Essa, Wael Al; Grandone, Anna; Bellone, Simonetta; Monzani, Alice; Vinci, Giulia; De Sanctis, Luisa; Stuppia, Liborio; Prodam, Flavia; Giordano, Mara",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-020-0676-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647378/,496

OBJECTIVES The goal of this clinical trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of IN.PACT Amphirion drug-eluting balloons (IA-DEB) compared to PTA for infrapopliteal arterial revascularization in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). METHODS Within a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial with independent clinical event adjudication and angiographic and wound core laboratories 358 CLI patients were randomized 2:1 to IA-DEB or PTA. The 2 coprimary efficacy endpoints through 12 months were clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and late lumen loss (LLL). The primary safety endpoint through 6 months was a composite of all-cause mortality, major amputation, and CD-TLR. RESULTS Clinical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Significant baseline differences between the IA-DEB and PTA arms included mean lesion length (10.2 cm vs. 12.9 cm; p = 0.002), impaired inflow (40.7% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.035), and previous target limb revascularization (32.2% vs. 21.8%; p = 0.047). Primary efficacy results of IA-DEB versus PTA were CD-TLR of 9.2% versus 13.1% (p = 0.291) and LLL of 0.61 ± 0.78 mm versus 0.62 ± 0.78 mm (p = 0.950). Primary safety endpoints were 17.7% versus 15.8% (p = 0.021) and met the noninferiority hypothesis. A safety signal driven by major amputations through 12 months was observed in the IA-DEB arm versus the PTA arm (8.8% vs. 3.6%; p = 0.080). CONCLUSIONS In patients with CLI, IA-DEB had comparable efficacy to PTA. While primary safety was met, there was a trend towards an increased major amputation rate through 12 months compared to PTA.

Rethinking the Word 'Violence; in Obstetric Settings"" and concludes that naming violence is critical for describing people's experiences of such violence and for addressing the structures and contexts that create and fuel such violence, not for judgment but for accountability and change. Impact, outcome, and, at times, processes-rather than intention-should underpin applications of the term violence; naming violence does not disempower women, but rather naming structural, systemic, and institutional violence demands acknowledgment, accountability, and responsibility for its effects on both patients and clinicians; and, finally, while the unintended consequences of using such a term may present challenges, they do not outweigh the importance of naming structural violence in health-related systems to identify practices and processes that discriminate, disempower, harm, and oppress.","Salter, Cynthia L; Olaniyan, Abisola; Mendez, Dara D; Chang, Judy C",Violence against women,https://doi.org/10.1177/1077801221996443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33663282/,496

99237,Endotherapy in case of relapse of neoplastic Barrett's esophagus after successful initial endoscopic resection.,2017,"AIMS Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can optimize the efficacy of infliximab (IFX) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because of the delay between blood samples taken at trough and availability of results, dose adjustments can only be carried out at the next infusion, typically 8 weeks later. Dried blood samples (DBS) performed at home to measure IFX concentrations can reduce the time to adapt dose/dosing interval. Here, we aimed to validate the clinical application of DBS for IFX in IBD patients and to evaluate the feasibility of home sampling. METHODS DBS results from 40 IBD patients on IFX treatment were compared to serum sample results at trough, peak, and 3-5 weeks after IFX infusion. Subsequently, patients performed DBS home sampling one week before the next IFX infusion. These were compared to serum concentrations as predicted by Bayesian analysis. RESULTS IFX concentrations from finger prick and venous puncture correlate well. DBS IFX concentrations showed high correlation with serum IFX concentrations (Spearman correlation: ≥0.965), without bias. Passing-Bablok regression for IFX concentrations in DBS from home sampling also showed no bias (intercept: 1.02 mg L-1 (95% CI -1.77-2.04 mg L-1 ), slope: 0.82 (95% CI 0.63-1.40)), with reasonable correlation (Spearman correlation: 0.671). CONCLUSIONS Timely adjustment of IFX dose/dosing interval can be facilitated by IFX concentration measurement in home-sampled DBS. DBS is a reliable method to measure IFX and can be used to predict IFX trough concentrations.","Berends, Sophie E; D'Haens, Geert R A M; Schaap, Tiny; de Vries, Annick; Rispens, Theo; Bloem, Karien; Mathôt, Ron A A",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.13939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927375/,496
99650,Permacol™ collagen paste injection for the treatment of complex anal fistula: 1-year follow-up.,2017,"INTRODUCTION During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, international recommendations and guidelines regarding breastfeeding-supportive hospital practices changed frequently. For example, some recommended separation of mothers and infants; others, feeding pumped milk instead of milk fed directly from the breast. Many recommendations were inconsistent or in direct conflict with each other. Guidance from UENPS (the Union of European Neonatal and Perinatal Societies) published in April 2020 recommended rooming in and direct breastfeeding where feasible, under strict measures of infection control, for women who were COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19. KEY FINDINGS Our study assessed data from respondents from 124 hospitals in 22 nations, with over 1000 births per year, who completed a survey on practices during the COVID-19 epidemic, as they related to the World Health Organization (WHO) Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding, considered to be the gold standard for breastfeeding support. The survey was conducted in the fall of 2020/winter of 2021. Overall 88% of responding hospitals had managed COVID positive mothers, and 7% had treated over 50 birthing women with confirmed COVID-19. The biggest change to hospital policy related to visitation policies, with 38% of hospitals disallowing all visitors for birthing women, and 19% shortening the postpartum stay. Eight hospitals (6%) recommended formula feeding instead of breastfeeding for women who tested positive for COVID-19 or were under investigation, whereas 73% continued to recommend direct, exclusive breastfeeding, but with some form of protection such as a mask or hand sanitizer for the mother or cleaning the breast before the feed. While 6% of hospitals discontinued rooming in, 31% strengthened their rooming in policy (keeping mothers and their babies together in the same room) to protect infants against possible exposure to the virus elsewhere in the hospital . Overall, 72% of hospitals used their country's national guidelines when making policy, 31% used WHO guidelines and 22% UENPS/SIN guidelines. Many European hospitals relied on more than one accredited source. DISCUSSION Our most concerning finding was that 6% of hospitals recommended formula feeding for COVID positive mothers, a measure that was later shown to be potentially harmful, as protection against the virus is transmitted through human milk. It is encouraging to note that a third of hospitals strengthened rooming in measures. Especially given the emergence of the highly transmissible Delta variant, the situation around postnatal care in maternity hospitals requires ongoing monitoring and may require proactive investment to regain pre-COVID era practices.","Merewood, Anne; Davanzo, Riccardo; Haas-Kogan, Maetal; Vertecchi, Giulia; Gizzi, Camilla; Mosca, Fabio; Burnham, Laura; Moretti, Corrado","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1986482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645354/,496

With no population immunity or vaccine at hand, all but fifteen countries issued 'stay at home' orders in a bid to contain the spread of the virus and limit the healthcare burden. 'Lockdown' included closure of dental practices. Both the virus itself and the various Government responses have had a profound impact on the work, home and social lives of the entire population and are likely to impact the oral health of many people. These oral health effects can be attributed to those caused directly by the virus and those caused indirectly through the subsequent societal response. Direct effects of COVID-19 on oral health include ageusia (an official symptom of COVID-19) and case reports of vesiculobullous lesions and necrotising periodontal disease (Patel and Woolley 2020). The ageusia associated with COVID-19 is transient and reports of other oral manifestations are based on low-grade and disputed evidence.

This respiratory virus has different symptoms from moderate to severe, and results in lung pneumonia following acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and patient's death in severe cases. ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury that is caused by high inflammatory response of the innate immunity cells. Hypoxia is the common feature in the inflammatory sites with having various impacts on this condition by induction of some factors such as hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). HIF-1α regulates some important cellular processes including cell proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. Furthermore, this factor is activated during the immune responses and plays important roles in the inflammation site by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines production through immune cells. So, in this study the possible effect of the HIF-1α on the COVID-19 pathogenesis with emphasizes on its role on innate immunity response has been discussed.","Jahani, Mozhgan; Dokaneheifard, Sadat; Mansouri, Kamran",Journal of inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12950-020-00263-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292282/,496

Various physicochemical parameters can have an impact on the allergenicity of animal proteins. Following our previous review on how physicochemical parameters shape plant protein allergenicity, the same analysis was proceeded here for animal allergens. We found that each parameter can have variable effects, ranging on an axis from allergenicity enhancement to resolution, depending on its nature and the allergen. While glycosylation and phosphorylation are common, both are not universal traits of animal allergens. High molecular structures can favour allergenicity, but structural loss and uncovering hidden epitopes can also have a similar impact. We discovered that there are important knowledge gaps in regard to physicochemical parameters shaping protein allergenicity both from animal and plant origin, mainly because the comparability of the data is poor. Future biomolecular studies of exhaustive, standardised design together with strong validation part in the clinical context, together with data integration model systems will be needed to unravel causal relationships between physicochemical properties and the basis of protein allergenicity.","Costa, Joana; Villa, Caterina; Verhoeckx, Kitty; Cirkovic-Velickovic, Tanja; Schrama, Denise; Roncada, Paola; Rodrigues, Pedro M; Piras, Cristian; Martín-Pedraza, Laura; Monaci, Linda; Molina, Elena; Mazzucchelli, Gabriel; Mafra, Isabel; Lupi, Roberta; Lozano-Ojalvo, Daniel; Larré, Colette; Klueber, Julia; Gelencser, Eva; Bueno-Diaz, Cristina; Diaz-Perales, Araceli; Benedé, Sara; Bavaro, Simona Lucia; Kuehn, Annette; Hoffmann-Sommergruber, Karin; Holzhauser, Thomas",Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-020-08826-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411319/,496

DESIGN Cross-sectional study METHODS: We conducted a survey of clinician-scientists in ophthalmology at U.S. academic institutions between April 17, 2019 and May 19, 2019. We collected information including 1) demographic data, 2) amount, type, and source of startup funding, first extramural grant, and first R01-equivalent independent grant, 3) starting and current salaries, and 4) Likert-scale measures of career satisfaction were analyzed using multivariate regression. RESULTS 98 clinician-scientists in ophthalmology were surveyed across different ages (mean 48±11 years), research categories, institutional types, geographic regions, and academic ranks. Median startup funding was $50-99k, and median starting salary was $150-199k. Most investigators (67%) received their first extramural award from the National Eye Institute, mostly through K-award mechanisms (82%). The median time to receiving their first independent grant was 8 years, mostly through an R01 award (70%). Greater institutional startup support (P=0.027) and earlier extramural grant success (P=0.022) were associated with earlier independent funding. Male gender (P = 0.001) and MD degree (P=0.008) were associated with higher current salaries, but not starting salaries. Overall career satisfaction increased with career duration (P=0.011), but not with earlier independent funding (P=0.746) or higher income (P=0.300). CONCLUSIONS Success in research funding by clinician-scientists in ophthalmology may be linked to institutional support and earlier acquisition of extramural grants, but does not impact academic salaries. Nevertheless, career satisfaction among clinician-scientists improves with time, which is not necessarily influenced by research or financial success.","Rusakevich, Alexander M; Protopsaltis, Nicholas J; Rao, Rajesh C; Chao, Daniel L; Yiu, Glenn",American journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2021.03.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836182/,496

While treatment options are limited, stem cells may be a novel alternative. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) have become increasingly popular compared with bone marrow-derived stem cells as they are far easier to harvest. To summarize the current status of treating chronic ulcers with ADSC, this systematic review includes all clinical trials on the subject from PubMed and EmBase, as well as all registered clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.Gov. A total of nine clinical trials and fourteen registered trials were included. The studies were significantly different in terms of study design and patient population, and the overall quality of the studies was low to moderate. Despite the overall low study quality and the significant differences between the studies, some conclusions were consistent: ADSCs are safe, improve the healing of chronic ulcers, and reduce pain. As these results are consistent despite the shortcomings of the studies, they appear to highlight the efficacy of ADSCs in the treatment of chronic ulcers. Larger numbers of higher quality studies are needed to determine the precise role of ADSCs in treating chronic leg ulcers.","Holm, Jens Selch; Toyserkani, Navid Mohamadpour; Sorensen, Jens Ahm",Stem cell research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-018-0887-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29764508/,496

Snail Soothing and Repairing (SSR) cream, containing several glycoproteins with potential antimicrobial and antioxidant effects, may benefit skin hydration promotion after the laser treatment. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SSR cream in skin hydration promotion after AFCO2 resurfacing. METHOD The study was a double-blinded, split-face, placebo-controlled trial in participants aged 18-50 years with atrophic acne scars on both cheeks. After AFCO2 resurfacing, participants applied the product or placebo on either cheek twice daily for 14 days. Corneometry, TEWL, colorimetry, and clinical assessments (edema, erythema, crusting, pruritus, and tightness score) were evaluated at baseline, day 7, and day 14 after AFCO2 resurfacing. RESULTS From 22 participants in the study, the SSR cream-treated sides showed significantly higher corneometry levels than placebo-treated sides at day 14 (p = 0.033), while TEWL and colorimetry levels were not different at any study visits. Pruritus and tightness scores of the SSR side were lower, but not significant, than the placebo. Other clinical assessments (edema, erythema, and crusting) showed similar results. No significant adverse events took place. CONCLUSION The SSR cream significantly improved skin hydration, highlighting skin barrier restoration after AFCO2 resurfacing, with a good safety profile.","Theerawattanawit, Chinathip; Promvaranon, Tiwanun; Rerknimitr, Pawinee; Asawanonda, Pravit; Noppakun, Nopadon; Kumtornrut, Chanat",Skin pharmacology and physiology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000515965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038904/,496

Reference lists of articles were reviewed to identify additional articles. RESULTS There is growing concern around an increase in alcohol intake and alcohol-related harms. These concerns are related to the impact of excessive alcohol consumption in a person with COVID-19 and/or with alcohol use disorder, as well as with a potential increase in the prevalence of harmful drinking, alcohol use disorder, withdrawal symptoms, intimate partner violence, harm to children, suicide, mental health problems and non-communicable diseases. The need for assessing alcohol use and providing adequate advice during the pandemic have been highlighted.

METHODS A low-fidelity fetoscopic box trainer was developed for surgical simulation of myelomeningocele repair. Participants with varying surgical experience were recruited and completed three essential tasks (cutting skin, dural patch placement, and suturing skin) using both 2D and 3D endoscopic visualization. Participants were randomized to begin all tasks in either 2D or 3D. Time to completion was measured for each task, and each participant subsequently completed the NASA Load Index test and a questionnaire evaluating their experience. RESULTS Sixteen participants completed the study tasks using both 2D and 3D endoscopes in the simulator. While the mean performance time across all tasks was shorter with 3D versus 2D endoscopy (cutting skin, 47 vs. 54 seconds; dural patch placement, 38 vs. 52 seconds; and suturing skin, 424 vs. 499 seconds), the results did not reach statistical significance. When comparing times to completion of each of the three tasks between levels of expertise, participants in the expert category were faster when suturing skin on the 2D modality (P = 0.047). Under 3D visualization, experts were faster at cutting the skin (P = 0.008). When comparing experiences using the NASA-TLX test, participants felt that their performance was better using 3D over the 2D system (P = 0.045). Overall, 13 of 16 (81.3%) participants preferred 3D over 2D visualization. CONCLUSIONS Three-dimensional endoscopes could potentially be used in the near future for relative improvement in visualization and possibly performance during complex fetoscopic procedures such as prenatal repair of myelomeningocele defects. Further studies utilizing 3D scopes for other related procedures may potentially support clinical implementation of this technology in fetal surgery and also prove to be a useful tool in surgical training.","Patel, Smruti K; Kashyrina, Oleksandra; Duru, Soner; Miyabe, Marcos; Lim, Foong-Yen; Peiro, Jose L; Stevenson, Charles B",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-020-04999-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392653/,496

Objective. Minimally invasive spine surgery includes the treatment of intradural lesions, and proper closure of the dura is necessary. However, primary dural closure can be difficult due to the restricted space of MIS retractors and the availability of appropriate surgical instrumentation. Methods. We describe the use of a needle already used in the pediatric neurosurgical arena that can facilitate easier and safer closure of spinal dura through MISS retractors in two illustrative intradural cases. Results and Discussion. The primary dural closure technique is described and patient demographics are included. The instruments specifically used for the intradural closure through MIS retractor systems include (1) 4-0 Surgilon braided nylon (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) with a CV-20 taper 1/2 circle, 10 mm diameter needle; (2) Scanlan (Saint Paul, MN, USA) dura closure set.

This study was designed to assess the degree of gastric emptying shortly after LVR within an ERAS protocol. METHODS From August 2012 to June 2014, 40 patients diagnosed with external or internal rectal prolapse were recruited. All patients underwent LVR within an ERAS protocol. Carbohydrate solution (CS) was administered before and 5 h after surgery on the same day. The pyloric area (PA) was measured using ultrasonography before and after each CS intake. RESULTS The PA was measured in 34 patients. The PA measured prior to CS intake, before surgery, was not significantly different from that after surgery. The rate of increase in the PA, which was calculated by the PA measured 1 h after CS intake divided by the PA measured prior to CS intake before surgery, was not significantly different from that after surgery. The postoperative hospital stay was 1 (1-2) day, and 36 patients (90 %) were discharged on the first postoperative afternoon.

METHODS We searched Medline and the Cochrane Library for RCTs assessing PtDAs in people with Type 2 diabetes. PtDAs were defined as tools designed to help people engage in decision-making about healthcare options, such as making treatment choices or setting therapeutic goals. The study selection process was facilitated by an automated screening tool to identify RCTs. We classified outcomes into seven domains and conducted meta-analyses using random effects models. RESULTS We included a total of 15 studies, nine of which were cluster RCTs, that evaluated 10 PtDAs. Thirteen trials compared a PtDA with usual care or usual care plus educational material, whereas two RCTs compared individually tailored vs. non-tailored PtDAs. Meta-analyses showed a favourable effect of PtDAs compared with usual care in reducing decisional conflict [weighted mean difference (WMD) -4.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.93 to -1.39] and in improving knowledge (WMD 20.46, 95% CI 9.13 to 3.77). Use of PtDAs resulted in more active involvement in decision-making during the consultation, although no effect was evident in terms of glycaemic control or self-reported medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS PtDAs for people with Type 2 diabetes can improve the quality of decision-making and increase knowledge transfer. Interpretation of our findings is attenuated due to limitations related to the rapid review approach, including searching only two databases and performing data extraction and risk of bias assessment by a single reviewer.","Karagiannis, T; Andreadis, P; Manolopoulos, A; Malandris, K; Avgerinos, I; Karagianni, A; Tsapas, A",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.13939; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30791131/,496

We herein report an elderly patient with CKD who suffered bradycardia shock after the combined use of carteolol eye drops and verapamil for glaucoma and paroxysmal AF. This case highlights the fact that eye drops have a similar systemic effect to oral drugs, and especially in elderly patients with polypharmacy, drug interactions can unwittingly lead to serious events.","Arai, Riku; Fukamachi, Daisuke; Monden, Masaki; Akutsu, Naotaka; Murata, Nobuhiro; Okumura, Yasuo",Internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.5598-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830185/,496
102218,Hypoglycemia After Gastric Bypass Surgery: Current Concepts and Controversies.,2018,"INTRODUCTION During the state of alarm established in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the face-to-face outpatient consultations were cancelled and a telephone consultation was established to follow up coloproctological patients. The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. RESULTS From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. CONCLUSION In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this.","Muñoz-Duyos, Arantxa; Abarca-Alvarado, Natalia; Lagares-Tena, Laura; Sobrerroca, Laura; Costa, Daniel; Boada, Mercè; Ureña, Dolors; Delgado-Rivilla, Salvadora",Cirugia espanola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2020.06.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32811680/,496

Positive clinical specimens came mostly from patients with acute symptomatic infection, and among these LamPORE had a diagnostic sensitivity of 99.1% (226/228 [95% CI 96.9-99.9%]). Among negative clinical specimens, including 153 with other respiratory pathogens detected, LamPORE had a diagnostic specificity of 99.6% (278/279 [98.0-100.0%]). Overall, 1.4% (7/514 [0.5-2.9%]) of samples produced an indeterminate result on first testing, and repeat LamPORE testing on the same RNA extract had a reproducibility of 96.8% (478/494 [94.8-98.1%]).Interpretation LamPORE has a similar performance to RT-PCR for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, and offers a promising approach to high-throughput testing.","Peto, Leon; Rodger, Gillian; Carter, Daniel P; Osman, Karen L; Yavuz, Mehmet; Johnson, Katie; Raza, Mohammad; Parker, Matthew D; Wyles, Matthew D; Andersson, Monique; Justice, Anita; Vaughan, Alison; Hoosdally, Sarah; Stoesser, Nicole; Matthews, Philippa C; Eyre, David W; Peto, Timothy E A; Carroll, Miles W; de Silva, Thushan I; Crook, Derrick W; Evans, Cariad M; Pullan, Steven T",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.03271-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782112/,496

103138,Pure Laparoscopic Liver Resection for Malignant Liver Tumor: Anatomic Resection Versus Nonanatomic Resection.,2016,"Purpose Pediatric acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for 10% of pediatric acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) case and is accompanied by a tendency to hemorrhage. miR-188-5p plays an important role in adult AML. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effects of miR-188-5p on cell proliferation and apoptosis and tumor growth, and its mechanism in pediatric APL patients. Materials and Methods Survival-associated miRNAs or mRNAs from TCGA database associated with AML were identified via using the ""survival R"" package in R language. CCK8, clone formation, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays were used to detect the viability, proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and related gene expression in APL cell lines. The prognostic value of miR-188-5p was evaluated using a ROC curve. The tumorigenic ability of APL cell lines was determined using a nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment. Tumor cell apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay in vivo. The target genes of miR-188-5p were predicted using the miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan databases. A PPI network was constructed using STRING database and the hub gene was identified using the MCODE plug-in of the Cytoscape software. The DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. A luciferase reporter assay was used to demonstrate the binding of miR-188-5p to CD2AP. Results miR-188-5p overexpression or CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) inhibition was significantly associated with poor survival in pediatric APL patients. Upregulation of miR-188-5p was identified in the blood of pediatric APL patients and cell lines. Increased expression of miR-188-5p also promoted the viability, proliferation, and cell cycle progression, and reduced the apoptosis of APL cells. Additionally, upregulation of miR-188-5p regulated the expressions of cyclinD1, p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of miR-188-5p was 0.661. miR-188-5p overexpression increased the tumorigenic ability of APL and Ki67 expression, and reduced cell apoptosis in vivo. CD2AP was identified as the only overlapping gene from the list of miR-188-5p target genes and survival-related mRNAs of the TCGA database. It was mainly enriched in the ""biological process (BP)"" and ""cellular component (CC)"" terms, and was downregulated in the blood of pediatric APL patients and cell lines. The luciferase reporter, RT-PCR, and Western blot assays demonstrated that the binding of miR-188-5p to CD2AP. CD2AP inhibition promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of APL cells. Rescue experiments showed that inhibition of miR-188-5p inhibited cell proliferation, activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, induced G0/G1 phase arrest, regulated gene expression, and promoted cell apoptosis, which were reversed by CD2AP inhibition. Conclusion miR-188-5p, an oncogene, promoted tumor growth and progression of pediatric APL in vitro and in vivo via targeting CD2AP and activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.","Wang, Dao; Chen, Jiao; Ding, Yanjie; Kong, Huimin; You, Hongliang; Zhao, Yanting; Wei, Huixia; Liu, Yufeng",OncoTargets and therapy,https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s244813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764959/,496
103411,Slow versus fast rewarming after hypothermic circulatory arrest: effects on neuroinflammation and cerebral oedema.,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is commonly used to treat Barrett's esophagus (BE). We assessed the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) after RFA, factors associated with the development of EAC, and EAC-specific and all-cause mortality. METHODS We collected data for outcomes of patients who underwent RFA for BE from July 2007 through July 2011 from US multicenter RFA Patient Registry. Patients were followed until July 2014. Kaplan-Meier curves of EAC incidence were stratified by baseline histology. Crude EAC incidence and mortality (all-cause and EAC-specific) were calculated, and adjusted all-cause mortality was assessed. Logistic regression models were constructed to assess predictors of EAC and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Among 4982 patients, 100 (2%) developed EAC (7.8/1000 person-years [PY]) and 9 patients (0.2%) died of EAC (0.7/1000 PY) in a mean 2.7 ± 1.6 years. The incidence of EAC in nondysplastic BE was 0.5/1000 PY. Overall, 157 patients (3%) died during follow-up (all-cause mortality, 11.2/1000 PY). On multivariate logistic regression, baseline BE length (odds ratio, 1.1/ cm) and baseline histology (odds ratios, 5.8 and 50.3 for low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia [HGD] respectively) predicted EAC incidence. Among 9 EAC deaths, 6 (67%) had baseline HGD, and 3 (33%) had baseline intramucosal EAC. The most common causes of death were cardiovascular (15%) and extraesophageal cancers (15%). No deaths were associated with RFA. CONCLUSIONS Based on analysis of a multicenter registry of patients who underwent RFA of BE, less than 1% died from EAC. The incidence of EAC was markedly lower in this study than in other studies of disease progression, with the greatest absolute benefit observed in patients with HGD.","Wolf, W Asher; Pasricha, Sarina; Cotton, Cary; Li, Nan; Triadafilopoulos, George; Muthusamy, V Raman; Chmielewski, Gary W; Corbett, F Scott; Camara, Daniel S; Lightdale, Charles J; Wolfsen, Herbert; Chang, Kenneth J; Overholt, Bergein F; Pruitt, Ron E; Ertan, Atilla; Komanduri, Srinadh; Infantolino, Anthony; Rothstein, Richard I; Shaheen, Nicholas J",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2015.08.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26327132/,496

METHODS Prospective study of 890 ambulatory older persons without dementia who underwent annual clinical evaluations to examine change in the rate of mobility over time. RESULTS In a linear mixed-effect model adjusted for age, sex, and education, mobility declined about 0.12 unit/year, and higher levels of respiratory muscle strength were associated with a slower rate of mobility decline (estimate 0.043, SE 0.012, p < 0.001). Respiratory muscle strength remained associated with the rate of change in mobility even after controlling for lower extremity strength (estimate 0.036, SE 0.012, p = 0.004). In a model that included terms for respiratory muscle strength, lower extremity strength and physical activity together, all three were independent predictors of mobility decline in older persons. These associations remained significant even after controlling for body composition, global cognition, the development of dementia, parkinsonian signs, possible pulmonary disease, smoking, joint pain and chronic diseases. CONCLUSION Respiratory muscle strength is associated with mobility decline in older persons independent of lower extremity strength and physical activity. Clinical interventions to improve respiratory muscle strength may decrease the burden of mobility impairment in the elderly.","Buchman, A S; Boyle, P A; Wilson, R S; Leurgans, S; Shah, R C; Bennett, D A",Neuroepidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000154930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18784416/,496

104565,First prize: Standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy versus laparoendoscopic single-site donor nephrectomy: a randomized comparative study.,2011,"BACKGROUND Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy is a safe model for exploration of the peritoneum. Endoscopic insufflation of the peritoneal cavity has not been validated in humans. We report here our experience with pneumoperitoneum established endoscopically with a laparoscopic insufflator. DESIGN Pneumoperitoneum was established with a laparoscopic insufflator through the biopsy channel of the gastroscope. Intra-abdominal pressure was measured with a transfascial Veress needle and compared with endoscopic values. The gastrotomy was used in the creation of the gastric pouch. PATIENTS Twenty patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participated in the study. Ten had undergone no previous surgery, whereas the other 10 patients had a history of abdominal procedures. INTERVENTIONS Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy was performed through a gastrotomy created endoscopically without laparoscopic visualization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS Diagnostic findings, operating times, and clinical course were recorded. RESULTS The average time for transgastric access was 9.6 minutes. This did not vary in patients with previous surgery (P = .3). Endoscopic insufflation was successful in all patients. The mean endoscopic and laparoscopic pressures were 9.80 and 9.75 mm Hg, respectively (P = .9). In no patients were there limitations to visualization of the abdomen. Adhesions were noted in 80% and 10% of patients with and without a history of surgery, respectively (P = .005). There were no complications related to transgastric passage of the endoscope or exploration of the peritoneal cavity. CONCLUSIONS Although limited by the small sample size in this study, we believe that transgastric access may be considered as an alternative approach to peritoneal insufflation and provides a safe alternative for exploration of the abdomen. Endoscopic insufflation through the biopsy channel by using a laparoscopic insufflator seems to be an effective and safe method for establishing pneumoperitoneum.","Nau, Peter; Anderson, Joel; Needleman, Bradley; Ellison, E Christopher; Melvin, W Scott; Hazey, Jeffrey W",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2009.09.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20003968/,496

STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Orthodontics, Altamash Institute of Dental Medicine (AIDM) Karachi, Pakistan, from October 2019 to March 2020. Methodology: The study was carried out with the final year undergraduate dental students in the subject of orthodontics, selected by using non-probability sampling method. Selected students were given an introductory lecture on PAL approach at the start of the study. Two PAL sessions were conducted in smaller groups with all students utilised as an adjunct to traditional large group lectures; and at the end assessment was conducted comprising of multiple choice questions (MCQ). For the consecutive four weeks, same students went through traditional EAL, followed by similar type of assessment. Their test scores were compared for significance, set at p <0.05. RESULTS A total of six sessions were conducted, two faculty members (professors of orthodontics) conducted two sessions each, and subsequent two sessions were conducted by employing PAL approach by students (earlier trained by the faculty). The mean differences in the scores of students was compared between faculty teaching and PAL-related teaching. It was observed that the EAL group significantly performed better than PAL group (p<0.05). CONCLUSION In terms of test scores, academic performance and overall learning in PAL sessions was not higher than EAL group. Nonetheless, PAL can be utilised as an important supplement to synchronous teaching tele-presence by faculty as being practised during current pandemic situation in many medical and dental institutes.

We examine variations by age, gender, socioeconomic status and country of birth. Methods: Youth within the municipality of Bergen were invited via SMS to participate in a 15-minute online survey. A total of 2997 (40%) youths participated. The mean age was 17 years (standard deviation 1.7). Results: Overall, 28% reported feeling somewhat to a lot impacted by schools closing, 63% reported learning less. In total, 62% reported improvement of everyday life. The youth's situation in their family was worse for 13%. Regarding sleep problems, 19% reported difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, 12% had more nightmares, while 90% reported later bedtime and rise time. Seven per cent worried about getting infected, while 53% worried about infection among family members. A total of 19% worried that the outbreak would lead to a more difficult future, and 32%worried that friends were facing a difficult situation at home. Perceived consequences and worries related to the lockdown varied across sociodemographic groups. Conclusions: The perceived consequences and degree of worries varied by age, gender, socioeconomic status and to a certain degree country of birth. Girls, older youth, youth with lower socioeconomic status and with a migrant background from developing countries seemed to experience the lockdown as more difficult, and thereby possibly accentuating the need for services in these groups.","Lehmann, Stine; Skogen, Jens Christoffer; Haug, Ellen; Mæland, Silje; Fadnes, Lars Thore; Sandal, Gro Mjeldheim; Hysing, Mari; Bjørknes, Ragnhild",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494821993714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33645323/,496

To mitigate the issue, it seems necessary to start integrating modern-day technologies into the everyday practice of physicians and to benefit from the opportunities it provides. Much of medical decision making is cognitive, and telemedicine can provide easy access to specialists who are not immediately available. With wide internet access, this task is more than feasible.

106201,Comparison study of classification methods of intramuscular electromyography data for non-human primate model of traumatic spinal cord injury.,2020-07-01,"Neonatal seizures are commonly associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Phenobarbital (PB) resistance is common and poses a serious challenge in clinical management. Using a newly characterized neonatal mouse model of ischemic seizures, this study investigated a novel strategy for rescuing PB resistance. A small-molecule TrkB antagonist, ANA12, used to selectively and transiently block post-ischemic BDNF-TrkB signaling in vivo, determined whether rescuing TrkB-mediated post-ischemic degradation of the K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter (KCC2) rescued PB-resistant seizures. The anti-seizure efficacy of ANA12 + PB was quantified by (i) electrographic seizure burden using acute continuous video-electroencephalograms and (ii) post-treatment expression levels of KCC2 and NKCC1 using Western blot analysis in postnatal day (P)7 and P10 CD1 pups with unilateral carotid ligation. ANA12 significantly rescued PB-resistant seizures at P7 and improved PB efficacy at P10. A single dose of ANA12 + PB prevented the post-ischemic degradation of KCC2 for up to 24 h. As anticipated, ANA12 by itself had no anti-seizure properties and was unable to prevent KCC2 degradation at 24 h without follow-on PB. This indicates that unsubdued seizures can independently lead to KCC2 degradation via non-TrkB-dependent pathways. This study, for the first time as a proof-of-concept, reports the potential therapeutic value of KCC2 modulation for the management of PB-resistant seizures in neonates. Future investigations are required to establish the mechanistic link between ANA12 and the prevention of KCC2 degradation.","Kang, S K; Johnston, M V; Kadam, S D",The European journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.13094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26452067/,496

Furthermore, regional cerebral oxygenation saturation (rcSO2) decreases were obtained during spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. The aim of this prospective observational study is to compare the effects of spinal anesthesia on rcSO2 in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnant women. Preeclamptic (Group P, n = 24) and normotensive (Group N, n = 25) women with gestational week 32 and above, and scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were included in this study. In addition to routine monitoring, rcSO2 values obtained with right and left frontal cerebral sensors (rcSO2right and rcSO2left) were recorded before (baseline) spinal injection and during the surgery. The baseline rcSO2 values were similar in both groups. In Group P, rcSO2left values were higher than Group N only 3 and 5 min after spinal injection. In Group N, rcSO2 values decreased from baseline 1, 3, 5, and 10 min after spinal injection. In Group P, rcSO2 values decreased from baseline 1, 3, 5, 10, 30 and 35 min after spinal injection and at the end of the operation. There was no difference between the number of declines and the patients with rScO2 below the cerebral hypoxic threshold. There was a positive correlation between rcSO2 and blood pressure only 5 min after spinal injection, but no correlation with peripheral oxygen saturation was detected during the operation. There is decrease in rcSO2 values after spinal anesthesia correlating with hypotension in preeclamptic women. However, the decrease is less than that of normotensive pregnant women, especially the first 5 min after spinal injection when the blood pressure is lowest. The clinical impact of these results and the relationship between cerebral desaturation and neurological complications remain to be determined.","Karademir, Ali; Erdogan Kayhan, Gulay",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-018-00237-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30603823/,496

Additional single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) not only permits image fusion but also attenuation correction (AC) of SPECT data. This study evaluated whether attenuation corrected SPECT-images (SPECT[AC]) are more sensitive than nonattenuation corrected SPECT-reconstructions (SPECT[NAC]) for the detection of NET lesions. METHODS The imaging data (planar In-111-octreotide scintigraphy and SPECT-CT) of 50 consecutive patients (28 male; 22 female; age, 34-80; mean, 65 years) with NET were included in this retrospective analysis. SPECT data were reconstructed with and without integrated CT-based AC and then analyzed by 2 experienced readers for the presence of pathologic uptake in a blinded consensus reading. Fused SPECT-CT, contemporary CT/MRI, and clinical as well as imaging follow-up served as a reference standard. All foci were rated in both the SPECT(NAC)- and SPECT(AC)-reconstructions for intensity and contrast using a 6-point-score (""0 = no uptake/no delineation from surrounding tissue"" to ""5 = very high uptake/very strong delineation from surrounding tissue""). The scores were analyzed in a 6 x 6 contingency table using the McNemar Bowker test. RESULTS A total of 222 pathologic foci were detected by SPECT(NAC) and 227 foci by SPECT(AC), respectively. In 67 of 227 foci (29.5%), focus intensity/contrast increased after AC, whereas only 5 foci showed a decrease (P < 0.001). Sensitivity increased by 2.2% (P = 0.025; 95% CI: 0.02%-4.1%) as 5 foci were detected only by SPECT(AC). However, as these 3 patients were already diagnosed with systemic disease, there was no influence on the therapeutic strategy chosen. CONCLUSION Attenuation correction of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy-SPECT significantly improves focus visualization and, albeit slightly, also significantly increases sensitivity.","Steffen, Ingo G; Mehl, Sebastian; Heuck, Friederike; Elgeti, Florian; Furth, Christian; Amthauer, Holger; Ruf, Juri",Clinical nuclear medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/rlu.0b013e3181becfcb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20139819/,496

Patients experience a plethora of symptoms that can be attributed to the nerve fiber tracts that are compromised. This includes limb weakness, sensory impairment, and truncal instability, as well as a variety of autonomic abnormalities. This article will discuss how machine learning classification can be used to characterize the initial impairment and subsequent recovery of electromyography signals in an non-human primate model of traumatic spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective is to identify potential treatments for traumatic spinal cord injury. This work focuses specifically on finding a suitable classifier that differentiates between two distinct experimental stages (pre-and post-lesion) using electromyography signals. Eight time-domain features were extracted from the collected electromyography data. To overcome the imbalanced dataset issue, synthetic minority oversampling technique was applied. Different ML classification techniques were applied including multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, and radial basis function network; then their performances were compared. A confusion matrix and five other statistical metrics (sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and F-measure) were used to evaluate the performance of the generated classifiers. The results showed that the best classifier for the left- and right-side data is the multilayer perceptron with a total F-measure of 79.5% and 86.0% for the left and right sides, respectively. This work will help to build a reliable classifier that can differentiate between these two phases by utilizing some extracted time-domain electromyography features.","Masood, Farah; Farzana, Maisha; Nesathurai, Shanker; Abdullah, Hussein A","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Design Prospective randomized study. Setting University Hospital. Patients 50 patients age ≤18 years, undergoing lung or esophageal surgery requiring OLV. Interventions Patients randomized to two groups (group-35F, group -DLT based on height). Measurements and Main Results Data collected include demographics, ASA status, airway assessment, number of intubation attempts, Cormack-Lehane grade, number of times DLT repositioned, incidence of sore throat, oxygen saturation at induction and oxygen saturation at 5 minutes and 10 minutes after OLV. There was no statistically significant difference in demographics, ASA classification, Mallampati score, number of intubation attempts, Cormack-Lehane grade, number of times DLT was repositioned, and incidence of sore throat. In height based DLT group the odds were higher for the incidence of sore throat in 37-41 F group. Oxygen saturation at induction, 5 minutes and 10 minutes after OLV are not statistically significant between the two groups. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the majority of patients receive unnecessarily large DLTs for thoracic surgery, which not only makes intubation inherently more difficult but also increases their risk of postoperative sore throat.","Nguyen, Raisa D; Kurnutala, Lakshmi N; Tucci, Michelle A; Hierlmeier, Bryan J",Annals of cardiac anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.4103/aca.aca_93_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938830/,496

The terahertz (THz) optical and magneto-optical properties of La:YIG film were demonstrated by THz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The results show that a high refractive index of approximately 4.09 and a low absorption coefficient of 10-50 cm-1 from 0.1 to 1.6 THz for this La:YIG film. Moreover, the THz Faraday rotation effect of La:YIG film was measured by the orthogonal polarization detection method in THz-TDS system, which can be actively manipulated by a weak longitudinal magnetic field of up to 0.155 T. With 5 samples stacked together, the Faraday rotation angle varies linearly from -15° to 15°, and the Verdet constant of La:YIG is about 100 °/mm/T within the saturation magnetization. This magneto-optical single crystal thick film with large area shows low loss, high permittivity and strong magneto-optical effect in the THz regime, which will be widely used in magneto-optical polarization conversion, nonreciprocal phase shifter and isolator for THz waves.","Li, Yi-Lei; Li, Teng-Fei; Wen, Qi-Ye; Fan, Fei; Yang, Qing-Hui; Chang, Sheng-Jiang",Optics express,https://doi.org/10.1364/oe.395668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680153/,496

107706,Unilateral pulmonary oedema after minimally invasive mitral valve surgery: a single-centre experience.,2018,"Introduction Repair of supra-pubic incisional hernia is still challenging because of the highest pressure at the lower abdominal wall in the erect position. Recently, laparoscopic preperitoneal mesh repair has been gradually reported. Case presentation A 77-year-old woman underwent single-incision laparoscopic preperitoneal mesh repair under a diagnosis of a supra-pubic incisional hernia, measuring 7 × 4 cm. A single, 2.5-cm, intraumbilical incision was made, followed by creation of the preperitoneal space. Then, the posterior rectus sheath and peritoneum were opened, and laparoscopic exploration was performed. After dissection of the supra-pubic hernia content, the tube for degassing the abdominal cavity was inserted into the abdominal cavity, and the peritoneum and the posterior sheath were closed. The preperitoneal space was dissected gradually, and circular dissection of the hernia sac was performed. The proximal sac (peritoneum) was sutured continuously. A 15 × 10 cm mesh was placed in the preperitoneal space and fixed securely with absorbable tacks at the pubic bone, Cooper's ligament, and the rectus abdominis muscle, respectively. After degassing the preperitoneal space, a second laparoscopic exploration was performed to confirm the secure suture of the peritoneum and no injury of the abdominal organs. At 4-month follow-up, the patient remained well with no signs of recurrence. Discussion Single-incision laparoscopic preperitoneal mesh repair could minimize the recurrence of supra-umbilical incisional hernia and perioperative complications. Conclusion Single-incision laparoscopic preperitoneal mesh repair, offering good cosmetic results, might be useful for repair of supra-pubic incisional hernia.","Wakasugi, Masaki; Nakahara, Yujiro; Hirota, Masaki; Matsumoto, Takashi; Kusu, Takashi; Takemoto, Hiroyoshi; Takachi, Ko; Oshima, Satoshi",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2018.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30224949/,496
107718,Comparison between transumbilical and transvaginal morcellation of a large uterus during single-port-access total laparoscopic hysterectomy.,2020-05-01,"PURPOSE Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are widely used therapies for the treatment of intrahepatic metastases; however, direct comparisons are lacking. We sought to compare outcomes for these 2 modalities. METHODS AND MATERIALS From 2000 to 2015, 161 patients with 282 pathologically diagnosed unresectable liver metastases were treated with RFA (n = 112) or SBRT (n = 170) at a single institution. The primary outcome was freedom from local progression (FFLP). The effect of treatment and covariates on FFLP was modeled using a mixed-effects Cox model with application of inverse probability treatment weighting to adjust for potential imbalances in treatment modality. RESULTS The median follow-up period was 24.6 months. Patients receiving SBRT had larger tumors than those treated with RFA (median, 2.7 cm vs 1.8 cm; P < .01). On univariate analysis, tumor size was associated with worse FFLP for RFA (hazard ratio [HR]; 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.14; P < .01) but not for SBRT (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.76-2.51; P = .3). The 2-year FFLP rate was 88.2% compared with 73.9%, favoring SBRT (P = .06). For tumors ≥2 cm in diameter, SBRT was associated with improved FFLP (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.09-0.93; P < .01). On multivariate analysis, treatment with SBRT (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.07-0.62; P = .005) and smaller tumor size (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91; P = .01) were associated with improved FFLP. The 2-year overall survival rate was 51.1%, with no difference between groups (P = .8). Grade ≥3 treatment-related toxicity was rare, with no difference between SBRT (n = 4) and RFA (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS Treatment with SBRT or RFA is well tolerated and provides excellent and similar local control for intrahepatic metastases <2 cm in size. For tumors ≥2 cm in size, treatment with SBRT is associated with improved FFLP and may be the preferable treatment.","Jackson, William C; Tao, Yebin; Mendiratta-Lala, Mishal; Bazzi, Latifa; Wahl, Dan R; Schipper, Matthew J; Feng, Mary; Cuneo, Kyle C; Lawrence, Theodore S; Owen, Dawn","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.12.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485074/,496

AIM To compare the diagnostic values of biomarkers or clinical prediction rules for urinary tract infections in children presenting to ambulatory care. DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review and meta-analysis of ambulatory care studies. METHODS Medline, Embase, WOS, CINAHL, Cochrane library, HTA and DARE were searched until 21 May 2021. We included diagnostic studies on urine or blood biomarkers for cystitis or pyelonephritis in children below 18 years of age. We calculated sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios. Data were pooled using a bivariate random effects model and a Hierarchical Summary Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. RESULTS Seventy-five moderate to high quality studies were included in this review and 54 articles in the meta-analyses. The area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve to diagnose cystitis was 0.75 (95%CI 0.62 to 0.83, n = 9) for C-reactive protein, 0.71 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.80, n = 4) for procalcitonin, 0.93 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.96, n = 22) for the dipstick test (nitrite or leukocyte esterase ≥trace), 0.94 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.98, n = 9) for urine white blood cells and 0.98 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.99, n = 12) for Gram-stained bacteria. For pyelonephritis, C-reactive protein < 20 mg/l had LR- of 0.10 (95%CI 0.04-0.30) to 0.22 (95%CI 0.09-0.54) in children with signs suggestive of urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS Clinical prediction rules including the dipstick test biomarkers can support family physicians while awaiting urine culture results.

108567,Qualitative Assessment of Arts-Integrated Education for Physician Assistant Students.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND For the last few years, English general practices - which are, traditionally, small - have been encouraged to serve larger populations of registered patients by merging or collaborating with each other. Meanwhile, patient surveys have suggested that continuity of care and access to care are worsening. AIM To explore whether increasing the size of the practice population and working collaboratively are linked to changes in continuity of care or access to care. DESIGN AND SETTING This observational study in English general practice used data on patient experience, practice size, and collaborative working. Data were drawn from the English GP Patient Survey, NHS Digital, and from a previous study. METHOD The main outcome measures were the proportions of patients at practice level reporting positive experiences of both access and relationship continuity of care in the GP Patient Survey. Changes in proportions between 2013 and 2018 among practices that had grown and those that had, roughly, stayed the same size were compared, as were patients' experiences, categorised by whether or not practices were working in close collaborations in 2018. RESULTS Practices that had grown in population size had a greater fall in continuity of care (by 6.6%, 95% confidence interval = 4.3% to 8.9%), than practices that had roughly stayed the same size, after controlling for other factors. Differences in falls in access to care were smaller (4.3% difference for being able to get through easily on the telephone; 1.5% for being able to get an appointment; 0.9% in satisfaction with opening hours), but were statistically significant. Practices collaborating closely with others had marginally worse continuity of care than those not working in collaboration, and no differences in access. CONCLUSION Larger general practice size in England may be associated with slightly poorer continuity of care and may not improve patient access. Close collaborative working did not have any demonstrable effect on patient experience.","Forbes, Lindsay Jl; Forbes, Hannah; Sutton, Matt; Checkland, Katherine; Peckham, Stephen",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp20x713429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139333/,496

METHODS Participants who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 1 year previously were randomly assigned to a structured dietary intervention incorporating portion-controlled foods (intervention, n = 20) or a comparison group (control, n = 20). Both groups received instruction in behavioral weight loss (one 60-min session) followed by four monthly coaching telephone calls. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 4 months (post-intervention), and 6 months. RESULTS Participants were 85% female and 80% White. Average age was 46.9 (11.1) years, and body mass index was 31.3 (5.4) kg/m(2) at enrollment. Percent weight change from enrollment was significantly greater for intervention compared with control participants at 4 months [-4.56% vs. -0.13%, t(30) = -3.29, P = 0.003] and 6 months [-4.07% vs. -0.14%, t(31) = -2.03, P = 0.05]. Change in average daily calorie intake was greater among intervention compared with control [-108 vs. 116, t(30) = -2.01, P = 0.05] at 4 months only. CONCLUSIONS A structured dietary intervention increased weight loss and reduced calorie intake when initiated 1 year following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This approach holds promise for optimizing postsurgery lifestyle change.","Kalarchian, Melissa A; Marcus, Marsha D; Courcoulas, Anita P; Lutz, Calvin; Cheng, Yu; Sweeny, Gina",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.21591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27466039/,496

METHODS After general practitioners had been informed, prospectively selected patients with unilateral or bilateral inguinal hernia underwent one-stop surgery by TEP. Pre- and postoperative questionnaires were used to evaluate patient satisfaction. RESULTS During 12 months, 52 patients were referred for one-stop surgery. There were no ""no shows"". The general practitioner correctly diagnosed inguinal hernia in 51 patients. On the scheduled date, 50 patients successfully underwent surgery using TEP, and 49 of these patients were satisfied with the procedure and would repeat one-stop surgery when indicated. CONCLUSION One-stop endoscopic TEP inguinal hernia surgery is feasible and safe. The majority of patients would give preference to a repeated procedure if necessary. This clinical pathway reduces the number of patient visits to the hospital for inguinal hernia repair and also suggests cost efficiency.","Jutte, Ewoud H; Cense, Huib A; Dur, Alphons H M; Hunfeld, Michiel A J M; Cramer, Biron; Breederveld, Roelf S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1035-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20396910/,496
108929,Evaluation of the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic total gastrectomy in clinical stage I gastric cancer patients.,2015,"BACKGROUND Healthcare resources are limited and unnecessary, and inappropriate emergency department use is now a highly visible healthcare priority. Individuals visiting the emergency department for mental health-related reasons are often amongst the most frequent presenters. In response, researchers and clinicians have created interventions to streamline emergency department use and several primary studies describe the effects of these interventions. Yet, no consensus exists on the optimal approach, and information on the quality of development, effectiveness, acceptability, and economic considerations is hard to find. The purpose of this study is to systematically review interventions designed to improve appropriate use of the emergency department for mental health reasons. METHOD A mixed-method systematic review using Joanna Briggs Methodology. Search combining electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, HealthSTAR, PROQUEST, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health) and secondary searches (grey literature and hand search with consultation). Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts using predetermined eligibility criteria and a third reviewer will resolve conflicts. Full texts will also be screened by two independent reviews and conflicts resolved in a consensus meeting with a third reviewer. A pilot-tested data extraction form will be used to retrieve data relevant to the study objectives. We will assess the quality and of all included studies. Data describing interventions will be summarized using logic models and reported narratively. Quality of development will be assessed using the Oxford Implementation Index. For data on intervention effectiveness, we will assess statistical heterogeneity and conduct a meta-analysis using a random effects method, if appropriate. For interventions that cannot be pooled, we will report outcomes narratively and descriptively. Qualitative data on acceptability will be synthesized using meta-aggregation and an economic evaluation of interventions will be done. The reporting of this protocol follows the PRISMA-P statement. DISCUSSION Using a combined systematic review methodology and integrated knowledge translation plan, the project will provide decision makers with concrete evidence to support the implementation and evaluation of interventions to improve emergency department use for mental health reasons.

Natural Killer (NK) cells infiltrate hypoxic skin lesions and Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) mediate adaptation to low oxygen. We demonstrate that mice lacking the Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α isoform in NK cells show impaired release of the cytokines Interferon (IFN)-γ and Granulocyte Macrophage - Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) as part of a blunted immune response. This accelerates skin angiogenesis and wound healing. Despite rapid wound closure, bactericidal activity and the ability to restrict systemic bacterial infection are impaired. Conversely, forced activation of the HIF pathway supports cytokine release and NK cell-mediated antibacterial defence including direct killing of bacteria by NK cells despite delayed wound closure. Our results identify, HIF-1α in NK cells as a nexus that balances antimicrobial defence versus global repair in the skin.","Sobecki, Michal; Krzywinska, Ewelina; Nagarajan, Shunmugam; Audigé, Annette; Huỳnh, Khanh; Zacharjasz, Julian; Debbache, Julien; Kerdiles, Yann; Gotthardt, Dagmar; Takeda, Norihiko; Fandrey, Joachim; Sommer, Lukas; Sexl, Veronika; Stockmann, Christian",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25065-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349124/,496

This study aimed to analyze the influencing factors of international students' intention to wear a mask based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The findings are important because they provide pertinent information in designing and implementing COVID-19 prevention programs. METHODS Self-designed questionnaires were distributed to 477 international students. exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to identify and confirm the factor structure, and the structural equation model (SEM) was applied to determine the predictors of masks wearing. RESULTS The final structural model was well reflected by fit indices. The research model of international students' intention to wear a mask for protection against COVID-19 was acceptable. All of the hypotheses were supported. Attitude and perceived behavioral control (PBC) were positively related to behavior intention (BI), respectively. Subjective norm (SN) also had a direct effect on attitude, PBC, and BI. CONCLUSIONS Referring to TPB was useful in identifying determinants of mask-wearing. The strongest predictor was SN, which indicated it was deserving of increased attention.

An acellular biologic scaffold seems to be a promising option for urinary bladder augmentation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of bladder acellular matrix (BAM) for reconstruction of clinically significant large urinary bladder wall defects in a long-term porcine model. Urinary bladders were harvested from 10 pig donors. Biological scaffolds were prepared by chemically removing all cellular components from urinary bladder tissue. A total of 10 female pigs underwent hemicystectomy and subsequent bladder reconstruction with BAM. The follow-up study was 6 months. Reconstructed bladders were subjected to radiological, macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular evaluations. Six out of ten animals survived the 6-month follow-up period. Four pigs died during observation due to mechanical failure of the scaffold, anastomotic dehiscence between the scaffold and native bladder tissue, or occluded catheter. Tissue engineered bladder function was normal without any signs of postvoid residual urine in the bladder or upper urinary tracts. Macroscopically, graft shrinkage was observed. Urothelium completely covered the luminal surface of the graft. Smooth muscle regeneration was observed mainly in the peripheral graft region and gradually decreased toward the center of the graft.

111187,Video-assisted thoracoscopic pulmonary resections - The Melbourne experience.,2012,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in 2002. Despite reports showing Chiroptera as the original animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, many argue that Carnivora-hosted viruses are the most likely origin. The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 also involves Chiroptera-hosted lineages. However, factors such as the lack of comprehensive phylogenies hamper our understanding of host shifts once MERS-CoV emerged in humans and Artiodactyla. Since 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), added to this episodic history of zoonotic transmission events. Here we introduce a phylogenetic analysis of 2006 unique and complete genomes of different lineages of Orthocoronavirinae. We used gene annotations to align orthologous sequences for total evidence analysis under the parsimony optimality criterion. Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus were set as outgroups to understand spillovers of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus among ten orders of animals. We corroborated that Chiroptera-hosted viruses are the sister group of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-related viruses. Other zoonotic events were qualified and quantified to provide a comprehensive picture of the risk of coronavirus emergence among humans. Finally, we used a 250 SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses.","Jacob Machado, Denis; Scott, Rachel; Guirales, Sayal; Janies, Daniel A",Cladistics : the international journal of the Willi Hennig Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/cla.12454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219906/,496

Nasopharyngeal PCR panels contain more viruses than previously. The problem then becomes determining the relevance of the organisms identified rather than figuring out which virus is present. This review addresses how to distinguish between viral CAP and bacterial CAP, how viral CAP predisposes to bacterial CAP and some novel antiviral treatment being conducted. RECENT FINDINGS The pneumonia severity index has been studied in patients with viral CAP. There are new studies using biomarkers to help determine when antimicrobial treatment is needed in CAP patients, and there is still no consensus. Newer devices are being invented in an effort to separate upper from lower respiratory organisms to make test results more relevant. Several outcome studies in patients with viral CAP are reviewed. SUMMARY In addition to clinical correlation, using biomarkers can be useful to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP. Outcomes in patients with a co-infection are generally worse as a viral infection may predispose someone to a bacterial pneumonia. Influenza CAP treatment may be initially accompanied with antimicrobials until a patient's diagnosis is clear (∼48-72 h). Future research is being conducted for antiviral treatment more than for influenza.","Arnold, Forest W; Fuqua, Joshua L",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32068577/,496

Growing concerns for the safety of health care workers was raised when up to 80% of people with COVID-19 showed mild or no symptoms at all. Some surgical procedures will be inevitable during the pandemic, and proper safety measures must be in place to avoid transmission risks. Surgical smoke is a common by-product from the use of energy devices in the operating room. The effects of surgical smoke have been studied for more than 40 years, and potential health hazards have been reported. Chemicals, carcinogens and biologically active materials, such as bacteria and viruses, have been isolated in surgical smoke. To ensure the safety of operating room personnel, we must consider whether there is any concern of viral transmission from the inhalation of surgical smoke.","Vourtzoumis, Phil; Alkhamesi, Nawar; Elnahas, Ahmad; Hawel, Jeffrey E; Schlachta, Christopher",Canadian journal of surgery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-center, institutional review board-approved retrospective review included 320 consecutive HAEs for NET metastases performed in 137 patients between September 1996 and September 2007. Forty-seven HAEs (15%) were performed urgently to manage refractory symptoms in inpatients (urgent group), and 273 HAEs (85%) were elective (elective group). Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology. Complications were categorized per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors for OS, complications, and 30-day mortality. The independent factors were combined to develop clinical risk score groups. RESULTS Urgent HAE (P = .007), greater than 50% liver replacement by tumor (P < .0001), and extrahepatic metastasis (P = .007) were independent predictors for shorter OS. Patients with all three risk factors had decreased OS versus those with none (median, 8.5 vs 86 mo; P < .001). Thirty-day mortality was significantly lower in the elective (1%) versus the urgent group (8.5%; P = .0009). There were eight complications (3%) in the elective group and five (10.6%) in the urgent group (P = .03). Male sex and urgent group were independent factors for higher 30-day mortality rate (P = .023 and P =.016, respectively) and complications (P = .012 and P =.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Urgent HAE, replacement of more than 50% of liver by tumor, and extrahepatic metastasis are strong independent predictors of shorter OS. Male sex and urgent HAE carry higher 30-day mortality and periprocedural morbidity risks.","Sofocleous, Constantinos T; Petre, Elena N; Gonen, Mithat; Reidy-Lagunes, Diane; Ip, Ivan K; Alago, William; Covey, Anne M; Erinjeri, Joseph P; Brody, Lynn A; Maybody, Majid; Thornton, Raymond H; Solomon, Stephen B; Getrajdman, George I; Brown, Karen T",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2013.09.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24365504/,496

MATERIALS AND METHODS We electronically searched for randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies published between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2019 evaluating the effect of interventions on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) control. Characteristics of included studies and HbA1c difference between intervention and control arms (main outcome) were extracted. Interventions were grouped as: care management and patient education; nurse or certified diabetes educator (CDE); pharmacist; or physician-based. RESULTS Thirty-six studies including 22 243 individuals were combined in nonlinear random-effects meta-regressions; the median (range) duration of intervention was 1 year (0.9 to 36 months). Compared to the control arm, HbA1c reduction ranged from: -17.7 mmol/mol (-1.62%) to -4.4 mmol/mol (-0.40%) for nurse- or CDE-based interventions; -13.1 mmol/mol (-1.20%) to 3.3 mmol/mol (0.30%) for care management and patient education interventions; -9.8 mmol/mol (-0.90%) to -6.6 mmol/mol (-0.60%) for pharmacist-based interventions; and -4.4 mmol/mol (-0.40%) to 2.8 mmol/mol (0.26%) for physician-based interventions. Across the included studies, a reduction in HbA1c was observed only during the first year (6 months: -4.2 mmol/mol, 95% confidence interval [CI] -6.2, -2.2 [-0.38%, 95% CI -0.56, -0.20]; 1 year: -1.6 mmol/mol, 95% CI -3.3, 0.1 [-0.15%, 95% CI -0.30, 0.01]) and in individuals with preintervention HbA1c >75 mmol/mol (9%).

Several projects focus on automating, simplifying and/or streamlining specific tasks of the systematic review. Some tasks are already fully automated while others are still largely manual. In this review, we describe each task and the effect that its automation would have on the entire systematic review process, summarize the existing information system support for each task, and highlight where further research is needed for realizing automation for the task. Integration of the systems that automate systematic review tasks may lead to a revised systematic review workflow. We envisage the optimized workflow will lead to system in which each systematic review is described as a computer program that automatically retrieves relevant trials, appraises them, extracts and synthesizes data, evaluates the risk of bias, performs meta-analysis calculations, and produces a report in real time.","Tsafnat, Guy; Glasziou, Paul; Choong, Miew Keen; Dunn, Adam; Galgani, Filippo; Coiera, Enrico",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-4053-3-74; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005128/,496

We hypothesized that, despite low ASPECTS, patients may benefit from endovascular recanalization if good collaterals are present. METHODS Ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and an ASPECTS of ≤5 were analyzed. Collateral status (CS) was assessed using a 5-point-scoring system in CT angiography with poor CS defined as CS=0-1. Clinical outcome was determined using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score after 90 days. Edema formation was measured in admission and follow-up CT by net water uptake. RESULTS 27/100 (27%) patients exhibited a CS of 2-4. 50 patients underwent successful vessel recanalization and 50 patients had a persistent vessel occlusion. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, collateral status (OR 3.0; p=0.003) and vessel recanalization (OR 12.2; p=0.009) significantly increased the likelihood of a good outcome (mRS 0-3). A 1-point increase in CS was associated with 1.9% (95% CI 0.2% to 3.7%) lowered lesion water uptake in follow-up CT . CONCLUSION Endovascular recanalization in patients with ASPECTS of ≤5 but good collaterals was linked to improved clinical outcome and attenuated edema formation.

114146,JHL News.,2019,"BACKGROUND AKT, also known as protein kinase B, is a key element of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, AKT regulates the hallmarks of cancer, e.g. tumor growth, survival and invasiveness of tumor cells. After AKT was discovered in the early 1990s, further studies revealed that there are three different AKT isoforms, namely AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3. Despite their high similarity of 80%, the distinct AKT isoforms exert non-redundant, partly even opposing effects under physiological and pathological conditions. Breast cancer as the most common cancer entity in women, frequently shows alterations of the PI3K/AKT signaling. MAIN CONTENT A plethora of studies addressed the impact of AKT isoforms on tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis of breast cancer as well as on therapy response and overall survival in patients. Therefore, this review aimed to give a comprehensive overview about the isoform-specific effects of AKT in breast cancer and to summarize known downstream and upstream mechanisms. Taking account of conflicting findings among the studies, the majority of the studies reported a tumor initiating role of AKT1, whereas AKT2 is mainly responsible for tumor progression and metastasis. In detail, AKT1 increases cell proliferation through cell cycle proteins like p21, p27 and cyclin D1 and impairs apoptosis e.g. via p53. On the downside AKT1 decreases migration of breast cancer cells, for instance by regulating TSC2, palladin and EMT-proteins. However, AKT2 promotes migration and invasion most notably through regulation of β-integrins, EMT-proteins and F-actin. Whilst AKT3 is associated with a negative ER-status, findings about the role of AKT3 in regulation of the key properties of breast cancer are sparse. Accordingly, AKT1 is mutated and AKT2 is amplified in some cases of breast cancer and AKT isoforms are associated with overall survival and therapy response in an isoform-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS Although there are several discussed hypotheses how isoform specificity is achieved, the mechanisms behind the isoform-specific effects remain mostly unrevealed. As a consequence, further effort is necessary to achieve deeper insights into an isoform-specific AKT signaling in breast cancer and the mechanism behind it.","Hinz, Nico; Jücker, Manfred",Cell communication and signaling : CCS,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12964-019-0450-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752925/,496
114345,Recurrent Foley catheter puncture and displacement: a complication of the use of barbed polyglyconate suture to facilitate vesicourethral anastomosis during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.,2014,"INTRODUCTION Affibody molecules, small scaffold proteins, have demonstrated an appreciable potential as imaging probes. Affibody molecules are composed of three alpha-helices. Helices 1 and 2 are involved in molecular recognition, while helix 3 provides stability. The size of Affibody molecules can be reduced by omitting the third alpha-helix and cross-linking the two remaining, providing a smaller molecule with better extravasation and quicker clearance of unbound tracer. The goal of this study was to develop a novel 2-helix Affibody molecule based on backbone cyclization by native chemical ligation (NCL). METHODS The HER2-targeting NCL-cyclized Affibody molecule ZHER2:342min has been designed, synthesized and site-specifically conjugated with a DOTA chelator. DOTA-ZHER2:342min was labeled with (111)In and (68)Ga. The binding affinity of DOTA-ZHER2:342min was evaluated in vitro. The targeting properties of (111)In- and (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:342min were evaluated in mice bearing SKOV-3 xenografts and compared with the properties of (111)In- and (68)Ga-labeled PEP09239, a DOTA-conjugated 2-helix Affibody analogue cyclized by a homocysteine disulfide bridge. RESULTS The dissociation constant (KD) for DOTA-ZHER2:342min binding to HER2 was 18nM according to SPR measurements. DOTA-ZHER2:342min was labeled with (111)In and (68)Ga. Both conjugates demonstrated bi-phasic binding kinetics to HER2-expressing cells, with KD1 in low nanomolar range. Both variants demonstrated specific uptake in HER2-expressing xenografts. Tumor-to-blood ratios at 2h p.i. were 6.1±1.3 for (111)In- DOTA-ZHER2:342min and 4.6±0.7 for (68)Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:342min. However, the uptake of DOTA-ZHER2:342min in lung, liver and spleen was appreciably higher than the uptake of PEP09239-based counterparts. CONCLUSIONS Native chemical ligation enables production of a backbone-cyclized HER2-binding 2-helix Affibody molecule (ZHER2:342min) with low nanomolar target affinity and specific tumor uptake.","Honarvar, Hadis; Jokilaakso, Nima; Andersson, Karl; Malmberg, Jennie; Rosik, Daniel; Orlova, Anna; Karlström, Amelie Eriksson; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Järver, Peter",Nuclear medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2012.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23357083/,496

MATERIAL AND METHODS Prospective study of patients diagnosed with covid-19 pneumonia. Patients were followed until home discharge or death. PSI, CURB-65, SMART-COP and MuLBSTA severity scores were assessed on admission. Risk scores were related to mortality and ICU admission. RESULTS 249 patients, 143 males (57.4%) were included. The mean age was 65.6 + 16.1 years. Factors associates with mortality in the multivariate analysis were age > 80 years (OR: 13.9; 95%CI 3.8-51.1) (p=0.000), lymphocytes < 800 (OR:2.9; CI95% 1.1-7-9)(p=0.040), confusion (OR: 6.3; CI95% 1.6-24.7)(p=0.008) and NT-proBNP > 500 pg/mL (OR: 10.1; CI95% 1.1-63.1)(p=0.039). In predicting mortality, the PSI score: AUC 0.874 (95% CI 0.808-0.939) and the CURB-65 score: AUC 0.852 (95% CI 0.794-0.909) were the ones that obtained the best results. In the need for ICU admission, the SMART-COP score: AUC 0.749 (95% CI 0.695-0.820) and the MuLBSTA score: AUC 0.777 (95% CI 0.713-0.840) were the ones that obtained better results, with significant differences with PSI and CURB-65. The scores with the lowest value for ICU admission prediction were PSI with AUC of 0.620 (95% CI 0.549-0.690) and CURB-65 with AUC of 0.604 (95% CI 0.528-0.680). CONCLUSIONS Prognosis scores routinely used for CAP (PSI and CURB-65) were good predictors for mortality in patients with covid-19 CAP but not for need of hospitalization or ICU admission.

Understanding the potential morbidity associated with its harvest is important. In this study, we describe the objective sensory and functional outcomes associated with endoscopic sural nerve harvest from a combined paediatric and adult population. METHODS Data were collected prospectively from patients attending for follow-up between August 2015 and January 2016, who had previously undergone an endoscopic sural nerve graft harvest. Sensory loss was evaluated using a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. The lower extremity functional scale was used to evaluate the patients' lower limb function. Statistical comparison was made using the Student's t-test. RESULTS The outcomes from 46 sural nerve grafts were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 18.1 years (range 4-45 years old). The mean time since surgery was 4.3 years. Those aged ≤18 years had a significantly smaller area of sensory loss (p = 0.003), which was not related to a difference in foot size. Those who had undergone surgery >6 months previously had a significantly smaller area of sensory loss than those who had undergone surgery <6 months ago (p = 0.0002). The mean lower extremity functional scale score was 78.7/80. CONCLUSION We demonstrated a significantly reduced post-harvest sensory deficit among a paediatric population compared to that seen in adults. Furthermore, sensory loss reduces with time. Despite the sensory loss resulting from sural nerve graft harvest, there is minimal loss of function. As such, the sural nerve continues to be an excellent donor for a nerve graft procedure.","Butler, Daniel P; Johal, Kavan S; Wicks, Catherine E; Grobbelaar, Adriaan O","Journal of plastic, reconstructive & aesthetic surgery : JPRAS",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjps.2017.02.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28336449/,496

The aims of this study were (1) to summarise the reported risk of VTE associated with COVID-19 infections and (2) to summarise guidance documents on thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients, in a systematic review. METHODS We systematically searched for peer-reviewed evidence on the risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19, in PubMed, Embase and Twitter, and for guidelines or guidance documents for thromboprophylaxis, from international or national societies relevant to the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, up to April 30 2020. RESULTS We found 11 studies (1 clinical trial, 7 retrospective cohorts and 3 prospective cohorts), which included a range of 16 to 388 in patients with COVID-19 (total of 1369 inpatients). The diagnoses of COVID-19 and VTE were of high quality, but the follow-up was often unclear. Most studies reported universal in-hospital thromboprophylaxis. Among all inpatients and among intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients with COVID-19, reported risks of VTE were 4.4–8.2% (three studies) and 0–35.3% (six studies), respectively. Two studies at least partially screened for VTE in ICU inpatients with COVID-19, and found risks of 24.7–53.8%. We found 12 guidelines for thromboprophylaxis of COVID-19 patients. The majority suggested universal pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in all COVID-19 inpatients, but there was heterogeneity in the suggested intensity of thromboprophylaxis: seven advised considering intensified doses of heparin according to the clinical or biological severity of the disease, especially in the ICU setting. CONCLUSIONS Venous thromboembolism very commonly complicates the clinical course of inpatients with COVID-19, despite thromboprophylaxis. The risk appears highest among critically ill inpatients. We found no estimates of risks among outpatients. Many questions remain unresolved, as delineated by the heterogeneity of national and international guidelines. This situation calls for fast randomised clinical trials, comparing different schemes of thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 inpatients.","Fontana, Pierre; Casini, Alessandro; Robert-Ebadi, Helia; Glauser, Frederic; Righini, Marc; Blondon, Marc",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640479/,496

To facilitate planning of mental health services, empirical data on mental health problems and service utilization of populations affected by the epidemic are urgently needed. This study investigated the prevalence of mental health problems of residents within and outside Wuhan, China, as well as their patterns of mental health service utilization. Methods From January 27 to February 2, 2020, an online cross-sectional survey recruited residents from 4 subpopulations: Wuhan residents (n=2,617), migrants from Wuhan (those who left Wuhan before lockdown, n=930), other Hubei residents (n=633), and residents of other provinces of China (""other residents"", n=3,561). Participants' mental health problems and patterns of utilization of mental health services in recent days were assessed with standardized assessments. Results Among the 4 groups, Wuhan residents had the highest rate of any type of mental health problem (i.e., psychological distress: 41.9%), followed by migrants from Wuhan (34.2%), other Hubei residents (24.8%), and other residents (21.1%). Rates of perceived mental health needs and utilization of mental health services during recent days were 10.2% and 1.9% for Wuhan residents, 8.4% and 1.8% for migrants from Wuhan, 6.2% and 1.1% for other Hubei residents, and 6.4% and 1.0% for other residents, respectively. Overall, 63.0% mental health service users received services via internet and telephone, and 83.1% participants with perceived mental health needs ascribed their lack of help-seeking to barriers to accessibility and availability. Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemic is associated with unprecedented levels of mental health problems and needs in affected residents. To address the unmet mental health needs, internet- and telephone-based mental health services should be widely provided to residents, especially those in the worst-affected regions.","Zhong, Bao-Liang; Zhou, De-Yi; He, Min-Fu; Li, Yi; Li, Wen-Tian; Ng, Chee H; Xiang, Yu-Tao; Chiu, Helen Fung-Kum",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313137/,496

115765,Successful closure of defects in the upper gastrointestinal tract by endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT): a prospective cohort study.,2017,"BACKGROUND Interventions to reduce population salt intake are feasible and cost-effective. The Victorian Salt Reduction Partnership implemented a complex, multi-faceted salt reduction intervention between 2014 and 2020 in the Australian state of Victoria. This study aimed to understand stakeholder perspectives on the effectiveness of the Victorian Salt Reduction Partnership. METHODS Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Partnership and food industry stakeholders. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was adapted for the Partnership intervention and used to guide the qualitative analysis. RESULTS Fourteen Partnership and seven food industry stakeholders were interviewed. The Partnership was viewed as essential for intervention planning and decision-making and an enabler for intervention delivery. The goals of capacity building and collaborative action were perceived to have been achieved. The implementation team executed intended intervention activities and outputs, with some adaptations to strategy. Barriers and enablers to implementation were identified by interviewees, such as compatibility of individual, organisational and Partnership values and building positive relationships between the Partnership and food industry, respectively. Legal, political, social, environmental, technological and economic factors affecting intervention design, delivery and outcomes were identified. CONCLUSIONS Establishing a Partnership with diverse skills and experience facilitated collaborative action, capacity building and execution of the intervention. Monitoring and evaluating implementation informed strategy adaptations, which allowed optimisation of Partnership strategy. The importance of developing strong communication networks between strategic and implementation-levels was a key lesson.","Rosewarne, Emalie; Chislett, Wai-Kwan; McKenzie, Briar; Reimers, Jenny; Jolly, Kellie-Ann; Corben, Kirstan; Trieu, Kathy; Webster, Jacqui",BMC nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40795-021-00414-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883029/,496
116140,Comparison of outcomes after laparoscopy-assisted and open total gastrectomy for early gastric cancer.,2015,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a worldwide crisis in public health. It is crucial we understand the epidemiological trends and impact of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns for effective management of the disease and control of its spread. We develop and validate a novel intelligent computational model to predict epidemiological trends of COVID-19, with the model parameters enabling an evaluation of the impact of NPIs. By representing the number of daily confirmed cases (NDCC) as a time-series, we assume that, with or without NPIs, the pattern of the pandemic satisfies a series of Gaussian distributions according to the central limit theorem. The underlying pandemic trend is first extracted using a singular spectral analysis (SSA) technique, which decomposes the NDCC time series into the sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slow varying trend, oscillatory components and structureless noise. We then use a mixture of Gaussian fitting (GF) to derive a novel predictive model for the SSA extracted NDCC incidence trend, with the overall model termed SSA-GF. Our proposed model is shown to accurately predict the NDCC trend, peak daily cases, the length of the pandemic period, the total confirmed cases and the associated dates of the turning points on the cumulated NDCC curve. Further, the three key model parameters, specifically, the amplitude (alpha), mean (mu), and standard deviation (sigma) are linked to the underlying pandemic patterns, and enable a directly interpretable evaluation of the impact of NPIs, such as strict lockdowns and travel restrictions. The predictive model is validated using available data from China and South Korea, and new predictions are made, partially requiring future validation, for the cases of Italy, Spain, the UK and the USA. Comparative results demonstrate that the introduction of consistent control measures across countries can lead to development of similar parametric models, reflected in particular by relative variations in their underlying sigma, alpha and mu values. The paper concludes with a number of open questions and outlines future research directions.","Ren, Jinchang; Yan, Yijun; Zhao, Huimin; Ma, Ping; Zabalza, Jaime; Hussain, Zain; Luo, Shaoming; Dai, Qingyun; Zhao, Sophia; Sheikh, Aziz; Hussain, Amir",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2020.3027987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32997638/,496

In addition, by grading the degree of PQ injury, an attempt was made to correlate failure of repair with the PQ injury severity. METHODS The extent of PQ injury was graded for each fracture. After fracture fixation, the PQ muscle was repaired along its radial and distal borders. Radiopaque hemoclips were attached to each side of the PQ repair, 2 radially and 2 distally. The distance between these markers at time 0 versus x-rays taken at approximately 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months was recorded. Clip displacement of 1 cm or more compared to time 0 indicated repair failure. RESULTS One of 24 repairs (4%) failed at 3 months. No statistical difference was noted between the type of PQ injury and wrist flexion/extension, pronation/supination, and grip strength. CONCLUSIONS Pronator quadratus repairs after volar plate fracture fixation are generally durable. They withstand forces that occur at the distal radius during the healing process with a 4% failure rate. No correlation was shown between type of PQ injury and radiographic failure of the repair.","Swigart, Carrie R; Badon, Mary A; Bruegel, Victoria L; Dodds, Seth D",The Journal of hand surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhsa.2012.06.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22854257/,496

The aim of this study was to define the distribution of lymph node metastases and relation to the radiation field in patients following nCRTx and esophagectomy. METHODS Between April 2014 and August 2015 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy with 2-field lymphadenectomy following nCRTx were included in this prospective observational study. Lymph node stations according to AJCC 7 were separately investigated. The location of lymph node metastases in relation to the radiation field was determined. The primary endpoint was the distribution of lymph node metastases and relation to the radiation field, the secondary endpoints were high-risk stations and risk factors for lymph node metastases and relation to survival. RESULTS Fifty consecutive patients were included. Lymph node metastases were found in 60% of patients and most frequently observed in paraesophageal (28%), left gastric artery (24%), and celiac trunk (18%) stations. Fifty-two percent had lymph node metastases within the radiation field. The incidence of lymph node metastases correlated significantly with ypT-stage (p = 0.002), cT-stage (p = 0.005), lymph angioinvasion (p = 0.004), and Mandard (p = 0.002). The number of lymph node metastases was associated with survival in univariable analysis (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.068-1.173, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Esophageal adenocarcinoma frequently metastasizes to both the mediastinal and abdominal lymph node stations. In this study, more than half of the patients had lymph node metastases within the radiation field. nCRTx is therefore not a reason to minimize lymphadenectomy in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.","Hagens, Eliza R C; Künzli, Hannah T; van Rijswijk, Anne-Sophie; Meijer, Sybren L; Mijnals, R Clinton D; Weusten, Bas L A M; Geijsen, E Debby; van Laarhoven, Hanneke W M; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I; Gisbertz, Suzanne S",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07205-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624944/,496

BACKGROUND Long-term outcome data for prolapse repair are rare. A high incidence of mesh-related problems has been noted after transvaginal approaches using nonresorbable meshes. METHODS All patients treated with LVR at the Meander Medical Centre, Amersfoort, the Netherlands and the University Hospital Leuven, Belgium between January 1999 and March 2013 were enrolled in this study. All data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for recurrences and mesh-related problems. RESULTS 919 consecutive patients (869 women; 50 men) underwent LVR. A 10-year recurrence rate of 8.2% (95% confidence interval, 3.7-12.7) for external rectal prolapse repair was noted. Mesh-related complications were recorded in 18 patients (4.6%), of which mesh erosion to the vagina occurred in 7 patients (1.3%). In 5 of these patients, LVR was combined with a perineotomy. Both rates of fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation decreased significantly (P < 0.0001) after LVR compared to the preoperative incidence (11.1% vs 37.5% for incontinence and 15.6% vs 54.0% for constipation). CONCLUSIONS LVR is safe and effective for the treatment of different rectal prolapse syndromes. Long-term recurrence rates are in line with classic types of mesh rectopexy and occurrence of mesh-related complications is rare.","Consten, Esther C J; van Iersel, Jan J; Verheijen, Paul M; Broeders, Ivo A M J; Wolthuis, Albert M; D'Hoore, Andre",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000001401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26583661/,496
117943,"Adverse effects of fibrin sealants in thoracic surgery: the safety of a new fibrin sealant: multicentre, randomized, controlled, clinical trial.",2012,"OBJECTIVE To compare design features and mechanical properties of 13 commercially available Veress needles (VN). STUDY DESIGN In vitro biomechanical study. SAMPLE POPULATION Veress needles from 9 manufacturers (6 reusable, 6 disposable, and 1 with a reusable stylet combined with a disposable cannula) were included in the study. METHODS Veress needles are designed with a spring-loaded stylet to protect the tip of the cannula following insertion into the abdomen. Stylet forces were measured with a scale in a test jig by moving the stylet in 0.5 mm steps into the hollow cannula. Forces and spring rates were derived from force-displacement plots. Mass, mechanical dimensions, and the bevel angle and geometry were assessed. Differences between VN models were analyzed with a univariate analysis of variance. Results are reported as mean ± SD or median (range). RESULTS Physical and mechanical parameters differed between models. The exposed stylet length was 3.5 mm (2-7). Three bevel geometries (bias, lancet type, and back-cut) with angles between 20° and 40° were identified. Reusable VN weigh more (24.9 ± 2.2 g) than disposable designs (6.0 ± 2.3 g). The mean values for the spring rate and the residual stylet force were 0.23 ± 0.08 Nmm-1 and 0.94 ± 0.28 N, respectively. The mean force required to move the stylet to the cannula tip was 1.81 ± 0.29 N and 2.77 ± 0.54 N to move to the proximal end of the bevel. CONCLUSION Commercially available VN use diverse bevel geometries and have different mechanical characteristics. Studies investigating laparoscopic entry complications should explicitly report the type of VN model used.","Schramel, Johannes P; Kindslehner, Angelika; Bockstahler, Barbara A; Dupré, Gilles P",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12690; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28759119/,496

Recently, indocyanine green and near-infrared imaging have been used to aid in sentinel node biopsy. The present study aimed to determine the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy with indocyanine green SPY Elite navigation and to critically evaluate the technique compared with the standard modalities. METHODS A retrospective review of 90 consecutive cutaneous melanoma patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. Two cohorts were formed: group A, which had sentinel lymph node biopsy performed with blue dye and radioisotope; and group B, which had sentinel lymph node biopsy performed with radioisotope and indocyanine green SPY Elite navigation. The cohorts were compared to assess for differences in localization rates, sensitivity and specificity of sentinel node identification, and length of surgery. RESULTS The sentinel lymph node localization rate was 79.4 percent using the blue dye method, 98.0 percent using the indocyanine green fluorescence method, and 97.8 percent using the radioisotope/handheld gamma probe method. Indocyanine green fluorescence detected more sentinel lymph nodes than the vital dye method alone (p = 0.020). A trend toward a reduction in length of surgery was noted in the SPY Elite cohort. CONCLUSIONS Sentinel lymph node mapping and localization in cutaneous melanoma with the indocyanine green SPY Elite navigation system is technically feasible and may offer several advantages over current modalities, including higher sensitivity and specificity, decreased number of lymph nodes sampled, decreased operative time, and potentially lower false-negative rates.

Here, we designed a nanoparticle-based vaccine able to target human CD141+ (BDCA3+) DCs - the equivalent of murine CD8α+ DCs - and deliver both tumor Ag (Melan A) and α-GalCer. This nanovaccine was inoculated into humanized mice that mimic the human immune system (HIS) and possess functional iNKT cells and CD8+ T cells, called HIS-CD8/NKT mice. We found that multiple immunizations of HIS-CD8/NKT mice with the nanovaccine resulted in the activation and/or expansion of human CD141+ DCs and iNKT cells and ultimately elicited a potent Melan-A-specific CD8+ T cell response, as determined by tetramer staining and ELISpot assay. Single-cell proteomics further detailed the highly polyfunctional CD8+ T cells induced by the nanovaccine and revealed their predictive potential for vaccine potency. This finding demonstrates for the first time the unique ability of human iNKT cells to license cross-priming DCs in vivo and adds a new dimension to the current strategy of cancer vaccine development.","Huang, Jing; Zhou, Jing; Ghinnagow, Reem; Seki, Toshiyuki; Iketani, Sho; Soulard, Daphnée; Paczkowski, Patrick; Tsuji, Yukiko; MacKay, Sean; Cruz, Luis Javier; Trottein, François; Tsuji, Moriya",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.02043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973811/,496

MEASUREMENTS Olfaction was measured using the Brief Smell Identification Test, with impaired olfaction defined as an olfactory score below the fifth percentile of normative data. Delirium was assessed using a validated chart review method. Cognitive performance was assessed using a neuropsychological testing battery at baseline and 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS Impaired olfaction was identified in 54 of 165 participants (33%) before surgery. Impaired olfaction was associated with greater adjusted risk of postoperative delirium (relative risk = 1.90, 95% confidence interval = 1.17-3.09, P = .009). There was no association between impaired olfaction and change in composite cognitive score in the overall study population. CONCLUSION Impaired olfaction is prevalent in individuals undergoing cardiac surgery and is associated with greater adjusted risk of postoperative delirium but not cognitive decline.

Among them, CYP6AE17 has the highest sequence identity with CYP6AE18 but shows ∼7-fold higher metabolic efficiency. CYP6AE11 is most active towards esfenvalerate but CYP6AE20 is inactive even though the enzymes share 54.8% sequence identity. Sequence analysis revealed the SRS1 (Substrate Recognition Site) and SRS6 between CYP6AE17 and CYP6AE18, and SRS1 between CYP6AE11 and CYP6AE20 are the most variable among all six SRSs. In order to identify the key factors that underlie the observed catalytic difference, we exchanged these SRS sequences between two pairs of P450s and studied the activity of the resulting hybrid mutants or chimeras. In vitro metabolism showed that the CYP6AE17/18 chimeras had 2- and 10-fold decreased activities and the CYP6AE18/17 chimeras had 6- and 10-fold increased activities to esfenvalerate. Meanwhile, after exchanging SRS1 with each other, the CYP6AE11/20 chimera folded incorrectly but the CYP6AE20/11 chimera gained moderate activity to esfenvalerate. Molecular modelling showed that amino acids variants within SRS1 or SRS6 change the shape and chemical environment of the active sites, which may affect the ligand-binding interactions. These results indicate that the protein structure variation resulting from the sequence diversity of SRSs promotes the evolution of insect chemical defense and contributes to the development of insect resistance to pesticides.","Shi, Yu; O Reilly, Andrias O; Sun, Shuo; Qu, Qiong; Yang, Yihua; Wu, Yidong",Insect biochemistry and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2020.103486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069773/,496

The Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI), Constipation Scoring System (CSS), and QOL instruments (i.e., 36-item Short-form Health Survey [SF-36], Patient Assessment of Constipation-QOL [PAC-QOL] scale, and Fecal Incontinence-QOL [FIQL]) were administered before and annually after surgery. The sustainability of substantial symptom improvement (reduction of at least 50% in CSS or FISI scores) postoperatively was evaluated. RESULTS Fifty-one patients (median age 76 [range 60-93] years, 48 women [94%]) were analyzed. No mortality or major morbidity occurred. After a median follow-up of 60 months (range 12-84 months), no mesh-related complications occurred. The median CSS and FISI scores were significantly reduced at 1 year and remained significantly reduced for 7 years. In patients who reported symptom scores ≥ 3 times postoperatively, sustained improvement of constipation and fecal incontinence was found in about 50% (18/38) and 75% (26/35) of relevant patients, respectively. All PAC-QOL and FIQL scales significantly improved over time for 5 years. Of the SF-36 scales, four showed significant improvement at 1 year but none was significantly improved after 3 years, except for the social functioning scale. CONCLUSIONS LVR for RAI and/or rectocele was associated with low morbidity and long-term improvement in symptom-specific QOL. The sustainability of postoperative improvement in fecal incontinence was satisfactory, and that in constipation was fair.","Tsunoda, A; Takahashi, T; Matsuda, S; Kusanagi, H",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-021-02499-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633567/,496

METHODS This was a descriptive study focusing on year 2017, having as main source the Brazilian Ministry of Health's hospital information system. Child hospitalizations were considered to encompass those of individuals under 13 years of age whose main diagnosis was included in Chapter V of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10). RESULTS The most prevalent diagnostic group was F10-F19, with 24.1% (21.8-26.3), followed by groups F30-39, F80-F89, F90-F99, F20-F29, with no statistical difference among them. Hospitalizations occurred more frequently in non-psychiatric hospitals, with 93.1% (91.7-94.4); most hospitalizations lasted for up to one week - 75.5% (73.2-77.8). The national hospitalization rate was 4.3 (4.1-4.5)/100,000, showing variations according to macro-regions. The highest rate was found in the South macro-region and the lowest in the Northeast, with values of 10.9 (9.9-12.0)/100,000 and 1.9 (1.6-2.2)/100,000, respectively. Intermediate values were found in the other macro-regions. CONCLUSION Some specificities of the characteristics of hospitalizations for psychiatric reasons in this age group could be attested, as well as important variations in their occurrence among the different macro-regions of the country.","Souza, Maximiliano Loiola Ponte de; Lima, Rossano Cabral",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1590/2237-6089-2019-0064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084804/,496

METHODS Secondary analysis of a larger online cross-sectional study designed to determine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown across Spain. We analyzed a total of 1690 respondents aged ≥60 years and compared them with 13,363 respondents under 60 years of age. We employed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale to evaluate psychological responses. RESULTS In all, 52.6% of women and 34.3% of men were found to be probable cases of any emotional distress (p < 0.001). In both sexes, the most common psychological response was avoidance behavior (34.7% and 23.8%, respectively), followed by depression (28.5 and 14.2%). Older women and men were considered probable cases of any emotional distress less often than younger ones (women: 52.6% vs. 72.3%, p < 0.001; men: 34.3% vs. 50.6%, p < 0.001). Finally, the results of the binary logistic regression showed that only depressive and stress responses are psychological factors associated with age group [age ≥ 60 years, O.R. = 0.617 (95% CI = 0.501 - 0.759) and 0.437 (95% CI = 0.334 - 0.573), respectively]. CONCLUSION Contrary to our hypothesis and despite the high percentage of emotional distress we found in older adults, especially women, they are actually at lower risk of developing depressive and stress consequences from COVID-19 and lockdown than those under 60 years of age. That said, we believe our results highlight the need for expert guidance in this age group, especially older women living alone.","García-Portilla, Paz; de la Fuente Tomás, Lorena; Bobes-Bascarán, Teresa; Jiménez Treviño, Luis; Zurrón Madera, Paula; Suárez Álvarez, María; Menéndez Miranda, Isabel; García Álvarez, Leticia; Sáiz Martínez, Pilar A; Bobes, Julio",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2020.1805723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32870024/,496

Under these circumstances, vaccination is the only effective solution that can save millions of lives across the globe. Objectives The present study was conducted to assess the attitude and acceptance/willingness of health care professionals (medical and dental) towards COVID-19 vaccine. Materials and Methods An online questionnaire survey was conducted among medical and dental professionals working in different hospitals of two states of India. A total of 520 subjects constituted the final sample size. A self-constructed questionnaire (divided into 2 parts) containing 12 questions was administered to obtain information from the subjects regarding their attitude and willingness towards COVID 19 vaccine. Statistical analysis was done using chi-square test and multiple liner regression analysis. Odds ratio with 95% CI were also generated. Statistical significance was set at p≤0.05. Results Majority of the subjects (67% of dental and 73% of medical) had full confidence on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. Willingness to get vaccinated was shown by 63% of subjects and 65% had positive attitude towards vaccine. Some subjects (45.5% dental and 48.4% medical) showed concern regarding unforeseen effects of the vaccine. Willingness to get vaccinated was 3.45 higher in subjects who were involved in COVID duties. Subjects giving less preference to natural immunity over vaccine showed more willingness (OR: 2.98) towards getting the vaccine. Conclusion The findings of the study showed that acceptance and attitude of subjects regarding COVID 19 vaccine was suboptimal as there were various factors which contributed towards subjects' hesitancy to get vaccinated. There is an utmost need to address various issues regarding vaccine safety to promote high uptake.","Kaur, Avineet; Kaur, Gagandeep; Kashyap, Akanksha; Singh, Gaganpreet; Singh Sandhu, Harnoor; Khilji, Iqra; Singh Gambhir, Ramandeep",Roczniki Panstwowego Zakladu Higieny,https://doi.org/10.32394/rpzh.2021.0162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114775/,496

Exercise training has various potential benefits in terms of prevention of a sustained decline in functional status. This study aimed to evaluate the physical, psychological, laboratory, and dialysis-related effects of intradialytic exercise. METHODS We enrolled 22 patients from a hemodialysis center for a 6-month non-randomized prospective trial. Combination of aerobic exercise with bicycle ergometer and anaerobic exercise with elastic bands was conducted during hemodialysis. Data including physical fitness test results, dialysis-related measurements, and biochemical laboratory results were collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Depression and quality of life were assessed using Beck Depression Inventory and Short Form-36 health survey. RESULTS After exercise completion, there were significant improvements in back muscle power, forward and backward trunk flexibility, vertical jump, elbow flexion, sit to stand test, and 6-minute walk test (p < 0.05). No significant changes were observed in dry weight, blood pressure, Kt/V, and biochemical variables, except for intradialytic hypotension (p < 0.05). For depression, Beck Depression Inventory showed statistically significant enhancement (p < 0.05). Scores of Short Form-36 health survey did not show significant increase in each domain, except for bodily pain (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Combined aerobic and anaerobic exercise training during dialysis was found to be effective on physical health status, intradialytic hypotension, and depression in terms of mental health. Therefore, the findings of the current study may provide an appropriate guidance for encouraging exercise by nephrologists.","Rhee, So Yon; Song, Jin Kyung; Hong, Suk Chul; Choi, Jae Won; Jeon, Hee Jung; Shin, Dong Ho; Ji, Eun Hee; Choi, Eun-Hee; Lee, Jiyeon; Kim, Aram; Choi, Seung Wook; Oh, Jieun",The Korean journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.3904/kjim.2017.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28838226/,496

Thus, we need to improve OHE to strengthen people's OHB. Undergraduates are regarded as the best candidates for the improvement of OHE. The objective of this study is to determine undergraduates' oral health status and existing problems in OHB by comparing dental and non-dental students at Sichuan University. We hope to provide some suggestions for future OHE to improve people's OHB. METHODS A quasi-experimental study designed with a pre-test and post-test group was conducted. A total of 217 dental students and 135 non-dental students were enrolled. They were administered an OHE course focused on OHB. A survey about oral health behaviour and knowledge was conducted before and after the course. RESULTS According to the pre-course survey, dental students surpassed non-dental students in terms of toothbrushing frequency, method, and time, but unfortunately, flossing was overlooked by all the students. After the course, both dental and non-dental students showed strong willingness to improve their OHB. More non-dental students than dental students were willing to use toothpicks and Chinese herbal toothpaste before and after the course. CONCLUSIONS OHE focused on behaviour has a positive effect on university students. Future OHE and interventions should focus on flossing, toothbrushing methods, toothpicks, Chinese herbal toothpaste and modifications to adopt new media.","Li, Mingming; Wu, Zhiwu; Zhang, Rui; Lei, Lei; Ye, Siqi; Cheng, Ran; Hu, Tao",BMC oral health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-020-01232-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894119/,496

Direct surgery to disconnect venous reflux has been favored. We report the curative endovascular treatment of two sphenoid wing dAVFs with pure cortical venous drainage. One patient revealed complete obliteration of dAVF by a single session of transarterial embolization (TAE). As part of strategic TAE for this complex dAVF, we used a novel approach to create a complete flow-arrest condition in which coils and an occlusion balloon were combined. A liquid agent was then injected across the pathological fistula and into the parent venous apparatus, thereby occluding the lesion. The other patient was treated with percutaneous TVE after TAE was unsuccessful. With a specific strategy and appropriate devices, the microcatheter was successfully introduced through sigmoid sinus, transverse sinus, superior sagittal sinus, and refluxing cortical vein by puncture of the jugular vein. Coils were deployed at the venous side of the fistula, resulting in successful obliteration of the dAVF. Sphenoid wing dAVF with pure cortical venous drainage could be curable by endovascular treatment with proper strategy and instruments when anatomical condition permits.","Fukuda, Hitoshi; Miyake, Kosuke; Kunieda, Takenobu; Murao, Kenichi",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2013.12.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582791/,496

Here, we use an approach in which DNA breaks can be induced in G1 cells and their repair tracked, enabling us to show that joining of DSBs is not functional in G1-arrested XRCC4-deficient cells. Cell cycle entry into S-G2/M restores DSB repair by Pol θ-dependent and PARP1-independent alternative NHEJ with repair products bearing kilo-base long DNA end resection, micro-homologies and chromosome translocations. We identify a synthetic lethal interaction between XRCC4 and Pol θ under conditions of G1 DSBs, associated with accumulation of unresolved DNA ends in S-G2/M. Collectively, our results support the conclusion that the repair of G1 DSBs progressing to S-G2/M by alternative NHEJ drives genomic instability and represent an attractive target for future DNA repair-based cancer therapies.","Yu, Wei; Lescale, Chloé; Babin, Loelia; Bedora-Faure, Marie; Lenden-Hasse, Hélène; Baron, Ludivine; Demangel, Caroline; Yelamos, José; Brunet, Erika; Deriano, Ludovic",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19060-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33067475/,496
120778,Successful closed suction drain management of a canine elbow hygroma.,2015,"OBJECTIVES Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome is complicated with coronavirus disease 2019 and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support may be necessary in severe cases. This study is to summarize the clinical features, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation characteristics, and outcomes of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN Descriptive study from two hospitals. SETTING The ICUs from university hospitals. PATIENTS Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia received mechanical ventilation, including those underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 8, 2020, to March 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Clinical records, laboratory results, ventilator parameters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related data were abstracted from the medical records. One-hundred twenty-nine critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia were admitted to ICU of the two referral hospitals. Fifty-nine patients received mechanical ventilation and 21 of them received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (fourteen from Zhongnan hospital and seven from Wuhan pulmonary hospital). Compared to mechanical ventilation patients without extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, there was a tendency of decline in mortality but with no significant difference (no-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 24/38 [63.2%] vs extracorporeal membrane oxygenation group 12/21 [57.1%]; p = 0.782). For those patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 12 patients died and nine survived by April 7, 2020. Among extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients, the PaCO2 prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was lower (54.40 mm Hg [29.20-57.50 mm Hg] vs 63.20 mm Hg [55.40-72.12 mm Hg]; p = 0.006), and pH prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was higher (7.38 [7.28-7.48] vs 7.23 [7.16-7.33]; p = 0.023) in survivors than nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might be an effective salvage treatment for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Severe CO2 retention and acidosis prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation indicated a poor prognosis.","Yang, Xiao; Cai, Shuhan; Luo, Yun; Zhu, Fangfang; Hu, Ming; Zhao, Yan; Zheng, Ruiqiang; Li, Xuyan; Hu, Bo; Peng, Zhiyong",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427613/,496
121332,Video-atlas of thoracoscopic formal lung resections emulating traditional open techniques.,2012,"INTRODUCTION General approval of laparoscopy as well as persistent urge to minimize operative trauma with still existing difficulties in putting natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) into practice have contributed to the introduction of laparoscopic operations through one incision in the umbilicus named single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). AIM The main aim of this study was to assess the benefits to patients of applying SILS cholecystectomy as a method of gallbladder removal based on the comparison with classic four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between 18.03.2009 and 09.12.2009, 100 patients were included in the study and they underwent elective gallbladder removal by applying the laparoscopic technique. All patients were divided into two equal groups: qualified for SILS cholecystectomy (group I) and qualified for classic four-trocar laparoscopic cholecystectomy (group II), whose ASA physical status was I and II. BMI was limited to 35 kg/m(2). Outcome measures included operative time, intensity of postoperative pain and consumption of painkillers, hospital stay, need for conversion, complications, and cosmetic effects. RESULTS Mean operating time in group I was 66 min and in group II 47.2 min. Intensity of pain evaluated by using the visual analogue scale (VAS) 6 h after the operation in group I was 3.49 and in group II 4.53, whereas 24 h after the operation in group I it was 1.18 and in group II 1.55. The painkiller requirement in group I was smaller than in group II. Mean hospital stay after the operation in group I was 1.33 days and in group II 1.96 days. There were 4 conversions in group I and one conversion in group II. Among the complications in group I there were noted 2 cases of right pneumothorax, 1 case of choleperitonitis and 4 complications connected with wound healing. There was one injury of the duodenum and one wound infection in group II. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic surgery cholecystectomy can be an alternative to classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy, especially with reference to young people with body mass index less than 35 kg/m(2), without serious systemic diseases, operated on electively due to benign gallbladder diseases.","Kurpiewski, Waldemar; Pesta, Wiesław; Kowalczyk, Marek; Głowacki, Leszek; Juśkiewicz, Wit; Szynkarczuk, Rafał; Snarska, Jadwiga; Stanowski, Edward",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.30811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362429/,496
121575,Technique for Fenestrated Stent-Graft Implantation as a Proximal Extension to a Previous Fenestrated Endovascular Repair for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,2018,"This article reviews the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical ACE-angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system. ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury. Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry. ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future. In the meantime, however, the use of RAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers that inhibit the damaging (ACE-Ang II) arm of the RAS cascade in the lung may also be promising.

ANIMALS 13 client- or student-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Pressure sensors were placed over the calcaneus and cranial tibial surface. Dogs then were fitted with a fiberglass cast on a pelvic limb extending from the digits to the stifle joint (tall cast). Pressure induced over the calcaneus and proximal edge of the cast at the level of the cranial tibial surface was simultaneously recorded during ambulation. Subsequently, the cast was shortened to end immediately proximal to the calcaneus (short cast), and data acquisition was repeated. Pressure at the level of the calcaneus and cranial tibial surface for both cast configurations was compared by use of paired t tests. RESULTS The short cast created significantly greater peak pressure at the level of the calcaneus (mean ± SD, 0.2 ± 0.07 MPa), compared with peak pressure created by the tall cast (0.1 ± 0.06 MPa). Mean pressure at the proximal cranial edge of the cast was significantly greater for the short cast (0.2 ± 0.06 MPa) than for the tall cast (0.04 ± 0.03 MPa). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A cast extended to the level of the proximal portion of the tibia caused less pressure at the level of the calcaneus and the proximal cranial edge of the cast. Reducing the amount of pressure at these locations may minimize the potential for pressure sores and other soft tissue injuries.","Iodence, Ashley E; Olsen, Anastasia M; McGilvray, Kirk C; Duncan, Colleen G; Duerr, Felix M",American journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.79.3.317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29466049/,496
122045,First case report of single port video-assisted thoracoscopic middle lobectomy for the treatment of pulmonary aspergilloma in a pediatric patient.,2013,"Nonstructural protein 2B of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus (FMDV) is comprised of a small, hydrophobic, 154-amino-acid protein. Structure-function analyses demonstrated that FMDV 2B is an ion channel-forming protein. Infrared spectroscopy measurements using partially overlapping peptides that spanned regions between amino acids 28 and 147 demonstrated the adoption of helical conformations in two putative transmembrane regions between residues 60 and 78 and between residues 119 and 147 and a third transmembrane region between residues 79 and 106, adopting a mainly extended structure. Using synthetic peptides, ion channel activity measurements in planar lipid bilayers and imaging of single giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) revealed the existence of two sequences endowed with membrane-porating activity: one spanning FMDV 2B residues 55 to 82 and the other spanning the C-terminal region of 2B from residues 99 to 147. Mapping the latter sequence identified residues 119 to 147 as being responsible for the activity. Experiments to assess the degree of insertion of the synthetic peptides in bilayers and the inclination angle adopted by each peptide regarding the membrane plane normal confirm that residues 55 to 82 and 119 to 147 of 2B actively insert as transmembrane helices. Using reverse genetics, a panel of 13 FMD recombinant mutant viruses was designed, which harbored nonconservative as well as alanine substitutions in critical amino acid residues in the area between amino acid residues 28 and 147. Alterations to any of these structures interfered with pore channel activity and the capacity of the protein to permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to calcium and were lethal for virus replication. Thus, FMDV 2B emerges as the first member of the viroporin family containing two distinct pore domains.IMPORTANCE FMDV nonstructural protein 2B is able to insert itself into cellular membranes to form a pore. This pore allows the passage of ions and small molecules through the membrane. In this study, we were able to show that both current and small molecules are able to pass though the pore made by 2B. We also discovered for the first time a virus with a pore-forming protein that contains two independent functional pores. By making mutations in our infectious clone of FMDV, we determined that mutations in either pore resulted in nonviable virus. This suggests that both pore-forming functions are independently required during FMDV infection.","Gladue, D P; Largo, E; de la Arada, I; Aguilella, V M; Alcaraz, A; Arrondo, J L R; Holinka, L G; Brocchi, E; Ramirez-Medina, E; Vuono, E A; Berggren, K A; Carrillo, C; Nieva, J L; Borca, M V",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01360-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30232178/,496

Although nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) remains the gold standard for detecting and theoretically quantifying SARS-CoV-2 mRNA in various specimen types, antigen assays may be considered a suitable alternative, under specific circumstances. Rapid antigen tests are meant to detect viral antigen proteins in biological specimens (e.g. nasal, nasopharyngeal, saliva), to indicate current SARS-CoV-2 infection. The available assay methodology includes rapid chromatographic immunoassays, used at the point-of-care, which carries some advantages and drawbacks compared to more conventional, instrumentation-based, laboratory immunoassays. Therefore, this document by the International Federation for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Taskforce on COVID-19 aims to summarize available data on the performance of currently available SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid detection tests (Ag-RDTs), providing interim guidance on clinical indications and target populations, assay selection, and evaluation, test interpretation and limitations, as well as on pre-analytical considerations.

122782,Quality of life and nutritional consequences after aboral pouch reconstruction following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer: randomized controlled trial CCG1101.,2016,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health communication campaigns have been targeted at reducing viral transmission, specifically among populations most vulnerable to infection and death from the virus (e.g. older adults). However, other individuals who have not been defined as vulnerable populations may also suffer from a decrease in health because of the measures aimed at reducing viral transmission, such as social distancing. To illuminate this issue, we investigate the role of social and media resources in complementing limited offline communication and supporting mental and physical health during this pandemic. We then suggest an alternative audience segmentation strategy based on social and media resources for public health interventions. Based on online survey data from 723 adults in South Korea, the regression analysis results indicated that individuals with lower levels of social resources suffered more during the pandemic. The cluster analysis results revealed that, contrary to the traditional definition of vulnerable populations, a cluster of younger people were unhealthier than a cluster of older people because of a lack of social resources. Clusters with different levels of ICT skills and uses for health-related activities also experienced the pandemic differently. These findings imply public health interventions should focus on social resources beyond the demographic factors to determine target audiences, and that they should take advantage of the target audiences' media resources to encourage them to forge intimate connections with others and to engage in health-related activities.","Ihm, Jennifer; Lee, Chul-Joo",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2020.1847450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198528/,496

123065,Comparison of dexmedetomidine and dexamethasone for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,2015,"BACKGROUND Jejunostomy catheters for jejunal feeding are an effective method to improve nutritional status in malnourish patients. However, this procedure is commonly being performed using an open approach, which can be associated with more postoperative pain and prolonged recovery. The objective of this study was to assess the outcomes of patients who underwent placement of feeding jejunostomy using a laparoscopic approach. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent laparoscopic jejunostomy tube placement between 1998 and 2014. Main outcome measures included indication for catheter placement, rate of conversion rate to open surgery, perioperative and late morbidity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Two hundred and ninety-nine consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic jejunostomy during the study period. The mean age was 64 years, and 81% of patients were male. The mean BMI was 26.2 kg/m(2). The most common indications for catheter placement were resectable esophageal cancer (78%), unresectable esophageal cancer (10%) and gastric cancer (6%). There were no conversions to open surgery. The 30-day complication rate was 4.0% and included catheter dislodgement (1%), intraperitoneal catheter displacement (0.7%), catheter blockage (1%) or breakage (0.3%), site infection requiring catheter removal (0.7%) and abdominal wall hematoma (0.3%). The late complication rate was 8.7% and included jejuno-cutaneous fistula (3.7%), jejunostomy tube dislodgement (3.3%), broken or clogged J-tube (1.3%) and small bowel obstruction (0.3%). The 30-day mortality was 0.3% for a patient with stage IV esophageal cancer who died in the postoperative period secondary to respiratory failure. CONCLUSION In this large consecutive series of feeding jejunostomy, the laparoscopic approach is feasible and safe and associated with a low rate of small bowel obstruction and no intraabdominal catheter-related infection.","Young, Monica T; Troung, Hung; Gebhart, Alana; Shih, Anderson; Nguyen, Ninh T",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4171-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25801114/,496
123129,Laparoscopic resection with complete mesocolic excision for splenic flexure cancer: long-term follow-up data from a multicenter retrospective study.,2019,"BACKGROUND Total gastrectomy has detrimental effects on postoperative nutritional status and quality of life (QOL), but it is often unavoidable in the treatment of gastric cancer. Roux-en-Y (RY) is the most common reconstruction method following total gastrectomy. Trials to explore other means of reconstruction have been conducted but have failed to identify a method that is globally accepted. METHODS Aboral pouch reconstruction (AP), in which an anisoperistaltic jejunal pouch is created in the Y limb of the RY reconstruction, is considered effective and technically feasible. A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare AP with RY. Gastric cancer patients requiring total gastrectomy for R0 resection were randomly assigned during surgery to receive either RY (n = 51) or AP (n = 49). Postoperative QOL as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and STO22, body composition, and morbidity were compared between the two reconstruction methods. The physical functioning score of the QLQ-C30 was selected as the primary endpoint. RESULTS The incidences of postoperative complications were similar between the two groups (29 % in the RY group and 27 % in the AP group). No significant difference was observed in the physical functioning score, and the superiority of AP was demonstrated only for the nausea and vomiting score at 12 months (p = 0.041) and the reflux score at 1 month (p = 0.036). No significant differences were observed in body composition or serum biochemistry. CONCLUSIONS Although AP was safely implemented, no increased benefits in nutritional or QOL-related parameters were observed for this method over RY within 12 months postoperatively.","Ito, Yuichi; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Fujiwara, Michitaka; Kojima, Hiroshi; Matsui, Takanori; Mochizuki, Yoshinari; Cho, Haruhiko; Aoyama, Toru; Ito, Seiji; Misawa, Kazunari; Nakayama, Hiroshi; Morioka, Yuki; Ishiyama, Akiharu; Tanaka, Chie; Morita, Satoshi; Sakamoto, Junichi; Kodera, Yasuhiro",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-015-0529-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26272278/,496

Here we show that the actions of natural transinducers from these two different families of persistent viruses (Rev of SIV and ORF57 of the rhesus monkey rhadinovirus) are dependent on the nature of the skewed codon usage. In fact, the transinducibility of expression of these glycoproteins by Rev and by ORF57 can be flipped simply by changing the nature of the codon usage. Even expression of a luciferase reporter could be made Rev dependent or ORF57 dependent by distinctive changes to its codon usage. Our findings point to a new general principle in which different families of persisting viruses use a poor codon usage that is skewed in a distinctive way to temporally regulate late expression of structural gene products.","Shin, Young C; Bischof, Georg F; Lauer, William A; Desrosiers, Ronald C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1515387112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26504241/,496

124094,Robot-Assisted Myomectomy for Large Uterine Myomas: A Single Center Experience.,2016,"OBJECTIVES To determine the rate of recurrent Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) in our clinical practices and to evaluate whether the mode of treatment of a CSP is associated with the risk of recurrent CSP, as well as to review the published literature on recurrent CSP. METHODS We performed a retrospective search of our six obstetrical and gynecologic departmental ultrasound databases for all CSPs and recurrent CSPs between 2010 and 2019. We extracted various data, including numbers of CSPs with follow-up, numbers attempting and numbers achieving pregnancy following treatment of the CSP and numbers of recurrent CSPs, as well as details of the treatment of the original CSP. After analyzing the clinical data, we evaluated whether the mode of treatment terminating the previous CSP was associated with the risk of recurrent CSP. We also performed a PubMed search for: 'recurrent Cesarean scar pregnancy' and 'recurrent Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy'. Articles were reviewed for year of publication and extraction and analysis of the same data as those obtained from our departmental databases. RESULTS Our database search identified 252 cases of CSP. The overall rate of clinical follow-up ranged between 71.4% and 100%, according to treatment site (mean, 90.9%). Among these, 105 were followed by another pregnancy after treatment of the previous CSP. Of these, 36 (34.3%) pregnancies were recurrent CSP, with 27 women having a single recurrence and three women having multiple recurrences, one with two, one with three and one with four. We did not find any particular single or combination treatment mode terminating the previous CSP to be associated with recurrent CSP. The literature search identified 17 articles that yielded sufficient information for us to evaluate their reported prevalence of recurrent CSP. They reported 1743 primary diagnoses of CSP, and 944 had reliable follow-up. There were data for 489 cases in which a woman attempted to conceive again, and on 327 pregnancies achieved, after treatment of a previous CSP. Of these, 67 (20.5%) were recurrent CSP. CONCLUSION On the basis of our pooled clinical data and review of the literature, recurrent CSP is apparently more common than was previously assumed based upon mostly single case reports or series with few cases. This should be borne in mind when counseling patients undergoing treatment for CSP regarding their risk of recurrence. We found no obvious causal relationship or association between the type of treatment for the previous CSP and recurrence of CSP. Patients pregnant after treatment for a CSP should be encouraged to have an early (5-7-week) first-trimester transvaginal scan to determine the location of the gestation.

METHODS AND RESULTS The authors present three cases of TN treated with V2 nerve block using commonly available local anesthetics injected through the greater palatine foramen. Patients' medications were noted before and after the procedure. Following the injection, patients were followed over time and outcome was assessed. Patients experienced rapid and long-lasting pain relief allowing for significant reduction in antineuralgia medications. This was done with the objective of breaking the pain cycle with subsequent discontinuation or reduction of analgesic medications. CONCLUSION This technique may be an effective treatment for medication-refractory V2 TN. By interrupting the pain cycle, this renders the condition amenable to long-term control using diminished doses of standard antineuralgia pharmaceuticals.

124853,Total laparoscopic approach for the treatment of right colon cancer: a technical critique.,2013,"Paulinella photosynthetic species are unicellular, silica shell-forming amoebas classified into the supergroup Rhizaria. They crawl at the bottom of freshwater and brackish environments with the help of filose pseudopodia. These protists have drawn the attention of the scientific community because of two photosynthetic bodies, called chromatophores, that fill up their cells permitting fully photoautotrophic existence. Paulinella chromatophores, similarly to primary plastids of the Archaeplastida supergroup (including glaucophytes, red algae as well as green algae and land plants), evolved from free-living cyanobacteria in the process of endosymbiosis. Interestingly, these both cyanobacterial acquisitions occurred independently, thereby undermining the paradigm of the rarity of endosymbiotic events. Chromatophores were derived from α-cyanobacteria relatively recently 60-140 million years ago, whereas primary plastids originated from β-cyanobacteria more than 1.5 billion years ago. Since their acquisition, chromatophore genomes have undergone substantial reduction but not to the extent of primary plastid genomes. Consequently, they have also developed mechanisms for transport of metabolites and nuclear-encoded proteins along with appropriate targeting signals. Therefore, chromatophores of Paulinella photosynthetic species, similarly to primary plastids, are true cellular organelles. They not only show that endosymbiotic events might not be so rare but also make a perfect model for studying the process of organellogenesis. In this chapter, we summarize the current knowledge and retrace the fascinating adventure of Paulinella species on their way to become photoautotrophic organisms.","Gagat, Przemysław; Sidorczuk, Katarzyna; Pietluch, Filip; Mackiewicz, Paweł",Results and problems in cell differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51849-3_13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263879/,496

125235,Short-term Outcome of Robot-assisted and Open IPAA: An Observational Single-center Study.,2016,"Prevalence of hypertension, subjective sleep complaints and snoring increases with age. Worse sleep and snoring, in turn, are independent risk factors to develop hypertension. Both respiratory muscle training (RMT) and intermittent hypoxia (IH) are suggested to have positive effects on these physiological and behavioral variables. This study therefore aimed to test the acute effects of a single bout of RMT, with and without IH, on resting blood pressure (BP) and sleep. Fourteen prehypertensive elderly performed a 60-min session of (a) intermittent voluntary normocapnic hyperpnea (HYP) alone, (b) HYP in combination with IH (HYP&IH) and (c) a sham intervention in randomized order. BP, hemodynamics, heart rate variability (HRV), cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed before and 15, 30 and 45 min after each intervention. Variables of sleep were assessed with actigraphy, pulse oximetry and with questionnaires during and after the night following each intervention. Neither HYP nor HYP&IH resulted in a decrease in BP. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant interaction effect for systolic BP (p = 0.090), diastolic BP (p = 0.151), HRV parameters, BRS and PWV (all p > 0.095). Fragmentation index was lower after both HYP (-6.5 units) and HYP&IH (-8.4 units) compared to sham, p(ANOVA) = 0.046, although pairwise comparisons reveal no significant differences. There were no other significant effects for the remaining sleep variables. We conclude that one bout of intermittent hyperpnea, alone or in combination with IH, is not effective in lowering blood pressure or improving sleep in prehypertensive elderly.","Stutz, Jan; Oliveras, Ruben; Eiholzer, Remo; Spengler, Christina M",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.556220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123023/,496

However, each professional's awareness of children with developmental, emotional and behavioural difficulties may differ, allowing their special needs to be overlooked at child health checkups until secondary difficulties appear. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the multi-professional views of children with such chronic difficulties. This study investigates pediatric dentists' perception of children with potential chronic difficulties. METHODS Interviews were conducted with 21 pediatric dentists, and the transcripts were analyzed using grounded theory to develop categories for the theoretical assessment. RESULTS Four themes emerged regarding the children with potential chronic difficulties: children exhibiting possible DDs with awkward social communication and interaction; severe rampant caries possibly derived from maltreatment; dental phobia possibly derived from mental health problems; a complicated home environment where their mothers exhibit poor oral health literacy. CONCLUSIONS This study's findings imply that participants' concept of children of concern included the risks of poor oral health and mental health problems that other healthcare professionals might overlook. It is recommended that multidisciplinary professionals engaging in child health checkups be aware of children's oral and mental health status as well as potential DDs and child maltreatment.","Ide-Okochi, Ayako; Funayama, Hiromi; Asada, Yoshinobu",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-021-02711-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011290/,496

During the initial phase of the outbreak, dissemination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was primarily determined by human mobility from Wuhan, China5,6. Yet empirical evidence on the effect of key geographic factors on local epidemic transmission is lacking7. In this study, we analyzed highly resolved spatial variables in cities, together with case count data, to investigate the role of climate, urbanization and variation in interventions. We show that the degree to which cases of COVID-19 are compressed into a short period of time (peakedness of the epidemic) is strongly shaped by population aggregation and heterogeneity, such that epidemics in crowded cities are more spread over time, and crowded cities have larger total attack rates than less populated cities. Observed differences in the peakedness of epidemics are consistent with a meta-population model of COVID-19 that explicitly accounts for spatial hierarchies. We paired our estimates with globally comprehensive data on human mobility and predict that crowded cities worldwide could experience more prolonged epidemics.","Rader, Benjamin; Scarpino, Samuel V; Nande, Anjalika; Hill, Alison L; Adlam, Ben; Reiner, Robert C; Pigott, David M; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Zarebski, Alexander E; Shrestha, Munik; Brownstein, John S; Castro, Marcia C; Dye, Christopher; Tian, Huaiyu; Pybus, Oliver G; Kraemer, Moritz U G",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1104-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020651/,496

The goal of the present study was to clarify histologically and immunohistochemically how division with the device affects the wall layers of the pulmonary vasculature. METHODS This prospective cohort study analysed outcomes of 20 patients who underwent anatomical lung resection. After a single proximal ligation, the PA and the PV (diameter 2-7 mm) were divided using a LigaSure Blunt Tip (LSB). Histological findings and thermal damage were evaluated in vascular specimens from resected lungs. RESULTS The PA has a well-developed media with rich elastic fibres and a thin adventitia, whereas the PV has a thinner media and a thicker adventitia with abundant collagen fibres. Vascular division of the PAs and PVs appeared complete to the naked eye. However, in all divided PAs, the area adjacent to the sealed zone comprised only adventitia and thin disrupted media. Additionally, thermal energy generated by the LSB resulted in a wide area of thermal necrosis over the histologically fragile region in all cases. Conversely, the wall layers of all divided PVs were completely fused without disruption. Thermal spread and disruption did not significantly differ between small (2-4 mm) and large (5-7 mm) PAs [187 (150-253) vs 236 (190-275) μm, P = 0.22; 180 (138-200) vs 210 (161-305) μm, P = 0.22]. Histological changes differed significantly between the pulmonary vessels after division using the LSB. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons should consider that dividing the pulmonary vessels with a vessel-sealing device might have more histological impact on the layers of the wall of the PA than on those of the PV, although it remains unclear whether these findings constitute a clinical risk.","Yoshiya, Tomoharu; Mimae, Takahiro; Tsubokawa, Norifumi; Sasada, Shinsuke; Tsutani, Yasuhiro; Kushitani, Kei; Takeshima, Yukio; Miyata, Yoshihiro; Okada, Morihito",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivy072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29566156/,496

The psycho-immune-neuroendocrine (PINE) network comprises central nervous, immune, endocrine and autonomic systems, integrating biological mechanisms of MDD. Such networks exhibit recurrent motifs with specific functions, including positive and negative feedback loops, and are subject to critical transitions, influenced by feedback loop transitions (FLTs). AIMS We aim to identify critical feedback loops and their FLTs, as well sentinel network nodes (SNNs), key network nodes that drive FLTs, within the PINE network. Examples of biomarkers are provided which may reflect early warning signs of impending critical transition to MDD. RESULTS Disruption of homeostatic feedback loops reflects the physiological transition to MDD. Putative FLTs are identified within hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-parasympathetic axes, the kynurenine pathway, gut function and dysbiosis. CONCLUSIONS Progression from health to disease is driven by FLTs in the PINE network, which is likely to undergo changes characteristic of system instability.

The situation required a rapid development of molecular and serological tests to enable mass screening, testing of high-risk groups, and establishing epidemiological data. Knowledge of diagnostic methods is continuously evolving, so it is crucial to understand the nature of the tests and to be able to interpret their results. This review discusses the current literature on diagnostic methods, prognostic markers, diagnostic recommendations, choice of the appropriate test, type of biological material, and interpretation of results depending on test sensitivity and disease duration. Also, the percentage of positive results in the selected countries at two distant time points of the epidemic was analyzed. Further development of diagnostic techniques and incorporation of new technologies can provide more accurate and faster tools for control the epidemic.","Klimek-Tulwin, Monika; Duma, Dariusz; Wojtysiak-Duma, Beata; Solski, Janusz",Postepy biochemii,https://doi.org/10.18388/pb.2020_365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33470070/,496

Several studies have demonstrated chronic pain after groin hernia repair but long-term complaints have been only scarcely studied. This study was undertaken to investigate long-term pain and discomfort after open repair for small umbilical or epigastric hernias. METHODS This is a retrospective study with prospective long-term follow-up. Only elective primary umbilical or epigastric hernias with an open mesh or sutured repair were included. A structured follow-up questionnaire was sent to all patients regarding verbal rating scores (VRS) of pain and discomfort (no, little, moderate, or severe) and recurrence. Patients with suspected recurrence were clinically examined. RESULTS There were 139 eligible patients, and 132 patients answered the questionnaire (95 % response rate). The median follow-up time was 36 months (range 15-85), and defect size was 1.0 cm (0.2-8.0). Sixteen patients reported moderate or severe pain and/or discomfort (12 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 6-18). The cumulated risk of recurrence was 11.5 %. Of the 15 patients with clinical recurrence or reoperation for recurrence, 5 patients reported moderate/severe complaints (31 %) whereas 11 of the remaining 116 patients with no recurrence (10 %) reported moderate/severe complaints (P = 0.014). CONCLUSION Surprisingly, many patients complained about pain and discomfort 3 years after elective repair for a small umbilical or epigastric hernia.","Erritzøe-Jervild, L; Christoffersen, M W; Helgstrand, F; Bisgaard, T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-012-0960-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22797701/,496

Our objective was to compare two laparoscopic techniques for closure of the NSS in twenty-eight horses diagnosed with nephrosplenic entrapment. Medical records of horses that had laparoscopic NSS ablation in two referral centers between 2017-2019 were retrieved. Duration of surgery, complications, and short- and long-term follow-up information were collected and compared. Costs were also calculated and compared. All horses met the inclusion criteria: 9 had NSS ablation with a mesh implant (group M), 19 with barbed suture material (group B). One horse in group B had recurrent colic after discharge. At control laparoscopy after 5 months, the NSS resulted in still not being ablated because of a failure of the suture. In group M, three horses had recurrent colic. One was successfully treated medically, one died of unknown causes and the third required a second laparoscopic suturing at 3-6 months because of failure of the mesh implant. The mean time of surgery and costs were lower in group B compared to group M. The barbed suture technique was faster, more cost-effective and had a lower complication rate than the mesh implant.","Gialletti, Rodolfo; Nannarone, Sara; Gandini, Marco; Cerullo, Anna; Bertoletti, Alice; Scilimati, Nicola; Giusto, Gessica",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11041096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921312/,496
128403,Guidelines for institutions granting bariatric privileges utilizing laparoscopic techniques. Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons Guidelines Committee.,2011,"BACKGROUND Previous studies carried out in different countries have indicated that young adults experienced higher levels of emotional distress, in the form of depressive and anxiety symptoms, than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which pandemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. PURPOSE The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in four age groups in the Polish population during the COVID-19 lockdown; (ii) differences in perceived difficulties related to the pandemic in these groups; and (iii) which factors and difficulties related to the pandemic are the best predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHOD A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The sample was representative of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed the following online: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, a Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, a Social Support Scale, and a Scale of Pandemic-Related Difficulties. RESULTS Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Household relationship difficulties were among the most significant predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus was one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18 and 29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms exclusively in the youngest group. CONCLUSIONS The youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members are the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. It is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the various challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gambin, Małgorzata; Sękowski, Marcin; Woźniak-Prus, Małgorzata; Wnuk, Anna; Oleksy, Tomasz; Cudo, Andrzej; Hansen, Karolina; Huflejt-Łukasik, Mirosława; Kubicka, Karolina; Łyś, Agnieszka Ewa; Gorgol, Joanna; Holas, Paweł; Kmita, Grażyna; Łojek, Emilia; Maison, Dominika",Comprehensive psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33388494/,496

The system achieves superior rate-distortion performances over the best of existing image compression methods, including BPG, WebP, FLIF and recent CNN codecs, in both ℓ2 and ℓ∞ error metrics, for bit rates near or above the threshold of perceptually transparent reconstruction. These remarkable coding gains are made by deep learning for compression artifact removal. A restoration CNN is designed to map a lossy compressed image to its original. Its unique strength is to enforce a tight error bound on a per pixel basis. As such, no small distinctive structures of the original image can be dropped or distorted, even if they are statistical outliers that are otherwise sacrificed by mainstream CNN restoration methods.","Zhang, Xi; Wu, Xiaolin",IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,https://doi.org/10.1109/tip.2020.3040074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33264093/,496

This was a retrospective cohort study carried out at the reproductive endocrinology and gynecologic oncology divisions at two academic medical centers. RA-LESS myomectomy was performed with the da Vinci Si Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) employing standard rigid 8 or 5 mm instrumentation in a coaxial arrangement through a standard laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) port (GelPOINT Advanced Access Platform, Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA). Cases were completed between October 2011 and November 2013. Twenty-one patients underwent surgery. Mean age (±SD) was 38.1 ± 5.8 years, and mean BMI was 29.4 ± 4.7 kg/m2. Menorrhagia, pelvic pressure, and urinary frequency were the main presenting symptoms. Mean diameter of the largest tumor was 5.7 ± 1.9 cm (median 5.9 cm, range 2.1-9.5 cm), while mean number of tumors removed was 2.2 ± 1.8, ranging from 1 to 8 per surgery. Mean operative time was 154.2 ± 55.2 min (median 152 min, range 85-290 min). Mean blood loss was 57.9 ± 53.7 cc (median 50 cc, range 5-200 cc) and length of hospital stay ranged between 0 and 3 days (median 0). All procedures were successfully performed without conversion to conventional LESS surgery, multi-port laparoscopy or laparotomy. RA-LESS myomectomy with coaxial use of standard rigid instrumentation is a safe and reproducible addition to the minimally invasive surgeons' armamentarium, with excellent cosmetic and postoperative outcomes in selected patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The calcification insert of an anthropomorphic cardiac phantom was replaced with an aortic aneurysm model containing a stent, simulated endoleaks, and an intraluminal thrombus. CT was performed at tube energies of 120, 100, and 80 kVp with incrementally increasing noise indexes (NIs) of 16, 25, 34, 43, 52, 61, and 70 and a 2.5-mm section thickness. NI directly controls radiation exposure; a higher NI allows for greater image noise and decreases radiation. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and hybrid and fully iterative algorithms. Five radiologists independently analyzed lesion conspicuity to assess sensitivity and specificity. Mean attenuation (in Hounsfield units) and standard deviation were measured in the aorta to calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Attenuation and SNR of different protocols and algorithms were analyzed with analysis of variance or Welch test depending on data distribution. RESULTS Both sensitivity and specificity were 100% for simulated lesions on images with 2.5-mm section thickness and an NI of 25 (3.45 mGy), 34 (1.83 mGy), or 43 (1.16 mGy) at 120 kVp; an NI of 34 (1.98 mGy), 43 (1.23 mGy), or 61 (0.61 mGy) at 100 kVp; and an NI of 43 (1.46 mGy) or 70 (0.54 mGy) at 80 kVp. SNR values showed similar results. With the fully iterative algorithm, mean attenuation of the aorta decreased significantly in reduced-dose protocols in comparison with control protocols at 100 kVp (311 HU at 16 NI vs 290 HU at 70 NI, P ≤ .0011) and 80 kVp (400 HU at 16 NI vs 369 HU at 70 NI, P ≤ .0007). CONCLUSION Endoleaks and in-stent thrombus of thoracic aorta were detectable to 1.46 mGy (80 kVp) with FBP, 1.23 mGy (100 kVp) with the hybrid algorithm, and 0.54 mGy (80 kVp) with the fully iterative algorithm.","Deák, Zsuzsanna; Grimm, Jochen M; Mueck, Fabian; Geyer, Lucas L; Treitl, Marcus; Reiser, Maximilian F; Wirth, Stefan",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.13130740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475853/,496

OBJECTIVES To investigate the changes of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level in patients with COVID-19 and assess its value in the evaluation and prognosis of this disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS This paper is a cross-sectional retrospective study. Eighty-six severe COVID-19 patients, 132 non-severe COVID-19 patients and 76 healthy individuals (control group) were recruited to measure triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using enzyme-coupled colorimetry. RESULTS The serum HDL-C level in COVID-19 group was 1.02 ±0.28 mmol/L which was significantly lower than in control group (1.52 ±0.55 mmol/L) (p < 0.05). In addition, the serum HDL-C level in severe COVID-19 group was 0.83 ±1.67 mmol/L, which was significantly lower than that in non-severe COVID-19 group (1.15 ±0.27 mmol/L) (p < 0.05).

Subtype OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is the more prevalent human coronavirus in several parts of the world. Recent studies have suggested these viruses can cause severe lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, outcomes and severity of illness associated with HCoV-OC43 infections in a pediatric population. METHODS We retrospectively identified patients with positive HCoV-OC43 respiratory specimens between December 2009 and December 2010 in a pediatric hospital in Montreal. Each case was compared with 2 controls (tested negative for HCoV-OC43). Clinical characteristics, underlying conditions, outcomes and disease severity were reviewed for both groups. Risk factors and independent predictors of disease severity were also assessed. RESULTS During the study period, 68 patients were identified as infected with HCoV-OC43 (1.8% of specimens tested, 4.2% of all respiratory viruses identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). The majority (77%) occurred in November 2010. Chief symptoms of HCoV-OC43 infection were fever (in 78% of cases), cough (67%) and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (57%). HCoV-OC43 infection was not more frequent in children with preexisting conditions. Coinfection with other respiratory viruses was associated with lower respiratory tract infections in HCoV-OC43-infected cases, but did not lead to increased rates of hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit or death. CONCLUSIONS In our population, HCoV-OC43 infections generally caused upper respiratory tract infection, but can be associated with lower respiratory tract infection especially in those coinfected with other respiratory viruses.","Jean, Andréanne; Quach, Caroline; Yung, Allison; Semret, Makeda",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3182812787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23337903/,496

Its organelles and constituents vary between different cell types, but endolysosomal proteases are key components of this compartment in all cells. In immune cells, these proteases function in pathogen recognition and elimination, signal processing and cell homeostasis, and they are regulated by dedicated inhibitors. Pathogens can produce analogous proteases to subvert the host immune response. The balance in activity between a protease and its inhibitor can tune the immune response or cause damage as a result of mislocalized proteolysis. In this Review, we highlight recent developments in this area and emphasize the importance of studying the role of endolysosomal proteases, and their natural inhibitors, in the initiation and regulation of immune responses.","Bird, Phillip I; Trapani, Joseph A; Villadangos, José A",Nature reviews.

Topical analgesics offer the potential to provide the same analgesic relief provided by oral analgesics but with minimal adverse systemic effects. This article describes the results of a systematic review of the efficacy of topical analgesics in the management of acute and chronic pain conditions. A literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed was conducted using the keywords topical analgesic AND chronic pain OR acute pain OR neuropathic pain and focused only on individual clinical trials published in English-language journals. The search identified 92 articles, of which 65 were eligible for inclusion in the review. The most commonly studied topical analgesics were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=27), followed by lidocaine (n=9), capsaicin (n=6), amitriptyline (n=5), glyceryl trinitrate (n=3), opioids (n=2), menthol (n=2), pimecrolimus (n=2), and phenytoin (n=2). The most common indications were acute soft tissue injuries (n=18), followed by neuropathic pain (n=17), experimental pain (n=6), osteoarthritis and other chronic joint-related conditions (n=5), skin or leg ulcers (n=5), and chronic knee pain (n=2). Strong evidence was identified for the use of topical diclofenac and topical ibuprofen in the treatment of acute soft tissue injuries or chronic joint-related conditions, such as osteoarthritis. Evidence also supports the use of topical lidocaine in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Currently, limited evidence is available to support the use of other topical analgesics in acute and chronic pain.","Argoff, Charles E",Mayo Clinic proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.11.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374622/,496

To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement 'I know a lot about ticks` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves 'outdoorsy', results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy.","Bron, Gebbiena M; Fenelon, Hannah; Paskewitz, Susan M",Journal of medical entomology,https://doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128056/,496

However, clinical laboratory professionals rarely know whether patient specimens contain infectious agents, making ensuring biosafety while performing testing procedures challenging. The importance of biosafety in clinical laboratories was highlighted during the 2014 Ebola outbreak, where concerns about biosafety resulted in delayed diagnoses and contributed to patient deaths. This review is a collaboration between subject matter experts from large and small laboratories and the federal government to evaluate the capability of clinical laboratories to manage biosafety risks and safely test patient specimens. We discuss the complexity of clinical laboratories, including anatomic pathology, and describe how applying current biosafety guidance may be difficult as these guidelines, largely based on practices in research laboratories, do not always correspond to the unique clinical laboratory environments and their specialized equipment and processes. We retrospectively describe the biosafety gaps and opportunities for improvement in the areas of risk assessment and management; automated and manual laboratory disciplines; specimen collection, processing, and storage; test utilization; equipment and instrumentation safety; disinfection practices; personal protective equipment; waste management; laboratory personnel training and competency assessment; accreditation processes; and ethical guidance. Also addressed are the unique biosafety challenges successfully handled by a Texas community hospital clinical laboratory that performed testing for patients with Ebola without a formal biocontainment unit. The gaps in knowledge and practices identified in previous and ongoing outbreaks demonstrate the need for collaborative, comprehensive solutions to improve clinical laboratory biosafety and to better combat future emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","Cornish, Nancy E; Anderson, Nancy L; Arambula, Diego G; Arduino, Matthew J; Bryan, Andrew; Burton, Nancy C; Chen, Bin; Dickson, Beverly A; Giri, Judith G; Griffith, Natasha K; Pentella, Michael A; Salerno, Reynolds M; Sandhu, Paramjit; Snyder, James W; Tormey, Christopher A; Wagar, Elizabeth A; Weirich, Elizabeth G; Campbell, Sheldon",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00126-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105993/,496
132087,"Needlescopic surgery for liver, gallbladder and spleen diseases.",2011,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the admission characteristics and hospital outcomes for patients admitted with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in Northern Queensland. METHODS We perform a retrospective analysis of the data covering an 11-year period, 2006-2016. Length of hospital stay (LOS) is modelled by negative binomial regression and heterogeneous effects are checked using interaction terms. RESULTS A total of 11,726 patients were admitted due to LRTI; 2,430 (20.9%) were of Indigenous descent. We found higher hospitalisations due to LRTI for Indigenous than non-Indigenous patients, with a disproportionate increase in hospitalisations occurring during winter. The LOS for Indigenous patients was higher by 2.5 days [95%CI: -0.15; 5.05] than for non-Indigenous patients. The average marginal effect of 17.5 [95%CI: 15.3; 29.7] implies that the LOS for a patient, who was admitted to ICU, was higher by 17.5 days. CONCLUSIONS We highlighted the increased burden of LRTIs experienced by Indigenous populations, with this information potentially being useful for enhancing community-level policy making. Implications for public health: Future guidelines can use these results to make recommendations for preventative measures in Indigenous communities. Improvements in engagement and partnership with Indigenous communities and consumers can help increase healthcare uptake and reduce the burden of respiratory diseases.","Pak, Anton; Adegboye, Oyelola A; Eisen, Damon P; McBryde, Emma S",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/1753-6405.13104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900652/,496

Synergistic interactions between these stressors could substantially amplify the environmental effect of these stressors and could therefore have important implications for policy decisions that aim to improve the health of pollinators3,8,9. Here, to quantitatively assess the scale of this threat, we conducted a meta-analysis of 356 interaction effect sizes from 90 studies in which bees were exposed to combinations of agrochemicals, nutritional stressors and/or parasites. We found an overall synergistic effect between multiple stressors on bee mortality. Subgroup analysis of bee mortality revealed strong evidence for synergy when bees were exposed to multiple agrochemicals at field-realistic levels, but interactions were not greater than additive expectations when bees were exposed to parasites and/or nutritional stressors. All interactive effects on proxies of fitness, behaviour, parasite load and immune responses were either additive or antagonistic; therefore, the potential mechanisms that drive the observed synergistic interactions for bee mortality remain unclear. Environmental risk assessment schemes that assume additive effects of the risk of agrochemical exposure may underestimate the interactive effect of anthropogenic stressors on bee mortality and will fail to protect the pollinators that provide a key ecosystem service that underpins sustainable agriculture.","Siviter, Harry; Bailes, Emily J; Martin, Callum D; Oliver, Thomas R; Koricheva, Julia; Leadbeater, Ellouise; Brown, Mark J F",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03787-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349259/,496
132690,Early anastomotic complications in colorectal surgery: a systematic review of techniques for endoscopic salvage.,2019,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS The aim of this study was to assess the 36-month safety and efficacy of a lightweight polypropylene mesh used for the transvaginal repair of stage III-IV cystocele. METHODS A multicenter prospective cohort study was performed. Preoperative assessment included an interview and evaluation with the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system. Inclusion criteria were stage III-IV cystocele and no contraindications for mesh use. A lightweight (28 g/m(2)) four-arm transobturator polypropylene mesh was used for the study. Pre- and postoperative symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Urinary Symptoms Measurement (MHU), Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7), and Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). The main endpoint was mesh safety. Secondary endpoints were anatomic (Ba point ≤ -1) and functional success. RESULTS In all, 111 patients with a mean age of 67 ± 9 years (range 47-89) were included in the study, and 94 (84.7%) were included in the analysis. Two intraoperative complications occurred (one bladder and one rectal injury, 2.2%). Medium-term analysis of 79 patients (84%) after 36 months showed a satisfaction rate of 98.7% (78/79), a mesh contraction rate of 5.1% (4/78), only one case of vaginal mesh exposure (1.3%), no cases of chronic pelvic pain, and a postoperative dyspareunia rate of 2.8% (1/36). The anatomic success rate of cystocele repair was 75/79 (94.9%) and a highly significant improvement was noted for symptoms and on quality of life questionnaires. Overall, 7/79 patients (8.9%) were reoperated, including 1 for hemorrhage, 1 for vaginal mesh exposure, 3 for stress urinary incontinence, and 2 for cystocele recurrence (2.5%). CONCLUSION Transvaginal cystocele repair using a lightweight transobturator polypropylene mesh was safe and efficient in the medium term. Long-term data and comparative studies are needed.","de Tayrac, Renaud; Brouziyne, Majid; Priou, Gérard; Devoldère, Guy; Marie, Gérard; Renaudie, Joël",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-015-2659-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25731722/,496

The electrophysiological properties of previously MRgFUS-sonicated thalamic neurons have not yet been described. We report on an ET patient who underwent an MRgFUS thalamotomy but experienced tremor recurrence. We expanded the MRgFUS-induced thalamic cavity using radiofrequency (RF), with good effect on the tremor but transient sensorimotor deficits and permanent ataxia. This is the first report of a patient undergoing RF thalamotomy after an unsuccessful MRgFUS thalamotomy. As we used microelectrode recording to guide the RF thalamotomy, we could also study for the first time the electrophysiological properties of previously sonicated thalamic neurons bordering the MRgFUS-induced cavity. These neurons displayed electrophysiological characteristics identical to those recorded from nonsonicated thalamic cells in ET patients. Hence, our findings support the widespread assumption that sonication below the necrotic threshold does not permanently alter neuronal function.","De Vloo, Philippe; Milosevic, Luka; Gramer, Robert Matthew; Dallapiazza, Robert F; Lee, Darrin J; Fasano, Alfonso; Hutchison, William D; Lozano, Andres M; Schwartz, Michael L; Kalia, Suneil K",Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937628/,496

The purpose of this study was to compare FSD in different types of renal replacement therapy and control patients. METHODS The study was consisted of 47 renal transplantation (RT), 46 hemodialysis (HD), and 28 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and 36 healthy control subjects. All groups were evaluated with the following scales: Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Demographic data, laboratory values, and hormone levels were obtained. The patients with FSFI score <26.55 were accepted as experiencing sexual dysfunction. RESULTS Overall, total FSFI scores in RT, HD, CAPD, and control were 22 (range, 2-35), 22.4 (4-34), 18.35 (2-34), and 29.6 (2-35), respectively. The mean total FSFI score was not different in patients receiving different kinds of renal replacement therapy (P > .05) although they were significantly worse then the control group (P < .001). On regression analysis, age was significantly associated with FSD (β = -0.14; P = .001). In addition, the physiologic health domain of SF-36 was significantly better in control groups (P < .001). The difference in terms of mean of BDI score did not reach statistical significance among patient groups (P > .05). Female sexual dysfunction score was negatively correlated with BDI (r = -0.371; P < .001) and positively correlated with the mental-physical components score of SF-36 (r = 0.423 [P < .001] and r = 0.494 [P < .001], respectively) in all patients groups. Regarding the hormones of the patients, there was a significant difference between RT and the HD and CAPD groups in dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS; P < .001), RT and HD in prolactin (P < .001), and RT and CAPD in free testesterone (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Renal transplantation, hemodialysis, and peritoneal dialysis patients were at more risk of developing sexual dysfunction and lower quality of life scores than healthy subjects. Notably, the mode of renal replacement therapy had no impact on female sexual function.","Altunoglu, A; Yavuz, D; Canoz, M Batur; Yavuz, R; Karakaş, Latife A; Bayraktar, N; Colak, T; Sezer, S; Ozdemir, F Nurhan; Haberal, M",Transplantation proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2014.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935332/,496

Several therapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of Covid-19, but none have yet been shown to be efficacious. Remdesivir (GS-5734), an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase with inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), was identified early as a promising therapeutic candidate for Covid-19 because of its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.

133959,Single-incision thoracoscopic surgery for primary spontaneous pneumothorax.,2011,"An estimated 1 million people in the United States have functional or anatomic asplenia or hyposplenia. Infectious complications due to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae can lead to fulminant sepsis and death, particularly in young children, in the period shortly after splenectomy, and in immunocompromised patients. Patients with asplenia are also at risk for less common infections due to Capnocytophaga, Babesia, and malaria. Antibiotic prophylaxis, vaccines, and patient and family education are the mainstays of prevention in these at-risk patients. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis typically target high-risk periods, such as 1 to 3 years after splenectomy, children ≤5 years of age, or patients with concomitant immunocompromise. However, the risk for sepsis is lifelong, with infections occurring as late as 40 years after splenectomy. Currently available vaccines recommended for patients with asplenia include pneumococcal vaccines (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine), meningococcal vaccines (meningococcal conjugate vaccines for serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 and serogroup B meningococcal vaccines), H. influenzae type b vaccines, and inactivated influenza vaccines. Ongoing booster doses are also recommended for pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines to maintain protection. Despite the availability of prevention tools, adherence is often a challenge. Dedicated teams or clinics focused on patient education and monitoring have demonstrated substantial improvements in vaccine coverage rates for individuals with asplenia and reduced risk of infection. Future efforts to monitor the quality of care in patients with asplenia may be important to bridge the know-do gap in this high-risk population.","Lee, Grace M",Hematology.

134086,Laparoscopic liver resection for malignant and benign lesions: ten-year Norwegian single-center experience.,2010,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) remains a common cause of infectious disease in dogs, particularly in high-density housing situations such as shelters. Vaccination of all dogs against CDV is recommended at the time of admission to animal shelters and many use a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. From a diagnostic standpoint for dogs with suspected CDV infection, this is problematic because highly sensitive diagnostic real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are able to detect MLV virus in clinical samples. Real-time PCR can be used to quantitate amount of virus shedding and can differentiate vaccine strains from wild-type strains when shedding is high. However, differentiation by quantitation is not possible in vaccinated animals during acute infection, when shedding is low and could be mistaken for low level vaccine virus shedding. While there are gel-based RT-PCR assays for differentiation of vaccine strains from field strains based on sequence differences, the sensitivity of these assays is unable to match that of the real-time RT-PCR assay currently used in the authors' laboratory. Therefore, a real-time RT-PCR assay was developed that detects CDV MLV vaccine strains and distinguishes them from wild-type strains based on nucleotide sequence differences, rather than the amount of viral RNA in the sample. The test is highly sensitive, with detection of as few as 5 virus genomic copies (corresponding to 10(-1) TCID(50)). Sequencing of the DNA real-time products also allows phylogenetic differentiation of the wild-type strains. This test will aid diagnosis during outbreaks of CDV in recently vaccinated animals.","Wilkes, Rebecca P; Sanchez, Elena; Riley, Matthew C; Kennedy, Melissa A","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638713517232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24532693/,496

The purpose of this report is to highlight differences in protocols among US state laboratories. We circulated a survey to state laboratory directors requesting qualitative and quantitative information about individual screening programs. Qualitative and quantitative information provided by 17 state programs were available for analysis. Disease prevalence ranged from 1:9941 to 1:28,661 live births. Four state laboratories mandated a second screen regardless of the initial screening results; most others did so for infants in intensive care units. All but one program utilized birthweight cut-points, but cutoffs varied widely: 17OHP values of 25 to 75 ng/mL for birthweights >2250-2500 g. The positive predictive values for normal birthweight infants varied from 0.7% to 50%, with the highest predictive values based in two of the states with a mandatory second screen.

They are involved in various physiological events, such as protein degradation, development, and host defense. However, the characterization and functional roles of aspartic proteinases remain to be elucidated in crustaceans. Here, we characterized a fragment of cathepsin D-like cDNA from red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Pc-cathepsin D-like). The open reading frame of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene contained 1152 bp, encoding a protein of 383 amino acid residues. We also evaluated the immunological role of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene in vivo. Spatial distribution analysis revealed that the Pc-cathepsin D-like mRNA was high in the hepatopancreas, followed by the gut, gills, and hemocytes of P. clarkii. The expression levels of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene increased following challenge with viral (polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid) and bacterial (lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycan) PAMPs compared with PBS injection. The suppression of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene by RNA interference significantly increased the expression of immune-associated genes. These results showed that the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene has an essential biological role in innate immune responses because it regulates the expression of immune-associated genes.","Huang, Long; Wu, Ben-Li; He, Ji-Xiang; Zhang, Ye; Chen, Jing; Chen, Xia-Jun",Genome,https://doi.org/10.1139/gen-2020-0154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323597/,496

A series of experimental tests were carried out under different drilling conditions (vc/vf), monitoring the thrust force (Fz), torque (T), and electric power (EP), to define which one can help more for industrial daily life production. Results validation was carried out using the analysis of variance, in order to relate main machining parameters cutting speed and linear feed, with thrust force, drilling torque, main spindle electric power and hole quality parameters (average roughness, cylindricity and diameter). The conclusions show that thrust force is not proportional to the cutting speed and the best combinations of cutting speed and feed were found out around the average values of tested parameters.

A phylogeographic analysis shows that DWV is globally distributed in honeybees, having recently spread from a common source, the European honeybee Apis mellifera. DWV exhibits epidemic growth and transmission that is predominantly mediated by European and North American honeybee populations and driven by trade and movement of honeybee colonies. DWV is now an important reemerging pathogen of honeybees, which are undergoing a worldwide manmade epidemic fueled by the direct transmission route that the Varroa mite provides.","Wilfert, L; Long, G; Leggett, H C; Schmid-Hempel, P; Butlin, R; Martin, S J M; Boots, M",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aac9976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26912700/,496

To reduce disease transmission, national regulatory agencies temporarily recommended curtailment of all nonurgent office visits and elective surgeries in March 2020, including vitreoretinal outpatient care in the USA. The effect of these guidelines on utilization of vitreoretinal care has not been explored to date. RECENT FINDINGS Retinal outpatient visits, new patient visits, intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections and in-office multimodal retinal imaging has seen a significant decline in utilization in the early phase of the pandemic. Intravitreal injections were performed at a comparatively higher rate than office visits. Utilization appeared to steadily increase in April 2020. Telemedicine visits, enabled by new national legislation for all areas of medicine, have been adopted to a modest degree by the retina community.

135468,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy for malignant tumors.,2012,"OBJECTIVE Pressure ulcers (PUs) involve the destruction of skin and underlying tissue due to prolonged pressure and shear forces. These ulcers are painful and significantly reduce a person's quality of life. PUs are also expensive to manage and impact negatively on the achievement of cost-effective, efficient care delivery. METHOD Prone positioning is a postural therapy that aims to enhance respiratory function through increasing oxygenation levels. In contemporary clinical practice, ventilation in the prone position is indicated for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, despite its advantages in terms of respiratory function, several studies have examined complications of prone position ventilation and have identified PUs (facial PUs as well as PUs on other weight-bearing areas of the body) as a frequent complication in patients who are already in a precarious medical situation. International data suggest that up to 57% of patients nursed in the prone position develop a PU. The aim of this clinical review is to identify and review evidence-based recommendations developed to facilitate the selection and application of preventive interventions aimed at reducing PU development in patients ventilated in the prone position. Given the current COVID-19 crisis, this review is timely as intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 require ventilation in the prone position at a level that is disproportionate to the general intensive care population. Up to 28% of patients admitted to the ICU with confirmed infection due to severe COVID-19 are cared for in the prone position. The scope of this review is limited to adult individuals only. RESULTS The skin assessment should be undertaken before proning and following positioning the patient back into the supine position. Although it is essential to keep the skin clean and moisturised, using pH-balanced cleansers, there is inconsistency in terms of the evidence to support the type of moisturiser. Use of positioning devices in addition to repositioning is recommended to offload pressure points on the face and body. Further, using dressings such as hydrocolloids, transparent film and silicone may be of benefit in decreasing facial skin breakdown. CONCLUSION Given the importance of PU prevention in this cohort of patients, adopting a focused prevention strategy, including skin assessment and care, offloading and pressure redistribution, and dressings for prevention may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of these largely preventable wounds.","Moore, Zena; Patton, Declan; Avsar, Pinar; McEvoy, Natalie L; Curley, Gerard; Budri, Aglecia; Nugent, Linda; Walsh, Simone; O'Connor, Tom",Journal of wound care,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2020.29.6.312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530776/,496

We evaluated outcomes of coiling with and without stents in the multicenter Matrix and Platinum Science Trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients in the Matrix and Platinum Science Trial with unruptured intracranial aneurysms treated per protocol were included. Baseline patient and aneurysm characteristics, procedural details, neurologic outcomes, angiographic outcomes, and safety data were analyzed. RESULTS Overall, 137 of 361 (38%) patients were treated with a stent. Stent-coiled aneurysms had wider necks (≥4 mm in 62% with stents versus 33% without, P < .0001) and lower dome-to-neck ratios (1.3 versus 1.8, P < .0001). Periprocedural serious adverse events occurred infrequently in those treated with and without stents (6.6% versus 4.5%, P = .39). At 1 year, total significant adverse events, mortality, and worsening of mRS were similar in treatment groups, but ischemic strokes were more common in stent-coiled patients than in coiled patients (8.8% versus 2.2%, P = .005). However, multivariate analysis confirmed that at 2 years after treatment, prior cerebrovascular accident (OR, 4.7; P = .0089) and aneurysm neck width ≥4 mm (OR, 4.5; P = .02) were the only independent predictors of ischemic stroke. Stent use was not an independent predictor of ischemic stroke at 2 years (OR, 1.1; P = .94). Stent use did not predict target aneurysm recurrence at 2 years, but aneurysm dome size ≥10 mm (OR, 9.94; P < .0001) did predict target aneurysm recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Stent-coiling had similar outcomes as coiling despite stented aneurysms having more difficult morphology than coiled aneurysms. Increased ischemic events in stent-coiled aneurysms were attributable to baseline risk factors and aneurysm morphology.","Hetts, S W; Turk, A; English, J D; Dowd, C F; Mocco, J; Prestigiacomo, C; Nesbit, G; Ge, S G; Jin, J N; Carroll, K; Murayama, Y; Gholkar, A; Barnwell, S; Lopes, D; Johnston, S C; McDougall, C",AJNR.

Changes in cerebral oxygenation resulting from the interaction of inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2), end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), and anesthetic choice have not been fully evaluated in anesthetized patients in the beach chair position. METHODS This is a prospective interventional within-group study of patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the beach chair position that incorporated a randomized comparison between two anesthetics. Fifty-six patients were randomized to receive desflurane or total intravenous anesthesia with propofol. Following induction of anesthesia and positioning, FIO2 and minute ventilation were sequentially adjusted for all patients. Regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) was the primary outcome and was recorded at each of five set points. RESULTS While maintaining FIO2 at 0.3 and PETCO2 at 30 mmHg, there was a decrease in rSO2 from 68% (SD, 12) to 61% (SD, 12) (P < 0.001) following beach chair positioning. The combined interventions of increasing FIO2 to 1.0 and increasing PETCO2 to 45 mmHg resulted in a 14% point improvement in rSO2 to 75% (SD, 12) (P <0.001) for patients anesthetized in the beach chair position. There was no significant interaction effect of the anesthetic at the study intervention points. CONCLUSIONS Increasing FIO2 and PETCO2 resulted in a significant increase in rSO2 that overcomes desaturation in patients anesthetized in the beach chair position and that appears independent of anesthetic choice.","Picton, Paul; Dering, Andrew; Alexander, Amir; Neff, Mary; Miller, Bruce S; Shanks, Amy; Housey, Michelle; Mashour, George A",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26244887/,496

Microtubules were required for virus entry into cells, as evidenced using virus pseudotypes presenting HCV envelope proteins on their surface. Studies carried out using the recent infectious HCV model revealed that microtubules also play an essential role in early, postfusion steps of the virus cycle. Moreover, low concentrations of vinblastin and nocodazol, microtubule-affecting drugs, and paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules, inhibited infection, suggesting that microtubule dynamic instability and/or treadmilling mechanisms are involved in HCV internalization and early transport. By protein chip and direct core-dependent pull-down assays, followed by mass spectrometry, we identified beta- and alpha-tubulin as cellular partners of the HCV core protein. Surface plasmon resonance analyses confirmed that core directly binds to tubulin with high affinity via amino acids 2-117. The interaction of core with tubulin in vitro promoted its polymerization and enhanced the formation of microtubules. Immune electron microscopy showed that HCV core associates, at least temporarily, with microtubules polymerized in its presence. Studies by confocal microscopy showed a juxtaposition of core with microtubules in HCV-infected cells. In summary, we report that intact and dynamic microtubules are required for virus entry into cells and for early postfusion steps of infection. HCV may exploit a direct interaction of core with tubulin, enhancing microtubule polymerization, to establish efficient infection and promote virus transport and/or assembly in infected cells.","Roohvand, Farzin; Maillard, Patrick; Lavergne, Jean-Pierre; Boulant, Steeve; Walic, Marine; Andréo, Ursula; Goueslain, Lucie; Helle, François; Mallet, Adeline; McLauchlan, John; Budkowska, Agata",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m807873200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19269968/,496

The objective of this transdiagnostic analysis was to examine the effect of benzodiazepines on treatment outcomes in older patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS Secondary analyses of data from 2 clinical trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy for GAD (escitalopram vs placebo, 2006-2009) or MDD (open treatment with venlafaxine, 2009-2014) were conducted. Participants included 640 adults aged 60+ years with DSM-IV-defined GAD (n = 177) or MDD (n = 463). Benzodiazepine data were collected at baseline. Adherence and treatment response were assessed over 12 weeks. The analysis addressed whether coprescribed benzodiazepines are associated with treatment response, antidepressant medication adherence, dropout, final dose of antidepressant medication, and report of antidepressant-related adverse effects. RESULTS Participants with GAD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were treated with a lower mean dosage of escitalopram and were less likely to complete the trial; there was no difference in adherence or treatment response. Participants with MDD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were less likely to tolerate a therapeutic dose of venlafaxine and reported more medication-related adverse effects; there was no difference in adherence, dropout, or treatment response. CONCLUSIONS Coprescription of benzodiazepines was associated with increased dropout in older patients with GAD and more medication-related adverse effects in older patients with MDD. However, with the systematic clinical attention offered in a clinical trial, they do not impede treatment response. Clinicians should be aware that a coprescribed benzodiazepine may be a marker of a more challenging treatment course.

This is especially relevant for adolescents. Educational institutions are promoters of healthy habits through the organisation of different activities such as extracurricular sports programmes. These activities increase the rates of sports practice among adolescents. The literature shows that the perceived quality of sports and health services is an antecedent of users' behavioural intentions. The aim of this paper is to find out whether communication from educational/sports organisations influences adolescents' intentions to continue engaging in physical activity. A total of 1080 students participated, with a mean age of 13.76 ± 1.39 years, 34.1% of whom were girls. Tests were conducted to verify the validity and reliability of the model that relates communication with value, satisfaction, and future intentions. Tests were conducted to verify the validity (average variance extracted was between 0.754 and 0.583) and reliability (composite reliability was between 0.925 and 0.813) of the model that relates communication with value, satisfaction, and future intentions. Confirmatory analyses and factor invariance tests were performed. The results revealed that communication is an antecedent of value, satisfaction, and future intentions. In conclusion, communication is a good strategy to consolidate sporting habits in both male and female adolescents.","Fernández-Martínez, Antonio; Pérez-Ordás, Raquel; Nuviala, Román; Aznar, Mónica; Porcel-Gálvez, Ana María; Nuviala, Alberto",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640604/,496
137491,An ergonomic study of single-port versus multi-port laparoscopic mesh insertion for ventral hernia repair.,2012,"A crucial bacterial strategy to avoid killing by antibiotics is to enter a growth arrested state, yet the molecular mechanisms behind this process remain elusive. The conditional overexpression of mazF, the endoribonuclease toxin of the MazEF toxin-antitoxin system in Staphylococcus aureus, is one approach to induce bacterial growth arrest, but its targets remain largely unknown. We used overexpression of mazF and high-throughput sequence analysis following the exact mapping of non-phosphorylated transcriptome ends (nEMOTE) technique to reveal in vivo toxin cleavage sites on a global scale. We obtained a catalogue of MazF cleavage sites and unearthed an extended MazF cleavage specificity that goes beyond the previously reported one. We correlated transcript cleavage and abundance in a global transcriptomic profiling during mazF overexpression. We observed that MazF affects RNA molecules involved in ribosome biogenesis, cell wall synthesis, cell division and RNA turnover and thus deliver a plausible explanation for how mazF overexpression induces stasis. We hypothesize that autoregulation of MazF occurs by directly modulating the MazEF operon, such as the rsbUVW genes that regulate the sigma factor SigB, including an observed cleavage site on the MazF mRNA that would ultimately play a role in entry and exit from bacterial stasis.","Sierra, Roberto; Prados, Julien; Panasenko, Olesya O; Andrey, Diego O; Fleuchot, Betty; Redder, Peter; Kelley, William L; Viollier, Patrick H; Renzoni, Adriana",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735661/,496

In this study, a surgical intramedullary tibial insertion was performed using a titanium wire previously inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus in order to develop an osteomyelitis model in a clinically relevant long bone and in absence of any prophylactic treatment. As such, twenty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats received a sterile or inoculated intramedullary biomaterial with either 2 × 106 or 1 × 107 S. aureus colony forming units. Bacterial burden, inflammation, morphological changes, as well as newly formed bone tissues were evaluated for histopathology following a period of either eight or fifteen days of implantation. The implant inoculated in presence of the highest bacterial load was effective to produce significant periprosthetic infection observations in addition to hard and soft tissue inflammation consistent with the development of osteomyelitis. In contrast, neither the sterile nor the low-dose implant inoculation showed inflammation and clinical infection signs, but rather produced an expected bone remodeling and appropriate healing associated with biomaterial implantation.

STUDY DESIGN Case series, retrospective chart review. SETTING Institutional microvascular database. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects who underwent forearm free flaps and FTSGs for donor site reconstruction from April 2016 to November 2017 were included. FTSGs were obtained from the donor forearm with a proximal S-shaped incision, thereby avoiding additional wound creation. Morbidity outcomes were compared to 68 consecutive patients with STSG reconstruction from January 2009 to May 2010. Complications, including tendon exposure, subjective functional impairment, complete graft loss, partial graft loss, infection, paresthesias, and hematoma/seroma, were evaluated, as were aesthetic outcomes. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients underwent FTSG reconstruction. No significant differences between FTSGs and STSGs were demonstrated in terms of graft loss ≥40% (4% vs 4%, P = 1.000), partial graft loss (<40%) (29% vs 40%, P = .207), tendon exposure (9% vs 12%, P = .573), infection (15% vs 13%, P = .805), paresthesias (12% vs 7%, P = .382), subjective functional impairment (0% vs 2%, P = .316), or hematoma/seroma (2% vs 0%, P = .316). Aesthetic outcomes were better in the FTSG group compared to the STSG group, as determined by both patients (P = .004) and surgeon (P < .001).

The interaction of viral spike proteins with their host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical determinant of potential hosts and cross-species transmission. Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to examine 46 ACE2 orthologues from phylogenetically diverse bat species, including those in close and distant contact with humans. We found that 24, 21 and 16 of them failed to support infection by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or both viruses, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed that infection assays in human cells were consistent with those in two bat cell lines. Additionally, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify critical residues in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our results suggest that many bat species may not be the potential hosts of one or both viruses and that no correlation was identified between proximity to humans and probability of being natural hosts of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. This study demonstrates dramatic variation in susceptibility to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection among bat species and adds knowledge towards a better understanding of coronavirus-bat interaction.","Yan, Huan; Jiao, Hengwu; Liu, Qianyun; Zhang, Zhen; Xiong, Qing; Wang, Bing-Jun; Wang, Xin; Guo, Ming; Wang, Lin-Fa; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu; Zhao, Huabin",Nature ecology & evolution,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01407-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649547/,496
138090,"Video-assisted thoracic surgery micro pneumonectomy, a new approach.",2016,"OBJECTIVE To explore the impact of environmental design on doffing personal protective equipment in a simulated healthcare environment. METHODS A mixed-methods approach was used that included human-factors usability testing and qualitative questionnaire responses. A patient room and connecting anteroom were constructed for testing purposes. This experimental doffing area was designed to overcome the environmental failures identified in a previous study and was not constructed based on any generalizable hospital standard. RESULTS In total, 72 healthcare workers from Ontario, Canada, took part in the study and tested the simulated doffing area. The following environmental design changes were tested and were deemed effective: increasing prominence of color-coded zones; securing disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer; outlining disposal bins locations; providing mirrors to detect possible contamination; providing hand rails to assist with doffing; and restricting the space to doff. Further experimentation and iterative design are required with regard to several important features: positioning the disposal bins for safety, decreasing the risk of contamination and user accessibility; optimal positioning of mirrors for safety; communication within the team; and positioning the secondary team member for optimal awareness. Additional design suggestions also emerged during this study, and they require future investigation. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the importance of the environment on doffing personal protective equipment in a healthcare setting. Iterative testing and modification of the design of the environment (doffing area) are important to enhancing healthcare worker safety.

This is particularly important to understand how to potentially enhance the efficacy of psychological interventions for children by incorporating interventions targeting parents. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the specific parent factors that have been examined in the literature and to quantify the associations observed between parent factors and child pain and disability. A search of the electronic databases EMBASE, PsychINFO, Medline and PubMed was conducted, using search terms related to chronic pain, pediatric population and parents. 54 studies met criteria and were included in the review. Parent pain catastrophizing and protective behavior were the most commonly assessed parental constructs in the literature. Meta-analyses were conducted for associations between: parent pain catastrophizing, parent protective behaviors, parent anxiety and depression and parent stress associated with parenting a child with chronic pain with child pain, disability, school functioning and emotional functioning. Correlation coefficients were pooled using the random-effects model. A medium relationship was observed between higher protective behavior and poorer school functioning (r = -0.39); and small relationships were found between higher parent pain catastrophizing and increased child disability (r = 0.29); higher protective behaviors and increased child disability (r = 0.25); and increased parent depression and anxiety with increased child disability (r = 0.23 and r = 0.24 respectively).

Here we present the results of a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature reporting the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The review used the 'Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative' database (comprising 1682 publications related to climate change adaptation responses) that was constructed through systematic literature searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar (2013-2020). For this study, further screening was performed to identify studies from LMICs reporting the effects on human health of climate change adaptation responses. Studies were categorised by study design and data were extracted on geographic region, population under investigation, type of adaptation response and reported health effects. The review identified 99 studies (1117 reported outcomes), reporting evidence from 66 LMICs. Only two studies were ex ante formal evaluations of climate change adaptation responses. Papers reported adaptation responses related to flooding, rainfall, drought and extreme heat, predominantly through behaviour change, and infrastructural and technological improvements. Reported (direct and intermediate) health outcomes included reduction in infectious disease incidence, improved access to water/sanitation and improved food security. All-cause mortality was rarely reported, and no papers were identified reporting on maternal and child health. Reported maladaptations were predominantly related to widening of inequalities and unforeseen co-harms. Reporting and publication-bias seems likely with only 3.5% of all 1117 health outcomes reported to be negative. Our review identified some evidence that climate change adaptation responses may have benefits for human health but the overall paucity of evidence is concerning and represents a major missed opportunity for learning. There is an urgent need for greater focus on the funding, design, evaluation and standardised reporting of the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses to enable evidence-based policy action.","Scheelbeek, Pauline F D; Dangour, Alan D; Jarmul, Stephanie; Turner, Grace; Sietsma, Anne J; Minx, Jan C; Callaghan, Max; Ajibade, Idowu; Austin, Stephanie E; Biesbroek, Robbert; Bowen, Kathryn J; Chen, Tara; Davis, Katy; Ensor, Tim; Ford, James D; Galappaththi, Eranga K; Joe, Elphin T; Musah-Surugu, Issah J; Alverio, Gabriela Nagle; Schwerdtle, Patricia Nayna; Pokharel, Pratik; Salubi, Eunice A; Scarpa, Giulia; Segnon, Alcade C; Siña, Mariella; Templeman, Sienna; Xu, Jiren; Zavaleta-Cortijo, Carol; Berrang-Ford, Lea",Environmental research letters : ERL [Web site],https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac092c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267795/,496

Analysis of 277 elective and urgent colorectal resections.",2011,"BACKGROUND The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of stump closure techniques on pancreatic fistula (PF) focusing on pancreatic thickness after distal pancreatectomy (DP). METHODS A total of 213 patients who underwent DP between 2007 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The risk factors of PF were investigated. RESULTS In all patients, age ≥65 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.60, p = 0.012), operation time ≥300 min (OR: 3.05, p = 0.013) and thickness of transected pancreas (OR: 1.37, p < 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for clinically relevant PF. A receiver operating curve analysis revealed the optimum cut-off values of thickness to be 14 mm with stapler closure and 17 mm with the clamp-crushing method. There were no significant differences regarding PF between the stapler closure and clamp-crushing methods in the thin (<14 mm) and very thick pancreas (≥17 mm) groups (p = 0.822, p = 0.072). In contrast, stapler closure was the only independent risk factor for developing PF in the moderately thick (≥14, <17 mm) pancreas group (OR: 6.75 and p = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSION The clamp-crushing method was superior to stapler closure for pancreatic transection, especially in patients with moderately thick pancreas.","Watanabe, Nobuyuki; Yamamoto, Yusuke; Sugiura, Teiichi; Okamura, Yukiyasu; Ito, Takaaki; Ashida, Ryo; Uesaka, Katsuhiko",Digestive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1159/000505061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986517/,496

This study aimed to implement an actuarial approach to classifying MCI in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) study. Method: ACTIVE study participants (N = 2,755) were classified as cognitively normal (CN) or as having MCI using NP criteria. Estimated proportion of MCI participants and reversion rates were examined as well as baseline characteristics by MCI subtype. Mixed effect models examined associations of MCI subtype with 10-year trajectories of self-reported independence and difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Results: The proportion of MCI participants was estimated to be 18.8%. Of those with MCI at baseline, 19.2% reverted to CN status for all subsequent visits. At baseline, the multidomain-amnestic MCI group generally had the greatest breadth and depth of cognitive impairment and reported the most IADL difficulty. Longitudinally, MCI participants showed faster IADL decline than CN participants (multidomain-amnestic MCI > single domain-amnestic MCI > nonamnestic MCI). Conclusion: NP criteria identified a proportion of MCI and reversion rate within ACTIVE that is consistent with prior studies involving community-dwelling samples. The pattern of everyday functioning change suggests that being classified as MCI, particularly amnestic MCI, is predictive of future loss of independence. Future work will apply these classifications in ACTIVE to better understand the relationships between MCI and health, social, and cognitive intervention-related factors.

Therefore, at the university hospital of Freiburg we build and launched the ENT Learning Program, an online learning platform for medical students. OBJECTIVES This study will give an insight into structure and functions of the learning program. Furthermore, its use and usefulness will be subjectively and objectively evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS The ENT Learning Program is a web application, that can be used by any Internet-enabled device. ENT content is presented by text, images, video tutorials and interactive features like multiple-choice questions and feedback functions. To evaluate students' use and benefits of the program we first conducted a questionnaire survey with 116 medical students. To objectify the results, we then counted the actual visits to the program and carried out a randomised learning-control-study (n = 47). RESULTS The learning program was used by 97 % of the interrogated students. Over 80 % said that the program improved their exam preparation, motivated them to study and enhanced their interest in ENT. In one year, we counted almost 90.000 visits to the website. Furthermore, the learning-control-study showed a significant better test outcome in students, who used the LP in addition. CONCLUSIONS The ENT Learning Program is a promising tool in online teaching, that did not yet exist in Germany that way.

140871,Instrumentation and equipment for single-site umbilical laparoscopic surgery.,2011,"BACKGROUND Core muscle injury (CMI), often referred to as a sports hernia, is a common cause of groin pain in athletes characterized by concomitant injury to the insertion of the adductor longus and the rectus abdominis muscles. Currently, the literature on CMI is sparse with no standardized physical examination tests used in the diagnosis of this type of injury. PURPOSE To determine the diagnostic accuracy of various physical examination tests in the diagnosis of CMI. STUDY DESIGN Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. METHODS A consecutive series of patients evaluated by the senior author with symptoms consistent with CMI were included. Four physical examination tests were routinely performed in these patients by the senior author and were noted in each patient's chart as positive or negative: (1) pain with resisted cross-body sit-up in figure-of-4 position, (2) pain with straight-leg sit-up, (3) pain with resisted hip flexion in external rotation (external rotation Stinchfield test), and (4) the presence of an adductor contracture. CMI was independently diagnosed by a reference standard (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). All MRI scans were read by a musculoskeletal fellowship-trained radiologist. The sensitivity and specificity of each physical examination test alone and in combination were calculated based on this reference standard. RESULTS A total of 81 patients were included in this study. MRI was positive for a CMI in 39 patients (48%) overall. Both the cross-body sit-up test and the presence of an adductor contracture were found to have a sensitivity of 100% (specificity, 3% for both). The external rotation Stinchfield test was found to have the highest specificity of 60% (sensitivity, 15%). The sensitivity of all 4 physical examination tests in combination was found to be 100% (specificity, 0%). CONCLUSION Certain physical examination maneuvers can be used to assist in the diagnosis of a CMI. The cross-body sit-up test and the presence of an adductor contracture are highly sensitive but nonspecific tests for CMI and therefore should be used in conjunction with diagnostic imaging before deciding on an appropriate treatment course.","Kurowicki, Jennifer; Kraeutler, Matthew J; Dávila Castrodad, Iciar M; Hahn, Alexander K; Simone, Erica S; Kelly, Michael A; Talishinskiy, Toghrul; Scillia, Anthony J",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546520926029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32510969/,496

We report the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the short-term course of OCD. A cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD (n = 240) who were on regular follow-up at a tertiary care specialty OCD clinic in India were assessed telephonically, about 2 months after the declaration of the pandemic (""pandemic"" cohort). Data from the medical records of an independent set of patients with OCD (n = 207) who were followed up during the same period, 1 year prior, was used for comparison (historical controls). The pandemic group and historical controls did not differ in the trajectories of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores (chi-square likelihood ratio test of the group × time interaction = 2.73, p = 0.255) and relapse rate (21% vs. 20%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.59; p = 0.535). Preexisting contamination symptoms and COVID-19-related health anxiety measured by the COVID-Threat Scale did not predict relapse. Only a small proportion of patients (6%) reported COVID-19-themed obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic, at least in the short run, did not influence the course of illness.","Sharma, Lavanya P; Balachander, Srinivas; Thamby, Abel; Bhattacharya, Mahashweta; Kishore, Chethana; Shanbhag, Vandita; Sekharan, Jaisoorya T; Narayanaswamy, Janardhanan C; Arumugham, Shyam Sundar; Reddy, Janardhan Y C",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,https://doi.org/10.1097/nmd.0000000000001318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625069/,496

Longitudinal associations between resilience and mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the association between resilience and trajectories of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Participants were 6,008 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet-panel representative of the US adult population. Baseline data were collected between March 10 and March 31, 2020, with nine follow-up waves conducted between April 1 and August 4. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between date and mental distress, stratified by resilience level (low, normal, or high). RESULTS In contrast to the high resilience group, participants in the low and normal resilience groups experienced increases in mental distress in the early months of the pandemic (low: OR=2.94, 95% CI=1.93-4.46; normal: OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.55-2.35). Men, middle-aged and older adults, Black adults, and adults with a graduate degree were more likely to report high resilience, whereas adults living below the poverty line were less likely to report high resilience. LIMITATIONS These associations should not be interpreted as causal, and resilience was measured at only one time-point. CONCLUSIONS Trajectories of mental distress varied markedly by resilience level during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with low-resilience adults reporting the largest increases in mental distress during this crisis. Activities that foster resilience should be included in broader strategies to support mental health throughout the pandemic.","Riehm, Kira E; Brenneke, Savannah G; Adams, Leslie B; Gilan, Donya; Lieb, Klaus; Kunzler, Angela M; Smail, Emily J; Holingue, Calliope; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Kalb, Luther G; Thrul, Johannes",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33421866/,496

We sought to determine the incidence, distribution, and outcomes of patients who have total occlusion of the culprit artery but present with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The randomized Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy trial enrolled 13,819 patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes who underwent an early invasive strategy. The present study includes 1,319 patients with baseline biomarker elevation (NSTEMI) and no history of coronary artery bypass graft who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention of a single culprit vessel. We compared the baseline characteristics and outcomes according to whether the culprit vessel was occluded (baseline Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] 0 to 1) or patent (TIMI 2 to 3 flow) by angiographic core laboratory assessment. TIMI 0 to 1 flow in the culprit artery was present in 262 of 1,319 (19.9%) patients. The incidence of coronary occlusion was 28.4%, 19.3%, and 12.6% in patients with NSTEMI because of right coronary, left circumflex, and left anterior descending artery disease, respectively. Patients with an occluded culprit artery were more commonly men and had ST-segment deviation ≥1 mm. One-year outcomes, including death (3.5% vs 3.0%, p = 0.68) and myocardial infarction (8.4% vs 9.6%, p = 0.47), did not differ significantly between patients with versus without occluded culprit arteries, respectively. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the culprit artery is totally occluded in approximately 1 in 5 patients presenting with NSTEMI and single-vessel disease; however, the presence of total occlusion in NSTEMI was not associated with an incremental hazard of death or reinfarction at 1 year.","Warren, Josephine; Mehran, Roxana; Yu, Jennifer; Xu, Ke; Bertrand, Michel E; Cox, David A; Lincoff, A Michael; Manoukian, Steven V; Ohman, E Magnus; Pocock, Stuart J; White, Harvey D; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2014.11.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25542393/,496

142267,Comparison of surgical outcomes of intracorporeal hepaticojejunostomy in the excision of choledochal cysts using laparoscopic versus robot techniques.,2018,"The present study describes the most comprehensive comparison of turtle mtD-loop regions to date. The primary structure was compared from DNA sequences accessed from GenBank from 48 species in 13 families of extant turtles, and secondary structures of the mtD-loop region were inferred from thermal stabilities, using the program Mfold, for each superfamiliy of turtles. Both primary and secondary structures were found to be highly variable across the order. The Cryptodira showed conservation in the primary structure at conserved sequence blocks (CSBs), but the Pleurodira displayed limited conservation of primary structural characters, other than the coreTAS, a binding site for the helicase TWINKLE, which was highly conserved in the Central and Right Domains across the order. No secondary structure was associated with a TAS, but an AT-rich fold (secondary structure) near the 3' terminus of the mtD-loop region was detected in all turtle superfamilies. Mapping of character states of structural features of the mtD-loop region revealed that most character states were autapomorphies and inferred a number of homoplasies. The Left Domain of turtles, containing no highly conserved structural elements, likely does not serve a functional role; therefore, the Central Domain in turtles is likely equivalent to the Left Domain of mammals. The AT-rich secondary structural element near the 3' terminus of the mtD-loop region may be conserved across turtles because of a functional role, perhaps containing the Light Strand Promotor, or perhaps interacting with the TWINKLE-coreTAS complex in the Central and Right Domains to regulate mtDNA replication and transcription.","Bernacki, Lucas E; Kilpatrick, C William",Journal of molecular evolution,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00239-020-09962-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808073/,496
142368,Impact of stepwise introduction of esophagojejunostomy during laparoscopic total gastrectomy: a single-center experience in Japan.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Generic clopidogrel recently became available in the United States and was rapidly adopted as a cost-effective alternative to the brand name formulation. However, unlike other medications, subtle differences in clopidogrel bioavailability may lead to acute consequences including stent thrombosis (ST). MATERIALS AND METHODS We studied the incidence of acute and subacute ST during the initial period of generic clopidogrel use (June 18, 2012-September 6, 2012 [80 days]) at a single percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center. There were 4 definite ST cases within 30 days of successful PCI in patients receiving generic clopidogrel, which were compared to historic control ST cases from 80 days prior to generic clopidogrel use and for 3 years from June 18, 2009 to June 17, 2012. RESULTS During generic clopidogrel administration, 1054 PCIs were performed, giving a definite 30-day ST incidence of 0.38% (4 of 1054) among these patients. By comparison, there were 2 episodes of definite 30-day ST during the 80 days immediately preceding generic clopidogrel use (2 of 1114), while 3-year historic data indicated a definite 30-day ST incidence of 0.14% (20 of 14 432), representing a 2.7-fold increase in definite 30-day ST with generic clopidogrel use (P = .076). Exclusion of 3 historic controls with a defined reason for ST (noncompliance, marked thrombocytosis) gave a 3.2-fold increase in 30-day ST with generic clopidogrel (P = .050). An ST-predictive algorithm revealed no difference in the likelihood of ST between patients receiving generic clopidogrel and historic controls. CONCLUSIONS We observed an unexpected >2-fold increase in ST coincident with generic clopidogrel use. Although we cannot ascribe causality, this observation warrants increased vigilance and close monitoring of patients receiving generic clopidogrel.","Kovacic, Jason C; Mehran, Roxana; Sweeny, Joseph; Li, Jennifer R; Moreno, Pedro; Baber, Usman; Krishnan, Prakash; Badimon, Juan J; Hulot, Jean-Sebastien; Kini, Annapoorna; Sharma, Samin K",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1177/1074248413510605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24271136/,496

Not only hyperglycaemia induced nerve damage is harder to repair using currently approved medications, but also, the use of these agents is often limited by the extent of pain relief provided and side effects. METHODOLOGY In this prospective, open-label, pilot study, 20 type-2 diabetes mellitus patients (male/female=13/7, mean age- 56.1±8.04 years), meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, were treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Teneligliptin, 20mg once a day for three months. Efficacy parameters: Sudomotor function (Sudoscan score); parasympathetic dysfunction assessed using Ewing's criteria i.e. heart rate response to -standing (HRS), -valsalva (HRV) and -deep breath (HRD); sympathetic dysfunction assessed as blood pressure response to -standing (BPS) and -handgrip (BPH); ankle brachial index (ABI), vibration perception threshold (VPT), C-reactive protein, glycemic profile and health related quality of life (HRQoL); and, tolerability parameters: complete blood count, liver function tests, serum creatinine, thyroid stimulating hormone, QT- interval and serum vitamin B12 levels, were measured. RESULTS There was no statistical difference in BMI, SBP, DBP, HRD, BPH and all safety parameters. After 12 weeks treatment, there was improvement in HRS (p<0.01) and HRV (p<0.01), but not in HRD (p=0.12). BPS was significantly lowered (p <0.01), but not the BPH (p =0.06). Sudoscan score was increased, while VPT was significantly decreased (both p<0.01). CONCLUSION Teneligliptin not only improves the glycemic status but also improves sudomotor function, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, and reduces vascular inflammation in type 2 diabetes.","Syngle, Ashit; Chahal, Simran; Vohra, Kanchan",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04681-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803534/,496

Influenza virus has been around for centuries and is one of the most successful, and consequently most studied human viruses. This has generated tremendous amount of data and information, thus it is pertinent to summarise these for, particularly interdisciplinary readers. Viruses are acellular organisms and exist at the interface of living and non-living. Due to this unique characteristic, viruses require another organism, i.e. host to survive. Viruses multiply inside the host cell and are obligate intracellular pathogens, because their relationship with the host is almost always harmful to host. In mammalian cells, the life cycle of a virus, including influenza is divided into five main steps: attachment, entry, synthesis, assembly and release. To complete these steps, some viruses, e.g. influenza utilise all three parts - plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus, of the cell; whereas others, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 utilise only plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Hence, viruses interact with numerous host factors to complete their life cycle, and these interactions are either exploitative or antagonistic in nature. The host factors involved in the life cycle of a virus could be divided in two broad categories - proviral and antiviral. This perspective has endeavoured to assimilate the information about the host factors which promote and suppress influenza virus infection. Furthermore, an insight into host factors that play a dual role during infection or contribute to influenza virus-host adaptation and disease severity has also been provided.","Husain, Matloob",Emerging topics in life sciences,https://doi.org/10.1042/etls20200232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33210707/,496

The SAPPHIRE (States And Pathways Projected with HIgh REsolution) plot allows a direct visual inference of the dominant states visited by high-dimensional systems and how they are interconnected in time. Here, we extend this visual inference into a clustering algorithm. Specifically, the automatic procedure derives from the SAPPHIRE plot states that are kinetically homogeneous, structurally annotated, and of tunable granularity. We provide a relative assessment of the kinetic fidelity of this SAPPHIRE-based partitioning in comparison to popular clustering methods. This assessment is carried out on trajectories of a toy model and two polypeptides.

144241,Randomized clinical trial comparing the cost and effectiveness of bipolar vessel sealers versus clips and vascular staplers for laparoscopic colorectal resection.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the evidence for fascial closure of 5-mm laparoscopic trocar sites. METHODS We conducted electronic database searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library for articles published between November 2008 and December 2010. We used the keywords trocar hernia, trocar-site hernia, laparoscopic hernia, trocar port-site hernia, laparoscopic port-site hernia. Prospective and retrospective case series, randomized trials, literature reviews, and randomized animal studies of trocar hernias on abdominal wall defects from gynecologic, urologic, and general surgery literature were reviewed. The Cochrane Database was reviewed for pertinent studies. Metaanalysis was not possible due to the significant heterogeneity between studies and lack of randomized trials large enough to assess the incidence of this rare complication. RESULTS Trocar-site hernias are a rare but known complication of laparoscopic surgery. Trocar size ≥10mm is associated with an increased rate of hernia development. Currently, the accepted gynecologic surgical practice is closure of fascial incisions ≥10mm, while incisions <10mm do not require closure. However, large prospective and retrospective case series reports from general surgery and urology literature support nonclosure of blunt or radially dilating trocars in paramedian sites. Expert opinion and small case reports suggest that in cases of prolonged manipulation of 5-mm trocar sites the surgeon should consider fascial closure, because extension of the initial incision may have occurred. CONCLUSION There is no evidence to recommend routine closure of 5-mm trocar incisions; the choice should continue to be left to the discretion of the individual surgeon.","Yamamoto, Miya; Minikel, Laura; Zaritsky, Eve",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680811x13022985131697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21902958/,496

This study examined the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants on hospital readmissions for pediatric asthma in South Texas. A time-stratified case-crossover study was conducted using the hospitalization data from a children's hospital and the air pollution data, including particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and ozone concentrations, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2010 and 2014. A conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between ambient air pollution and hospital readmissions, controlling for outdoor temperature. We identified 111 pediatric asthma patients readmitted to the hospital between 2010 and 2014. The single-pollutant models showed that PM2.5 concentration had a significant positive effect on risk for hospital readmissions (OR = 1.082, 95% CI = 1.008-1.162, p = 0.030). In the two-pollutant models, the increased risk of pediatric readmissions for asthma was significantly associated with both elevated ozone (OR = 1.023, 95% CI = 1.001-1.045, p = 0.042) and PM2.5 concentrations (OR = 1.080, 95% CI = 1.005-1.161, p = 0.036). The effects of ambient air pollutants on hospital readmissions varied by age and season. Our findings suggest that short-term (4 days) exposure to air pollutants might increase the risk of preventable hospital readmissions for pediatric asthma patients.","Baek, Juha; Kash, Bita A; Xu, Xiaohui; Benden, Mark; Roberts, Jon; Carrillo, Genny",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32640508/,496

We exploited proximity-dependent labeling to define the in vivo interactions of cohesin domains with DNA or with other cohesin domains that lie within the same or in different cohesin complexes. Our results suggest both cohesin's head and hinge domains bind to DNA, and cohesin structure is dynamic with differential folding of its coiled coil regions to generate butterfly confirmations. This method also reveals that cohesins form ordered clusters on and off DNA. The levels of cohesin clusters and their distribution on chromosomes are cell cycle-regulated. Cohesin clustering is likely necessary for cohesion maintenance because clustering and maintenance uniquely require the same subset of cohesin domains and the auxiliary cohesin factor Pds5p. These conclusions provide important new mechanistic and biological insights into the architecture of the cohesin complex, cohesin-cohesin interactions, and cohesin's tethering and loop extruding activities.","Xiang, Siheng; Koshland, Douglas",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.62243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594972/,496

The present study investigated the influence of VTE prophylaxis, including aspirin, on mortality following TJA. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 31,133 patients who underwent primary TJA from 2000 to 2017. Patient demographics, body mass index, and comorbidities were obtained from an electronic chart query. Patients were allocated into 2 cohorts on the basis of the VTE prophylaxis administered: aspirin (25.9%, 8,061 patients) and non-aspirin (74.1%, 23,072 patients). Mortality was assessed with use of an institutional mortality database that is updated biannually. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. RESULTS The overall mortality rate was 0.2% and 0.6% at 30 days and 1 year after TJA, respectively. The use of aspirin was independently associated with lower risk of death at both 30 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; p = 0.020) and 1 year (OR, 0.51; p = 0.004). Patients in the non-aspirin cohort showed 3 times the risk of death at 30 days compared with the aspirin cohort (0.3% compared with 0.1%; p = 0.004), and twice the risk of death at 1 year (0.7% compared with 0.3%; p < 0.001). At 1 year, the primary cause of death in the non-aspirin group was cardiac-related (46 of 23,072, 0.20%). In the aspirin group, the rate of cardiac-related death was almost 5 times lower (3 of 8,061, 0.04%; p = 0.005). Risk factors for mortality at 1 year included higher age (p < 0.001), male sex (p = 0.020), history of congestive heart failure (p = 0.003), cerebrovascular disease (p < 0.001), malignancy (p < 0.001), and history of prior myocardial infarction (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrates that the use of aspirin as prophylaxis against VTE following TJA may reduce the risk of mortality. Given the numerous options available and permitted by the current guidelines, orthopaedic surgeons should be aware of the potential added benefits of aspirin when selecting a VTE-prophylactic agent.

145824,Innovations in minimally invasive hysterectomy.,2014,"BACKGROUND The advancement of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) into clinical practice is dependent on its safety, efficacy, and efficiency. Access is the obligatory first step in NOTES and serves as a surrogate to technical difficulties associated with this novel surgical approach. This study aimed to compare endoscopic transgastric access techniques in terms of safety, reproducibility, and efficiency. METHODS Seven variations for anterior transgastric NOTES access were evaluated with female domestic swine. After marking of an anterior site, electrocautery was used to create a small gastrotomy, followed by balloon dilation and entry into the peritoneal cavity. Methodologic variations incorporated the use of guidewires, electrocautery and dilation combined within a single device, support tubes, and dilation without electrocautery. Access times were recorded, and tissue injury was evaluated. RESULTS In 70 access attempts, the most serious complication was bleeding from the gastroepiploic vessel, controlled with electrocautery. High variability in access times was prevalent with almost all the access techniques. CONCLUSIONS This study supports the presumption that an anterior transgastric access technique for NOTES procedures is safe. The use of a wire to mark the site and another wire to retain the gastrotomy provided safe, efficient, and reproducible transgastric access. Comparison with laparoscopy exposed the disparity in technical challenges facing NOTES, suggesting that new technology and further refinement in methodology are required for NOTES to be clinically relevant.","Schomisch, Steve J; Furlan, Joseph P; Andrews, Jamie M; Trunzo, Joseph A; Ponsky, Jeffrey L; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1818-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21789648/,496

Echocardiography revealed the presence of supravalvular pulmonary stenosis. The peak velocity through the stenosis was 6.4 m/sec, and the interventricular septum was flattened. Cutting balloon angioplasty was designed for the treatment of coronary artery stenosis, which was resistant to conventional balloon angioplasty. Accordingly, the dog underwent cutting balloon angioplasty and conventional balloon dilation. One month after treatment, it showed neither exercise intolerance nor easy fatigability. The ventricular septum flattening disappeared. Five months later, the dog showed an increase in activity. Two years later, the peak velocity through the stenosis decreased to 4.4 m/sec. Neither clinical symptoms nor restenosis was observed. Thus, supravalvular pulmonary stenosis was successfully treated using this combination method. The present case showed that combined cutting balloon and conventional balloon angioplasty is a useful and minimally invasive treatment for supravalvular pulmonary stenosis.","Goya, Seijirow; Wada, Tomoki; Shimada, Kazumi; Uemura, Akiko; Tanaka, Ryou",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://doi.org/10.1292/jvms.18-0060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30232302/,496

Disease severity has been associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia. To elucidate the atlas of peripheral immune response and pathways that might lead to immunopathology during COVID-19 disease course, we performed a peripheral blood RNA sequencing analysis of the same patient's samples collected from symptom onset to full recovery. We found that PBMCs at different disease stages exhibited unique transcriptome characteristics. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused excessive release of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators as well as an aberrant increase of low-density neutrophils. Further analysis revealed an increased expression of RNA sensors and robust IFN-stimulated genes expression but a repressed type I IFN production. SARS-CoV-2 infection activated T and B cell responses during the early onset but resulted in transient adaptive immunosuppression during severe disease state. Activation of apoptotic pathways and functional exhaustion may contribute to the reduction of lymphocytes and dysfunction of adaptive immunity, whereas increase in IL2, IL7, and IL15 may facilitate the recovery of the number and function of lymphocytes.

We discuss sequent stages of transformation, practical solutions and difficulties encountered in the process. 9 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized in the CDACAP between 09.04 and 29.05.2020, and 97 were tended to by consulting psychiatrists in the main building of the University Hospital in Krakow between 23.03 and 23.05.2020. In our experience, the Polish healthcare facilities, especially psychiatric and long-term care ones, were ill-equipped to operate during the pandemic crisis. This situation has brought out the nationwide lack of systemic solutions, particularly in the areas of child and adolescent psychiatry as well as forensic psychiatry. Functioning during the epidemic and confronting the risk of rapid deterioration in patients'condition clearly pointed out the necessity of creating psychiatric wards within the multispecialty hospitals. The requirement for ensuring separate spaces for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or with exclusion thereof should be considered in the psychiatric reform which assumes the regional responsibility of stationary wards.","Pilecki, Maciej; Dimter, Agata; Siwek, Marcin; Styczeń, Krzysztof; Rodak, Weronika; Krupa, Anna; Śmierciak, Natalia; Dudek, Dominika",Psychiatria polska,https://doi.org/10.12740/pp/126592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529274/,496

Here, we report the efficient separation of both propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) and ethylene/ethane (C2H4/C2H6) mixtures for the first time by a cheap and customized anion-functionalized metal-organic framework, ZU-36 (also termed as GeFSIX-3-M, M= Ni2+, Co2+), through molecular recognition and cross-section matching mechanism. Specifically, the pore window size of the fine-tuned ZU-36-Ni (4.42×4.42 Å2) decorated with high density of electronegative anions matches well with the cross-section of C3H6 (4.16×4.65 Å2) and C2H4 (3.28×4.18 Å2), leading to efficient separation of C3H6/C3H8 and C2H4/C2H6. The high uptake capacity and separation selectivity of ZU-36-Ni were confirmed by adsorption isotherms and breakthrough tests. Binary dynamic breakthrough results showed that ZU-36-Ni can trap 1.35 mmol g-1 C3H6 and 1.08 mmol g-1 C2H4 from C3H6/C3H8 and C2H4/C2H6 mixtures, respectively. The separation selectivity for C3H6/C3H8 on ZU-36-Ni calculated from the breakthrough tests is 19, which sets a new benchmark for C3H6/C3H8 separation. The proposed cross-section matching mechanism together with proper selective binding affinity may serve as a guide for the design of effective porous materials for other important gas separation.","Zhang, Zhaoqiang; Ding, Qi; Cui, Xili; Jiang, Xiao-Ming; Xing, Huabin",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c07800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805845/,496
148216,Functional outcomes by reconstruction technique following laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer: double tract versus jejunal interposition.,2014,"The adrenal gland may exhibit a wide variety of pathologic conditions. A number of imaging techniques can be used to characterize these, although it is not always possible to attain a definitive diagnosis radiologically. Incorrect diagnoses may be made if radiologists are not attentive to technical parameters and interpretive factors associated with adrenal gland imaging. Hence, an appreciation of the intricacies of adrenal imaging strategies and characterization is required; this can be aided by understanding the pitfalls of adrenal imaging. Technical pitfalls at CT may relate to the imaging parameters, including region of interest characteristics, tube voltage selection, and the timing of contrast material-enhanced imaging. With MRI, imaging acquisition technique and evaluation of the reference tissues used in chemical shift MRI are important considerations that can directly influence image interpretation. Interpretive errors may occur when evaluating adrenal washout at CT without considering other radiologic features, including the size of adrenal nodules, the presence of fat or calcification, the attenuation of nodules, and atypical imaging features. The characterization of an incidental adrenal lesion as benign or malignant does not end the role of the radiologist; consideration as to whether an adrenal lesion is associated with endocrine dysfunction is required. While imaging may not be optimal for establishing endocrine activity, there are imaging features from which radiologists may infer function. In cases of known endocrine activity, imaging can guide clinical management, including further investigations such as venous sampling. ©RSNA, 2020.","Nandra, Gurinder; Duxbury, Oliver; Patel, Pawan; Patel, Jaymin H; Patel, Nirav; Vlahos, Ioannis","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2020190080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609593/,496

This study examined the long-term outcomes and response to NIV in a large adult CF cohort. METHODS All patients attending a UK adult CF Centre receiving NIV as treatment for hypercapnic respiratory failure over a nine-year period were studied prospectively. Detailed clinical data was recorded and longitudinal data measurements were examined for the three years pre and post NIV initiation to assess effect of this intervention. RESULTS 94 patients, mean age 29.9 (SD 9.7) years, percent predicted FEV1 21.5 (7.3), received NIV. All patients commenced NIV in a hospital setting. 21 remain alive, 24 received double lung transplant, 49 died without lung transplantation. NIV use was associated with a stabilisation and improvement in both FEV1 and FVC from NIV set up to three years post follow-up, in addition to an increase in body mass index and attenuation of PCO2 (all p<0.001). No single parameter was found to predict long-term NIV response but baseline PCO2 (p=0.005), CRP (p=0.004) and age (p=0.009) were identified as independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS NIV use in CF adults is associated with improvements in lung function and attenuation of hypercapnia which is maintained for up to three years post NIV initiation. Outcomes for CF patients with severe pulmonary disease commenced on NIV have significantly improved with fifty percent of patients expected to survive for approximately five years.","Wadsworth, L E; Belcher, J; Bright-Thomas, R J",Journal of cystic fibrosis : official journal of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2021.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140250/,496

METHODOLOGY Individuals living in Brazil answered an online questionnaire on their sociodemographic and behavioral aspects, emotional scale (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scale, and Pain Screener in Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD-Pain Screener) during June 2020. Descriptive statistical analyses and logistic and linear regressions were applied (5% significance). RESULTS Overall, 2301 individuals were included, 89.1% practiced social isolation, 72.6% were employed/studying, at least 15% presented severe or extremely severe levels of emotional distress and presence of powerful (34.1%) and severe impact event (15%). During the outbreak, 53.2% perceived feeling worse and 31.8% reported that orofacial pain started or worsened after the pandemic outbreak. Gender was associated with ""social class"" (P=0.036), ""pain/stiffness in the jaw on awakening"" (P=0.037), ""change of pain during jaw habits"" (P=0.034) and ""perception of change in the situations mentioned in the TMD-Pain Screener"" (P=0.020), ""depression"" (P=0.012), ""anxiety"" (P=0.006) and ""impact of the event"" (P=8.3E-11). Social isolation had a lesser chance to change the routine, to be practiced by the unemployed/not studying, and to be practiced by men (all with P<0.001). Associations were found between social class and all subscales of the DASS-21 and IES, all with P<0.001. CONCLUSIONS The practice of social isolation has social determinants. High levels of psychological and event impacts were detected. The presence of orofacial pain seemed to increase during the health crisis, and there were gender differences in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","DE Caxias, Fernanda Pereira; Athayde, Flávia Regina Florencio de; Januzzi, Marcella Santos; Pinheiro, Larissa Viana; Turcio, Karina Helga Leal",Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB,https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-7757-2021-0122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34614122/,496

Pouch strictures are a complication with a reported incidence of 5-38%. The three areas where pouch strictures occur are in the pouch inlet, mid-pouch and pouch-anal anastomosis. Aim To undertake a systematic review of the literature and to identify management strategies available for pouch-anal, mid-pouch and pre-pouch ileal strictures and their outcomes. Methods A computer-assisted search of the online bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE limited to 1966 to February 2016 was performed. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, observational studies and case reports were considered. Those where data could not be extracted were excluded. Results Twenty-two articles were considered eligible. Pouch-anal strictures have been initially managed using predominately dilators which include bougie and Hegar dilators with various surgical procedures advocated when initial dilatation fails. Mid-pouch strictures are relatively unstudied with both medical, endoscopic and surgical management reported as successful. Pouch inlet strictures can be safely managed using a combined medical and endoscopic approach. Conclusion The limited evidence available suggests that pouch-anal strictures are best treated in a stepwise fashion with initial treatment to include digital or instrumental dilatation followed by surgical revision or resection. Management of mid-pouch strictures requires a combination of medical, endoscopic and surgical management. Pouch inlet strictures are best managed using a combined medical and endoscopic approach. Future studies should compare different treatment modalities on separate stricture locations to enable an evidenced-based treatment algorithm.","Segal, Jonathan P; Adegbola, Samuel O; Worley, Guy H T; Sahnan, Kapil; Tozer, Philip; Lung, Phillip F C; Faiz, Omar D; Clark, Susan K; Hart, Ailsa L",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjx151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155985/,496

However, there is dearth of empirical knowledge in low- and middle-income settings about the pandemic's impact on survivors, particularly the tension of their everyday life arising from the experiences and consequences of stigma, discrimination and social exclusion, and how they cope with these behavioral adversities. METHODS Realist qualitative approach drawing data from people clinically diagnosed positive of COVID-19, admitted into therapy in a designated treatment facility, and subsequently recovered and discharged for or without follow-up domiciliary care. In-depth interviews were conducted by maintaining a code book for identifying and documenting thematic categories in a progression leading to thematic saturation with 45 participants. Data were transcribed and coded deductively for broad themes at the start before systematically nesting emerging themes into the broad ones with the aid of NVivo 12 software. RESULTS Everyday lived experiences of the participants were disrupted with acts of indirect stigmatization (against relatives and family members), direct stigmatization (labeling, prejudices and stereotyping), barriers to realizing full social life and discriminatory behaviors across socio-ecological structures (workplace, community, family, and social institutions). These behavioral adversities were associated with self-reported poor health, anxiety and psychological disorders, and frustrations among others. Consequently, supplicatory prayers, societal and organizational withdrawal, aggressive behaviors, supportive counseling, and self-assertive behaviors were adopted to cope and modify the adverse behaviors driven by misinformation and fearful perceptions of the COVID-19 and its contagious proportions.

Tests of joint position sense (JPS) are commonly used to assess knee proprioception, but their psychometric properties (PMPs) are largely unknown. Purpose To evaluate the PMPs (reliability, validity, and responsiveness) of existing knee JPS tests targeting individuals with ACL injury. Study Design Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods PubMed, Allied and Complementary Medicine, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, Scopus, CENTRAL, and ProQuest databases were searched to identify studies that assessed PMPs of knee JPS tests in individuals with ACL injury. The risk of bias for each included study was assessed and rated at the outcome level for each knee JPS test. Overall quality and levels of evidence for each PMP were rated according to established criteria. Meta-analyses with mean differences were conducted using random effects models when adequate data were available. Results Included were 80 studies covering 119 versions of knee JPS tests. Meta-analyses indicated sufficient quality for known-groups and discriminative validity (ACL-injured knees vs knees of asymptomatic controls and contralateral noninjured knees, respectively), owing to significantly greater absolute errors for ACL-injured knees based on a strong level of evidence. A meta-analysis showed insufficient quality for responsiveness, which was attributed to a lack of significant change over time after diverse interventions with a moderate level of evidence. Statistical heterogeneity (I 2 > 40%) was evident in the majority of meta-analyses. All remaining PMPs (reliability, measurement error, criterion validity, convergent validity, and other PMPs related to responsiveness) were assessed qualitatively, and they failed to achieve a sufficient quality rating. This was a result of either the study outcomes not agreeing with the statistical cutoff values/hypotheses or the level of evidence being rated as conflicting/unknown or based on only a single study. Conclusion Knee JPS tests appear to have sufficient validity in differentiating ACL-injured knees from asymptomatic knees. Further evidence of high methodologic quality is required to ascertain the reliability, responsiveness, and other types of validity assessed here. We recommend investigations that compare the modifiable methodologic components of knee JPS tests on their PMPs to develop standardized evidence-based tests.","Strong, Andrew; Arumugam, Ashokan; Tengman, Eva; Röijezon, Ulrik; Häger, Charlotte K",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/23259671211007878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350298/,496

Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is known to recognize viral RNA and induce IFN expression through tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs). We discovered that MERS-CoV N protein suppresses RIG-I-CARD-, but not MDA5-CARD-induced IFN-β and IFN-λ1 promoter activity. By interacting with TRIM25, N protein impedes RIG-I ubiquitination and activation and inhibits the phosphorylation of transcription factors IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB that are known to be important for IFN gene activation. By employing recombinant Sindbis virus-EGFP replication system, we showed that viral N protein downregulated the production of not only IFN mRNA but also bioactive IFN proteins. Taken together, MERS-CoV N protein functions as an IFN antagonist. It suppresses RIG-I-induced type I and type III IFN production by interfering with TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination. Our study sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism of how MERS-CoV causes disease.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV causes death of about 35% of patients. Published studies showed that some coronaviruses are capable of suppressing interferon (IFN) expression in the early phase of infection and MERS-CoV proteins can modulate host immune response. In this study, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein suppresses the production of both type I and type III IFNs via sequestering TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is essential for activating RIG-I signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of TRIM25 rescues the suppressive effect of the N protein. In addition, the C-terminal domain of the viral N protein plays a pivotal role in the suppression of IFN-β promoter activity. Our findings reveal how MERS-CoV evades innate immunity and provide insights into the interplay between host immune response and viral pathogenicity.","Chang, Chi-You; Liu, Helene Minyi; Chang, Ming-Fu; Chang, Shin C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00099-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295922/,496

This study evaluates the workflow and telecommunication requirements of tele-robotic peripheral vascular interventions. METHODS Ten superficial femoral artery cases were performed by the operator being 44 miles away from the interventional suite, with an endovascular robotic system, on a high-fidelity endovascular simulator. Procedural success, technical success, fluoroscopy time, residual stenosis, contrast dose, and network delay were registered. Communication success was assessed after each procedure on a scale from 1(unacceptable) to 5(ideal). RESULTS Procedural success and technical success were 100% and 80% respectively. The mean residual stenosis, fluoroscopy time, and contrast dose were 1.7±5.25%, 6.5±1.8 min, and 58.8±14.8 ml. The mean network latency was 38.9±3.5 ms. Median communication success scores were 4.5 (min: 4, max: 5) reported by both the operator and the bedside technician on a scale of 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (ideal). CONCLUSION With a stable network connection and good communication protocol, a high success rate was achieved for remote robotic-assisted peripheral vascular intervention in an ex-vivo model.

Breath-exhaled VOCs are often ""unknowns"" and possess low concentrations, which make their analysis, peak digging and data processing challenging. We report a new methodology, applied in a proof-of-concept experiment, for the detection of VOCs in breath. For this purpose, we developed and compared four complementary analysis methods based on solid-phase microextraction and thermal desorption (TD) tubes with two GC-mass spectrometer (MS) methods. Using eight model compounds, we obtained an LOD range of 0.02-20 ng/ml. We found that in breath analysis, sampling the exhausted air from Tedlar bags is better when TD tubes are used, not only because of the preconcentration but also due to the stability of analytes in the TD tubes. Data processing (peak picking) was based on two data retrieval approaches with an in-house script written for comparison and differentiation between two populations: sick and healthy. We found it best to use ""raw"" AMDIS deconvolution data (.ELU) rather than its NIST (.FIN) identification data for comparison between samples. A successful demonstration of this method was conducted in a pilot study (n = 21) that took place in a closed hospital ward (Covid-19 ward) with the discovery of four potential markers.

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPβ/AEP) signaling spatiotemporally mediates AD pathologies in the brain via cleaving both β-amyloid precursor protein and Tau. We show that gut dysbiosis occurs in 5xFAD mice, and is associated with escalation of the C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in the gut with age. Unlike that of aged wild-type mice, the microbiota of aged 3xTg mice accelerate AD pathology in young 3xTg mice, accompanied by active C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in the brain. Antibiotic treatment diminishes this signaling and attenuates amyloidogenic processes in 5xFAD, improving cognitive functions. The prebiotic R13 inhibits this pathway and suppresses amyloid aggregates in the gut. R13-induced Lactobacillus salivarius antagonizes the C/EBPβ/AEP axis, mitigating gut leakage and oxidative stress. Our findings support the hypothesis that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling is activated by gut dysbiosis, implicated in AD pathologies in the gut.","Chen, Chun; Ahn, Eun Hee; Kang, Seong Su; Liu, Xia; Alam, Ashfaqul; Ye, Keqiang",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba0466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832679/,496

We tested 2 lymphedema prevention interventions and their impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a group-randomized trial at 38 cooperative group sites within the United States. METHODS Patients were recruited before breast surgery. Sites were randomly assigned to education-only (EO) lymphedema prevention or education plus exercise and physical therapy (LEAP). Lymphedema was defined as a ≥10% difference in arm volume at any time from baseline to 18 months postsurgery. HRQOL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast plus 4 lymphedema items (FACT-B+4). Longitudinal mixed model regression analysis, adjusting for key demographic and clinical variables, examined participants' HRQOL by intervention group and lymphedema status. RESULTS A total of 547 patients (56% LEAP) were enrolled and completed HRQOL assessments. The results revealed no differences between the interventions in preventing lymphedema (P = .37) or HRQOL (FACT-B+4 total score; P = .8777). At 18 months, the presence of lymphedema was associated with HRQOL at borderline significance (P = .0825). However, African American patients reported greater lymphedema symptoms (P = .0002) and better emotional functioning (P = .0335) than patients of other races or ethnicities. Lower HRQOL during the intervention was associated with younger age (P ≤ .0001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >0 (P = .0002), ≥1 positive lymph nodes (P = .0009), having no education beyond high school (P < .0001), having undergone chemotherapy (P = .0242), and having had only axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy versus both (P = .0007). CONCLUSION The tested interventions did not differ in preventing lymphedema or in HRQOL outcomes. African American women reported greater HRQOL impacts due to lymphedema symptoms than women of other races or ethnicities.","Naughton, Michelle J; Liu, Heshan; Seisler, Drew K; Le-Rademacher, Jennifer; Armer, Jane M; Oliveri, Jill M; Sloan, Jeffrey A; Hock, Karen; Schwartz, Michael; Unzeitig, Gary; Melnik, Marianne; Yee, Lisa D; Fleming, Gini F; Taylor, John R; Loprinzi, Charles; Paskett, Electra D",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079393/,496

We aimed to describe rates and characterize predictors and health outcomes associated with AKI in a national cohort of US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS In a cohort of 5216 US veterans hospitalized with COVID-19 identified through July 23, 2020, we described changes in serum creatinine and examined predictors of AKI and the associations between AKI, health resource utilization, and death, utilizing logistic regressions. We characterized geographic and temporal variations in AKI rates and estimated variance explained by key variables utilizing Poisson regressions. RESULTS In total, 1655 (32%) participants had AKI; 961 (58%), 223 (13%), and 270 (16%) met Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes definitions of stage 1, 2, and 3 AKI, respectively, and 201 (12%) received KRT. Eight percent of participants had AKI within 1 day of hospitalization, and 47% did not recover to baseline serum creatinine by discharge. Older age, Black race, male gender, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lower eGFR were significant predictors of AKI during hospitalization with COVID-19. AKI was associated with higher mechanical ventilation use (odds ratio, 6.46; 95% confidence interval, 5.52 to 7.57) and longer hospital stay (5.56 additional days; 95% confidence interval, 4.78 to 6.34). AKI was also associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio, 6.71; 95% confidence interval, 5.62 to 8.04); this association was stronger in Blacks (P value of interaction <0.001). Hospital-level rates of AKI exhibited substantial geographic variability, ranging from 10% to 56%. Between March and July 2020, AKI rates declined from 40% to 27%; proportions of AKI stage 3 and AKI requiring KRT decreased from 44% to 17%. Both geographic and temporal variabilities were predominately explained by percentages of Blacks (31% and 49%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AKI is common during hospitalization with COVID-19 and associated with higher risk of health care resource utilization and death. Nearly half of patients with AKI did not recover to baseline by discharge. Substantial geographic variation and temporal decline in rates and severity of AKI were observed.

To determine the perceived value that pharmacy practice department chairs ascribe to pharmacy faculty candidates having completed a teaching and learning curriculum (TLC) program and related activities.Methods. An 18-item survey instrument was created that was intended to capture the overall impressions of pharmacy practice chairs regarding the value of TLC programs, relative importance compared to other accomplishments (eg, residency completion, board certification), and importance of specific activities. Following pilot testing and establishment of intra-rater reliability, invitations to complete the electronic survey instrument were sent to pharmacy practice chairs (or their equivalent) at accredited Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) programs in the United States.Results. Of the 127 pharmacy practice chairs invited, 53 completed the survey (response rate of 41.7%). The majority of respondents held a PharmD degree (90.6%), had been in their role of chair for zero to five years (60.4%), and represented a private institution (54.7%). The majority of respondents who answered the question (32 of 49) felt it was very important or important (16.3% and 49.0%, respectively) that teaching experiences be completed within a formal teaching and learning curriculum program. These programs were believed to be most important for candidates with less than five years of professional experience. Teaching and learning curriculum programs were not deemed to be more important than other accomplishments by most responders. The perceived most important TLC program activities were instruction on didactic and experiential teaching strategies, and experience developing learning objectives, developing examination items, evaluating examination results, and facilitating case conferences or practice laboratory activities.Conclusion. Teaching and learning curriculum programs may provide the foundational experiences needed for pharmacy graduates to stand out among other candidates, although department chairs' perceptions of the value of teaching and learning curriculum experiences varied.","Beckett, Robert D; Isaacs, Alex N; Montagano, Kaitlin J; Sheehan, Amy H; Ramsey, Darin C; Sprunger, Tracy",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe7981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34283776/,496

METHODS We analyzed 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and haematological malignancies. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared to a matched control group of 53 non-cancer patients with COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the risk factors associated with poor outcome. RESULTS The most frequent haematological diseases were lymphoma (30%) and multiple myeloma (30%). Eighty-seven % HP developed moderate or severe disease. Patients with haematological malignancies had a significantly higher mortality rate compared to non-cancer patients (35.9% vs 13.2%; P=0.003 (odds ratio 6.652). The worst outcome was observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Only age >70 years and C reactive protein >10 mg/dl at admission were associated with higher risk of death (odds ratio 34.86, p= 0.003 and 13.56, p=0.03). Persistant viral sheddind was detected in 5 HP. Active chemotherapy, viral load at diagnosis and COVID-19 therapy were not predictors of outcome. CONCLUSION Mortality of COVID-19 is significantly higher in patients with haematological malignancies compared to non-cancer patients.

For example, bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP) is involved in the pathogenesis of lysosomal storage diseases, and polyphosphoinositides (PPI) play critical roles in cellular signaling and functions. Phosphatidylglycerol (PG), a structural isomer of BMP, mediates lipid-protein and lipid-lipid interactions, and inhibits platelet activating factor and phosphatidylcholine transferring. However, due to their low abundance, the analysis of these phospholipids from biological samples is technically challenging. Therefore, the cellular function and metabolism of these phospholipids are still elusive. This chapter overviews a novel method of shotgun lipidomics after methylation with trimethylsilyl-diazomethane (TMS-D) for accurate and comprehensive analysis of these phospholipid species in biological samples. Firstly, a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure is performed to extract tissue lipids for PPI analysis, whereas modified methyl-tert-butylether (MTBE) extraction and modified Folch extraction methods are described to extract tissue lipids for PPI analysis. Secondly, TMS-D methylation is performed to derivatize PG/BMP and PPI, respectively. Then, we described the shotgun lipidomics strategies that can be used as cost-effective and relatively high-throughput methods to determine BMP, PG, and PPI species and isomers with different phosphate position(s) and fatty acyl chains. The described method of shotgun lipidomics after methylation achieves feasible and reliable quantitative analysis of low-abundance lipid classes. The application of this novel method should enable us to reveal the metabolism and functions of these phospholipids in healthy and disease states.","Pan, Meixia; Qin, Chao; Han, Xianlin",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1410-5_6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954941/,496

We test three hypotheses: [H1] Asians in the US are more likely to report experiencing coronavirus stigmatization than non-Hispanic Whites; [H2] Coronavirus stigmatization is associated with psychological distress; [H3] Magnitude of association between coronavirus stigmatization and psychological distress is more pronounced among US-born Asians, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. DESIGN We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from the 10-31 March 2020 wave of the Understanding America Survey, a nationally representative survey of adults in the US. Psychological distress was assessed with the PHQ-4. Measures of association were estimated using multiple logistic regression and survey sampling weights. Predicted probabilities were calculated using marginal standardization ( n = 6707). RESULTS [H1] The adjusted predicted probability of experiencing any coronavirus stigma among foreign-born Asians (11.2%, 95% CI: 5.5-17.0%; E-value = 4.52), US-born Asians (10.9%, 95% CI: 5.8-16.0%; E-value = 4.23), Blacks (8.0%, 95% CI: 5.3-10.7%; E-value = 2.92), and Hispanic Whites (7.3%, 95% CI: 4.6-9.9%; E-value = 2.58) was significantly greater than non-Hispanic Whites (4.5%, 95% CI: 3.7-5.4%).

152816,Reduced port laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer.,2016,"BACKGROUND Concerns have been expressed regarding a possible association between arterial hyperoxia and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. Oxygen status is commonly monitored noninvasively by peripheral saturation monitoring (SpO2). However, the risk of hyperoxia above specific SpO2 levels in critically ill patients is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine a threshold value of SpO2 above which the prevalence of arterial hyperoxia distinctly increases. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study in adult mechanically ventilated intensive care patients in a tertiary referral center. In 100 patients, we collected 200 arterial blood gases (ABG) and simultaneously registered SpO2 levels, as well as hemodynamic and ventilation parameters and vasoactive medication. Patients under therapeutic hypothermia were excluded. RESULTS The risk of arterial hyperoxia, defined as PaO2>100mmHg or >125mmHg, was negligible when SpO2 was ≤95% or ≤96%, respectively. The majority (89% and 54%, respectively for PaO2>100mmHg and 125mmHg) of ICU patients with SpO2 of 100% had arterial hyperoxia. The relation between SpO2 and PaO2 was not clearly affected by hemodynamic or other clinical variables (pH, pCO2, body temperature, recent blood transfusion). CONCLUSION In critically ill patients, the prevalence of arterial hyperoxia increases when SpO2 is >95%. Above this saturation level, supplemental oxygen should be administered with caution in patients potentially susceptible to adverse effects of hyperoxia.","Durlinger, E M J; Spoelstra-de Man, A M E; Smit, B; de Grooth, H J; Girbes, A R J; Oudemans-van Straaten, H M; Smulders, Y M",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2017.02.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279497/,496
152894,Ileal Pouch Excision: A Contemporary Observational Cohort.,2019,"OBJECTIVES Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) constitute an important group of metabolic diseases, consisting of approximately 60 disorders. In some types of lysosomal diseases, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is administered intravenously in weekly or biweekly doses. Unfortunately, scheduled ERT during COVID-19 was disrupted. We considered the possibility of adverse outcomes caused by the disruption in the treatment of patients with lysosomal storage disorders. METHODS During the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a questionnaire that was delivered via Internet to assess how this vulnerable patient group was affected by the pandemic in terms of their access to treatment and their disease-related symptoms. RESULTS The questionnaire was filled out by 75 patients. There were 35 patients whose treatment dose was missed because of COVID-19. The most common reason for skipping treatment was not wanting to go to the hospital for fear of contracting COVID-19. These 35 patients missed a median of four doses of ERT (range: 1-16 dosages). Twenty-one patients (60%) claimed that they were affected physically by not taking ERT (20 mucopolysaccaridoses, 1 Fabry disease), whereas 14 (40%) did not. CONCLUSIONS Interruption of ERT during the COVID-19 pandemic may have significant consequences. It may be beneficial to switch to home treatment or reserve dedicated facilities. With proper planning and management, the treatment disruptions of this particular group can be avoided.","Kahraman, Ayça Burcu; Yıldız, Yılmaz; Çıkı, Kısmet; Akar, Halil Tuna; Erdal, İzzet; Dursun, Ali; Tokatlı, Ayşegül; Sivri, Hatice Serap",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpem-2021-0067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818036/,496

Larger aneurysms are believed to be more likely to rupture and should therefore be treated. Recently, flow diverters (FDs) are widely used to treat large or wide neck aneurysms. However, it can be difficult to treat them by deployment of a single FD because of its insufficient flow disturbance. To overcome this problem, double stenting technique is sometimes applied with the aim to improve the effect of blood velocity reduction. In this study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the hemodynamic changes in an aneurysm when deploying virtual FDs. The results showed that the characteristics of the blood flow field inside the aneurysm did not changed much after the deployment of a single FD but underwent a large change after the deployment of two FDs. Furthermore, the velocity reduction in the aneurysm sac at a plane away from the parent artery increased from 25.9% to 92.8% when two FDs were deployed instead of one compared to no stenting. Double stenting was effective to decrease blood velocity in large or wide neck aneurysms.","Uchiyama, Yuya; Takao, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Takashi; Fujimura, Soichiro; Tanaka, Kazutoshi; Otani, Katharina; Hayakawa, Motoharu; Ishibashi, Toshihiro; Fukudome, Koji; Mamori, Hiroya; Yamamoto, Makoto; Murayama, Yuichi",Conference proceedings : ...

Initial reports of high mortality have sparked debate regarding the safety and efficacy of the procedure. We describe a higher incidence of early post-operative bile duct strictures after ALPPS, a complication rarely seen after conventional liver resection. METHODS An institutional review was conducted to assess the incidence of post-operative biliary strictures following conventional right-sided or extended right-sided hemi-hepatectomy and ALPPS. Patient demographics and operative data were obtained from the patient database of Karolinska University Hospital. RESULTS Between 2010 and 2015, 528 hemi-hepatectomies or extended hemi-hepatectomies were performed, of which 500 were conventional liver resections and 28 were ALPPS. The incidence of post-operative biliary stricture was 10.7% (n = 3) following ALPPS, 1.4% (n = 2) following extended right-sided hepatectomy (P = 0.023; OR = 8.46; 95% CI 1.35-53.2) and 1.1% following formal right-sided hepatectomy (P = 0.004; OR = 11.0; 95% CI 2.11-57.6). All biliary strictures were at the level of the hilum affecting the left hepatic duct. Pre-operative comorbidity was less in the ALPPS group and post-operative complications were more severe following ALPPS. CONCLUSION Iatrogenic biliary strictures following conventional liver resection is an uncommon complication. It does, however, occur more frequently following ALPPS and is associated with an increased morbidity. Caution should therefore be exercised when dividing the right hilar pedicle at stage 2 of ALPPS.","Sanjeevi, Srinivas; Sparrelid, Ernesto; Gilg, Stefan; Jonas, Eduard; Isaksson, Bengt",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.14252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29239077/,496
153474,Single incision thoracoscopic right upper lobectomy with systematic lymph node dissection.,2014,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using biologically transparent illumination to detect the correct position of the nasogastric tube in surgical patients. This prospective observational study enrolled 102 patients undergoing general surgeries. In all cases, a nasogastric tube equipped with a biologically transparent illumination catheter was inserted after general anesthesia. The identification of biologically transparent light in the epigastric area either with or without finger pressure indicated that the tube had been successfully inserted into the stomach. X-ray examination was performed to ascertain the tube position and was compared with the findings of the biologically transparent illumination technique. Biologically transparent light was detected in 72 of the 102 patients. In all of these 72 patients, the position of the nasogastric tube in the stomach was confirmed by X-ray examination. The light was not detected in the other 30 patients; X-ray examination showed that the nasogastric tube was positioned in the stomach in 21 of these 30 patients but not in the other 9. The sensitivity and specificity of the illumination were 77.4% and 100%, respectively. The results suggest that biologically transparent illumination is a useful and safe technique for detecting the correct position of the nasogastric tube in surgical patients under general anesthesia. When the BT light cannot be identified, X-ray examination is mandatory to confirm the position of the nasogastric tube.","Hirano, Hirofumi; Masaki, Hanayo; Kamada, Teppei; Taniguchi, Yoshie; Masaki, Eiji",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914808/,496
153525,Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery.,2014,"BACKGROUND The drawback of intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy with the double-stapling technique (DST) using a transorally inserted anvil (OrVil™, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) following laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is not only the high incidence of stenosis but also the presence of intractable stenosis that is refractory to endoscopic treatments. METHODS From November 2013 to December 2016, 24 patients with gastric cancer underwent intracorporeal circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy with the hemi-double-stapling technique (hemi-DST) using the OrVil™ in antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located on the left side of the patient following LTG to prevent twisting of the esophagojejunostomy and lifted jejunum, which might cause intractable stenosis of the esophagojejunostomy. RESULTS In this patient series, no twisting of the esophagojejunostomy and lifted jejunum was encountered intraoperatively or postoperatively. Two stenoses of the esophagojejunostomy occurred. Because neither was involved with twisting and both were localized at the anastomotic plane, endoscopic treatments including balloon dilation and electrocautery incisional therapy were successful in both cases. There were no patients with intractable stenosis in this series. CONCLUSIONS Intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy with the hemi-DST using the OrVil™ in antecolic Roux-en-Y reconstruction with its efferent loop located on the left side of the patient can be one option for a circular stapling technique in LTG due to its prevention of intractable stenosis of the esophagojejunostomy that is refractory to endoscopic treatments.","Tokuhara, Takaya; Nakata, Eiji; Tenjo, Toshiyuki; Kawai, Isao; Kondo, Keisaku; Ueda, Hirofumi; Tomioka, Atsushi",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6484-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30341648/,496

We utilized the reasoned action framework in a mixed-methods, two-study approach. Study 1, an open-ended belief elicitation survey (N = 197), explored the underlying beliefs associated with intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 once a vaccine becomes available. In a quantitative survey with a representative sample of U.S. adults, study 2 (N = 1656) tested the psychological determinants of intention to get vaccinated. Results revealed (1) the most common attitudinal, normative, and control beliefs about COVID-19 vaccination; (2) instrumental attitude as the strongest determinant of COVID-19 vaccination intention; and (3) 'achieving peace of mind' as an effective target for health promotion efforts.

153980,Role of canine circovirus in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea.,2017,"Background Gastric cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the digestive system. It has a poor prognosis and is clinically challenging to treat. Ferroptosis is a newly defined mode of programmed cell death. The roles and prognostic value of ferroptosis-related long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in gastric cancer remain unknown. Results In the current study, 20 ferroptosis-related lncRNAs were identified via univariate Cox analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator Cox regression analysis and used to construct a prognostic signature and classify gastric cancer patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. The signature was validated using TCGA training and testing cohorts. The risk signature was an independent prognostic indicator of survival and accurately predicted the prognoses of patients with gastric cancer. It was also associated with immune cell infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to investigate underlying mechanisms that the 20 ferroptosis-related lncRNAs were involved in. Chemosensitivity and immune checkpoint inhibitor analyses indicated that high-risk patients were more sensitive to the immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death protein 1. Conclusions The important role of ferroptosis-related lncRNAs in immune infiltration identified in the current study may assist the determination of personalized prognoses and treatments in patients with gastric cancer. These 20 lncRNAs can be used as the diagnostic and prognostic markers for gastric cancer.","Chen, WenZheng; Feng, ZongFeng; Huang, JianFeng; Fu, PengCheng; Xiong, JianBo; Cao, Yi; Liu, Yi; Tu, Yi; Li, ZhengRong; Jie, ZhiGang; Xiao, Tao",Disease markers,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/7724997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394774/,496

This is a crucial epidemiological parameter that speaks to both the consequences of relaxing lockdown and the propensity for a second wave of infections. Using a dynamic causal model of reported cases and deaths from multiple countries, we evaluated the evidence models of progressively longer periods of immunity. The results speak to an effective population immunity of about three months that, under the model, defers any second wave for approximately six months in most countries. This may have implications for the window of opportunity for tracking and tracing, as well as for developing vaccination programmes, and other therapeutic interventions.","Friston, Karl J; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Oliver J; Billig, Alexander J; Litvak, Vladimir; Price, Cathy J; Moran, Rosalyn J; Costello, Anthony; Pillay, Deenan; Lambert, Christian",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16253.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33088924/,496
154586,Venous thromboembolism risk for the contemporary bariatric surgeon.,2019,"The gastrointestinal microenvironment, dominated by dietary compounds and the commensal bacteria, is a major driver of intestinal CD4+ T helper (Th) cell differentiation. Dietary compounds can be sensed by nuclear receptors (NRs) that consequently exert pleiotropic effects including immune modulation. Here, we found that under homeostatic conditions the NR Liver X receptor (LXR), a sensor of cholesterol metabolites, regulates RORγt+ CD4 T cells in the intestine draining mesenteric lymph node (MLN). While LXR activation led to a decrease, LXR-deficiency resulted in an increase in MLN Th17 and RORγt+ Tregs. Mechanistically, LXR signaling in CD11c+ myeloid cells was required to control RORγt+ Treg. By contrast, modulation of MLN Th17 was independent of LXR signaling in either immune or epithelial cells. Of note, horizontal transfer of microbiota between LXRα-/- and WT mice was sufficient to only partially increase MLN Th17 in WT mice. Despite LXRα deficiency resulted in an increased abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae bacterial families compared to littermate controls, microbiota ablation (including SFB) was not sufficient to dampen LXRα-mediated expansion of MLN Th17. Altogether, our results suggest that LXR modulates RORγt+ Treg and Th17 cells in the MLN through distinct mechanisms.","Parigi, Sara M; Das, Srustidhar; Frede, Annika; Cardoso, Rebeca F; Tripathi, Kumar Parijat; Doñas, Cristian; Hu, Yue O O; Antonson, Per; Engstrand, Lars; Gustafsson, Jan-Åke; Villablanca, Eduardo J",Mucosal immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-020-0323-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32681027/,496

155694,A new minimally invasive technique of combined chest wall resection for lung cancer.,2016,"Background The goal is to investigate prognostic factors for change in memory test performance in healthy older adults and to report and discuss the different statistical procedures used for investigating this topic in the literature. Methods Prognostic factors were here understood as any measures that were investigated to estimate change in memory test performance. MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, CENTRAL, and PsycInfo were searched up to November 2019. Prognostic factor and prognostic factor finding studies investigating prognostic factors on verbal and non-verbal short- and long-term memory after conducting memory training in healthy older adults were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the QUIPS tool. Results Our search yielded 12,974 results. We included 29 studies that address prognostic factors of change in memory test performance, including sociodemographic, (neuro-)psychological, genetic, and biological parameters. Studies showed high variation and methodological shortcomings with regard to the assessment, statistical evaluation, and reporting of the investigated prognostic factors. Included studies used different types of dependent variables (change scores vs. post-test scores) when defining change in memory test performance leading to contradictory results. Age was the only variable investigated throughout most of the studies, showing that older adults benefit more from training when using the change score as the dependent variable. Conclusion Overall, there is a need for adequate reporting in studies of prognostic factors for change in memory test performance. Because of inconsistencies and methodological shortcomings in the literature, conclusions regarding prognostic factors remain uncertain. As a tentative conclusion, one may say that the higher the age of the participant, the more profound the improvement in memory test performance will be after memory training.

But, there are few non-pharmacological nursing interventions to reduce propofol injection pain. OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of lidocaine pre-administration and local warming of the intravenous access site on propofol injection pain. DESIGN Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING The 555 bed, non-teaching National Cancer Center in Kyunggido, South Korea. PARTICIPANTS A total of 96 patients who underwent thyroidectomy under total intravenous general anesthesia with propofol were randomly allocated to the control, lidocaine pre-administration (LA) or local warming (LW) group. METHODS All three groups received 2% propofol with an effect-site target at 3μg/mL for induction dose. The control group received 2% propofol with no intervention. The lidocaine pre-administration group received 2% propofol 30s after 1% lidocaine 30mg. The local warming group received 2% propofol after warming of the intravenous access site for 1min using 43°C forced air. Propofol injection pain was assessed by four-point verbal categorial scoring (VCS), numerical rating scale (NRS) and surgical pleth index (SPI). RESULTS Pain VCS of the LA group (mean±SD, 1.11±0.45) was significantly reduced (U=-3.92, p<.001) compared to the control group (mean±SD, 1.71±0.74). Pain VCS of the LW group (mean±SD, 0.76±0.44) was significantly reduced (U=-5.17, p<.001) compared to the control group (mean±SD, 1.71±0.74). Pain VCS of the LW group was significantly reduced compared to the LA group (U=-3.33, p=.001]. Pain NRS of the LA group (mean±SD, 4.31±2.32) was significantly reduced (mean difference, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.63-3.00; p=.003) compared to the control group (mean±SD, 6.13±2.39). Pain NRS of the LW group (mean±SD, 3.06±2.37) was significantly reduced (mean difference, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.63-4.51; p<.009) compared to the control group. There were significant differences in pain NRS between the LA group and the LW group (mean difference, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.09-2.42; p=.035). SPI of the LA group (mean±SD, 64.1±16.3) was significantly reduced (mean difference control versus LA, 8.36; 95% CI, 1.64-15.1; p=.016) compared to the control group (mean±SD, 72.5±9.56). SPI of the LW group (mean±SD, 55.0±16.2) was significantly reduced (mean difference control versus LW, 17.4; 95% CI, 10.8-24.0; p<.001) compared to the control group. There was a significant difference in SPI between the LA group and LW group (mean difference, 9.06; 95% CI, 1.02-17.1; p=.028).

METHODS Retrospective analysis of clinical data and survival follow-up was undertaken on 41 patients with advanced P-ADC from January 1, 2009, to April 30, 2019. Analysis on tumor biomarkers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and the cytokeratin-19-fragment (Cyfra21-1) were undertaken. The patients in this study were divided into three groups based on usage of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI): TKI therapy group (including combination with chemotherapy), non-TKI therapy group (chemotherapy alone), and palliative care group. RESULTS More than half of the patients had higher levels of tumor biomarkers and the incidence of NSE was highest (81.8%), followed by CEA (74.4%) and Cyfra21-1 (74.1%). All patients had abnormal findings on chest computed tomography and with adenocarcinoma pathology. The overall survival (OS) time was 10.4 months in TKI group, 8.8 months in the non-TKI group, and 2.1 months in the palliative care group. Patients with higher level of serum Cyfra21-1 had insignificantly shorter survival time compared to those with normal Cyfra21-1 (p = 0.067). TKI therapy and non-TKI therapy provided a better prognosis prediction compared to palliative care. TKI therapy improved prognosis compared to non-TKI therapy. The comprehensive based TKI therapy provided improved OS vs the non-TKI therapy. CONCLUSION TKI-based therapy could improve the prognosis and OS for advanced P-ADC. This study recommends the analysis of EGFR mutations for all patients with advanced P-ADC.","Zong, Qiu; Zhu, Feng; Wu, Shimin; Peng, Li; Mou, Yong; Miao, Kang; Wang, Qi; Zhao, Jianping; Xu, Yongjian; Zhou, Min",Tumori,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300891620947159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762285/,496

Here, a novel strategy for the stable expression of multiple proteins by integrating the genes into defined transcriptional hotspots in the human genome is presented. As a proof-of-concept, it is shown that EYFP is expressed at similar levels from hotspots and that the EYFP expression increases proportionally with the copy number. It is confirmed that three different fluorescent proteins, encoded by genes integrated at different loci, can be coexpressed at high levels. Further, a stable cell line is generated, producing antigens from different human coronaviruses: MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43. Antibodies raised against these antigens, which contain human N-glycosylation, show neutralizing activities against both viruses, suggesting that the coexpression system provides a quick and predictable way to produce multiple coronavirus antigens, such as the recent 2019 novel human coronavirus.","Kim, Chonsaeng; Jeong, You Kyeong; Yu, Jihyeon; Shin, Hye Jin; Ku, Keun Bon; Cha, Hyung Jin; Han, Jun Hee; Hong, Sung-Ah; Kim, Bum-Tae; Kim, Seong-Jun; Woo, Jae-Sung; Bae, Sangsu",Advanced biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/adbi.202000154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852178/,496
157130,Milk drop due to leptospirosis in dairy cows.,2015,"PURPOSE We analyzed the incidence of and risk factors for complications and conversions in a large contemporary series of patients treated with urological laparoendoscopic single site surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study cohort consisted of consecutive patients treated with laparoendoscopic single site surgery between August 2007 and December 2010 at a total of 21 institutions. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the risks of conversion, and of any grade and only high grade postoperative complications. RESULTS Included in analysis were 1,163 cases. Intraoperatively complications occurred in 3.3% of cases. The overall conversion rate was 19.6% with 14.6%, 4% and 1.1% of procedures converted to reduced port laparoscopy, conventional laparoscopic/robotic surgery and open surgery, respectively. On multivariable analysis the factors significantly associated with the risk of conversion were oncological surgical indication (p=0.02), pelvic surgery (p<0.001), robotic approach (p<0.001), high difficulty score (p=0.004), extended operative time (p=0.03) and an intraoperative complication (p=0.001). A total of 120 postoperative complications occurred in 109 patients (9.4%) with major complications in only 2.4% of the entire cohort. Reconstructive procedure (p=0.03), high difficulty score (p=0.002) and extended operative time (p=0.02) predicted high grade complications. CONCLUSIONS Urological laparoendoscopic single site surgery can be done with a low complication rate, resembling that in laparoscopic series. The conversion rate suggests that early adopters of the technique have adhered to the principles of careful patient selection and safety. Besides facilitating future comparisons across institutions, this analysis can be useful to counsel patients on the current risks of urological laparoendoscopic single site surgery.","Autorino, Riccardo; Kaouk, Jihad H; Yakoubi, Rachid; Rha, Koon Ho; Stein, Robert J; White, Wesley M; Stolzenburg, Jens-Uwe; Cindolo, Luca; Liatsikos, Evangelos; Rais-Bahrami, Soroush; Volpe, Alessandro; Han, Deok Hyun; Derweesh, Ithaar H; Lee, Seung Wook; Abdel-Karim, Aly M; Branco, Anibal; Greco, Francesco; Allaf, Mohamad; Sotelo, Rene; Kallidonis, Panagiotis; Jeong, Byong Chang; Best, Sara; Bazzi, Wassim; Pierorazio, Phillip; Elsalmy, Salah; Rane, Abhay; Han, Woong Kyu; Yang, Bo; Schips, Luigi; Molina, Wilson R; Fornara, Paolo; Terrone, Carlo; Giedelman, Camilo; Lee, Joo Yong; Crouzet, Sebastien; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Richstone, Lee; Yinghao, Sun; Kim, Fernando J; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.juro.2012.01.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22498207/,496

There were 5 research institutions that published more than 10 related papers and 3 authors who published more than 10 papers. There was little cooperation between authors from different countries and institutions. This field should focus on leading journals in critical care medicine and quality comprehensive journals. Keyword analysis showed that the current research focus is the standardized application of PCT. CONCLUSIONS There are few targeted studies on the application of PCT in GIM, and the relevant important literature mainly comes from other journals. GIM-specific research should be increased in the future.","Zhang, Yajun; Zhao, Li; Zhao, Na; Liang, Xia; Jiao, Feiyan; Fan, Jiubo",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-1689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353104/,496

158079,Comparative benefits of laparoscopic vs open hepatic resection: a critical appraisal.,2011,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) encodes numerous accessory proteins whose importance in the natural infection process is currently unclear. One of these accessory proteins is set apart by its function in the context of a related murine hepatitis virus (MHV) infection. SARS-CoV protein 6 increases MHV neurovirulence and accelerates MHV infection kinetics in tissue culture. Protein 6 also blocks nuclear import of macromolecules from the cytoplasm, a process known to involve its C-terminal residues interacting with cellular importins. In this study, protein 6 was expressed from plasmid DNAs and accumulated in cells prior to infection by wild-type MHV. Output of MHV progeny was significantly increased by preexisting protein 6. Protein 6 with C-terminal deletion mutations no longer interfered with nuclear import processes but still retained much of the capacity to augment MHV infections. However, some virus growth-enhancing activity could be ascribed to the C-terminal end of protein 6. To determine whether this augmentation provided by the C terminus was derived from interference with nuclear import, we evaluated the virus-modulating effects of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against importin-beta mRNAs, which down-regulated classical nuclear import pathways. The siRNAs did indeed prime cells for enhanced MHV infection. Our findings indicated that protein 6-mediated nuclear import blocks augmented MHV infections but is clearly not the only way that this accessory protein operates to create a milieu conducive to robust virus growth. Thus, the SARS-CoV protein 6 accelerates MHV infections by more than one mechanism.","Hussain, Snawar; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Thomas M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02406-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448520/,496

158996,Review of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy in modern practice.,2015,"Meat is one of the most consumed agro-products because it contains proteins, minerals, and essential vitamins, all of which play critical roles in the human diet and health. Meat is a perishable food product because of its high moisture content, and as such there are concerns about its quality, stability, and safety. There are two widely used methods for monitoring meat quality attributes: subjective sensory evaluation and chemical/instrumentation tests. However, these methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and destructive. To overcome the shortfalls of these conventional approaches, several researchers have developed fast and nondestructive techniques. Recently, electronic nose (e-nose), computer vision (CV), spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and multispectral imaging (MSI) technologies have been explored as nondestructive methods in meat quality and safety evaluation. However, most of the studies on the application of these novel technologies are still in the preliminary stages and are carried out in isolation, often without comprehensive information on the most suitable approach. This lack of cohesive information on the strength and shortcomings of each technique could impact their application and commercialization for the detection of important meat attributes such as pH, marbling, or microbial spoilage. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of recent nondestructive technologies (e-nose, CV, spectroscopy, HSI, and MSI), as well as their applications and limitations in the detection and evaluation of meat quality and safety issues, such as contamination, adulteration, and quality classification. A discussion is also included on the challenges and future outlooks of the respective technologies and their various applications.","Khaled, Alfadhl Y; Parrish, Chadwick A; Adedeji, Akinbode",Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety,https://doi.org/10.1111/1541-4337.12781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151512/,496

159116,Effects of gastric bypass surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes and only mild obesity.,2012,"AIM The kinetics of propofol are influenced by cardiac output. The aim of this study was to examine changes in blood propofol concentrations during phaeochromocytoma surgery using target-controlled infusion (TCI) anaesthesia with propofol. METHODS This is a prospective observational study. Ten patients with phaeochromocytoma who underwent unilateral adrenalectomy were included. Cardiac output was measured using an arterial pressure-based cardiac output analysis method. The target blood propofol concentrations were adjusted to maintain an approximate bispectral index (BIS) value of 40 before initiating surgery. The settings remained constant during surgery. Blood samples for propofol concentrations were collected from the radial artery at seven time points: two before tumour manipulation (T1, 2), two during tumour manipulation (T3, 4), and three after tumour vein ligation (T4-7). BIS values, the arterial pressure cardiac index (APCI) and haemodynamic parameters were measured at the same time points as the blood samples. The prop-ratio was calculated by dividing blood propofol concentrations by target concentrations of TCI. RESULTS APCI increased during tumour manipulation and after tumour vein ligation. The prop-ratio was reduced significantly by approximately 40% and showed a significant negative correlation with APCI. BIS values increased significantly and showed a significant negative correlation with the prop-ratio. CONCLUSION The increased APCI during tumour manipulation and after tumour vein ligation was associated with markedly reduced blood propofol concentrations. These results reveal that significant decreases in the anaesthetic effect may be observed in patients undergoing phaeochromocytoma surgery even if TCI anaesthesia is used with propofol.","Watanabe, Tatsunori; Hiraoka, Haruhiko; Araki, Takuya; Nagano, Daisuke; Aomori, Tohru; Nakamura, Tomonori; Yamamoto, Koujirou; Baba, Hiroshi",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.13334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28548279/,496

It can influence the quality of life and cause psychological problems that lead to depression and decreased self-esteem. We aimed to investigate the maternal, obstetrical and neonatal risk factors of urinary incontinence 3 to 12 months after childbirth. METHODS The Cochrane Library, Medline, Science Direct and Web of Science were searched for studies published from the inception of the databases up to December 2019, including any observational full-text papers. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3. Of 338 articles reviewed, 20 studies were considered for meta-analysis. RESULTS The results of our study showed that vaginal delivery in contrast to cesarean section (OR = 3.74, 95% CI: [2.71, 5.15], P < 0.00001), UI in pregnancy (OR = 5.27, 95% CI: [3.40, 8.17], P < 0.00001), episiotomy (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: [1.05, 1.45], P < 0.01), perineal tear > grade 2, instrumental delivery in contrast to cesarean section, epidural or spinal anesthesia, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI and neonatal birthweight have a direct relationship with UI. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed that urinary incontinence during pregnancy and vaginal births had the strongest relationship with postpartum urinary incontinence. Also, the maternal upright positions during labor did not reduce the likelihood of urinary incontinence. The awareness of this issue helps find effective strategies to reduce the likelihood of female urinary incontinence.","Siahkal, Shahla Faal; Iravani, Mina; Mohaghegh, Zeynab; Sharifipour, Foruzan; Zahedian, Maryam",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-020-04442-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32712698/,496

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to highlight limiting factors and provide successful practical solutions to assist urologists in incorporating and maintaining TM in their practices. METHODS A thorough literature review was conducted utilizing PubMed, Cochrane library, clinicaltrials.gov, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. Search terms and keywords included ""telemedicine"" and ""urology."" Only articles written or translated into the English language were included. RESULTS A total of 12 peer-reviewed articles were identified that discussed barriers for incorporation of TM in urology. Articles exclusive to the use of TM during the COVID-19 pandemic were also included, as well as American Urological Association and European Urological Association guidelines and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services statements and policies regarding TM pertinent to urological practice.

To understand the role of these molecules in AAV and their potential as therapeutic targets we have studied 1) The relationship between these DAMPS and disease activity, 2) The expression of RAGE and sRAGE in biopsy tissue and peripheral blood and 3) The effect of these molecules on ANCA-mediated cytokine production. METHODS We examined circulating levels of calgranulins (S100A8/A9 and S100A12), HMGB1 and sRAGE by ELISA. RAGE was examined in AAV kidney and lung biopsies by immunohistochemistry and RAGE expression was monitored in peripheral blood by qPCR. In vitro, the effect of co-stimulating PBMC with ANCA and S100A8/A9 on cytokine production was studied by ELISA. RESULTS We found significantly raised levels of calgranulins and HMGB1 in active AAV regardless of clinical phenotype (PR3+/MPO+ AAV). Levels of calgranulins showed significant correlations with each other. RAGE protein and message was raised in peripheral blood and in cells infiltrating kidney and lung biopsy tissue, whilst sRAGE was lowered. Furthermore, ANCA-mediated production of IL-8 from PBMC was significantly enhanced by the presence of S100A8/A9 in a RAGE/TLR4 dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS Raised circulating calgranulins provide a good marker of disease activity in AAV and are unlikely to be counteracted by sRAGE. Increased RAGE expression in AAV indicates receptor stimulation in active disease which may exacerbate ANCA induced cytokine production. Targeting the RAGE pathway may provide a useful therapeutic approach in AAV.","Page, Theresa H; Chiappo, Derick; Brunini, Francesca; Garnica, Josep; Blackburn, Jack; Dudhiya, Fayaz; Prendecki, Maria; McAdoo, Stephen P; Pusey, Charles D",Rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974049/,496

The type of sedation used for this procedure remains controversial. We performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate the differences of diagnostic yield and overall success of the procedure based on anesthesia type. METHODS Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy was performed using the superDimension software system. Once the targeted lesion was within reach, multiple tissue samples were obtained. Statistical analysis was used to correlate the yield with the type of sedation among other factors. A successful procedure was defined if a diagnosis was made or a fiducial marker was adequately placed. RESULTS Navigational bronchoscopy was performed on a total of 120 targeted lesions. The overall complication rate of the procedure was 4.1%. The diagnostic yield and success of the procedure was 74% and 87%, respectively. Duration of the procedure was the only significant difference between the general anesthesia and IV sedation groups (mean, 58 vs. 43 min, P=0.0005). A larger tumor size was associated with a higher diagnostic yield (P=0.032). All other variables in terms of effect on diagnostic yield and an unsuccessful procedure did not meet statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Navigational bronchoscopy is a safe and effective pulmonary diagnostic tool with relatively low complication rate. The diagnostic yield and overall success of the procedure does not seem to be affected by the type of sedation used.","Bowling, Mark R; Kohan, Matthew W; Walker, Paul; Efird, Jimmy; Ben Or, Sharon",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1097/lbr.0000000000000120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25590477/,496

More acutely distressed students typically receive priority, whereas those with mild to moderate depression often face longer wait times and fewer available therapy sessions. For this reason, interpersonal counseling for college students (IPC-C) was created as a brief manualized psychotherapy, suitable for students with mild to moderate depression, that maintains the core components of interpersonal counseling and integrates components from interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents and other developmentally appropriate techniques. This article describes a pilot trial of IPC-C. METHODS IPC-C is delivered in three to six psychotherapy sessions focused on alleviating depressive symptoms and increasing social support. Ten participants from two university counseling centers were recruited to receive IPC-C. The inclusion criterion was a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score of 5-14, indicating mild to moderate depression. Participants completed the PHQ-9 at each session, the College Adjustment Test at baseline and termination, and the IPC Satisfaction Scale at termination. RESULTS Nine of the 10 participants completed the study, attending an average of five therapy sessions each. Participants agreed that the number of sessions was appropriate and indicated satisfaction with the IPC-C intervention. Participants exhibited significantly reduced depression severity (Cohen's d=2.45) and significantly improved college adjustment (d=0.92). CONCLUSIONS In this pilot trial, IPC-C was found to be a feasible and acceptable intervention for university-based treatment of young adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.

Panama established mandatory mask use two months after its first documented case. Initial compliance was high, but diverse masks were used in public areas. We studied behavioral dynamics of mask use through the first two COVID waves in Panama, to improve implementation of effective, low-cost public health containment measures, when populations are exposed to novel air-borne pathogens. Methods: Mask use behavior was recorded from pedestrians in four Panamanian populations (August to December 2020). We recorded facial coverings; and if used, the type of mask, and gender and estimated age of the wearer. Findings: People were highly compliant (> 95%) with mask mandates, and demonstrated important population-level behaviours: 1) decreasing use of cloth masks over time, and increasing use of surgical masks; 2) mask use was 3-fold lower in sub-urban neighborhoods than other public areas; and 3) young people were least likely to wear masks. Interpretation: Results help focus highly-effective, low-cost, public health interventions for managing and controlling a pandemic. Considerations of behavioural preferences for different masks, relative to pricing and availability, are essential for optimizing public health policies. Policies to increase availability of effective masks, and behavioral nudges to increase acceptance, and to facilitate mask usage, during the on-going SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and for future pandemics of respiratory pathogens, are key tools, especially for nations lagging in access to expensive vaccines and pharmacological approaches.","Fernandez-Marin, H.; Bruner-Montero, G.; Portugal-Loayza, A.

Therefore, in many countries, despite differences in state and private property ratios in health infrastructure, the state priority is ensuring cooperation within the national health care system which capable quickly and well-coordinated work in the extremely dangerous epidemics conditions and other emergency situations. The purpose of this article is discussing a problem of public and private models of medical care organization in Russian health care system. Materials and methods. Content analysis methods, economical and statistical analysis, information and analytical materials of the Russian and foreign news agencies, a summary across Russia of Rosstat form No. 62 of the state statistical observation «Data on resource providing and on delivery of health care to the population» (legal entities - the medical organizations which are carrying out activity in the sphere of compulsory health insurance), analytical materials and statistical data of World Health Organization (The European portal of information of health care of WHO: https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/hfa-explorer/), statistical data andmetadata on the countries ofthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, https://stats.oecd.org/), the materials of monographic researches and periodicals including placed on the Internet were used in this article. Results: the system of compulsory health insurance is an ancestor of the program of the state guarantees of free medical care of in Russian citizens. ThelengthofthetextofthisProgramsofarwasincreasedin130timesincomparison with initial edition of 1998. At the same time, there is still no clear delineation for the bases, volumes and conditions differentiation of free and paid medical care rendering. As a result, the major human right to free medical care remains not completely realized. The numbers of the non-state medical organizations to provide free of charge medical care to the population according to the policy of obligatory medical insurance (i.e. financed from the state sources) in the period of 2011 to 2019 – from 648 to 2423 organizations respectively were increased in Russia four times. This demonstrates the creation of the new, «integrated» model of health care in Russia in the mode of public and private partnership for deciding of social tasks. Although, free medical care for citizens in the private medical organizations is not mentioned in the Constitution of Russian Federation (Main Law). In emergency situations such integration allows private medical structures to involve capacities and also be coordinated with one of the tasks of the Ministry of health target program «Development of the Fundamental, Transmitting and Personalized Medicine». Conclusions. There is a formation of the integrated, public and private (hybrid) model of health care in modern Russia that needs developing of a new partnership and principles of management in the sphere of medical care organization. State policy in the health care financing sphere should be directed not only to the state guarantees of medical care specification, but also to a gap in social and economic inequality reduction. The social protection systems should be focused, first of all, on people who are mostin greatneedofmedicalcare. For the protecting population from catastrophic payments for medical care, it is necessary to bring the concept of the social standards - a number of the general rules, norms and standards which must guarantee the state ensuring constitutional rights of citizens to free medical care in the health care legislation. © 2021 Scientific Centre for Family Health and Human Reproduction Problems.","Perkhov, V.

The aim of this study is to assess the roles assumed by medical students worldwide to provide insights during this pandemic but also for future global health emergencies. Methods: A global quantitative, descriptive study was held during April 2020 aiming to assess the different roles of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data was collected through a pretested, self-administered questionnaire disseminated online on the social media platforms of the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations. Results: The questionnaire received 279 responses from 101 countries. Medical students played many roles, with raising awareness (20.3%), medical assistance (14.4%), and answering helplines (13.1%) being reported most often. 16.5% of medical students reported that their wellbeing was negatively impacted by the role that they played, which was most often reported when they played no active role. Conclusions: Our results confirm that medical students should be considered a key component of a nation's public health preparedness. Based on our results, medical students can and should play a role during the pandemic, but a strong ethical consideration of medical students' wellbeing and safety when designing their role for future crises is necessary. © Journal of Public Health and Emergency.

The results show a significant influence of possible actions on perceived enjoyment, leading to attitude change and visit intention, while self-location leads to perceived enjoyment and thus attitude change. Through two independent samples (i.e., pre- and post-COVID-19), we examine the moderating effects of a change in circumstances on structural relationships. Our findings suggest that self-location is critical to changing attitudes toward destinations during the pandemic. Thus, we demonstrate that VR serves as a critical role in helping tourism destinations recover and building in tourism resilience. This study extends current knowledge of spatial presence by examining the respective roles of self-location and possible actions in tourism destinations.","Kim, Hyunsu Fung So Kevin Kam J.

Unfortunately, interacting with conventional digital signage during Covid-19 pandemic raises a concern on its hygiene. Thus, touchless interaction is preferable to avoid direct contact on the touch screen. Here we present a novel study on effectiveness of gaze-based interaction in a digital signage for public health education. Instead of touching the screen, the users engage with the content by gazing at a dynamic button that moves in horizontal or vertical direction. Experimental results show that gazing at faster dynamic buttons (angular speed of 60.28°/s) than its slower counterpart (angular speed of 30.14°/s) requires shorter time to complete a three-steps task (T = 84, Z =-1.977, p < 0.05).

This condition not only affects the condition of a country, hinders social interaction among community, and also has been impact on the health condition of every human being. To avoid the wider spread of Covid-19, the Indonesian government adopted a policy of social distancing and physical distancing in the form of staying at home, working from home, studying, and worshiping at home.The research’s design used Analytical Observational with Cross Sectional Study design. The independent variables of this study are the application of physical distancing, the application of hands washing behavior and consumption pattern of fruits and vegetables. The amount of sampling in this study were 109 respondents spread across Bogor Regency, West Java using accidental sampling’s and analyzed using chi-square. The results of the study illustrate that efforts to prevent Covid-19 by implementing physical distancing, hands washing behavior and vegetables fruits consumption patterns can reduces the risk of being exposed to Covid-19 in Indonesia.

New variants of the disease have different person-to-person variations in viral load, suggesting for example that the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant is more infectious but relatively less prone to superspreading. Meanwhile, mitigation of the pandemic has focused on limiting social contacts (lockdowns, regulations on gatherings) and decreasing transmission risk through mask wearing and social distancing. Using a mathematical model, we show that the competitive advantage of disease variants may heavily depend on the restrictions imposed. In particular, we find that lockdowns exert an evolutionary pressure which favours variants with lower levels of overdispersion. We find that overdispersion is an evolutionarily unstable trait, with a tendency for more homogeneously spreading variants to eventually dominate.","Nielsen, B.

An aim was to study the impacts of COVID-19 on the lives of healthcare workers involved in treatment, care and diagnosis of positive patients. Material and methods. The research was based on a qualitative research approach – a case study. Semi-structured interviews were performed with three healthcare workers from the emergency internal medicine clinic. Results. The data obtained from the research can be summarized in 3 categories: the impact of COVID-19 on professional and private life and the impact of COVID-19 on personality and internal changes. Within the categories, another 14 subcategories were structured. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects all aspects of the lives of healthcare workers and generates negative emotions. The most commonly expressed emotion is fear;where fear for others, for existence and the future prevails. The epidemic also reflected on the inability to meet the basic human needs of the respondents. Conclusions. To reduce the negative impact of pandemic on work, additional research is needed to assess its influence on employees. The research suggests the inclusion of psychological support as well as more extensive education for employees to reduce the possibility of burnout in the workplace, anxiety, depression and worries about existence.","Kranjčević-Ščurić, Mihaela Ščurić Ivica Filej Bojana",Nursing in the 21st Century,https://doi.org/10.2478/pielxxiw-2021-0027,496
187152,Totally laparoscopic resection and extraction of specimens via transanal route in synchronous colon and gastric cancer.,2018,"BACKGROUND Disease severity in viral bronchiolitis is often difficult to predict at onset, and may be related to the host immune response. Recognizing the particular immunologic features of infants who develop severe disease might offer an opportunity for developing diagnostic tools to facilitate early intervention and improve outcomes. METHODS We compared cytokine gene expression (by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), cytokine concentrations (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and the activation status of lymphocytes (by flow cytometry) in the peripheral blood of children hospitalized with moderate and severe viral bronchiolitis and a group of age-matched controls. RESULTS Analysis was undertaken on 57 children with viral bronchiolitis and 33 controls. Interleukin-7 mRNA expression at enrollment in peripheral blood mononuclear cells differed significantly between those with moderate and severe bronchiolitis, and correlated with both the subsequent length of hospital stay and need for supplemental oxygen therapy. Serum interleukin-10 concentration also distinguished moderate from severe disease. Participants with viral bronchiolitis demonstrated a more activated γδ-T cell phenotype (Vδ1+), but a more naive TCR αβ-T cell compartment compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS Viral bronchiolitis is characterized by a distinct pattern of cytokine expression and lymphocyte activation. These changes suggest an inadequate innate response in severe disease, and may offer potential as markers of disease severity.","Leahy, T Ronan; McManus, Ross; Doherty, Derek G; Grealy, Robert; Carr, Michael J; Slattery, Dubhfeasa; Ryan, Thomas",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27434830/,496

The disease usually involves trachea, nose, and outer ears. To investigate whether the tissue distribution of RP may be explained by a specific immune response, we immunized rats with cartilage matrix protein (matrilin-1), a protein predominantly expressed in tracheal cartilage. After 2-3 weeks, some rats developed a severe inspiratory stridor. They had swollen noses and/or epistaxis, but showed neither joint nor outer ear affection. The inflammatory lesions involved chronic active erosions of cartilage. Female rats were more susceptible than males. The disease susceptibility was controlled by both MHC genes (f, l, d, and a haplotypes are high responders, and u, n, and c are resistant) and non-MHC genes (the LEW strain is susceptible; the DA strain is resistant). However, all strains mounted a pronounced IgG response to cartilage matrix protein. The initiation and effector phase of the laryngotracheal involvement causing the clinical symptoms were shown to depend on alphabeta T cells. Taken together, these results represent a novel model for RP: matrilin-1-induced RP. Our findings also suggest that different cartilage proteins are involved in pathogenic models of RP and RA.","Hansson, A S; Heinegård, D; Holmdahl, R",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10487773/,496

188273,Evaluation of a canine small intestinal submucosal xenograft and polypropylene mesh as bioscaffolds in an abdominal full-thickness resection model of growing rats.,2013,"At the outset, the concept of a 'public good' was associated with economic policies. However, it has now evolved not only from a national to a global concept (global public good), but also from a concept applying solely to the production of goods to one encompassing societal issues (education, environment, etc.) and fundamental rights, including the right to health and food. Through their actions, Veterinary Services, as defined by the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Terrestrial Code) of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), help to improve animal health and reduce production losses. In this way they contribute directly and indirectly to food security and to safeguarding human health and economic resources. The organisation and operating procedures of Veterinary Services are therefore key to the efficient governance required to achieve these objectives. The OIE is a major player in global cooperation and governance in the fields of animal and public health through the implementation of its strategic standardisation mission and other programmes for the benefit of Veterinary Services and OIE Member Countries. Thus, the actions of Veterinary Services and the OIE deserve to be recognised as a global public good, backed by public investment to ensure that all Veterinary Services are in a position to apply the principles of good governance and to comply with the international standards for the quality of Veterinary Services set out in the OIE Terrestrial Code (Section 3 on Quality of Veterinary Services) and Aquatic Animal Health Code (Section 3 on Quality of Aquatic Animal Health Services).","Eloit, M",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23413735/,496
188645,Is Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Adrenalectomy a Feasible Alternative in Treating Aldosterone-Producing Adenoma?,2016,"BACKGROUND Nitrous oxide is commonly used in general anaesthesia but concerns exist that it might increase perioperative cardiovascular risk. We aimed to gather evidence to establish whether nitrous oxide affects perioperative cardiovascular risk. METHODS We did an international, randomised, assessor-blinded trial in patients aged at least 45 years with known or suspected coronary artery disease having major non-cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned via automated telephone service, stratified by site, to receive a general anaesthetic with or without nitrous oxide. Attending anaesthetists were aware of patients' group assignments, but patients and assessors were not. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and cardiovascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrest) within 30 days of surgery. Our modified intention-to-treat population included all patients randomly assigned to groups and undergoing induction of general anaesthesia for surgery. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00430989. FINDINGS Of 10,102 eligible patients, we enrolled 7112 patients between May 30, 2008, and Sept 28, 2013. 3543 were assigned to receive nitrous oxide and 3569 were assigned not to receive nitrous oxide. 3483 patients receiving nitrous oxide and 3509 not receiving nitrous oxide were assessed for the primary outcome. The primary outcome occurred in 283 (8%) patients receiving nitrous oxide and in 296 (8%) patients not receiving nitrous oxide (relative risk 0·96, 95% CI 0·83–1·12; p=0·64). Surgical site infection occurred in 321 (9%) patients assigned to nitrous oxide, and in 311 (9%) patients in the no-nitrous oxide group (p=0·61), and severe nausea and vomiting occurred in 506 patients (15%) assigned to nitrous oxide and 378 patients (11%) not assigned to nitrous oxide (p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION Our findings support the safety profile of nitrous oxide use in major non-cardiac surgery. Nitrous oxide did not increase the risk of death and cardiovascular complications or surgical-site infection, the emetogenic effect of nitrous oxide can be controlled with antiemetic prophylaxis, and a desired effect of reduced volatile agent use was shown.

Sequence determination and comparison of genes 6 and 11 with the corresponding sequences of GBR strains ADRV and IDIR showed that they were the cognate genes encoding NSP1 and NSP5, respectively. While the overall identities of nucleotide sequences between these two genes and the corresponding genes of strains ADRV and IDIR were in the range 52.6-57.2%, the identities of deduced amino acid sequences were only 34.9-46.3%. These results demonstrate that the substantial diversity of NSP1 observed among group A rotaviruses (GAR) also exists within GBRs and that a high degree of diversity also exists among NSP5 of GBRs, in contrast to GAR NSP5. The NSP1 gene of KB63 contains three ORFs, whereas the NSP1 genes of other GBR strains contain only two. ORFs 2 and 3 of the KB63 gene may be derived from a single ORF corresponding to ORF2 of other GBR strains by the usage of a stop codon created by an upstream single base deletion and single point mutations. In vitro expression studies showed that ORFs 1 and 2, but not 3, of gene 6 can be translated, suggesting that ORF2 may encode a C-terminally truncated, potentially functional product. It may play a role, together with the product of ORF1, in virus replication, as the virus can be passaged further in kids. Similarly, gene 11 can be translated in vitro. Like its counterpart in GARs, the protein encoded by gene 11 was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro.","Shen, S; McKee, T A; Wang, Z D; Desselberger, U; Liu, D X",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10466806/,496
189703,Prevalence of four enteropathogens in the faeces of young diarrhoeic dairy calves in Switzerland.,2008,"Standard sutures used in vaginal cuff reapproximation in total laparoscopic hysterectomies and hysterotomy closure in myomectomies require knot placement and tensioning of the suture throughout the closure. This may contribute to wound dehiscence, increased blood loss, and ischemia of tissue surrounding the knots. In 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the Quill™ bidirectional barbed suture (Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada)(Fig. 1). In January 2007, the suture was introduced in the United States. The emergence of the bidirectional barbed suture has significantly affected minimally invasive surgery. Initially used by orthopaedic and plastic surgeons, barbed suture has allowed for the tedious task of knot tying to fade away. Following the introduction of the bidirectional barbed suture, the FDA approved the V-Loc™ unidirectional suture (Covidien, Mansfield, MA)(Fig. 2). The utility of the barbed suture has been instrumental in laparoscopic myomectomy and total laparoscopic hysterectomy. As barbed suture is easily utilized using the same laparoscopic ports, needle drivers, and graspers, the surgeon does not require a third hand to facilitate laparoscopic suturing. The barbs minimize tissue recoil and do so with accurate soft tissue approximation, achieving hemostasis without the use of locking and figure eight sutures. Barbed suture allows for a shorter operative time, as there is an ease of suturing without the complication of knot tying. Barbed sutures are essential tools in the modern laparoscopist's toolbox.","Manoucheri, Elmira; Einarsson, Jon I",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23975449/,496

During the initial phases of infection the virus causes pauci-inflammatory alveolar and interstitial edema that result in imaging abnormalities dominated by ground glass opacities (GGO). Severe SARS cases can develop radiologic and pathologic findings of diffuse alveolar damage. Although radiologic evidence of acute bronchiolitis is absent, SARS-CoV also infects ciliated airway epithelium, probably accounting for respiratory transmissibility of the virus. Radiologic recovery from SARS can be complete, but computed tomography images often show persistent GGO and reticular opacities, some of which reflect pathologic findings of fibrosis. Long-term follow-up imaging of survivors shows gradual decrease of GGO and reticulation with persistent air trapping in some patients. The latter is evidence of small airway disease that is not radiologically evident at the onset of the disease.","Ketai, Loren; Paul, Narinder S; Wong, Ka-tak T",Journal of thoracic imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17110851/,496

We expressed and purified a soluble chimera consisting of the p75NTR ectodomain fused to the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc fragment (p75-Fc). Although p75-Fc interacts with RV, the infectivity of RV did not decrease significantly when it was incubated in the presence of the soluble receptor alone. However, when it was subsequently incubated with an antihuman IgG directed against the Fc fragment of p75-Fc, the infectivity of RV was significantly lowered (>90%), whereas incubation with antihuman IgG alone had no effect. We then selected eight independent RV mutants that were not neutralized by p75-Fc and antihuman IgG (srr [soluble receptor resistant] mutants). Each mutant carried a single mutation in the glycoprotein gene leading to one amino acid substitution in the protein. A total of four different substitutions were found. Two of the mutations were located at position 318 (phenylalanine replaced by a serine or a valine residue), and two were located at position 352 (histidine replaced by a tyrosine or an arginine residue). All of the mutations prevented the interaction with p75NTR as either a soluble or a membrane-anchored form. Two mutants (F318S) and (H352R) resulted in the formation of small plaques on BSR cells, probably due to the slower maturation of the glycoprotein. Immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and neutralization assays showed that the four mutated glycoproteins still interacted with representative anti-RV glycoprotein monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), indicating that p75NTR binds outside of the known RV glycoprotein antigenic sites.","Langevin, Christelle; Tuffereau, Christine",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12368318/,496

This is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, as patients with diabetes are at a higher risk of mortality.1 Reviewed in a 2018 installment of Evidence Corner,2 a double-blind, randomized clinical trial (RCT) reported that topical oxygen continuously diffused to DFU tissue resulted in nonhealing DFUs healing more than 20 days faster than those that were similarly treated with standard therapy and a sham device.3 More than twice the DFUs closed in patients receiving continuously diffused topical oxygen in comparison with the sham arm completely healed in 12 weeks (P = .02). It has been hypothesized that intervals of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)-breathing 100% oxygen at atmosphere absolute (ATA) greater than the 1.0 normal at sea level-may similarly improve lower extremity ulcer healing outcomes. This month's Evidence Corner summarizes 2 studies regarding patients receiving HBO.

This web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in the general population of India with an aim to evaluate the mental health of the healthy individuals in the later stage of the lockdown period. Data on socio-demographic factors, anxiety, depression (HADS scale), perceived stress (PSS scale), insomnia (insomnia severity index), subjective psychological feeling of well-being (WHO-5 well-being Index), and attitude towards covid-19 (7-point Likert scale) was collected. Univariate regression analysis and Karl Pearson's correlation were used to analyze the correlation of mental health abnormalities with socio-demographic factors. 119 subjects of mean age of 36.03 ± 18.04 years took part in the study. Their average number of days of stay at home during the lockdown and the average number of days of the lifestyle changes was 49.07 ± 31.92 and 61.39 ± 20.03 days, respectively. Depression, anxiety, stress, and clinical insomnia due to covid-19 were reported in 13.45%, 10.92%, 14.29%, and 11.76% subjects, respectively. There was a significant correlation of depression, anxiety, stress, and WHO-5 well-being score with age, socio-economic status, and the average number of days of the change in lifestyle due to the COVID-19 pandemic (P < 0.05). Therefore, the study concluded that the abnormalities of mental health were less prevalent in the older age group and lower socioeconomic status in the later phase of lockdown.","Gangwar, Vibha; Singh, Amita; Verma, Manish; John, Nitin A; Gangwar, Ritesh S; John, Jyoti; Jasrotia, Rajani B","International journal of physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540132/,496
193104,Protein sequence models for prediction and comparative analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 -human interactome.,2021,"Many groups of plus-stranded RNA viruses produce additional, subgenomic mRNAs to regulate the expression of part of their genome. Arteriviruses and coronaviruses (order Nidovirales) are unique among plus-stranded RNA viruses for using a mechanism of discontinuous RNA synthesis to produce a nested set of 5'- and 3'-coterminal subgenomic mRNAs, which serve to express the viral structural protein genes. The discontinuous step presumably occurs during minus-strand synthesis and joins noncontiguous sequences copied from the 3'- and 5'-proximal domains of the genomic template. Nidovirus genome amplification (""replication"") and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (""transcription"") are driven by 13 to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp's), generated by autocatalytic processing of two large ""replicase"" polyproteins. Previously, using a replicon system, the N-terminal nsp1 replicase subunit of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) was found to be dispensable for replication but crucial for transcription. Using reverse genetics, we have now addressed the role of nsp1 against the background of the complete EAV life cycle. Mutagenesis revealed that nsp1 is in fact a multifunctional regulatory protein. Its papain-like autoprotease domain releases nsp1 from the replicase polyproteins, a cleavage essential for viral RNA synthesis. Several mutations in the putative N-terminal zinc finger domain of nsp1 selectively abolished transcription, while replication was either not affected or even increased. Other nsp1 mutations did not significantly affect either replication or transcription but still dramatically reduced the production of infectious progeny. Thus, nsp1 is involved in at least three consecutive key processes in the EAV life cycle: replicase polyprotein processing, transcription, and virion biogenesis.","Tijms, Marieke A; Nedialkova, Danny D; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17626105/,496

This observation is in apparent contradiction with the reduced number of stroke patient admissions during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, seen worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 can affect the endothelium, favour a procoagulant state and involves the heart, leading to an increased risk of developing a stroke. The pandemic and confinement influence the behaviour of the population, perhaps more reticent to contact emergency departments flooded with COVID-19 patients and likely to have modified levels of stress. In addition, it was shown that confinement during the pandemic reduced air pollution, thought to affect stroke risk. These indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 probably also impact the number of hospital admissions for stroke.

The review was performed as part of a PhD study by the first author, which required the researcher to critically review all relevant studies in their specific research area. The review was conducted using a formal, scientific process and high¬lighted 20 relevant papers. Among the lessons learnt, undertaking an SLR was a time-consuming process. The search produced 1,987 papers, and screening the search yield was facilitated by using a pre-defined protocol. Extraction of data from each study was standardised and generated a 1-page summary of the key findings and methodology to facilitate comparisons of the included studies. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool was used for quality assessment. In the critical appraisal process, it is essential that reviewers have good baseline knowledge in the research subject, a solid under¬standing of the fundamentals of a robust research study including potential bias in research. With the great amount of information that a critical appraisal produces, good information management was key throughout the review to ensure the process was explicit and replicable and so that reviewers could justify their decisions. The methods and processes detailed in this report, as well as its lessons, are relevant to an SLR for any research subject.","Bonfield, M; Fearnside, L; Cramp, F",Journal of allied health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30194822/,496

While small-scale poultry farmers have already demonstrated their high risk of exposure and subsequent infection with H5N1 avian flu, other bird handling occupations may also be at high risk. In this review article, the author highlights the occupational health aspects of a newly emerging infectious disease, H5N1 avian flu, and the efforts being made by various authorities to confront the possibility of the next flu pandemic. Various measures potentially available to protect high-risk workers are outlined, emphasizing a hierarchy of controls in which these measures can be placed. The author postulates that, by reducing the risk of transmission of avian flu to these workers, occupational medicine can play a pivotal role in the world's effort to prepare for a pandemic, and may be uniquely positioned to contribute to the effort to delay or even avert the emergence of the next pandemic.","Halpin, John",Archives of environmental & occupational health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16983858/,496

In this study, we established a new animal model, the Chinese hamster, susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. SARS-CoV could propagate effectively and sustain high levels for 1 wk in animal lungs. All animals were protected from SARS-CoV infection in preventive settings. Further, when used therapeutically this antibody led to an approximately 4-log(10) decrease in viral burden in infected animal lungs. The pathological changes in lungs correlated closely with the dose of antibody administered. The excellent preventive and therapeutic roles of equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab')(2) in several animal models, including the novel Chinese hamster model described in this study, have provided exciting data concerning its potential clinical study.","Luo, Deyan; Ni, Bing; Zhao, Guangyu; Jia, Zhengcai; Zhou, Lili; Pacal, Marek; Zhang, Liangyan; Zhang, Songle; Xing, Li; Lin, Zhihua; Wang, Li; Li, Jintao; Liang, Yunfei; Shi, Xinfu; Zhao, Tingting; Zou, Liyun; Wu, Yuzhang; Wang, Xiliang",Viral immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17931120/,496

METHODS We performed a double-blinded prospective study at a tertiary care center in 23 adults scheduled to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis. The patients were randomized to receive SR or PR. The sinonasal mucosal blood flow was measured by optical rhinometry. The surgical field visualization score was based on the Boezaart scale. RESULTS The groups had similar clinical characteristics. During the 60- to 90-minute and 90- to 120-minute operative time windows, the blood flow was significantly greater in the PR group than in the SR group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively). The amounts of blood loss in the PR and SR groups were 152.9 +/- 161.3 mL and 355.9 +/- 393.4 mL, respectively (p = 0.12). The median ratios of the surgical field visualization score to the number of sinuses operated on in the PR and SR groups were 2.1 and 1.8, respectively (p = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS The intraoperative blood flow, as determined by optical rhinometry, was significantly greater with anesthesia with PR than with anesthesia with SR, 1 hour into the procedure; however, this difference did not translate into differences in the amounts of operative blood loss or in the surgical field visualization scores.","Gomez-Rivera, Fernando; Cattano, Davide; Ramaswamy, Uma; Patel, Chirag B; Altamirano, Alfonso; Man, Li-Xing; Luong, Amber; Chen, Zhongxue; Citardi, Martin J; Fakhri, Samer","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23193905/,496
194575,Poult enteritis and mortality syndrome in turkeys in Great Britain.,2006,"While the importance of viral infections is well studied in domestic cats, only limited information is available on their occurence and prevalence in the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV), calicivirus (FCV), herpesvirus (FHV), parvovirus (FPV), immunodeficiency virus (FIV), leukemia virus (FeLV), and FeLV antigenemia in 51 European wildcat sera. Samples were collected between 1996 and 1997 from wildcat populations in France, Switzerland, and Germany. Antibodies to FCoV were detected in two cats (4%) and FCoV RNA was detected in feces of one of these two cats. Antibodies to FCV, FHV and FPV were found at relatively low frequencies of 16%, 4%, and 2%, respectively. Antibodies to FIV were not detected. Although antigen and antibodies to FeLV were detected in 49%, and 75%, respectively, no evidence of FeLV-associated pathology was found. From the low prevalence of FCoV, FCV, FHV and FPV infections and from the fact that the European wildcats live solitarily, it was concluded that these viral infections do not spread readily within a population. Therefore, it may be assumed that release into the wild of European wildcats bred in captivity would not bring about a high risk of introducing of these viral infections to the free-ranging wildcats. As an exception, wildcats should be tested for absence of FIV infection before release if they were at risk to acquire this infection from domestic cats.","Leutenegger, C M; Hofmann-Lehmann, R; Riols, C; Liberek, M; Worel, G; Lups, P; Fehr, D; Hartmann, M; Weilenmann, P; Lutz, H",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10574526/,496

Its gene and surface expressions are increased in cases of malignant transformation, inflammation, or T cell activation, whereas normal B and resting T cells lack detectable APN protein expression. In this study we elucidated the intracellular distribution, expression pattern, and enzymatic activity of a naturally occurring mutation in the coding region of the APN gene. At physiological temperatures the mutant protein is enzymatically inactive, persists as a mannose-rich polypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum, and is ultimately degraded by an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. It shows in part the distinct behavior of a temperature-sensitive mutant with a permissive temperature of 32 degrees C, leading to correct sorting of the Golgi compartment accompanied by the acquisition of proper glycosylation but without reaching the cell-surface membrane and without regaining its enzymatic activity. Because the patient bearing this mutation suffered from leukemia, possible links to the pathogenesis of leukemia are discussed.","Alfalah, Marwan; Krahn, Michael P; Wetzel, Gabi; von Hörsten, Stephan; Wolke, Carmen; Hooper, Nigel; Kalinski, Thomas; Krueger, Sabine; Naim, Hassan Y; Lendeckel, Uwe",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469741/,496

MAA appeared 3 h post-infection, concurrently with the appearance of cytoplasmic antigens. Electron microscopic observations of cell cultures infected with either coronavirus strain and labelled with the immunoperoxidase antibody (IPA) technique for MAA detection showed that MAA consisted mainly of a strongly labelled, discontinuous, brush-like layer of amorphous material, strictly associated with the infected cell membrane. By light microscopy, reactivity of MAA with homologous and heterologous immune serum was similar to that of antigens detected by IPA in ethanol-fixed infected cells. IPA and IFAMA, but not haemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) and neutralizing (Nt) antibody, were strongly decreased by absorption of immune sera with trypsin-treated glutaraldehyde-fixed cell cultures infected with homologous virus. MAA IgG antibodies were detected by IFAMA in both human and animal sera.

196841,Chronic diarrhea in dogs.,1980,"Carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) inhibit HIV-1 and it is proposed that therapy with such agents may have important implications for the future of anti-HIV therapy. Examples of CBAs include the procaryotic cyanovirin-N (CV-N), plant lectins such as HHA, GNA, NPA, CA and UDA, the monoclonal antibody 2G12 directed against a glycan-containing epitope on HIV envelope gp120, and the mannose-specific non-peptidic antibiotic Pradimicin A, which inhibits the entry of HIV-1 into its target cells. CBAs prevent not only virus infection of susceptible cells, but also inhibit syncytia formation between persistently HIV-infected cells and uninfected lymphocytes. In addition, CBAs may also prevent DC-SIGN-mediated transmission of HIV to T-lymphocytes. Therefore, CBAs qualify as potential microbicide drugs. Long-term exposure of HIV to CBAs in cell culture results in the progressive deletion of N-glycans of HIV gpl20 in an attempt of the virus to escape drug pressure. In this respect, the CBAs are endowed with a high genetic barrier. Multiple mutations at N-glycosylation sites are required before pronounced phenotypic drug resistance development becomes evident. CBA treatment of HIV may consist of a novel chemotherapeutic concept with a dual mechanism of antiviral action: a direct antiviral activity by preventing HIV entry and transmission to its target cells, and an indirect antiviral activity by forcing HIV to delete glycans in its gpl20 envelope. The latter phenomenon will result in creating 'holes' in the protective glycan shield of the HIV envelope, whereby the immune system may become triggered to produce neutralizing antibodies against previously hidden immunogenic epitopes of gp120. If this concept can be proven in in vivo, low-molecular-weight non-peptidic CBAs such as Pradimycin A may become the cornerstone for the efficient treatment of infections of those viruses that require a glycosylated envelope (that is, HIV, but also hepatitis C virus) for entry into its target cells. In addition, influenza virus and coronavirus infections may also qualify to be treated by CBAs.","Balzarini, Jan",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17354647/,496

Still there are severe forms of illness in which the patients deteriorate unexpectedly within hours. This study delineates clinical characteristics of such fatal cases of SARS for the purpose of identifying patients with poor outcome. METHOD Patients with the diagnosis of probable or suspected SARS admitted to the Taipei Veterans General Hospital during the period from March 26, 2003 to May 25, 2003 were included. The medical records of fatal cases were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS During the study period, thirty-six probable cases and 17 suspected cases of SARS were identified. Eight probable but none of the suspected cases died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with multiple organ dysfunction after a median of 6-day hospital stay (range, 1-30 days). All but 2 patients acquired the infection nosocomially. Of the fatal cases, four were males and 4 females, with the median age of 65 years (range, 29-76 yrs). All except 3 had co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values were abnormal (> 200 U/L) in all patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: According to the specially designed form, a retrospective analysis of primary accounting documents was carried out (f. No. 103/o) in 158 patients with COVID-19. The research was carried out in specialized inpatient infectious diseases wards of health institutions of the Sumy region during the period from April to September 2020. The study used a systemic approach, bibliosemantic, comparative and statistical analyses, logical generalization methods. RESULTS Results: Among the study group of patients, namely 158 people, a bigger number of women (56.33±3.95%) than men (43.67±3.95%) were recorded. Patients of working age (from 18 to 64 years old) took 70.89±3.61% of all patients, and people aged 65 years and older - 29.11±3.61%. The time from the beginning of symptoms to hospitalization in each second patient (49.37±3.98%) lasted 5-7 days. In most cases, the patient's stay in the hospital equaled 13-15 bed-days - 32.28±3.72%. The index of patients with severe and critical state was 20.89±3.23% (33 patients). In 8.23±2.19% (13 people) of treated cases of hospital stay ended in death. A large index of patients with a severe course of the disease, the treatment of which ended in discharge, were in hospital for more than 13 bed days - 12.03±2.59% (19 people). All of these patients were older, had CNCDs (chronic non-communicable diseases), half of them were hospitalized on day 7 and later from the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION Conclusions: In older people, the disease progresses faster and complications are developing more often. Also, the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 pattern and the length of staying in the hospital are affected by the time starting the onset of symptoms till hospitalization and the presence of CNCDs. The hereinafter data allows to increase knowledge about spreading of COVID-19, to improve the quality of organizational and preventive events in the provision of medical care, and reducing mortality.","Dryha, Natalia O; Stepanenko, Alla V; Rudenko, Lesia A; Zhaldak, Daria O; Piven, Svitlana M; Plakhtiienko, Inna O",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34090263/,496

MHV, a collective term describing a group of corona viruses, is found in natural infections in over 70% of laboratory mouse populations in the U.S.A. and Canada. Natural outbreaks of MHV in our animal colony afforded us the opportunity to study MHV-induced immunosuppression as well as the effects of MHV infection on neurotransmitter immunomodulation. Concanavalin A (Con A)-stimulated DNA synthesis by spleen T lymphocytes from MHV-infected mice was 20-50% that of non-infected mice. The MHV infection also altered neurotransmitter modulation of spleen T-lymphocyte activation. In contrast to noradrenaline ablation of Con A-activated DNA synthesis by spleen lymphocytes from non-infected mice, DNA synthesis by the infected group was not inhibited by noradrenaline or dibutyryl-cAMP. These effects of MHV infection were specific for spleen T lymphocytes since MHV infection did not alter Con A stimulation of thymocytes, lipopolysaccharide stimulation of spleen B lymphocytes, or noradrenaline inhibition of thymocyte and B-cell DNA synthesis. MHV infection also did not alter spleen T-lymphocyte subset proportions. Thus, MHV infection inhibits spleen T-lymphocyte activation and blocks in vitro catecholamine and cAMP regulation of spleen T-cell activation but does not affect activation of thymic cells or spleen B cells.","Cook-Mills, J M; Munshi, H G; Perlman, R L; Chambers, D A",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1572700/,496

The sensitivity was 97.1% by testing against 69 samples from hospitalized and/or recovered COVID-19 patients. The overall accuracy rate reached 97.3%. The assay was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 1 after the onset of COVID-19 disease. The average antibody levels increased during hospitalization and 14 days after discharge. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 28 of 276 asymptomatic medical staff and 1 of 5 nucleic acid test-negative ""close contacts"" of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: With the assays developed here, we can screen medical staff, incoming patients, passengers, and people who are in close contact with the confirmed patients to identify the ""innocent viral spreaders,"" protect the medical staff, and stop further spread of the virus.","Rongqing, Zhao; Li, Maohua; Song, Hao; Chen, Jianxin; Ren, Wenlin; Feng, Yingmei; Gao, George F; Song, Jinwen; Peng, Ya; Su, Bin; Guo, Xianghua; Wang, Yanjun; Chen, Jingong; Li, Jianli; Sun, Hunter; Bai, Zhonghu; Cao, Wenjing; Zhu, Jin; Zhang, Qinlu; Sun, Yufei; Sun, Sean; Mao, Xinkun; Su, Junchi; Chen, Xiang; He, Ailiang; Gao, Wen; Jin, Ronghua; Jiang, Yongzhong; Sun, Le",Clin Infect Dis,,496

This research aimed to develop our understanding of healthcare professionals knowledge, decision making and routine practice of physical activity promotion with older adults. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with practicing healthcare professionals in general practice, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and nursing in Ireland and Northern Ireland. We received 347 eligible responses, with 70.3% of all respondents agreeing that discussing physical activity is their job and 30.0% agreeing that they have received suitable training to initiate conversations with patients about physical activity. Awareness of the content and objectives of national guidelines for physical activity varied considerably across the health professions surveyed. Less than a third of respondents had a clear plan on how to initiate discussions about physical activity in routine practice with older adults. Assessment of physical activity was not routine, neither was signposting to physical activity supports. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications, 81.6% of all respondents agreed that healthcare professionals can play an increased role in promoting physical activity to older adults as part of routine practice. Appropriate education, training and access to resources are essential for supporting healthcare professionals promotion of physical activity in routine practice. Effective physical activity promotion in healthcare settings has the potential for health benefits at a population level, particularly in older adult populations.","Cunningham, Conor; O039,; Sullivan, Roger",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,496

248159,The dark side of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen testing: screening asymptomatic patients,2021,"AIM: Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has become pandemic. It brings serious threat to hemodialysis (HD) patients. Therefore, we carried out a study on the clinical characteristics of HD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 31 HD patients with COVID-19. The clinical features of patients include epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging test, treatment and prognosis. RESULTS: 61.3% were severe, and 38.7% were mild. 83.9% had a close contact history with COVID-19 patients. The average age was 62.3 years comprising of 58.1% men and 41.9% women. Ninety percent had chronic diseases except ESRD. Clinical symptoms include cough (85%), fever (43%), and shortness of breath (48.4%), etc. Complications included ARDS (25.8%), AHF (22.6%), and septic shock (16.1%), etc. 64.5% of patients had remission, and 35.5% of patients had no remission with 6.5% deaths. Compared with the baseline before infection, HD patients with COVID-19 had lower lymphocytes, albumin and glucose, and higher D-dimer, albumin, phosphorus, lactate dehydrogenase, and CRP. There was no significant correlation between the neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio and the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the reported general population, the HD patients are susceptible to COVID-19 infection, especially older men and those with other underlying diseases. Moreover, HD patients have more severe infection and inflammation with less symptoms and worse outcome. COVID-19 infection can cause dialysis patients lower immunity, stronger inflammation, malnutrition, and internal environment disorder. Neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio does not reflect the severity of the HD patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Jiong; Cao, Fang; Wu, Shu-Kun; Xiang-Heng, Lu; Li, Wei; Li, Gui-Sen; Wang, Jia",Ren Fail,,496
249236,ARDS during the COVID-19 pandemic: not only SARS-CoV-2,2021,"BACKGROUND: At the beginning of the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), little was known about its actual rate of infectivity and any COVID-19 patient positive in laboratory testing was supposed to be highly infective and a public health risk factor. METHODS: One hundred oropharyngeal samples were obtained during routine work flow of testing symptomatic persons by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and were inoculated onto cell culture of VeroB4 cells to study the degree of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Quantification by virus titration and an external standard using synthetic RNA gave the breaking point of infectivity in SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. RESULTS: A clear negative correlation (r = - 0.76; p < 0.05) could be asserted between the viral load in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the probability of a successful isolation in serial isolation experiments of specific oropharyngeal samples positive in qPCR. Quantification by virus titration and an external standard using synthetic RNA indicate a Cq between 27 and 30 in E-gene screening PCR as a breaking point in vitro, where infectivity decreases significantly and isolations become less probable. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that only the 21% of samples with the highest viral load were infectious enough to transmit the virus in vitro and determined that the dispersion rate in vitro is surprisingly close to those calculated in large retrospective epidemiological studies for SARS-CoV-2. This raises the question of whether this simple in vitro model is suitable to give first insights in dispersion characters of novel or neglected viral pathogens. The statement that SARS-CoV-2 needs at least 40,000 copies to reliably induce infection in vitro is an indication of its transmissibility in Public Health decisions. Applying quantitative PCR systems in diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 can distinguish between patients providing a high risk of transmission and those, where the risk of transmission is probably limited to close and long-lasting contacts.","Sonnleitner, Sissy Therese; Dorighi, Julian; Jansen, Bianca; Schönegger, Carmen; Gietl, Sarah; Koblmüller, Stephan; Sturmbauer, Christian; Posch, Wilfried; Walder, Gernot",Virol J,,496

250266,This Month in AJP,2020,"The human immune response is a complex process that responds to numerous exogenous antigens in preventing infection by microorganisms, as well as to endogenous components in the surveillance of tumors and autoimmune diseases, and a great number of molecules are necessary to carry the functional complexity of immune activity. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA plays an important role in immune cell development and regulation of immune activity through yielding diverse transcriptional isoforms to supplement the function of limited genes associated with the immune reaction. In addition, multiple factors have been identified as being involved in the control of alternative splicing at the cis, trans, or co-transcriptional level, and the aberrant splicing of RNA leads to the abnormal modulation of immune activity in infections, immune diseases, and tumors. In this review, we summarize the recent discoveries on the generation of immune-associated alternative splice variants, clinical disorders, and possible regulatory mechanisms. We also discuss the immune responses to the neoantigens produced by alternative splicing, and finally, we issue some alternative splicing and immunity correlated questions based on our knowledge.","Su, Zhongjing; Huang, Dongyang",,,496

Another pressing issue is the unavailability of labeled unstructured text for experimentation. In this paper, we propose LESA, a framework which aims at advancing headfirst into expunging the former issue by assembling a source-independent generalized model that captures syntactic features through part-of-speech and dependency embeddings, as well as contextual features through a fine-tuned language model. We resolve the latter issue by annotating a Twitter dataset which aims at providing a testing ground on a large unstructured dataset. Experimental results show that LESA improves upon the state-of-the-art performance across six benchmark claim datasets by an average of 3 claim-F1 points for in-domain experiments and by 2 claim-F1 points for general-domain experiments. On our dataset too, LESA outperforms existing baselines by 1 claim-F1 point on the in-domain experiments and 2 claim-F1 points on the general-domain experiments.

Sixty patients (median age IQR, 65 (52-69), 43 males), hospitalized for COVID-19 at Siena COVID Unit University Hospital, were prospectively enrolled. Twenty-six patients were selected (median age IQR, 63 (55-71), 16 males); all of them underwent follow-up evaluations, including clinical, radiological, functional, and serum KL-6 assessments, after 6 (t1) and 9 (t2) months from hospital discharge. At t0, KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher than those at t1 (760 (311-1218) vs. 309 (210-408) p = 0.0208) and t2 (760 (311-1218) vs 324 (279-458), p = 0.0365). At t0, KL-6 concentrations were increased in patients with fibrotic lung alterations than in non-fibrotic group (755 (370-1023) vs. 305 (225-608), p = 0.0225). Area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) analysis showed that basal KL-6 levels showed good accuracy in discriminating patients with fibrotic sequelae radiologically documented (AUC 85%, p = 0.0404).

It was hypothesized that the training, which encourages adaptive self-reflection on stressor events and the effectiveness of coping strategies and resources, would exert a positive effect on mental health outcomes via increased reflection and decreased brooding. The trial was conducted during a significant stressor period with a final sample of 204 second-class Officer Cadets from the Royal Military College, Australia. Platoons of Cadets were randomly allocated to either Self-Reflection Resilience Training (SRT; n = 96) or an exposure-matched active control group that received training as usual (i.e., cognitive-behavioral skill development training) and communication skills seminars (n = 108). Compared to the active control group, SRT was more effective at preventing the onset of depression symptoms and promoting stable levels of perceived stress during a period of increased exposure to training stressors, consistent with a resilient trajectory. The Self-Reflection group unexpectedly demonstrated higher anxiety symptoms than the Control group at immediate follow-up, but these symptoms returned to baseline levels at longer term follow-up. In contrast, the Control group experienced increasing anxiety symptoms between immediate and longer term follow-up. Mediation analyses supported an indirect effect of SRT on all three outcome measures via brooding, but not via reflection. This study provides support for the capacity of a practical, sustainable, and scalable intervention based on self-reflection to strengthen resilience in the military training setting.

348278,Improving Anti-Icing and De-Icing Performances via Thermal-Regulation with Macroporous Xerogel,2021,"BACKGROUND: As of 13 July 2020, 12.9 million COVID-19 cases have been reported worldwide. Prior studies have demonstrated that local socioeconomic and built environment characteristics may significantly contribute to viral transmission and incidence rates, thereby accounting for some of the spatial variation observed. Due to uncertainties, non-linearities, and multiple interaction effects observed in the associations between COVID-19 incidence and socioeconomic, infrastructural, and built environment characteristics, we present a structured multimethod approach for analysing cross-sectional incidence data within in an Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) framework at the NUTS3 (county) scale. METHODS: By sequentially conducting a geospatial analysis, an heuristic geographical interpretation, a Bayesian machine learning analysis, and parameterising a Generalised Additive Model (GAM), we assessed associations between incidence rates and 368 independent variables describing geographical patterns, socioeconomic risk factors, infrastructure, and features of the build environment. A spatial trend analysis and Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation were used to characterise the geography of age-adjusted COVID-19 incidence rates across Germany, followed by iterative modelling using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to identify and measure candidate explanatory variables. Partial dependence plots were derived to quantify and contextualise BART model results, followed by the parameterisation of a GAM to assess correlations. RESULTS: A strong south-to-north gradient of COVID-19 incidence was identified, facilitating an empirical classification of the study area into two epidemic subregions. All preliminary and final models indicated that location, densities of the built environment, and socioeconomic variables were important predictors of incidence rates in Germany. The top ten predictor variables' partial dependence exhibited multiple non-linearities in the relationships between key predictor variables and COVID-19 incidence rates. The BART, partial dependence, and GAM results indicate that the strongest predictors of COVID-19 incidence at the county scale were related to community interconnectedness, geographical location, transportation infrastructure, and labour market structure. CONCLUSIONS: The multimethod ESDA approach provided unique insights into spatial and aspatial non-stationarities of COVID-19 incidence in Germany. BART and GAM modelling indicated that geographical configuration, built environment densities, socioeconomic characteristics, and infrastructure all exhibit associations with COVID-19 incidence in Germany when assessed at the county scale. The results suggest that measures to implement social distancing and reduce unnecessary travel may be important methods for reducing contagion, and the authors call for further research to investigate the observed associations to inform prevention and control policy.","Scarpone, Christopher; Brinkmann, Sebastian T; Große, Tim; Sonnenwald, Daniel; Fuchs, Martin; Walker, Blake Byron",Int J Health Geogr,,496

We also assessed the effect of secretory placenta products on NK cell cytotoxic activity toward JEG-3 line cells. RESULTS: Uteroplacental contact zone cytokines are able to enhance trophoblast mortality both by themselves in case of IL-1ß, IL-6, IFNÎ³, IL-4, TGFß, bFGF, and also through increasing the cytotoxic potential of NK cells in case of IL-1ß, IFNÎ³, IL-8, TGFß, and GM-CSF. PLGF decreases NK cell cytotoxicity for trophoblasts. Secretory products of first trimester placenta enhance NK cell cytotoxic potential for trophoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokines of the uteroplacental contact zone can appear a mechanism ensuring trophoblast mortality dynamics throughout pregnancy.","Bazhenov, Dmitriy; Mikhailova, Valentina; Nikolaenkov, Igor; Markova, Kseniya; Salloum, Zeina; Kogan, Igor; Gzgzyan, Aleksandr; Selkov, Sergey; Sokolov, Dmitriy",Gynecol Endocrinol,,496

Bge.var.mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao, has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the underlying mechanisms in treating chronic glomerular nephritis (CGN) have not been fully understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential mechanism of AS-IV on CGN. CGN rats were administrated with AS-IV at 10 mg·kg-1 ·d-1 (ASL) and 20 mg·kg-1 ·d-1 (ASH). Twenty four hour proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr) were detected. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were performed to evaluate the kidney lesion. Transmission electron microscope and GFP-RFP-LC3 transfection assay were used to monitor the effect of AS-IV on autophagy. IL-6 and IL-1ß were detected. The expression of CyclinD1, PI3K/AKT/AS160 pathway and autophagy related proteins were detected by Western Blot. The results demonstrated that AS-IV improved kidney function, ameliorated kidney lesion, and diminished inflammatory in CGN rats. Further, both in vivo and vitro study demonstrated that AS-IV inhibited the proliferation of mesangial cells. AS-IV further displayed a remarkable effect on inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT/AS160 pathway and improved the activation of autophagy in vivo and vitro. These results suggested that AS-IV is a potential therapeutic agent for CGN and merits further investigation.","Lu, Ruirui; Chen, Junqi; Liu, Bihao; Lin, Hua; Bai, Lixia; Zhang, Peichun; Chen, Dandan; Li, Honglian; Li, Jicheng; Pang, Yu; Zhou, Yuan; Zhou, Jiuyao; Wu, Junbiao",Phytother. res,,496

ACE-II has been implicated in the regulation of heart function and also as a functional receptor for the coronavirus that causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this study, the potential of some flavonoids presents in propolis to bind to ACE-II receptors was calculated with in silico. Binding constants of ten flavonoids, caffeic acid, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, chrysin, galangin, myricetin, rutin, hesperetin, pinocembrin, luteolin and quercetin were measured using the AutoDock 4.2 molecular docking program. And also, these binding constants were compared to reference ligand of MLN-4760. The results are shown that rutin has the best inhibition potentials among the studied molecules with high binding energy - 8.04 kcal/mol, and it is followed by myricetin, quercetin, caffeic acid phenethyl ester and hesperetin. However, the reference molecule has binding energy of - 7.24 kcal/mol. In conclusion, the high potential of flavonoids in ethanolic propolis extracts to bind to ACE-II receptors indicates that this natural bee product has high potential for COVID-19 treatment, but this needs to be supported by experimental studies.","Guler, Halil Ibrahim; Tatar, Gizem; Yildiz, Oktay; Belduz, Ali Osman; Kolayli, Sevgi",Arch. microbiol,,496

Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of human VIP1R bound to PACAP27 and Gs heterotrimer, whose complex assembly is stabilized by a NanoBiT tethering strategy. Comparison with other class B GPCR structures reveals that PACAP27 engages VIP1R with its N-terminus inserting into the ligand binding pocket at the transmembrane bundle of the receptor, which subsequently couples to the G protein in a receptor-specific manner. This structure has provided insights into the molecular basis of PACAP27 binding and VIP receptor activation.

Particularly, COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected financial econometrics and stock markets across the globe. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models, especially Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures, have the potential to act as a key enabling factor to reduce the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and future possible ones on financial markets. In this regard, first, a unique COVID-19 related PRIce MOvement prediction (COVID19 PRIMO) dataset is introduced in this paper, which incorporates effects of social media trends related to COVID-19 on stock market price movements. Afterwards, a novel hybrid and parallel DNN-based framework is proposed that integrates different and diversified learning architectures.

The proposed COVID19-HPSMP consists of two parallel paths (hence hybrid), one based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Local/Global Attention modules, and one integrated CNN and Bi-directional Long Short term Memory (BLSTM) path. The two parallel paths are followed by a multilayer fusion layer acting as a fusion centre that combines localized features. Performance evaluations are performed based on the introduced COVID19 PRIMO dataset illustrating superior performance of the proposed framework.","Ronaghi, Farnoush; Salimibeni, Mohammad; Naderkhani, Farnoosh; Mohammadi, Arash",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02287v2.pdf,496

449300,Significance of variables affecting profitability of airline,2020,"INTRODUCTION: In recent history, many new infectious diseases have affected humans for the first time or have appeared in previously unaffected areas of the world; these diseases are known as emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Examples of EIDs include COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease. EIDs are known for their complexity. Multiple factors play a role in their spread, including increases in human population, conflicts, urbanisation, air travel, global trade and inequalities in wealth distribution and access to healthcare. In order to gain a better understanding of such complexity, we aim to explore the role of systems science, which allows us to view EIDs in the context of complex adaptive systems rather than simple causes and effects. The objectives of this scoping review are to explore and map the theoretical concepts and key characteristics of studies that use systems methods in controlling EIDs, to identify the gaps in knowledge and disseminate the results. METHODS: We will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance for this scoping review, comprising the following stages: formulating the research question and subquestions, scanning the literature for available data, selecting relevant publications, charting the data by two independent reviewers, aggregating the findings, reporting, summarising and disseminating the results. We will review peer-reviewed articles, preprints and grey literature available in all languages. DISCUSSION: We intend that this scoping review will contribute to a better understanding of the use of systems methods to inform policymakers about how to prevent and control EIDs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Research ethics approval is not required for a scoping review because it is based on reviewing and collecting data from publicly available sources. To disseminate the findings, results will be shared through academic publications, seminars and conferences.","Mansouri, Mariam Abdulmonem; Kee, Frank; Garcia, Leandro; Bradley, Declan T",BMJ Open,,496

The purpose of this article is to analyze the effect of public health interventions on respiratory tract infection-related visits to pediatric emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. Method: Pediatric emergency department visits between January 1 2020 and April 30 2020 were included for trend analysis and compared to the same period during the past 3 years. The datasets were retrieved from Taiwan National Infectious Disease Statistics System and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Respiratory tract infections with other diagnoses categories, including fever, asthma, and urinary tract infections, were included for subgroup analysis. Result: A significant decrease of more than 50% in respiratory tract infection-related visits was found from February to April 2020 in the national database. With regard to diagnosis category, the proportion of respiratory tract infections in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Hospital also became significantly lower in 2020 during the months of March (43.4 vs. 37.4%, p = 0.024) and April (40.1 vs. 32.2%, p < 0.001). On the other hand, the proportion of urinary tract infections was significantly higher in 2020 during March (3.7 vs. 5.2%, p = 0.033) and April (3.9 vs. 6.5%, p < 0.001), and that of asthma was also higher in April (1.6 vs. 2.6%, p = 0.025). Furthermore, the intensive care unit admission rate was relatively higher in 2020 from February, with significant differences noted in March (1.3 vs. 2.8%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Due to public health interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic, the transmission of not only COVID-19 but also other air droplet transmitted diseases in children may have been effectively prevented.","Lin, Chien-Fu; Huang, Ying-Hsien; Cheng, Chi-Yung; Wu, Kuan-Han; Tang, Kuo-Shu; Chiu, I-Min",Front Public Health,,496

Few biomarkers have been identified but, unfortunately, these are individually poorly specific, and novel biomarkers are needed to better predict patient outcome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of circulating platelets (PLT)-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as biomarkers for Sars-Cov-2 infection, by setting a rapid and reliable test on unmanipulated blood samples. PLT-EVs were quantified by flow cytometry on two independent cohorts of Sars-CoV-2+ (n = 69), Sars-Cov-2- (n = 62) hospitalized patients, and healthy controls. Diagnostic performance of PLT-EVs was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. PLT-EVs count were higher in Sars-Cov-2+ compared to Sars-Cov-2- patients or HC. ROC analysis of the combined cohorts showed an AUC = 0.79 and an optimal cut-off value of 1472 EVs/µL, with 75% sensitivity and 74% specificity. These data suggest that PLT-EVs might be an interesting biomarker deserving further investigations to test their predictive power.","Cappellano, Giuseppe; Raineri, Davide; Rolla, Roberta; Giordano, Mara; Puricelli, Chiara; Vilardo, Beatrice; Manfredi, Marcello; Cantaluppi, Vincenzo; Sainaghi, Pier Paolo; Castello, Luigi; De Vita, Nello; Scotti, Lorenza; Vaschetto, Rosanna; Dianzani, Umberto; Chiocchetti, Annalisa",,,496

The objective of this study was to examine the correlation of SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate per capita and COVID-19-associated deaths with number of dialysis stations and demographics of residents within zip codes in Cook County, IL. Study Design: Ecological analysis. Setting & Participants: Data for SARS-CoV-2 test results and COVID-19-associated deaths during January 21 to June 15, 2020, among the 5,232,412 residents living within the 163 zip codes in Cook County, IL, were merged with demographic and income data from the US Census Bureau. The total number of positive test results in this population was 84,353 and total number of deaths was 4,007. Assessments: Number of dialysis stations and stations per capita within a zip code were calculated. SARS-CoV-2-positive test results per capita were calculated as number of positive test results divided by the zip code population. COVID-19-associated deaths per capita were calculated as COVID-19 deaths among residents for a given zip code divided by the zip code population. Analytic Approach: Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to examine the correlation of SARS-CoV-2-positive tests per capita and COVID-19-associated deaths per capita with dialysis stations, demographics, and household poverty. To account for multiple testing, statistical significance was considered as P < 0.005. Results: Among the 163 Cook County zip codes, there were 2,501 dialysis stations. Positive test results per capita were significantly associated with number of dialysis stations (r = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.29; P < 0.005) but not with dialysis stations per capita (r = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.08; P = 0.7). Positive test results per capita also correlated significantly with number of households living in poverty (r = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.53-0.6; P < 0.005) and percentage of residents reporting Black race (r = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.23-0.33; P < 0.005) and Hispanic ethnicity (r = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.65-0.7; P < 0.001;). COVID-19-associated deaths per capita correlated significantly with the percentage of residents reporting Black race (r = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.19-0.29; P < 0.005) and with percentage of households living in poverty (r = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.29-0.38; P < 0.005). The association between the number of COVID-19-associated deaths per capita and total number of dialysis stations (r = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.14-0.25; P = 0.01) did not achieve a priori significance, whereas the association with dialysis stations per capita (r = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07-0.17; P = 0.01) was not significant. Limitations: Analysis is at the zip code level and not at the person level. Conclusions: The number of dialysis stations within a zip code correlates with the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate per capita in Cook County, IL, and this correlation may be driven by population density and the demographics of the residents. These findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure for patients with end-stage kidney disease living in poor urban areas.","Bhayani, Siddharth; Sengupta, Ranit; Markossian, Talar; Tootooni, Samie; Luke, Amy; Shoham, David; Cooper, Richard; Kramer, Holly",,,496

This model and simulation tool dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of the tests in a large population at a low cost, particularly when the infection rate is low. The proposed method combines statistical modeling with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch sizes at each step of tests, with the flexibility to incorporate geographic and demographic information. In theory, this method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method significantly reduces the false negative rate. More accurate assessment can be made if the dilution effect or other practical factors are taken into consideration. The proposed method will be particularly useful for the early detection of infectious diseases and prevention of future pandemics. The proposed work will have broader impacts on medical testing for contagious diseases in general.","Ahn, Hongshik; Jiang, Haoran; Li, Xiaolin",Biom. j,,496
499953,Significant demands on healthcare resources during the COVID crisis,2020,"BACKGROUND: We projected the clinical and economic impact of alternative testing strategies on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in Massachusetts using a microsimulation model. METHODS: We compared four testing strategies: 1) Hospitalized: PCR testing only patients with severe/critical symptoms warranting hospitalization; 2) Symptomatic: PCR for any COVID-19-consistent symptoms, with self-isolation if positive; 3) Symptomatic+asymptomatic-once: Symptomatic and one-time PCR for the entire population; and, 4) Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly: Symptomatic with monthly re-testing for the entire population. We examined effective reproduction numbers (Re, 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We assumed homogeneous mixing among the Massachusetts population (excluding those residing in long-term care facilities). We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity/specificity (70/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). RESULTS: At Re 0.9, Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly vs. Hospitalized resulted in a 64% reduction in infections and a 46% reduction in deaths, but required >66-fold more tests/day with 5-fold higher costs. Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly had an ICER <$100,000/QALY only when Re &#8805;1.6; when test cost was &#8804;$3, every 14-day testing was cost-effective at all Re examined. CONCLUSIONS: Testing people with any COVID-19-consistent symptoms would be cost-saving compared to testing only those whose symptoms warrant hospital care. Expanding PCR testing to asymptomatic people would decrease infections, deaths, and hospitalizations. Despite modest sensitivity, low-cost, repeat screening of the entire population could be cost-effective in all epidemic settings.","Neilan, Anne M; Losina, Elena; Bangs, Audrey C; Flanagan, Clare; Panella, Christopher; Eskibozkurt, G Ege; Mohareb, Amir; Hyle, Emily P; Scott, Justine A; Weinstein, Milton C; Siedner, Mark J; Reddy, Krishna P; Harling, Guy; Freedberg, Kenneth A; Shebl, Fatma M; Kazemian, Pooyan; Ciaranello, Andrea L",Clin. infect. dis,,496

The data for confirmed cases of COVID-19 were collected for March 25 and June 30, 2020 (14 weeks) from South Africa's Government COVID-19 online resource, while the daily provincial climate temperatures were collected from the website of the South African Weather Service. Our result indicates that a higher or lower climate temperature does not prevent or delay the spread and death rates but shows significant positive impacts on the recovery rates of COVID-19 patients. Thus, it indicates that the climate temperature is unlikely to impose a strict limit on the spread of COVID-19. There is no correlation between the cases and death rates, an indicator that no particular temperature range is closely associated with a faster or slower death rate of COVID-19 patients. As evidence from our study, a warm climate temperature can only increase the recovery rate of COVID-19 patients, ultimately impacting the death and active case rates and freeing up resources quicker to enable health facilities to deal with the climbing rates of those patients who need treatment.","Ilori, A.

Motivated by this, we design a parsimonious game-theoretic behavioral--epidemic model, in which an interplay of realistic factors shapes the co-evolution of individual decision-making and epidemics on a network. Although such a co-evolution is deeply intertwined in the real-world, existing models schematize population behavior as instantaneously reactive, thus being unable to capture human behavior in the long term. Our model offers a unified framework to model and predict complex emergent phenomena, including successful collective responses, periodic oscillations, and resurgent epidemic outbreaks. The framework also allows to assess the effectiveness of different policy interventions on ensuring a collective response that successfully eradicates the outbreak.

We describe a case of a young man with a known history of the MS phenotype who presented with chest pain and was found to have pulmonary emboli and bullae. His past medical history was relevant for a gastric ulcer and elevated liver enzymes. Due to this young man’s age and lack of risk factors for the aforementioned diseases, we propose that these findings were manifestations of his MS phenotype.

To accurately model the distribution of Hounsfield scale values within both chest and lung regions, a new probabilistic model is developed that depends on a linear combination of Gaussian (LCG). Moreover, we modified the conventional expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to be run in a sequential way to estimate both the dominant Gaussian components (one for the lung region and one for the chest region) and the subdominant Gaussian components, which are used to refine the final estimated joint density. To estimate the marginal density from the mixed density, a modified k-means clustering approach is employed to classify the Gaussian subdominant components to determine which components belong properly to a lung and which components belong to a chest. The initial segmentation, based on the LCG-model, is then refined by the imposition of 3D morphological constraints based on a 3D Markov–Gibbs random field (MGRF) with analytically estimated potentials. The proposed approach was tested on CT data from 32 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

Around 40% of the population perceive that strengthening the immune defenses through nutrition is not important to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease infection. People with lower levels of perceived importance are slightly younger and have a less healthy lifestyle. They are less worried about the emergency. During the last months they have bought less food supplements and also intend to decrease their purchase in the next six months. Conclusion In COVID-19 pandemic, scholars underline the importance of having a strong immune system. However, the Italians who attribute less importance to food that helps the immune system seem to differ negatively in their psychological attitude towards the emergency and food consumption. Today, Italians are asked to engage in preventive food practices to protect against possible chronic diseases; exploring their perceptions is important to orient them toward this change.","Savarese, Mariarosaria; Castellini, Greta; Morelli, Lorenzo; Graffigna, Guendalina",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S093947532030452X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33358715/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S093947532030452X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.10.013,496

This outcome suggests that air circulation due to the ceiling fan was sufficient and that any additional increase would not improve efficacy. Numerous experimental studies on upper-room UVGI in which fans were used to provide air mixing have been published. However, none have quantified the air movement produced by these fans or described their tests in sufficient detail to allow results to be compared to predictions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

In the differential diagnosis, measuring the PCT level helps differentiate between bacterial and viral infections. Noninfectious inflammatory reactions can, however, show moderately increased PCT levels. Cut-off values depend on renal and hepatic function.

METHODS AND RESULTS: SoC preprocedural assessments as well as CT-based 3D computational simulations (FEops) were performed in 15 consecutive patients scheduled for LAAO with Amulet. Preprocedural device size selection and degree of confidence were determined after SoC and after FEops-based assessments and compared to the implanted device. FEops-based preprocedural assessment correctly selected the implanted device size in 11 out of 15 patients (73.3%), compared to 7 patients (46.7%) for SoC-based assessment. In 4 patients (26.7%), FEops induced a change in device size initially selected by SoC. In the 7 patients (46.7%) in which FEops confirmed the SoC device size selection, the degree of confidence of the size selection increased from 6.4 ± 1.4 for SoC to 8.1 ± 0.7 for FEops. One patient (6.7%) could not be implanted for anatomical reason, as correctly identified by FEops. CONCLUSIONS: Preprocedural 3D computational simulation by FEops impacts Amulet size selection in LAAO compared to TOE and CT-based SoC assessment. Operators could consider FEops computational simulation in their preprocedural device size selection.","Buysschaert, Ian; Viaene, Dries",J Interv Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385893/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9972228,496

This study introduces a novel method to estimate the reproductive number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors. By inferring the infection dates from incidence time series, the developed approach allows direct comparison between reproductive number and introduction of public health measures in a specific country. First a specific period between the onset of the symptoms and a case being declared as dead is derived on data available in Switzerland. Focussing on the measures taken by 31 European countries, this study shows that most countries required tough state interventions with a stringency index equal to 83.6 out of 100 to reduce the reproductive number below one and hence control the development of the epidemy. In addition, it is shown that there is a direct correlation between the time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the epidemy with a median time of 8 days between the introduction of initial restrictive measures and the reproductive rate reducing below one.","Turbe, H.; Bjelogrlic, M.; Robert, A.; Gaudet-Blavignac, C.; Lovis, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.10.20126870v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.20126870,496

Since its emergence in December 2019, research has been focused on ways to not only treat the infected but also identify those at risk and prevent spread. There is currently no known biological biomarker that can predict the risk of being infected. A growing set of studies have emerged that show an association between ABO blood group and the risk of COVID-19 infection. In this study, we used retrospective observational data in Bahrain to investigate the association between ABO blood group and risk of infection as well as susceptibility to a more severe ICU-requiring infection. We found that individuals with blood group B were at a higher risk of infection, while those with blood group AB were at a lower risk. No association was observed between blood group and the risk of a severe ICU-requiring COVID-19 infection. We extended the analysis to study the association by antibodies present; anti-a (blood groups B and O) and anti-b (blood groups A and O). Antibodies were not found to be associated with either risk of infection or susceptibility to severe infection. The current study, along with the variation in blood group association results, indicates that blood group may not be the most ideal biomarker to predict risk of COVID-19 infection.","AlMadhi, M.; Abdulrahman, A.; AlAwadhi, A.; Rabaan, A.; AlQahtani, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.22.20199422; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.22.20199422v1?rss=1,496

V. (AGAH),2021-03-01,"Abstract Objective The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has been basically controlled. However, the global epidemic of COVID-19 is worsening. We established a method to estimate instant case fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in China. Methods We collected 82735 confirmed cases released officially by Chinese authorities from Dec 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on median cure time or median death time of individual cases. Afterward, instant fatality rate was calculated according to the number of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis date. Results In China, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.8-14.6% from Jan 1 to Jan 17, and then gradually declined and stabilized at 5.7% in April. The average case fatality rate in China was 6.1%±2.9%. While, the case fatality rate was 1.0±0.4% in China except Hubei. The cure rates of COVID-19 were 93.9%±2.9% in China, and stabilized at 94.3%, while it was 99.0%±0.4% in China except Hubei. Conclusion The instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China was much higher than that in China except Hubei. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 in China was underestimated.","Mi, Yan-ni; Huang, Ting-ting; Zhang, Jun-xia; Qin, Qi; Gong, Ya-xin; Liu, Si-yu; Xue, Hui-min; Ning, Chang-hua; Cao, Lei; Cao, Yong-xiao",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030271X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339723/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122030271X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.055,496
664491,Air circulation in a gastrointestinal light source box and endoscope in the era of SARS-CoV-2 and airborne transmission of microorganisms,2021-02-22,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused more than 80 813 confirmed cases in all provinces of China, and 21 110 cases reported in 93 countries of six continents as of 7 March 2020 since middle December 2019. Due to biological nature of the novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with faster spreading and unknown transmission pattern, it makes us in a difficulty position to contain the disease transmission globally. To date, we have found it is one of the greatest challenges to human beings in fighting against COVID-19 in the history, because SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in terms of biological features and transmissibility, and also found the containment strategies including the non-pharmaceutical public health measures implemented in China are effective and successful. In order to prevent a potential pandemic-level outbreak of COVID-19, we, as a community of shared future for mankind, recommend for all international leaders to support preparedness in low and middle income countries especially, take strong global interventions by using old approaches or new tools, mobilize global resources to equip hospital facilities and supplies to protect noisome infections and to provide personal protective tools such as facemask to general population, and quickly initiate research projects on drug and vaccine development. We also recommend for the international community to develop better coordination, cooperation, and strong solidarity in the joint efforts of fighting against COVID-19 spreading recommended by the joint mission report of the WHO-China experts, against violating the International Health Regulation (WHO, 2005), and against stigmatization, in order to eventually win the battle against our common enemy — COVID-19.","Qian, Xu; Ren, Ran; Wang, Youfa; Guo, Yan; Fang, Jing; Wu, Zhong-Dao; Liu, Pei-Long; Han, Tie-Ru",Infect Dis Poverty,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00650-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32264957/,496
669001,The arrival and spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in Colombia,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, students and teachers have transitioned to online learning. The transition required changes in teaching practices to accommodate for an online learning environment. However, there are no studies characterizing physical educators' and school health experts' perspectives on physical education via distance learning or identifying best practices and their implications for student health. METHODS: Using purposive and snowball sampling, we conducted semi‐structured interviews with 19 physical education teachers and school health experts across 21 California school districts on best practices for physical education via distance learning. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged: (1) participants felt high quality physical education via distance learning was both critical and possible; (2) strategies for creating a successful distance learning environment included personalization, creativity, and inclusiveness; (3) resources necessary for success included professional development, administrative support, and equipment; and (4) lessons for the long‐term. CONCLUSIONS: Participants identified effective strategies, challenges, and recommendations for the future. Participants felt optimistic about their ability to provide quality physical education via distance learning, given the necessary supports, and perceived that they played a critical role in supporting student health during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Vilchez, Jocelyn A.; Kruse, John; Puffer, Maryjane; Dudovitz, Rebecca N.",J Sch Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031879/; https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.13030,496

Patients on maintenance dialysis are exceptionally vulnerable because most of them are old and have multiple comorbidities. We report the complex clinical course of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in a patient on maintenance dialysis who presented with fever and lung edema. After 41 days from the primary infection, the clinically recovered patient experienced symptomatic reactivation of SARS‐COV‐2 infection documented by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result on nasal/oropharyngeal swab with immunoglobulin M seroconversion. The recurrence of PCR positivity forced us to perform hemodialysis in a separate isolation room for a prolonged period of time. Close monitoring of previously infected patients and restructuring of dialysis facilities are necessary to avoid new outbreaks of this concerning disease.","Alfano, Gaetano; Perrone, Rossella; Fontana, Francesco; Mori, Giacomo; Lucchi, Leonardo; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Magistroni, Riccardo; Cappelli, Gianni",Hemodial Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743901/; https://doi.org/10.1111/hdi.12859,496

METHODS: A dynamic transmission model that extended the susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered framework by incorporating asymptomatic, presymptomatic and waiting‐to‐be‐diagnosed patients was constructed to conduct the cost‐effectiveness analysis from the healthcare system perspective. To estimate epidemic parameters, the model was first calibrated to the observed epidemic curve in Wuhan from 23 January to 19 March 2020. Following the calibration, the infected compartment was replaced by 3 severity‐defined health states to reflect differential costs and quality of life associated with disease gravity. Costs and quality‐adjusted life year (QALY) outcomes of 9 million simulated people were accrued across time to evaluate the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio of remdesivir. As robustness checks, an alternative modelling technique using decision tree, additional epidemic scenarios representing different epidemic intensities, and 1‐way parameter variations were also analysed. RESULTS: Remdesivir treatment cost CN¥97.93 million more than standard of care. Also, the net QALY gain from 5‐day remdesivir treatment was 6947 QALYs. As such, the incremental cost‐effectiveness ratio was CN¥14 098/QALY, substantially lower than the gross domestic product per capita threshold. The peak daily number of severe cases was 19% lower in the remdesivir treatment strategy. Overall, results were robust in alternative scenarios and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Given the cost‐effectiveness profile, access to remdesivir for severe COVID‐19 patients in China should be considered.","Jiang, Yawen; Cai, Dan; Chen, Daqin; Jiang, Shan; Si, Lei; Wu, Jing",Br J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33855727/,496
