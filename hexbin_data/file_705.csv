While many residents meet this criterion through inpatient oncology rotations, the current structure of many inpatient oncology rotations leaves little opportunity for formal education. We therefore designed a novel oncology curriculum consisting of one-page oncology teaching sheets to increase the number, breadth, and quality of formal teaching sessions on our resident inpatient oncology services. In order to evaluate the curriculum, we conducted pre- and post-intervention surveys of residents. From these surveys, we found that 72.2% of residents used the teaching sheets on their inpatient oncology rotation and that the teaching sheets led to an increase in the number of formal oncology teaching sessions (mean 3.4 ± 2.1 post-implementation vs 2.6 ± 2.0 pre-implementation, p = 0.008), the breadth of oncology topics taught (% reporting ≥ 5 topics; 26.1% vs 16.3%, p = 0.035), the proportion of residents reporting improvement in overall oncology knowledge (80.2% vs 62.4%, p = 0.012), and the proportion of residents reporting improvement in their ability to care for patients (70.8% vs 48.9%, p = 0.013). These results demonstrate that formal oncology teaching can be improved on inpatient oncology rotations through a simple and easily replicable oncology curriculum.

And what causes my asthma suddenly to become worse?” These questions have always been difficult to answer, and moving directly to a discussion of the management of asthma is a much easier road to take. In recent years, though, enough information has accumulated about the causes of asthma that one can weave a story containing useful advice that may help patients participate in the management of their disease. And there are also recent studies that can provide answers to the questions posed by physicians who have watched in puzzlement as their previously well-controlled asthma patients have spiraled rapidly out of control. This story has been growing increasingly complex, with an ever-expanding cast of players that sometimes creates a tangled web of interactions.","Ryhal, Bruce",Bronchial Asthma,705,1

With the evidence of organ failure, it was called severe sepsis, and this could lead to hypotension (septic shock). However, with the deep understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis, sepsis has been known as both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory. Additionally, the classic use of SIRS could lead to overestimation of sepsis. For example, usual common cold could be identified as sepsis in classic definition. With this background, new sepsis definition, Sepsis 3, was introduced and sepsis was defined as a “life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.” The management of sepsis has been changed dramatically, with the development of Surviving Sepsis Campaign, which substantially increased the survival of sepsis. However, this is not with the help of a new drug, but the implementation of a treatment system. Unfortunately, no specific drug for sepsis has survived in clinical use even though many candidate drugs have been successfully investigated in preclinical setting, and this leads to the new approach to the sepsis.","Kim, Kyuseok; Choi, Han Sung; Chung, Sung Phil; Kwon, Woon Young",Essentials of Shock Management,705,13

By comparing with the Western urban discourse, we clarify the process of how Tokyo became divided in terms of residential conditions. The national government focused on the growth of major metropolitan areas, stimulating suburban development and homeownership in the suburbs from the 1950s to the 1980s. However, after the late 1990s, the target shifted from the suburbs to the city centers. Alongside global competition among cities, the long-term recession of the Japanese economy, and social changes, continuous investment to grow central Tokyo has increased in importance. In contrast, suburban neighborhoods are facing challenges related to an aging population and an increase in housing vacancies. Although government intervention is necessary, there are limited possibilities for the outer suburbs to revitalize and re-grow. The sharp contrast between the growth in city centers and the shrinking suburbs, and specifically the divided Tokyo, will become more obvious in the next decade.","Kubo, Tomoko",Divided Tokyo,705,1

Die Letalität ist mit 25–30% entsprechend hoch. Weiterhin werden zunehmend invasive diagnostische und therapeutische Maßnahmen auf Intensivstationen durchgeführt, sodass 25% aller nosokomialen Infektionen auf Intensivstation erworben werden (Widmer 1994; Trilla 1994). Diese sind überwiegend »deviceassoziiert«, wobei die patienteneigene, endogene Bakterienflora das wichtigste Erregerreservoir darstellt. Etwa 20–25% dieser Infektionen sind vermeidbar (Gastmeier et al. 2002), sodass die konsequente Einhaltung sinnvoller und soweit wie möglich evidenzbasierter, infektionspräventiver Maßnahmen auf einer Intensivstation besonders wichtig ist. Weiterhin kommt es insbesondere auf Intensivstationen häufig zur Übertragungen von Bakterien überwiegend durch die Hände des Stationspersonals oder durch inadäquat wiederaufbereitete Gegenstände, die beim Patienten angewendet werden. Die Bedeutung der unbelebten Umgebung wie z. B. Luft, Wasser oder der patientennahen oder -fernen Flächen bei der Übertragung wird in der Literatur sehr kontrovers diskutiert (Talon 1999). Dennoch sollte eine Intensivstation so konzipiert sein, dass das Risiko der Infektionsentstehung sowie der Übertragung von beispielsweise multiresistenten Erregern minimiert werden. Hierzu zählen ausreichende Möglichkeiten für eine hygienische Händedesinfektion, desinfizierbare Oberflächen sowie ausreichende räumliche Gestaltung der einzelnen Patientenzimmer.","Lemmen, S.",Praktische Krankenhaushygiene und Umweltschutz,705,1

FUENTES DE DATOS: Estudios en cualquier idioma y tipo de publicación recogidos en las siguientes bases de datos: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2009, número 2), Medline (1966 a mayo de 2009), OldMedline (1955 a 1965), Embase (1990 hasta la semana 18 de 2009) y CINAHL (1982 a mayo de 2009). Se seleccionaron estudios que evaluasen cualquier intervención física para prevenir la transmisión de virus respiratorios de animales a humanos o de humanos a humanos, comparándola frente a cualquier otra o frente a ninguna actuación (“no hacer nada”). SELECCIÓN DE ESTUDIOS Y EXTRACCIÓN DE DATOS: Ensayos clínicos, estudios observacionales de cohortes, de casos y controles, estudios transversales, estudios antes-después y estudios de series temporales, realizados en personas de cualquier edad y en los que constase información de control de posibles factores de confusión. Tras la lectura del título y del resumen se procedió a la lectura completa del estudio si este reunía los criterios de elegibilidad o si se disponía de información insuficiente para su exclusión del análisis. Se hizo una clasificación de la calidad atendiendo al riesgo de sesgos: estudios con alto, medio y bajo riesgo de sesgos. Las principales variables de resultados analizadas fueron el número de casos, la gravedad, los ingresos hospitalarios y la mortalidad por infecciones víricas. RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES: La estrategia de búsqueda generó 2.958 citas, de las que 168 fueron potencialmente relevantes y recuperadas, incluyéndose finalmente 58 estudios pertenecientes a 59 proyectos de investigación (4 ensayos clínicos aleatorios, 14 ensayos aleatorizados en clúster, 7 estudios de casos y controles, 21 de cohortes y 13 estudios antes-después). La calidad de los ensayos clínicos fue baja y la de los estudios observacionales, intermedia. El metaanálisis de los estudios de casos y controles sugiere que las medidas físicas son altamente efectivas en prevenir la propagación del síndrome agudo respiratorio severo (SARS). Por ejemplo, el lavado frecuente de manos (> 10 veces al día) obtiene una odds ratio (OR) de 0,45 (intervalo de confianza [IC] 95%: 0,36-0,57) y un número necesario de pacientes a tratar (NNT) de 4,9 (IC 95%: 3,65-5,52). El uso de mascarillas simples, una OR de 0,32 (IC 95%: 0,25-0,40) y un NNT de 6 (IC 95%: 4,54-8,03) y el empleo de mascarillas N95, una OR de 0,09 (IC 95%: 0,03-0,30) y NNT de 3 (IC 95%: 2,37-4,06). Utilizar guantes, una OR de 0,43 (IC 95%: 0,29-0,65) y NNT de 5 (IC 95%: 4,15-15,41) y el uso de batas, una OR de 0,23 (IC 95%: 0,14-0,37) y NNT de 5 (IC 95%: 3,37-7,12). El uso simultáneo de lavado de manos, mascarillas, guantes y bata obtiene una OR de 0,09 (IC 95%: 0,02-0,35) y NNT de 3 (IC 95%: 2,66-4,97). Las medidas combinadas también fueron efectivas para frenar la transmisión de la gripe entre los familiares. Se desconoce si suplementar el lavado de manos con virucidas y antisépticos disminuye la transmisión de las enfermedades respiratorias. CONCLUSIÓN: Las medidas higiénicas y las barreras físicas (especialmente el lavado de manos, el uso de mascarillas y el aislamiento de los casos) son estrategias efectivas para impedir la transmisión de las infecciones víricas.","Buitrago, Francisco",FMC,705,1

We observed that standard machine learning methods alone performed somewhat poorly on the disease phenotype prediction task; therefore we devised an approach augmenting machine learning with topological data analysis. We describe a framework for predicting phenotype values by utilizing gene expression data transformed into sample-specific topological signatures by employing feature subsampling and persistent homology. The topological data analysis approach developed in this work yielded improved results on Parkinson’s disease phenotype prediction when measured against standard machine learning methods. This study confirms that gene expression can be a useful indicator of the presence or absence of a condition, and the subtle signal contained in this high dimensional data reveals itself when considering the intricate topological connections between expressed genes.","Mandal, Sayan; Guzmán-Sáenz, Aldo; Haiminen, Niina; Basu, Saugata; Parida, Laxmi",Algorithms for Computational Biology,705,13

We propose PathOGiST, an algorithmic framework for clustering bacterial isolates by leveraging multiple genotypic signals and calibrated thresholds. PathOGiST uses different genotypic signals, clusters the isolates based on these individual signals with correlation clustering, and combines the clusterings based on the individual signals through consensus clustering. We implemented and tested PathOGiST on three different bacterial pathogens - Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis - and we conclude by discussing further avenues to explore.","Katebi, Mohsen; Feijao, Pedro; Booth, Julius; Mansouri, Mehrdad; La, Sean; Sweeten, Alex; Miraskarshahi, Reza; Nguyen, Matthew; Wong, Johnathan; Hsiao, William; Chauve, Cedric; Chindelevitch, Leonid",Algorithms for Computational Biology,705,13

However, such datasets are large in volume, and retrieving meaningful information from them is often challenging. Hence, different indexing techniques and data structures have been proposed to handle such a massive scale of data. We utilize one such technique: Generalized Suffix Tree (GST). In this paper, we introduce an efficient parallel generalized suffix tree construction algorithm that is scalable for arbitrary genomic datasets. Our construction mechanism employs shared and distributed memory architecture collectively while not posing any fixed, prior memory requirement as it uses external memory (disks). Our experimental results show that our proposed architecture offers around 4-times speedup with respect to the sequential algorithm with only 16 parallel processors. The experiments on different datasets and parameters also exhibit the scalability of the execution time. In addition, we utilize different string queries and demonstrate their execution time on such tree structure, illustrating the efficacy and usability of GST for genomic data.","Aziz, Md Momin Al; Thulasiraman, Parimala; Mohammed, Noman",Algorithms for Computational Biology,705,1

Without this management, license compliance would be impossible, export restrictions could not be maintained, and security vulnerabilities would remain unknown to the vendor. The management of these dependencies has grown in an ad-hoc fashion in most companies. As such, vendors find it hard to learn from each other and improve practices. To address this problem, we performed exploratory single-case study research at one large established software vendor. We gathered and analyzed the key challenges of tracking and documenting open source dependencies in products. We wanted to understand whether these ad-hoc solutions could be based on a single unified conceptual model for managing dependencies. Our study suggests that underlying the various point solutions that we found at this vendor lies a conceptual model that we tentatively call the product (architecture) model.

METHODS: Using Walker and Avant’s (2011)‘s approach, we refined the search strategy with input from our team, including family representatives. We reviewed the published and grey literature. We also interviewed 84 health, social, and educational stakeholders involved in the care of children with complex health conditions about their use/understanding of the concept. RESULTS: We provided model, borderline, related, and contrary cases for clarification purposes. We identified defining attributes that nuance the concept: (1) conditions and needs’ breadth; (2) uniqueness of each child/condition; (3) varying extent of severity over time; 4) developmental age; and (5) uniqueness of each family/context. Antecedents were chronic physical, mental, developmental, and/or behavioural condition(s). There were individual, family, and system consequences, including fragmented services. CONCLUSIONS: Building on previous definitions, we proposed an iteration that acknowledges the conditions’ changing trajectories as involving one or more chronic condition(s), regardless of type(s), whose trajectories can change over time, requiring services across sectors/settings, oftentimes resulting in a lower quality of life. A strength of this paper is the integration of the stakeholders’/family’s voices into the development of the definition.","Azar, Rima; Doucet, Shelley; Horsman, Amanda Rose; Charlton, Patricia; Luke, Alison; Nagel, Daniel A.; Hyndman, Nicky; Montelpare, William J.",BMC Pediatr,705,1

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was used as primary respiratory support. The main objective was to compare the need of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in first 72 h of life and secondarily hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (hsPDA), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (> grade 2), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and composite outcome of BPD/mortality.

No difference was observed in terms of hs PDA, IVH (> grade 2), BPD and composite outcome of BPD/mortality. Conclusion: There is no difference between MIST and InSurE in preterm neonates with RDS with NIPPV as a primary mode of respiratory support. Larger multicentre studies are needed to further explore differences in treatment failure and other secondary outcomes.

These programmes resulted in a long-term agrarian and food crisis which then led to a number of catastrophic events in the long twentieth century. The present book is about three such events from India’s late-colonial and postcolonial periods—the 1943–1944 Bengal famine, the 1967–1972 Naxalbari movement, and the 1975–1977 national emergency. It argues that these events are all linked with the historical crisis and yet distinct in their nature and orientation. The chapter contends that such a condition of relation through difference can be better understood via a reading of form and mode of the novels of these events. It shows that writers have predominantly used the realist form to represent the long-term historical crisis, while they have employed a range of modes—from social realist, critical realist to metafictional, urban fantastic, gothic, and others (many of which are conventionally understood as anti-realist or non-realist). These modes have shaped their realisms into a deeply heterogeneous and dynamic form, and, in so doing, composed the aesthetic framework of catastrophe-prone, crisis-ridden condition of life and living in postcolonial India, which is called here as “catastrophic realism.” The chapter situates the link between crisis and event by drawing upon the works of Fredric Jameson, Veena Das, Shahid Amin, and Louis Althusser. Its take on catastrophic realism is mediated through a thorough reading of realism, form, and mode in the European and postcolonial/Indian contexts, where Sa’adat Hasan Manto’s pre- and post-partition stories are offered as examples.","Bhattacharya, Sourit",Postcolonial Modernity and the Indian Novel,705,17

This study posits that fundamental historical, cultural and behavioural aspects affect the transition and contribute to the poor performance of many agile implementations. In order to address such factors, this study applies a modified Activity Theory (AT) based framework to a case study agile implementation within a large public sector organisation. An activity is closely defined, and six generic activities associated with all agile implementations are identified. These are validated against the agile maturity model literature and a set of evaluation criteria of contradictions, congruences and collaboration is established. Evidence is gathered from participant interviews and the framework is used to surface learning and development obstacles and issues within an expansive learning cycle. The study argues that analysis via this modified AT framework brings original insight. Initial findings indicate that there are relatively few learning and development issues associated with the use of agile tools and techniques themselves and that most problems arise at the interface where the “changed” (more agile) delivery teams meet the organisation’s behavioural norms and practices.","Chita, Pritam; Cruickshank, Peter; Smith, Colin; Richards, Kendall",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming,705,1

Moreover, interaction analyses show that some positive effects are enhanced and negative effects dampened when requirements risk is high.

What is largely neglected by process drift approaches is the identification of temporal dynamics of different clusters of process execution, how they interrelate, and how they change in dominance over time. In this paper, we introduce process evolution analysis (PEA) as a technique that aims to support the exploration of process cluster interrelations over time. This approach builds on and synthesizes existing approaches from the process drift, trace clustering, and process visualization literature. Based on the process evolution analysis, we visualize the interrelation of trace clusters over time for descriptive and prescriptive purposes.","Yeshchenko, Anton; Bayomie, Dina; Gross, Steven; Mendling, Jan","Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling",705,7

In contemporary, fast-paced markets, business models are volatile in nature and should be continuously innovated to accommodate new customer needs and technology developments. Business model innovation can be considered as an iterative process to guide business models from ideation towards implementation, in which the proper evaluation of business model prototypes is essential. For this evaluation, we need normative guidance, tools and rules to understand the relative performance of a new business model design. In the early design phases, this implies dealing with high levels of uncertainty. A few techniques and methods have been proposed for this purpose, but these lack the formal basis required for systematical application and development of automated evaluation tools. As a novel approach, we have earlier proposed the application of linguistic summarization to support early-phase, soft-quantitative business model evaluation. In this paper, we focus on a structural formalization of this approach as the basis for the development of well-defined user guidelines and automated evaluation tools. In doing so, we bridge the existing gap between qualitative and quantitative business model evaluation.

The generated plan model relies on a metamodel called METAKIP that represents the basic elements of KiPs. Our solution explores Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to generate plan models. This technique allows uncertainty representation by defining state transition probabilities, which gives us more flexibility than traditional approaches. We construct an MDP model and solve it with the help of the PRISM model-checker.

To determine if SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in sewage during the emergence of COVID-19 in The Netherlands, sewage samples of six cities and the airport were tested using four qRT-PCR assays, three targeting the nucleocapsid gene (N1–N3) and one the envelope gene (E). No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on February 6, 3 weeks before the first Dutch case was reported. On March 4/5, one or more gene fragments were detected in sewage of three sites, in concentrations of 2.6–30 gene copies per mL. In Amersfoort, N3 was detected in sewage 6 days before the first cases were reported. As the prevalence of COVID-19 in these cities increased in March, the RNA signal detected by each qRT-PCR assay increased, for N1–N3 up to 790–2200 gene copies per mL. This increase correlated significantly with the increase in reported COVID-19 prevalence. The detection of the virus RNA in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, and the correlation between concentration in sewage and reported prevalence of COVID-19, indicate that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.","Medema, Gertjan; Heijnen, Leo; Elsinga, Goffe; Italiaander, Ronald; Brouwer, Anke",Environ Sci Technol Lett,705,13

A dominating broadcast of a digraph D is a function [Formula: see text] such that for each vertex v of D, there exists a vertex t with [Formula: see text] having a directed path to v of length at most f(t). The cost of f is the sum of f(v) over all vertices v. A multipacking is a set S of vertices of D such that for each vertex v of D and for every integer d, there are at most d vertices from S within directed distance at most d from v. The maximum size of a multipacking of D is a lower bound to the minimum cost of a dominating broadcast of D. Let Broadcast Domination denote the problem of deciding whether a given digraph D has a dominating broadcast of cost at most k, and Multipacking the problem of deciding whether D has a multipacking of size at least k. It is known that Broadcast Domination is polynomial-time solvable for the class of all undirected graphs (that is, symmetric digraphs), while polynomial-time algorithms for Multipacking are known only for a few classes of undirected graphs. We prove that Broadcast Domination and Multipacking are both NP-complete for digraphs, even for planar layered acyclic digraphs of small maximum degree. Moreover, when parameterized by the solution cost/solution size, we show that the problems are respectively W[2]-hard and W[1]-hard. We also show that Broadcast Domination is FPT on acyclic digraphs, and that it does not admit a polynomial kernel for such inputs, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level. In addition, we show that both problems are FPT when parameterized by the solution cost/solution size together with the maximum out-degree. Finally, we give for both problems polynomial-time algorithms for some subclasses of acyclic digraphs.","Foucaud, Florent; Gras, Benjamin; Perez, Anthony; Sikora, Florian",Combinatorial Algorithms,705,1

Although CanineCV was highly positive rate in diarrhea cases, its pathogenicity remains controversial. In this study, the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of CanineCV infection among domestic dogs in northeastern China was investigated by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on recombinant capsid protein. Results revealed the proposed iELISA had no cross-reactivity with other related pathogens, and yielded good diagnostic values. Then, to evaluate the rCap iELISA, this study applied it to detect antibodies against CanineCV in 1,047 clinical serum samples obtained from northeastern China in 2016–2017. Results showed the positive rates in the five cities of Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang provinces ranged from 22.22 to 42.29%. Statistical analysis shows a significant difference in age between dogs <3 months old with respect to the >1-year-old dogs (p = 0.005), that is, the CanineCV infection was more frequently identified from older dogs. In the artificially infected experiment, the dogs developed seroconversion after 9 or 12 days and the main way of virus excretion was through feces. More interestingly, among the 32 ELISA-positive serum samples, 34.75% samples tested positive for the CanineCV DNA by qPCR, far higher than that in ELISA-negative serum samples (5.26%, 2/38). This report is the first to demonstrate that CanineCV infection is common in the dog population in northeastern China. The results showed obvious differences in the positive rate associated with diarrhea, age, but not with different cities. This study also provide basis for evaluating the pathogenic potential of CanineCV. But, the pathogenicity, the relationship between antibody level and immune protection, and the harmful effects of this virus remain to be established.","Wang, Zheng; Shi, Yunjia; Wang, Yu; Zhao, Lili; Cui, Xingyang; Wen, Shanshan; Liu, Hanghang; Cui, Wen; Chen, Hongyan; Ge, Junwei",Front Vet Sci,705,1

METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated the medical records of patients with MDRAB infections in the PICU during a follow-up period, between January 2015 and January 2017. The identification of A. baumannii was performed using a BD Phoenix 100 Automated Microbiology System. A BD Phoenix NMIC/ID-400 commercial kit was used to test antibiotic susceptibility. All data was entered into Microsoft Excel, and the data was analyzed using SPSS version 23.0. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 8.1 ± 6.2 y. In all, 46 isolates were obtained from 33 patients. The most effective antimicrobial agents were colistin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and tigecycline. Nevertheless, with the exception of colistin, no antibiotic was associated with a susceptibility rate of >45% for the isolates.

Students with diagnoses that were perceived as dangerous (e.g., psychopathy) were more stigmatized than students with diagnoses that were perceived as less dangerous (e.g., autism). Disruptive autistic behaviors (described via vignettes) evoked more stigma than withdrawn behaviors. Perceived dangerousness predicted autism stigma. Greater acceptance of inequality, less openness, and lower cognitive empathy co-occurred with heightened stigma towards most conditions. Diagnostic labels were typically less stigmatized than behaviors. Findings suggest that interventions are needed to decrease stigma towards varied diagnoses in collegiate communities.

Shale generally contains a certain amount of primary water, and isothermal adsorption experiments on wet samples show that water inhibits methane adsorption. Researches on methane adsorption mainly focus on the conditions of low pressure and water content. In this study, a hybrid GCMC-MD simulation method is proposed to study methane adsorption characteristics under high pressure and water content in pores of different sizes. This method can obtain the bulk pressure of the system while ensuring the simultaneous movement of methane and water molecules, and has high efficiency and reliability. It is found that the existence of water does not change the morphology of excess isotherm, and the relative decrease of adsorption capacity due to the existence of water is not sensitive to temperature. In ≤3 nm pores, water molecules form water clusters and partially occupy wall adsorption sites, and the adsorption amount decreases linearly with increasing water saturation. In the 5 nm wide pore with 40% water saturation, water films formed and methane adsorption is strongly suppressed. It is expected these findings could provide guidance for the evaluation of the amount of adsorbed methane with primary water.","Zhou, Ji; Jiang, Wenbin; Lin, Mian; Ji, Lili; Cao, Gaohui",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,705,13

While the utility of such policies has been well-established empirically, a theoretical understanding of whether restarts are indeed crucial to the power of CDCL solvers is missing. In this paper, we prove a series of theoretical results that characterize the power of restarts for various models of SAT solvers. More precisely, we make the following contributions. First, we prove an exponential separation between a drunk randomized CDCL solver model with restarts and the same model without restarts using a family of satisfiable instances. Second, we show that the configuration of CDCL solver with VSIDS branching and restarts (with activities erased after restarts) is exponentially more powerful than the same configuration without restarts for a family of unsatisfiable instances. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first separation results involving restarts in the context of SAT solvers. Third, we show that restarts do not add any proof complexity-theoretic power vis-a-vis a number of models of CDCL and DPLL solvers with non-deterministic static variable and value selection.","Li, Chunxiao; Fleming, Noah; Vinyals, Marc; Pitassi, Toniann; Ganesh, Vijay",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,705,1

Instead of conventional bit-blasting, we exploit word-level inference to translate these systems into non-linear pseudo-boolean constraints. We derive the pseudo-booleans by simulating bit assignments through the addition of (linear) polynomials and applying a strong form of propagation by computing Gröbner bases. By handling bit assignments symbolically, the number of Gröbner basis calculations, along with the number of assignments, is reduced. The final Gröbner basis yields expressions for the bit-vectors in terms of the symbolic bits, together with non-linear pseudo-boolean constraints on the symbolic variables, modulo a power of two. The pseudo-booleans can be solved by translation into classical linear pseudo-boolean constraints (without a modulo) or by encoding them as propositional formulae, for which a novel translation process is described.","Seed, Thomas; King, Andy; Evans, Neil",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,705,1

This, however, has proven to be a challenging task and greedy approaches are typically used to learn trees in practice. Nevertheless, recent work showed that by the use of SAT solvers one may calculate the optimal size tree for real-world benchmarks. This paper proposes a novel SAT-based encoding that explicitly models paths in the tree, which enables us to control the tree’s depth as well as size. At the level of individual SAT calls, we investigate splitting the search space into tree topologies. Our tool outperforms the existing implementation.

Clinicians and medical representative bodies such as the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine (IAEM) have expressed concern that some patients may not seek timely urgent medical intervention. Evidence from previous epidemics found that hospital avoidance during outbreaks of MERS and SARS was common. While ED attendance returned to normal following SARS and MERS, both outbreaks lasted 2-3 months. As the COVID-19 pandemic is forecast to extend into 2021, little is known about the impact COVID-19 will have on paediatric attendance at EDs as the pandemic evolves. Aims: This project aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on paediatric emergency healthcare utilisation, to understand how the health seeking behaviour of parents may have altered due to the pandemic, and to identify how any barriers to accessing care can be removed. Methods: Administrative data records from five EDs across Ireland and one Urgent Care Centre will be analysed to identify changes in attendances at emergency healthcare. Qualitative inquiry will be utilised to capture the experience of staff providing emergency healthcare to paediatric patients during COVID-19, and their feedback on identified trends will inform the interpretation of findings. A cross-sectional survey of parents will capture experiences, concerns and decision-making on accessing healthcare for their children during the pandemic. Results and Conclusion: This information will help decision makers respond rapidly to meet the clinical needs of paediatric patients as the circumstances of the pandemic unfold and reduce the disruption to normal paediatric ED services during the onset of COVID-19. As the health of a child can deteriorate more rapidly than that of an adult, any delay in seeking care for an acutely ill child may have serious consequences.","McDonnell, Thérèse; McAuliffe, Eilish; Barrett, Michael; Conlon, Ciara; Cummins, Fergal; Deasy, Conor; Hensey, Conor; Martin, Ciara; Nicholson, Emma",HRB Open Res,705,1

DNTM uses pre-partitioned disjoint communities and then analyzes the neighbourhood distribution of boundary nodes in disjoint communities to detect overlapping communities. It is a form of seed-based global method since boundary nodes are considered as seeds and become the starting point for detecting overlapping communities. Threshold value for each boundary node is used as minimum influence by the neighbours of a node in order to determine its belongingness to any community. The effectiveness of the DNTM algorithm has been demonstrated by testing on fifteen real-world datasets and compared with seven overlapping community detection algorithms. DNTM outperforms comparable algorithms with 10 out of 15 datasets and gives comparable results for the remaining 5 datasets in terms of the extended modularity [Formula: see text] measure. Experiments with various disjoint algorithms on 15 datasets reveal that DNTM with tolerance community detection (TCD) as a preprocessing algorithm gives the best result.","Jaiswal, Rajesh; Ramanna, Sheela",Rough Sets,705,1

We then propose a novel vulnerability assessment approach that assembles on-device Intent/API fuzzing, network-side packet fuzzing, and targeted code auditing. By testing Android from version 7.0 to the recent 9.0, we have discovered 8 zero-day Android VoIP vulnerabilities, all of which were confirmed by Google with bug bounty awards. The security consequences are serious, including denying voice calls, caller ID spoofing, unauthorized call operations, and remote code execution.

To determine the existence of inequality and gradient in out-of-pocket expenses, public spending and private spending, among countries from the Americas stratified according to their human resources for health (HRH) density. METHODS. Analytical and transversal study of health inequalities for out-of-pocket spending (percentage of total health spending), public spending and private spending (percentage of GDP), applying the human resource density (medicine and nursing) as a stratifier. Based on data from the Pan American Health Organization and the World Bank, 32 countries from the Americas were categorized according to their density, and weighted rates, descriptors, differences, correlations, and simple and complex indicators of inequality were calculated. RESULTS. There is high variability in HRH density (3.8 to 171.3; mean 43.97, SD 37.08) with significant differences between high and low density categories. The first quartile concentrates 9% of the population and 4.45% of the HRH; the first 3 quartiles concentrate 48.4% of the population and 17% of the HRH. The stratification showed a gradient and inequalities in expenditure indicators, higher in the out-of-pocket expenditure, with which the HRH density presented a negative correlation. CONCLUSIONS. HRH density shows high variability among countries and categorized groups; it is unevenly concentrated in the population, and is greater in countries with higher public spending. As a stratifier of the sample, it showed inequalities and gradients in health spending; the strata with lower density showed higher out-of-pocket spending, lower public spending and higher private spending.","Guerrero Núñez, Juan",Rev Panam Salud Publica,705,1

To explore the structure–property relationship of Favipiravir, in silico designing of a series of piperazine substituted Favipiravir derivatives are attempted and computational screening has been done to evaluate its bimolecular interactions with Nipah virus. The geometrical features of all the molecules have been addressed from Density Functional Theory calculations. Chemical reactivity descriptor analysis was carried out to understand various reactivity parameters. The drug-likeness properties were estimated by a detailed ADMET study. The binding ability and the mode of binding of these derivatives into the Nipah virus are obtained from molecular docking studies.

Pedestrian streets play a significant role towards the direction of sustainable mobility and the facilitation of environment friendly daily trips. This research concerns one of the most important pedestrian streets in the centre of the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. The evaluation of the existing situation in the pedestrian street together with the evaluation of various scenarios concerning changes in the behaviour and direction of movement of pedestrians due to incidents is examined in the framework of this paper. The evaluation took place by using the pedestrian simulation software PTV Viswalk and four different scenarios were tested. The first scenario is the base scenario referring to the existing situation. The second scenario deals with an increase in the pedestrian flow due to unexpected events. The other two scenarios refer to evacuation phenomenon, thus preventing access to part of the pedestrian street. The examination concerns the pedestrian Level of Service (LOS) and the identification of critical segments of the pedestrian street in terms of pedestrians’ flow and composition. The simulation results show that even in the case of doubling of pedestrian flow, this will not cause an overall significant drop in LOS, except for specific sections of the pedestrian street. These results can assist the authorities so to minimize walking difficulties in the pedestrian street and at the same time to take care for waiting areas and the provision of optimum evacuation routes.","Campisi, Tiziana; Basbas, Socrates; Tesoriere, Giovanni; Canale, Antonino; Vaitsis, Panagiotis; Zeglis, Dimitris; Andronis, Charilaos",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,705,1

However, it is widely recognized that significant differences do arise in the way policies get implemented in different regions. This chapter underscores the importance of the regional political context in explaining the much-delayed reforms that took place in the electricity sector of Bihar. The performance of the electricity sector is essentially embedded in three major epochs in the political history of Bihar in which a fifteen-year period of a particular political party figures centrally. The state was delayed in reforming the sector due to their approach of ‘state incapacity by design’ which was deeply rooted in a larger sociopolitical institution called caste that is dominant in Bihar. Eventually, Bihar succeeded in reforming its power sector in the post-2012 period with the change in the political regime where power sector reform was given high priority. Enhancement in networks and customer base, organizational restructuring and mobilization of financial resources were possible because of sufficient political support towards this basic developmental challenge.","Siddiqui, Md Zakaria",Sustainable Development Insights from India,705,7

They are relevant for not only general purpose programming languages, but also for many domain specific languages. Bugs in compilers can potentially render all programs at risk. It is thus crucial that compilers are systematically tested, if not verified. Recently, a number of efforts have been made to formalise and standardise programming language semantics, which can be applied to verify the correctness of the respective compilers. In this work, we present a novel specification-based testing method named SpecTest to better utilise these semantics for testing. By applying an executable semantics as test oracle, SpecTest can discover deep semantic errors in compilers. Compared to existing approaches, SpecTest is built upon a novel test coverage criterion called semantic coverage which brings together mutation testing and fuzzing to specifically target less tested language features. We apply SpecTest to systematically test two compilers, i.e., the Java compiler and the Solidity compiler. SpecTest improves the semantic coverage of both compilers considerably and reveals multiple previously unknown bugs.","Schumi, Richard; Sun, Jun",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,705,26

For that, we propose the integrated open-source zeek-osquery platform that combines the Zeek IDS with the osquery host monitor. Our platform can collect, process, and correlate host and network data at large scale, e.g., to attribute network flows to processes and users. The platform can be flexibly extended with own detection scripts using already correlated, but also additional and dynamically retrieved host data. A distributed deployment enables it to scale with an arbitrary number of osquery hosts.

Prometheus is the figure par excellence of human forethought and progress in the anthropocene. In this article, we introduce the concept of ambient Prometheanism to describe the way of thinking that foregrounds foresight and anticipation and advances technological solutions developed by capital and energy-intensive projects. We question this stance, arguing that ambient Prometheanism, with its emphasis on technofix, leads to the economisation and depoliticisation of planetary environmental issues. Following Bernard Stiegler, we recover from the myth the figure of Epimetheus, Prometheus’ brother, as well as his associated faculty, epimetheia to theorise what we call an ‘Epimethean politics’. Thinking the anthropocene from the perspective of ambient Prometheanism and Epimetheanism means to consider the role of technology in climate politics, and in particular to make the case for the importance of afterthought in face of unintended consequences and accumulated errors. To substantiate our argument, we outline the challenge posed by emerging solutions focussed on technological intensification (geoengineering) and socio-economic acceleration (green growth and accelerationism). An Epimethean politics of the climate requires to use reflexivity as a capacity to anticipate, but also to mobilise epimetheia to account for accidents and past mistakes. Such a politics builds from an alternative conception of technology, one that radically differs from ambient Prometheanism. Finally we read as actualisations of Epimethean politics contemporary eco-political struggles and their imperatives for multispecies living and convivial livelihoods.","Dillet, Benoit; Hatzisavvidou, Sophia",Contemp Polit Theory,705,1

There are very limited data to support this contraindication. OBJECTIVES (1) To evaluate the effects of monopolar cautery on cochlear implant devices. (2) To determine whether monopolar cautery changes the endocochlear temperature in an implanted cochlea. DESIGN Sixteen cochlear implants from 3 manufacturers (Advanced Bionics LLC, Cochlear Americas Ltd, and Med-El Ltd) were implanted into 2 unembalmed, fresh cadavers. Monopolar cautery was applied to either the tongue or abdomen at coagulation settings of 10 W or 50 W for 30 minutes. Impedance and integrity testing were performed before, during, and after 30 minutes of cautery. The temperature in the endocochlear perilymph was measured during cautery. After explantation, devices were returned to the manufacturer for an in-depth ""failure"" analysis according to each manufacturer's current protocol evaluating explanted devices. SETTING Basic science laboratory, tertiary medical center. PARTICIPANTS Cadaveric study. INTERVENTION Application of monopolar cautery to implanted cochlear implants in a cadaveric model. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE (1) Changes to the implanted devices either during electrocautery or following failure analysis. (2) Changes in the intracochlear temperature. RESULTS No change in impedance, integrity testing, or failure analysis occurred at any cautery setting when applied to either the oral cavity or abdomen. The temperature of the cochlea did not increase with up to 30 minutes of cautery at a setting of 50 W. Comprehensive device analysis did not show any evidence of device damage at the conclusion of the study. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Monopolar cautery did not produce detectible damage to any of the cochlear implant devices or produce detectible temperature change in the cochlea at low or high levels of cautery in the oral cavity in this experimental model.","Jeyakumar, Anita; Wilson, Meghan; Sorrel, Jonathan E; McIntire, J Benjamin; Jones, Dara D; Brickman, Todd M; Arriaga, Moises",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,705,28

RESULTS Thirteen of the repurposed drugs or drug combinations are indicated for use in pediatrics in some age category albeit for indications other than COVID-19; 10 of these are indicated for use in pregnant women. Even in cases where these drugs are indicated in the populations, source data from which safety and or dosing could be extrapolated for use in COVID-19 is sparse. Vaccine trials are ongoing and generally exclude pregnant women; only in a few instances have pediatric subgroups been planned for enrollment. Data from individual case studies and RWD may suggest that subpopulations of both pediatric patients and pregnant women may be more at risk, particularly those in an increased inflammatory state. CONCLUSION In conjunction with more prospective collaboration, plans are evolving to ensure that we will be better prepared to address similar situations especially in pediatrics and pregnant women where experience is limited and actual practice relies heavily on leveraging data from other populations and indications.","Barrett, Jeffrey S",British journal of clinical pharmacology,705,16

Discovery of this heritable HLH/SPTCL diathesis has expanded our understanding of a rare and molecularly heterogeneous lymphoma. Furthermore, patients with SPTCL have excellent survival unless they develop HLH. Therefore, through compiling data on SPTCL-related conditions that predispose patients to HLH, we are better able to predict which patients with SPTCL have the greatest risk of mortality. We present the first case of SPTCL with concomitant HLH and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in a patient who was subsequently diagnosed with familial HLH (F-HLH) attributable to a germline STXBP2 splice-site mutation.

In an effort to identify patients at greater risk, some investigators promote individual risk assessment using Caprini scores. However, these scores do not correlate with relative risk values. Affected patients cannot be reliably predicted (97% false positive rate). Caprini scores make many body contouring patients candidates for chemoprophylaxis, an intervention that introduces risks related to anticoagulation. Caprini has financial conflicts with several companies that manufacture products such as enoxaparin, commonly used for chemoprophylaxis. Rivaroxaban, taken orally, has been used by some plastic surgeons as an alternative to enoxaparin injections. However, this medication is not United States Food and Drug Administration approved for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in plastic surgery patients, and a reversal agent is unavailable. This article challenges the prevailing wisdom regarding individual risk stratification and chemoprophylaxis. Alternative methods to reduce risk for all patients include safer anesthesia methods and Doppler ultrasound surveillance. Clinical findings alone are unreliable in diagnosing deep venous thromboses. Only by using a reliable diagnostic tool such as Doppler ultrasound are we able to learn more about the natural history of this problem in our patients.

Numerous studies have assessed the influence of demographic and socioeconomic factors on child immunization around the world. There are few such studies in Afghanistan, however. Therefore, this study aimed to identify factors influencing vaccination status among children age 12-23 months in Afghanistan. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nationally representative data from the 2015 Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey were used for this study. A sample of 5,708 children age 12-23 months with a vaccine card and immunization history was analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify significant relationships between cofactors and vaccination status. RESULTS In the study, 51% the subjects were boys, 48% were born at home, and 76% were residents of rural areas. Background characteristics positively associated with vaccination status included delivery in a health facility (RRR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.9-3.3), maternal age of 30-39 years (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.1), attending at least four visits for antenatal care (RRR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.7-4.5), health facility visit in the past 12 months (RRR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4-2.5), paternal professional occupation (RRR = 4.9, 95% CI = 2.0-12.3), family with richer wealth index (RRR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.4-4.1), and living in the northeast region (RRR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-3.9)were positively associated with vaccination status. Living in the southern region (RRR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.2-0.5) was negatively associated with vaccination status. CONCLUSION This study identified maternal age, ANC visits, place of delivery, health facility visits in past 12 months, paternal occupation, wealth quintile, and geographic region as the factors influencing child's vaccination status in Afghanistan.","Aalemi, Ahmad Khalid; Shahpar, Karimullah; Mubarak, Mohammad Yousuf",PloS one,705,1

The Health Protection Agency, in collaboration with the College of Emergency Medicine, has established the Emergency Department Sentinel Syndromic Surveillance System (EDSSS) to support the public health surveillance requirements of the Games. METHODS This feasibility study assesses the usefulness of EDSSS in monitoring indicators of disease in the community. Daily counts of anonymised attendance data from six emergency departments across England were analysed by patient demographics (age, gender, partial postcode), triage coding and diagnosis codes. Generic and specific syndromic indicators were developed using aggregations of diagnosis codes recorded during each attendance. RESULTS Over 339,000 attendances were recorded (26 July 2010 to 25 July 2011). The highest attendances recorded on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 and on weekends between 12:00 and 13:00. The mean daily attendance per emergency department was 257 (range 38-435). Syndromic indicators were developed including: respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, acute respiratory infection, gastroenteritis and myocardial ischaemia. Respiratory and acute respiratory infection indicators peaked during December 2010, concomitant with national influenza activity, as monitored through other influenza surveillance systems. CONCLUSIONS The EDSSS has been established to provide an enhanced surveillance system for the London 2012 Olympics. Further validation of the data will be required; however, the results from this initial descriptive study demonstrate the potential for identifying unusual and/or severe outbreaks of infectious disease, or other incidents with public health impact, within the community.","Elliot, Alex J; Hughes, Helen E; Hughes, Thomas C; Locker, Thomas E; Shannon, Tony; Heyworth, John; Wapling, Andy; Catchpole, Mike; Ibbotson, Sue; McCloskey, Brian; Smith, Gillian E",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,705,1

An effective inhibition of leukocyte transmigration in vitro is mediated by naturally occurring peptide Bβ15-42, which is a competitive inhibitor of the interaction between the N-terminus of the fibrin beta chain and vascular endothelial cadherin. We investigated the effect of Bβ15-42 on thrombus resolution in a murine stagnant flow venous thrombosis model and studied Bβ15-42 levels in venous thrombus of human patients. Approach and Results: We investigated 2 mouse models of subtotal inferior vena cava ligation. In the first model, we ligated the inferior vena cava. In the second model, we additionally ligated all visible inferior vena cava side and back branches. Study groups of 8 to 12 weeks old BALB/c mice were then injected intraperitoneal twice daily with 2.4 mg/kg of Bβ15-42, unrelated control peptide or saline. Bβ15-42 attenuated thrombus resolution after inferior vena cava ligation. We observed decreased numbers of thrombus macrophages and microvessels and less urokinase-type plasminogen activator expression in mice that were injected with Bβ15-42. Mechanistic experiments demonstrated that Bβ15-42 blocks monocyte transmigration through an endothelial cell monolayer. Measurements of Bβ15-42 in red clot and plasma of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension cases indicated high concentrations compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that excess of the fibrin fragment Bβ15-42 misguides thrombus resolution, presumably by inhibiting vascular endothelial cadherin-mediated leukocyte migration during early thrombus organization.","Chausheva, Stella; Redwan, Bassam; Sharma, Smriti; Marella, Nara; Schossleitner, Klaudia; Mueller, André C; Petzelbauer, Peter; Morris, Timothy; Lang, Irene M","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",705,16

In small trials of patients undergoing surgery, graduated compression stockings (GCS) reduce the risk of DVT. National stroke guidelines extrapolating from these trials recommend their use in patients with stroke despite insufficient evidence. We assessed the effectiveness of thigh-length GCS to reduce DVT after stroke. METHODS In this outcome-blinded, randomised controlled trial, 2518 patients who were admitted to hospital within 1 week of an acute stroke and who were immobile were enrolled from 64 centres in the UK, Italy, and Australia. Patients were allocated via a central randomisation system to routine care plus thigh-length GCS (n=1256) or to routine care plus avoidance of GCS (n=1262). A technician who was blinded to treatment allocation undertook compression Doppler ultrasound of both legs at about 7-10 days and, when practical, again at 25-30 days after enrolment. The primary outcome was the occurrence of symptomatic or asymptomatic DVT in the popliteal or femoral veins. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN28163533. FINDINGS All patients were included in the analyses. The primary outcome occurred in 126 (10.0%) patients allocated to thigh-length GCS and in 133 (10.5%) allocated to avoid GCS, resulting in a non-significant absolute reduction in risk of 0.5% (95% CI -1.9% to 2.9%). Skin breaks, ulcers, blisters, and skin necrosis were significantly more common in patients allocated to GCS than in those allocated to avoid their use (64 [5%] vs 16 [1%]; odds ratio 4.18, 95% CI 2.40-7.27). INTERPRETATION These data do not lend support to the use of thigh-length GCS in patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke.

The need for rapid testing is a high priority and alternative testing strategies including x-ray image classification are a promising area of research. However, at present, public datasets for COVID-19 x-ray images have low data volumes, making it challenging to develop accurate image classifiers. Several recent papers have made use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in order to increase the training data volumes. But realistic synthetic COVID-19 x-rays remain challenging to generate. We present a novel Mean Teacher + Transfer GAN (MTT-GAN) that generates COVID-19 chest x-ray images of high quality. In order to create a more accurate GAN, we employ transfer learning from the Kaggle pneumonia x-ray dataset, a highly relevant data source orders of magnitude larger than public COVID-19 datasets. Furthermore, we employ the Mean Teacher algorithm as a constraint to improve stability of training. Our qualitative analysis shows that the MTT-GAN generates x-ray images that are greatly superior to a baseline GAN and visually comparable to real x-rays. Although board-certified radiologists can distinguish MTT-GAN fakes from real COVID-19 x-rays, quantitative analysis shows that MTT-GAN greatly improves the accuracy of both a binary COVID-19 classifier as well as a multi-class pneumonia classifier as compared to a baseline GAN. Our classification accuracy is favorable as compared to recently reported results in the literature for similar binary and multi-class COVID-19 screening tasks.","Menon, S.; Galita, J.; Chapman, D.; Gangopadhyay, A.; Mangalagiri, J.; Nguyen, P.; Yesha, Y.; Saboury, B.; Morris, M.",2020 Ieee International Conference on Big Data,705,1

Rapid antigen tests (RAT), though less sensitive than RT-PCR, offer the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and early detection of the most infectious COVID-19 cases. Only very few studies have assessed the performance of the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT among asymptomatic people or in Latin America. This study set out to validate this test among people attending the public test street in Sint Maarten, Dutch Caribbean. Methods: People of all ages were recruited from the public COVID-19 test street regardless of COVID-19 symptoms. They received a nasopharyngeal swab for the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT and the RT-PCR Qtower. Diagnostic accuracy of the RAT was compared to the RT-PCR among the overall study population and for subgroups with/without symptoms, with/without close contact and different Ct values. Results: Using a RT-PCR Ct cut-off value of <33, 119 out of 1,411 people (8.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most were asymptomatic (59%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAT was 84% (95% CI 76.2-90.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100) respectively. The sensitivity reduced to 67.6% (95% CI: 49.5%, 82.6%) among people without symptoms, regardless of whether they were in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. Sensitivity reduced considerably with a Ct cut-off value of <35. Conclusions: The Abbott Panbio RAT is a valid and cheaper alternative to RT-PCR when used on symptomatic individuals among the general population. However, among asymptomatic people it should not be used as a stand-alone test and negative results should be confirmed with RT-PCR.","King, C.; Lista-de Weever, E.; Henry, M.; Steingrover, R.; Fleming, C.; Panneflek, R.; van Kampen, S.",,705,24

The current study adopted structural equation modeling to examine key employability skills that match workplace requirements and foster employability.FindingsBased on the empirical findings, the acquired employability skills of young graduates are entrepreneurship, professional development, work with others, self-management, communication and problem solving. Moreover, higher education institutions should work closely with industry stakeholders to get employers engaged with the work-integrating learning (WIL) programs and subsequently equip young graduates for better employability opportunities. In connection with employer engagement, employability skills of communication, problem solving and self-management would be improved. Furthermore, entrepreneurship and problem-solving skills could further be developed for young graduating students working in SME organizations during WIL.Originality/valueAs a notable gap exists in the current literature to examine young graduates' key employability skills in the context and content of Hong Kong self-financing tertiary education, this research explores key employability skills of self-financed young graduates and the relative importance of employability skills across company size using a quantitative approach.","Ng, Peggy M.

Methods: We recruited women aged 18 years or older with a singleton pregnancy of >12 weeks gestation. FHR recordings were performed using the HBM and cardiotocography (CTG) to determine comparative accuracy. The HBM was then used by clinicians and participants in the antenatal clinic with the latter then using the device unassisted to record at home. The women rated the HBM using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: A total of 81 participants provided 126 recordings for analysis. The accuracy of the HBM was excellent compared with CTG, with limits of agreement (95%) between minus 1.5 and plus 0.9 beats per minute (bpm) and a mean difference of minus 0.29 bpm. The FHR was detected on 100% of occasions by clinicians (52 recordings) and participants when used in the clinic (42 recordings) and at home (32 recordings). Home users took an average of 1.1 minutes to detect the FHR and recorded a continuous trace of >1 minute in 94% of occasions, with an average total trace time of 4.4 minutes. The FHR trace was deemed to be clinically useful in 100% of clinician recordings and 97% of home recordings. There was no effect from body mass index, gestational age, pregnancy history, or placental position. The HBM ranked in the 96th to 100th percentile on the SUS for usability and learnability. Conclusions: The HBM was accurate and easy for clinicians and participants to use. The data recorded at home was equivalent to that obtained in the clinic using current assessment protocols for low-risk pregnancies, allowing the device to be used in telehealth consultations.

Air quality issues abound in developing Asian countries, but during COVID-19 lockdowns, urban air quality improved due to the reduction in public mobility and fuel consumption. In Indonesia, the Large-Scale Social Restriction (LSSR) program was implemented to prevent the wider spread of COVID-19, especially in large urban areas. It was not a total lockdown program but had the purpose of reducing urban public mobility. This study investigated the effects of social restrictions on air quality in Jakarta, Indonesia. Data were obtained from our long-term monitoring of fine (PM2.5) and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5-10) and compositions collected at a site in South Jakarta. Other data were obtained from the environmental protection agency's (EPA's) air quality monitoring station in Central Jakarta including PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Jakarta measured by a sun photometer and satellite data were used to assess the spatial distribution of AOD across Jakarta. During the first LSSR implementation period from 15 March to 30 May 2020, there were decreased average SO2, CO, NO, NO2, and NOx concentrations of 40 to 60% compared to the same period in 2019. However, O-3 increased by 33% likely due to reduction in NOx emissions. The PM2.5 decline reached similar to 40%, but a similar decline was not observed for PM10. Elemental and black carbon concentration data showed reductions that ranged from 30% to more than 50%. Consistent with the PM observations, both ground and satellite based AOD showed reductions in the aerosol column burden over the city. The ground based AOD values showed moderate correlations with PM2.5. The results confirmed that significant reduction in public mobility was highly associated with the improvement of local air quality which useful to derive future control strategies.","Santoso, M.; Hopke, P.

Obligations, permissions and prohibitions are distinct from a system's mission, and are a necessary part of specifying advanced, adaptive AI-equipped systems. They need a dedicated deontic logic of obligations to formalize them. Most existing deontic logics lack corresponding algorithms and system models that permit automatic verification. We demonstrate how a particular deontic logic, Dominance Act Utilitarianism (DAU), is a suitable starting point for formalizing the obligations of autonomous systems like self-driving cars. We demonstrate its usefulness by formalizing a subset of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) in DAU; RSS is an industrial proposal for how self-driving cars should and should not behave in traffic. We show that certain logical consequences of RSS are undesirable, indicating a need to further refine the proposal. We also demonstrate how obligations can change over time, which is necessary for long-term autonomy. We then demonstrate a model-checking algorithm for DAU formulas on weighted transition systems, and illustrate it by model-checking obligations of a self-driving car controller from the literature.","Shea-Blymyer, Colin; Abbas, Houssam",,705,16

This study examines the need for orientation, cognitive reasoning of COVID-19 news, and perceived risk, which all contributed to protective action during the city’s total lockdown. Using data collected in a mobile CATI survey during the peak of the outbreaks in February 2020, findings show that the attention to COVID-19 in digital media predicted the perception of the coronavirus pandemic as a personal risk. In addition, the need for orientation and elaboration of news about the outbreaks were positively associated with perceived risk target–personal and societal. Finally, perceived personal risk proved a stronger predictor than perceived risk to society in general for taking protective behavior. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2021.","Li, Z.; Wei, R.; Lo, V.

In contrast, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) strains may cause invasive, community-acquired infections in otherwise healthy individuals. These highly virulent strains were first identified in Taiwan in 1986 and have since disseminated across the globe. The prevalence of hvKp has been well described in Southeast Asia, but is not well understood in the United States. In this work, 141 consecutive K. pneumoniae blood stream isolates were collected at Northwestern Memorial Hospital from 2015-2017. To screen this collection for hvKp, isolates were tested for the hypermucoviscous phenotype and the presence of aerobactin and salmochelin biosynthesis genes, biomarkers that have been used to distinguish hvKp from cKp. These biomarkers were identified in 12 (8.5%), 6 (4.3%), and 5 (3.5%) isolates, respectively. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the six isolates that contained aerobactin biosynthesis genes and demonstrated that these genes were contained on large plasmids. Five isolates contained plasmids nearly identical to previously described hvKp virulence plasmids while one was similar to a plasmid from a swine isolate of K. pneumoniae. These findings indicate that several non-clonal hvKp-like strains are present in the U.S.","Kochan, Travis J.; Khalatyan, Natalia; Cheung, Bettina H.; Nozick, Sophie H.; Ozer, Egon A.; Hauser, Alan R.",bioRxiv,705,19

Since the first laboratory confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from Kerala on January 30, 2020 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) has been presenting to the hospital emergencies as severe acute respiratory illness (SARI). We aim to find out the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in SARI cases and further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP in New Delhi, India. Aims and Objectives To find out the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in SARI cases presenting to the hospital emergency and describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting and Participants Retrospective, single-center case series of the 82 consecutive hospitalized patients with SARI and subsequent confirmed NCIP cases at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi between 10th April 2020 and 30th April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. The primary composite end-point was admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation or death. Patients were categorized as severe pneumonia and non-severe pneumonia at time of admission and outcome data was compared. Results Of the 82 SARI cases, 32(39%) patients were confirmed to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. The median age of NCIP cases was 54.5 years (IQR, 46.25 - 60) and 19(59.3%) of them were males. 24(75%) cases were categorized as severe pneumonia on admission. 22(68.8%) patients had 1 or more co-morbidities. Diabetes mellitus 16(50%), hypertension 11(34.4%) and chronic obstructive airway disease 5(15.6%) were the most common co-existing illnesses. Compared with the patients who did not meet the primary outcome, patients who met the primary outcome were more likely to be having at least 1 underlying comorbidity (p-0.03), diabetes (p-0.003) and hypertension (p-0.03). Common symptoms included dyspnea 29(90.6%) followed by cough 27(84.4%), fever 22(68%), bodyache and myalgias 14(43.75%). Median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 3 days. The most common pattern on chest X-ray was bilateral patchy nodular or interstitial infiltration seen in 30(93.8%) patients. Leucopenia was present in 10(31.2%) of the patients, with majority of patients presenting with lymphocytopenia, 24(75%) [lymphocyte count (1106 cells/ dL), interquartile range {IQR}, (970-1487)]. Thrombocytopenia was seen in 14(43.8%) patients, pancytopenia in 10(31.2%) patients and anemia was seen in 14(43.8%) patients. Hypoalbuminemia was present in 22(68.8%) cases. Raised CK-MB was seen in 7(21.9%) patients. The primary composite end-point occurred in 12(37.5%) patients, including 9(28.13%) patients who required mechanical ventilation and subsequently expired. 3(9.3%) of these patients who recovered, were subsequently shifted to COVID-19 ward from the ICU. The patients who met the primary outcome were older in age (56.5 years vs 50 years), had significantly higher SOFA scores (6 vs 3.5), were in shock (41.7% vs 5%), in higher respiratory distress (66.7% vs 10%), had lower mean arterial oxygen saturation (85% vs 89.5%), had higher CK-MB values (66 vs 26)U/L [6(54.5%) vs 2(9.5%)], had hypoalbuminemia (100% vs 50%) and acute kidney injury 8(72.7%) vs 5(23.8%) on admission.

We previously reported that only a limited neutralizing activity to vesicular stomatitis virus or HCV pseudotype is generated in animals immunized with recombinant HCV envelope proteins and chronically infected HCV patient sera. Interestingly, when some of these neutralizing sera were diluted into a range of concentrations below those that reduced virus plaque number, an increase in pseudotype plaque formation was observed. Purified HCV E2-specific human monoclonal antibodies were used to further verify the specificity of this enhancement, and one- to twofold increases were apparent on permissive Huh-7 cells. The enhancement of HCV pseudotype titer could be inhibited by the addition of a Fc-specific anti-human immunoglobulin G Fab fragment to the virus-antibody mixture prior to infection. Treatment of cells with antibody to Fc receptor I (FcRI) or FcRII, but not FcRIII, also led to an inhibition of pseudotype titer enhancement in an additive manner. Human lymphoblastoid cell line (Raji), a poor host for HCV pseudotype infection, exhibited a four- to sixfold enhancement of pseudotype-mediated cell death upon incubation with antibody at nonneutralizing concentrations. A similar enhancement of cell culture-grown HCV infectivity by a human monoclonal antibody was also observed. Taken together, antibodies to viral epitopes enhancing HCV infection need to be taken into consideration for pathogenesis and in the development of an effective vaccine.","Meyer, Keith; Ait-Goughoulte, Malika; Keck, Zhen-Yong; Foung, Steven; Ray, Ranjit",Journal of virology,705,1

METHODS: Longitudinal cohort study. We included 245 adult patients monitored with an ICM indicated for the investigation of syncope. The records from days 1 to 12 March 2020 (prior to the institution of lockdown by the state government) with days 16 to 28 March 2020 were compared. RESULTS: Daily physical exercise reduced markedly after the imposition of lockdown (132 [55-233] minutes vs. 78 [21-154] minutes). The mean daytime HR prior to lockdown was 77 [69-85] bpm, whereas during lockdown it was 74 [66-81] bpm. During the lockdown period, a drop in the variability in heart rate (114 [94-136] ms vs. 111 [92-133] ms) was observed. Although the incidence of AF was similar over both periods, the daily AF burden was significantly higher post-lockdown (405 [391-425] minutes vs. 423 [423-537] minutes). No differences in the number of other arrhythmias were found. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of mandatory lockdown has led to a marked drop in daily physical activity in this population which probably explains changes observed in other cardiac biometric variables. Although, in the short term, we have not documented an increased risk of arrhythmia, we cannot rule out an effect in the medium to long term or in other populations of at-risk patients.","Francisco-Pascual, Jaume; Rivas-Gándara, Núria; Santos-Ortega, Alba; Pérez-Rodón, Jordi; Benito, Begoña; Belahnech, Yassin; Ferreira-González, Ignacio",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),705,10

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether NAC in high doses can avoid respiratory failure in patients with Covid-19. METHODS: It was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, unicentric trial, conducted at the Emergency Department of Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, Brazil. We enrolled 135 patients with severe Covid-19 (confirmed or suspected), with an oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 94% or respiratory rate higher than 24 breaths/min. Patients were randomized to receive NAC 21 g (approximately 300 mg/kg) for 20 hours, or dextrose 5%. Primary endpoint was the need for mechanical ventilation. Secondary endpoints were time of mechanical ventilation, admission to ICU, time in ICU, and mortality. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were very similar in the two groups, with no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, medicines taken, and disease severity. Also, groups were similar in laboratory tests and chest CT scan findings.

METHODS: We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia during and after the epidemic peak in China, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We used the estimated incidence of disease in China, using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases, and an age specific deterministic model to model the epidemic in each scenario. RESULTS: The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well, predicting 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date, however we did not account for imported cases from other countries. The modelled impact without a travel ban results in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths, if the epidemic remained localised to China and no importations from other countries occurred. The full travel ban reduced cases by about 86%, while the impact of a partial lifting of the ban is minimal, and may be a policy option. CONCLUSIONS: Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia during the epidemic peak in China and averted a much larger epidemic at a time when COVID-19 was largely localised to China. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of travel bans applied to countries with high disease incidence. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.","Costantino, Valentina; Heslop, David J; MacIntyre, C Raina",J. travel med,705,16

People were admitted to hospitals complaining of fever, fatigue, cough, and difficulty breathing. Consequently, the strategy being adopted to limit the spread of COVID-19 is to encourage people in society to follow preventive measures. We aimed to estimate how the knowledge of and compliance with safe distancing measures affected the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia during Holy Ramadan. A cross-sectional survey was implemented in the central regions of Saudi Arabia from 24th of April to 22nd May to coincide with Ramadan. The study was conducted using a Google forum distributed through social media. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling of the Saudi population. In total, 1515 participants completed the survey. A significant difference between males and females was observed in answering questions about committing to: not attending gatherings, keeping a safe distance, not making physical contact, and staying at home during partial lockdown. In general, participants in our study demonstrated excellent adherence to all social distance measures, considered essential for limiting the spread and progression of COVID-19. However, attitudes regarding reduced physical contact was poor in the Makkah region, which necessitates greater efforts to educate and inform people about the associated risks.","Alotaibi, Nouf; Almutairi, Sattam; Alotaibi, Moawad; Alotaibi, Mishal M; Alsufian, Tahani",J. community health,705,20

We assessed published cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence, characterizing the hallmarks of reinfecting sequences and the rate of viral evolution in persistent infection. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed was conducted to identify cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection and persistence with available sequences. Nucleotide and amino acid changes in the reinfecting sequence were compared to both the initial and contemporaneous community variants. Time-measured phylogenetic reconstruction was performed to compare intra-host viral evolution in persistent SARS-CoV-2 to community-driven evolution. RESULTS: Twenty reinfection and nine persistent infection cases were identified. Reports of reinfection cases spanned a broad distribution of ages, baseline health status, reinfection severity, and occurred as early as 1.5 months or >8 months after the initial infection. The reinfecting viral sequences had a median of 17.5 nucleotide changes with enrichment in the ORF8 and N genes. The number of changes did not differ by the severity of reinfection and reinfecting variants were similar to the contemporaneous sequences circulating in the community. Patients with persistent COVID-19 demonstrated more rapid accumulation of sequence changes than seen with community-driven evolution with continued evolution during convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibody treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Reinfecting SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes largely mirror contemporaneous circulating sequences in that geographic region, while persistent COVID-19 has been largely described in immunosuppressed individuals and is associated with accelerated viral evolution.","Choudhary, Manish C; Crain, Charles R; Qiu, Xueting; Hanage, William; Li, Jonathan Z",Clin. infect. dis,705,24

Since the disease course is governed by important epidemiological parameters, including containment delays (time between symptom onset and mandatory isolation) and serial intervals (time between symptom onsets of infector-infectee pairs), understanding their temporal changes helps to guide interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the epidemiology of the first two epidemic waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong by doing the following: (1) estimating the containment delays, serial intervals, effective reproductive number (Rt), and proportion of asymptomatic cases; (2) identifying factors associated with the temporal changes of the containment delays and serial intervals; and (3) depicting COVID-19 transmission by age assortativity and types of social settings. METHODS: We retrieved the official case series and the Apple mobility data of Hong Kong from January-August 2020. The empirical containment delays and serial intervals were fitted to theoretical distributions, and factors associated with their temporal changes were quantified in terms of percentage contribution (the percentage change in the predicted outcome from multivariable regression models relative to a predefined comparator). Rt was estimated with the best fitted distribution for serial intervals. RESULTS: The two epidemic waves were characterized by imported cases and clusters of local cases, respectively. Rt peaked at 2.39 (wave 1) and 3.04 (wave 2). The proportion of asymptomatic cases decreased from 34.9% (0-9 years) to 12.9% (&#8805;80 years). Log-normal distribution best fitted the 1574 containment delays (mean 5.18 [SD 3.04] days) and the 558 serial intervals (17 negative; mean 4.74 [SD 4.24] days). Containment delays decreased with involvement in a cluster (percentage contribution: 10.08%-20.73%) and case detection in the public health care sector (percentage contribution: 27.56%, 95% CI 22.52%-32.33%). Serial intervals decreased over time (6.70 days in wave 1 versus 4.35 days in wave 2) and with tertiary transmission or beyond (percentage contribution: -50.75% to -17.31%), but were lengthened by mobility (percentage contribution: 0.83%). Transmission within the same age band was high (18.1%). Households (69.9%) and social settings (20.3%) were where transmission commonly occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First, the factors associated with reduced containment delays suggested government-enacted interventions were useful for achieving outbreak control and should be further encouraged. Second, the shorter serial intervals associated with the composite mobility index calls for empirical surveys to disentangle the role of different contact dimensions in disease transmission. Third, the presymptomatic transmission and asymptomatic cases underscore the importance of remaining vigilant about COVID-19. Fourth, the time-varying epidemiological parameters suggest the need to incorporate their temporal variations when depicting the epidemic trajectory. Fifth, the high proportion of transmission events occurring within the same age group supports the ban on gatherings outside of households, and underscores the need for residence-centered preventive measures.","Kwok, Kin On; Wei, Wan In; Huang, Ying; Kam, Kai Man; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Riley, Steven; Chan, Ho Hin Henry; Hui, David Shu Cheong; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan; Yeoh, Eng Kiong",J Med Internet Res,705,12

However, the mechanisms of toxic action of ACO remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the cardiac effects of ACO and mesaconitine (MACO), a structurally related analog of ACO identified in Aconitum with undocumented cardiotoxicity in guinea pigs. We showed that intravenous administration of ACO or MACO (25 µg/kg) to guinea pigs caused various types of arrhythmias in electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, including ventricular premature beats (VPB), atrioventricular blockade (AVB), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). MACO displayed more potent arrhythmogenic effect than ACO. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recording in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, and observed that treatment with ACO (0.3, 3 µM) or MACO (0.1, 0.3 µM) depolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP) and reduced the action potential amplitude (APA) and durations (APDs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ACO- and MACO-induced AP remodeling was largely abolished by an INa blocker tetrodotoxin (2 µM) and partly abolished by a specific Na+/K+ pump (NKP) blocker ouabain (0.1 µM). Furthermore, we observed that treatment with ACO or MACO attenuated NKP current (INa/K) and increased peak INa by accelerating the sodium channel activation with the EC50 of 8.36 ± 1.89 and 1.33 ± 0.16 µM, respectively. Incubation of ventricular myocytes with ACO or MACO concentration-dependently increased intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates strong arrhythmogenic effects of ACO and MACO resulted from increasing the peak INa via accelerating sodium channel activation and inhibiting the INa/K. These results may help to improve our understanding of cardiotoxic mechanisms of ACO and MACO, and identify potential novel therapeutic targets for Aconitum poisoning.","Wang, Xiang-Chong; Jia, Qing-Zhong; Yu, Yu-Lou; Wang, Han-Dong; Guo, Hui-Cai; Ma, Xin-di; Liu, Chun-Tong; Chen, Xue-Yan; Miao, Qing-Feng; Guan, Bing-Cai; Su, Su-Wen; Wei, He-Ming; Wang, Chuan",Acta pharmacol.

Public health jurisdictions report information, including pregnancy status, on confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases to CDC through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.* Through the Surveillance for Emerging Threats to Mothers and Babies Network (SET-NET), 16 jurisdictions collected supplementary information on pregnancy and infant outcomes among 5,252 women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported during March 29-October 14, 2020. Among 3,912 live births with known gestational age, 12.9% were preterm (<37 weeks), higher than the reported 10.2% among the general U.S. population in 2019 (4). Among 610 infants (21.3%) with reported SARS-CoV-2 test results, perinatal infection was infrequent (2.6%) and occurred primarily among infants whose mother had SARS-CoV-2 infection identified within 1 week of delivery. Because the majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 reported thus far experienced infection in the third trimester, ongoing surveillance is needed to assess effects of infections in early pregnancy, as well the longer-term outcomes of exposed infants. These findings can inform neonatal testing recommendations, clinical practice, and public health action and can be used by health care providers to counsel pregnant women on the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including preterm births. Pregnant women and their household members should follow recommended infection prevention measures, including wearing a mask, social distancing, and frequent handwashing when going out or interacting with others or if there is a person within the household who has had exposure to COVID-19..","Woodworth, Kate R; Olsen, Emily O039; Malley,; Neelam, Varsha; Lewis, Elizabeth L; Galang, Romeo R; Oduyebo, Titilope; Aveni, Kathryn; Yazdy, Mahsa M; Harvey, Elizabeth; Longcore, Nicole D; Barton, Jerusha; Fussman, Chris; Siebman, Samantha; Lush, Mamie; Patrick, Paul H; Halai, Umme-Aiman; Valencia-Prado, Miguel; Orkis, Lauren; Sowunmi, Similoluwa; Schlosser, Levi; Khuwaja, Salma; Read, Jennifer S; Hall, Aron J; Meaney-Delman, Dana; Ellington, Sascha R; Gilboa, Suzanne M; Tong, Van T",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,705,24

Our approach is based on a mathematical model which tracks the spread of disease among different age groups and across different geographical regions, and we introduce a method to combine age-specific contact data to geographical movement data. As a case study, we model the epidemic in the population of mainland Finland utilizing mobility data from a major telecom operator. Our approach allows to determine which geographical regions and age groups should be targeted first in order to minimize the number of deaths. In the scenarios that we test, we find that distributing vaccines demographically and in an age-descending order is not optimal for minimizing deaths and the burden of disease. Instead, more lives could potentially be saved by using strategies which emphasize high-incidence regions and distribute vaccines in parallel to multiple age groups. The level of emphasis that high-incidence regions should be given depends on the overall transmission rate in the population. This observation highlights the importance of updating the vaccination strategy when the effective reproduction number changes due to the general contact patterns changing and new virus variants entering.","Molla, Jeta; Ch'avez, Alejandro Ponce de Le'on; Hiraoka, Takayuki; Ala-Nissila, Tapio; Kivela, Mikko; Leskela, Lasse",,705,24

The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions regarding the technological instruction and accommodations provided to deaf students in online distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was qualitative in nature and used anonymous, one-to-one semi-structured interviews. In June 2020, we interviewed a convenience sample of deaf students (n = 15) and their instructors (n = 3) and analysed the responses thematically. Upon achieving theme saturation, the thematic structure analysis was finalised. The results revealed five main themes related to deaf students’ experience with online distance learning during COVID-19. The themes are as follows: course content delivered, technology used, delivery method, assessment tools used, and social interactions. Each theme is discussed and compared with the related literature to scientifically encapsulate its suggested dimensions. The interviewed students described their experience of using online technology in both negative and positive terms. Instructors also provided their input to express their experiences during that time. Online distance learning was described as a difficult and challenging experience that lacked efficient communication channels and failed to address the needs of the deaf with respect to the communication medium. The typical course delivery methods were described as challenging, and the lack of social interaction was highlighted as a liability. At the same time, participants acknowledged some ancillary benefits of online distance learning especially that it enhanced their technology skills and their competences in adapting to a new environment.","Alshawabkeh, Abdallah A.; Woolsey, M.

We aimed to verify whether there is an association between the OHCA difference compared with 2019 and the COVID-19 epidemic curve. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included all the consecutive OHCAs which occurred in the Provinces of Lodi, Cremona, Pavia, and Mantova in the 2 months following the first documented case of COVID-19 in the Lombardia Region and compared them with those which occurred in the same time frame in 2019. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 from 21 February to 20 April 2020 in the study territory was 956 COVID-19/100 000 inhabitants and the cumulative incidence of OHCA was 21 cases/100 000 inhabitants, with a 52% increase as compared with 2019 (490 OHCAs in 2020 vs. 321 in 2019). A strong and statistically significant correlation was found between the difference in cumulative incidence of OHCA between 2020 and 2019 per 100 000 inhabitants and the COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 inhabitants both for the overall territory (&#961; 0.87, P < 0.001) and for each province separately (Lodi: &#961; 0.98, P < 0.001; Cremona: &#961; 0.98, P < 0.001; Pavia: &#961; 0.87, P < 0.001; Mantova: &#961; 0.81, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The increase in OHCAs in 2020 is significantly correlated to the COVID-19 pandemic and is coupled with a reduction in short-term outcome.

Although there is consensus regarding the monophyly of the family, the relationships of about 80% of its species, currently included in the genus Corydoras, remain poorly known. Despite the vast amount of osteological information for Teleostei, knowledge regarding the phylogenetic implications of encephalon anatomy is sparse and represents a poorly explored source of potential characters. The present study aims to describe the encephalon morphology in members of the Callichthyidae in order to propose new characters that may help address phylogenetic questions regarding this group. In addition to representatives of Callichthyidae, specimens belonging to the Nematogenyidae, Trichomycteridae, Scoloplacidae, Astroblepidae and Loricariidae were dissected for comparative purposes. Head dissection revealed information on the structure of the medulla spinalis, rhombencephalon, mesencephalon, diencephalon and telencephalon. The conditions observed on the encephalons examined suggest that representatives of Callichthyidae have great taste perception and processing, while Corydoradinae stand out for visual acuity and Callichthyinae for mechanoreception processing subunits.

Yet, their cardiovascular health risks are still unclear. We aimed to summarize the evidence base on this topic by conducting an updated umbrella review. Recent Findings: We identified 7 systematic reviews, totaling 183 studies and reports, ranging from in vitro and in animal studies to clinical studies in apparently healthy volunteers and patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Overall, acute EVC use was associated with several toxic effects at molecular, cellular, tissue, organ, and system level. In addition, EVC impacted adversely on blood pressure (BP) management, caused tachycardia, and worsened arterial stiffness. Finally, EVC use was associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical events, including atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction, even if the causal link is still debated. Most reviews highlighted that the detrimental impact of EVC was of lesser magnitude of that of TCC. In addition, the differential impact of liquids and nicotine was not clearly disentangled. Finally, no review included studies on HNBC. Summary: The present umbrella review suggests that EVC, and likely HNBC, despite clearly causing an increase in overall cardiovascular risk, may represent a temporary lesser evil than TCC in a risk-reduction or risk-modification strategy, aiming for eventual abstinence from all tobacco or nicotine products.","Peruzzi, Mariangela; Biondi-Zoccai, Giuseppe; Carnevale, Roberto; Cavarretta, Elena; Frati, Giacomo; Versaci, Francesco",Curr Emerg Hosp Med Rep,705,1

DNA targeting by these Cas nucleases is restricted by their preferred protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs). The PAM requirement for the most popular Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) is NGG (N = A, T, C, G)7, limiting its targeting scope to GC-rich regions. Here, we demonstrate genome editing at relaxed PAM sites in rice (a monocot) and the Dahurian larch (a coniferous tree), using an engineered SpRY Cas9 variant8. Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis can be readily achieved by SpRY at relaxed PAM sites in the Dahurian larch protoplasts and in rice transgenic lines through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Furthermore, an SpRY-based cytosine base editor was developed and demonstrated by directed evolution of new herbicide resistant OsALS alleles in rice. Similarly, a highly active SpRY adenine base editor was developed based on ABE8e (ref. 9) and SpRY-ABE8e was able to target relaxed PAM sites in rice plants, achieving up to 79% editing efficiency with high product purity. Thus, the SpRY toolbox breaks a PAM restriction barrier in plant genome engineering by enabling DNA editing in a PAM-less fashion. Evidence was also provided for secondary off-target effects by de novo generated single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) due to SpRY-mediated transfer DNA self-editing, which calls for more sophisticated programmes for designing highly specific sgRNAs when implementing the SpRY genome editing toolbox.","Ren, Qiurong; Sretenovic, Simon; Liu, Shishi; Tang, Xu; Huang, Lan; He, Yao; Liu, Li; Guo, Yachong; Zhong, Zhaohui; Liu, Guanqing; Cheng, Yanhao; Zheng, Xuelian; Pan, Changtian; Yin, Desuo; Zhang, Yingxiao; Li, Wanfeng; Qi, Liwang; Li, Chenghao; Qi, Yiping; Zhang, Yong",Nat Plants,705,1

However, vitamin D levels are associated with many confounding variables, and thus associations described to date may not be causal. Vitamin D Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have provided results that are concordant with large-scale vitamin D randomized trials. Here, we used 2-sample MR to assess evidence supporting a causal effect of circulating 25OHD levels on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Genetic variants strongly associated with 25OHD levels in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 443,734 participants of European ancestry (including 401,460 from the UK Biobank) were used as instrumental variables. GWASs of COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, and severe disease from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative were used as outcome GWASs. These included up to 14,134 individuals with COVID-19, and up to 1,284,876 without COVID-19, from up to 11 countries. SARS-CoV-2 positivity was determined by laboratory testing or medical chart review. Population controls without COVID-19 were also included in the control groups for all outcomes, including hospitalization and severe disease. Analyses were restricted to individuals of European descent when possible. Using inverse-weighted MR, genetically increased 25OHD levels by 1 standard deviation on the logarithmic scale had no significant association with COVID-19 susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95; 95% CI 0.84, 1.08; p = 0.44), hospitalization (OR = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.33; p = 0.41), and severe disease (OR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.77, 1.22; p = 0.77). We used an additional 6 meta-analytic methods, as well as conducting sensitivity analyses after removal of variants at risk of horizontal pleiotropy, and obtained similar results. These results may be limited by weak instrument bias in some analyses. Further, our results do not apply to individuals with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: In this 2-sample MR study, we did not observe evidence to support an association between 25OHD levels and COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, or hospitalization.

Considering that glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) is involved in cellular detoxification, it may play an important role in susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or its outcome. In the present study, the association between the Ile105Val GSTP1 polymorphism (rs1695) and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its outcome was investigated. Data on the prevalence (per 10 6people), case-fatality (per 100 infected cases), and mortality (per 10 6people) of COVID-19 and various potential confounders (the life expectancy at birth, density of medical doctors, density of nursing and midwifery personnel, and the gross national income per capita) were used. The latest data available for 45 countries were used for the study. Results: In multivariate linear regression analyses, the Val105 allelic frequency showed positive association with the log-prevalence (partial r = 0.308, p = 0.042) and log-mortality of COVID-19 (partial r = 0.316, p = 0.037). The log-fatality did not show association with the allelic frequency. In the next step, only countries with the gross national income per capita more than $15,000 were included in the analysis. In the selected countries, the frequency of Val105 was positively associated with the log-prevalence (partial r = 0.456, p = 0.009) and log-mortality of COVID-19 (partial r = 0.544, p = 0.001).

Challenges arise concerning how to optimally support the immune system in the general population, especially under self-confinement. An optimal immune response depends on an adequate diet and nutrition in order to keep infection at bay. For example, sufficient protein intake is crucial for optimal antibody production. Low micronutrient status, such as of vitamin A or zinc, has been associated with increased infection risk. Frequently, poor nutrient status is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn can impact the immune system. Dietary constituents with especially high anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capacity include vitamin C, vitamin E, and phytochemicals such as carotenoids and polyphenols. Several of these can interact with transcription factors such as NF-kB and Nrf-2, related to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. Vitamin D in particular may perturb viral cellular infection via interacting with cell entry receptors (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), ACE2. Dietary fiber, fermented by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, has also been shown to produce anti-inflammatory effects. In this review, we highlight the importance of an optimal status of relevant nutrients to effectively reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby strengthening the immune system during the COVID-19 crisis.","Iddir, Mohammed; Brito, Alex; Dingeo, Giulia; Fernandez Del Campo, Sofia Sosa; Samouda, Hanen; La Frano, Michael R; Bohn, Torsten",Nutrients,705,16

However, the continuous flow pattern in FCV during inspiration and expiration has a significant impact on respiratory parameters and ventilatory settings compared to conventional ventilation modes. In addition, the constant flow combined with direct intratracheal pressure measurement allows determination of dynamic compliance and ventilation settings can be adjusted accordingly, reflecting a personalized ventilation approach. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year old women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was admitted to a tertiary medical center. Initial ventilation occurred with best standard of care pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) and was then switched to FCV, by adopting PCV ventilator settings. This led to an increase in oxygenation by 30 %. Subsequently, to reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation, FCV was individualized by dynamic compliance guided adjustment of both, positive end-expiratory pressure and peak pressure; this intervention reduced driving pressure from 18 to 12 cm H2O. However, after several hours, compliance further deteriorated which resulted in a tidal volume of only 4.7 ml/kg. CONCLUSIONS: An individualized FCV approach increased oxygenation parameters in a patient suffering from severe COVID-19 related ARDS. Direct intratracheal pressure measurements allow for determination of dynamic compliance and thus optimization of ventilator settings, thereby reducing applied and dissipated energy. However, although desirable, this personalized ventilation strategy may reach its limits when lung function is so severely impaired that patient's oxygenation has to be ensured at the expense of lung protective ventilation concepts.","Spraider, Patrick; Putzer, Gabriel; Breitkopf, Robert; Abram, Julia; Mathis, Simon; Glodny, Bernhard; Martini, Judith",BMC Anesthesiol,705,18

X-ray images, computed tomography (CT) images and test kits (RT-PCR) are three easily available options for predicting this infection. Compared to the screening of COVID-19 infection from X-ray and CT images, the test kits(RT-PCR) available to diagnose COVID-19 face problems such as high analytical time, high false negative outcomes, poor sensitivity and specificity. Radiological signatures that X-rays can detect have been found in COVID-19 positive patients. Radiologists may examine these signatures, but it's a time-consuming and error-prone process (riddled with intra-observer variability). Thus, the chest X-ray analysis process needs to be automated, for which AI-driven tools have proven to be the best choice to increase accuracy and speed up analysis time, especially in the case of medical image analysis.

Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) comprise of 70 inherited inborn errors of metabolism. Affected individuals suffer from multi-systemic involvement with variable severity and rate of disease progression between different diseases. Some of the LSDs have established treatments, whether parenteral or oral therapies. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic together with the lockdown on the wellbeing and medical management of patients with rare diseases, such as LSDs, is widely unknown. Herein, we describe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated mandatory home lockdown on patients with LSDs in Israel. RESULTS: We present a prospective multi-center questionnaire study including 48 LSD patients from four medical centers in Israel. The study objective was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on individuals with LSDs in Israel, as reported by their caregivers. Secondary objectives were to assess the morbidity from SARS CoV-2 in LSD patients and the impact of changes in mood and behavior on compliance to treatment and to assess the relationship between changes in mood to changes in cognition and behavior. Thirty one of 38 patients (82%) who received any kind of regular treatment did not miss treatments. Among patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in the in-hospital setting, 5 patients (20%) experienced treatment disruptions. Four patients had tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 virus infection by PCR. Seven out of the 48 patients (14%) described mood changes with cognitive and motor deterioration during the home quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: We observed high rates of treatment adherence and low morbidity through the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with LSDs in Israel.

They play a role in innate and adaptive immunity and are targets for various bacterial and viral adhesins. Two pathogens that colonize the normally sterile lower respiratory tract in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and Moraxella catarrhalis. Both pathogens bind to CEACAMs and elicit a variety of cellular reactions, including bacterial internalization, cell adhesion and apoptosis. METHODS: To analyze the (co-) expression of CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in different lung tissues with respect to COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration, immunohistochemically stained paraffin sections of 19 donors were studied. To address short-term effects of cigarette smoke and acute inflammation, transcriptional regulation of CEACAM5, CEACAM6 and different CEACAM1 isoforms by cigarette smoke extract, interferons, Toll-like receptor agonists, and bacteria was tested in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells by quantitative PCR. Corresponding CEACAM protein levels were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of lung sections showed the most frequent and intense staining for CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in bronchial and alveolar epithelium, but revealed no significant differences in connection with COPD, smoking status and granulocyte infiltration. In NHBE cells, mRNA expression of CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3L and CEACAM1-3S were up-regulated by interferons alpha, beta and gamma, as well as the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Interferon-gamma also increased CEACAM5 expression. These results were confirmed on protein level by FACS analysis. Importantly, also NTHI and M. catarrhalis increased CEACAM1 mRNA levels. This effect was independent of the ability to bind to CEACAM1. The expression of CEACAM6 was not affected by any treatment or bacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: While we did not find a direct correlation between CEACAM1 expression and COPD, the COPD-associated bacteria NTHi and M. catarrhalis were able to increase the expression of their own receptor on host cells. Further, the data suggest a role for CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 in the phenomenon of increased host susceptibility to bacterial infection upon viral challenge in the human respiratory tract.","Klaile, Esther; Klassert, Tilman E; Scheffrahn, Inka; Müller, Mario M; Heinrich, Annina; Heyl, Kerstin A; Dienemann, Hendrik; Grünewald, Christiane; Bals, Robert; Singer, Bernhard B; Slevogt, Hortense",Respir Res,705,30

METHODS (CASE DESCRIPTION): On March 16, 2020, the state government of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, determined that a neurosurgical center with 44 ICU beds equipped with mechanical ventilators should immediately transfer all patients with neurological conditions to other institutions and prepare for patients who were critically ill with COVID-19. The staff, including physical therapists, were trained to handle patients with COVID-19, many of whom were developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with complex and multifactorial ventilatory support needs. Adjustments were made to the physical therapy routine and protocols. Following the stabilization of patients’ respiratory condition, physical therapist interventions focused on restoring physical function. RESULTS: A total of 116 confirmed COVID-19 cases were treated from March 17 to May 17, 2020. Sixty percent were men (70) and 40% were women (46), with a median age of 59 years. Eighty-nine percent (103) underwent mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, of which 11% (11) were successfully extubated. Thirty percent (31) of patients underwent tracheostomy, and 26% of those (8) were successfully decannulated. Of the total patients, 57 patients died (mortality rate of 49%), 4 (3%) were transferred to another institution, 23 (20%) were discharged home, and 32 (28%) continued to be hospitalized. CONCLUSION: Physical therapists in the ICU can facilitate care for critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training. IMPACT: The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of physical therapists, specifically in the care of patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. The availability and expertise of physical therapists in the ICU are important for managing critical events such as intubation, patient positioning, ventilatory adjustments, extubation, and functional training.","Gaspari, Clara H; Assumpção, Iana; Freire, Renata; Silva, Ariane; Santiso, Cintia; Jaccoud, Anna Carolina",Phys Ther,705,5

In line with this notion, early case series reported high mortality rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with malignancy. However, subsequent large prospective epidemiological surveys indicate that the risk for severe COVID-19 may be largely attributed to the multiple confounders operating in this highly heterogeneous population of patients rather than the cancer or its treatment per se. In this viewpoint, we critically discuss the conundrums of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients and underscore mechanistic insights on the outcome of COVID-19 as it relates to cancer therapy and the type and status of the underlying malignancy. We emphasize the concept that not all cancer patients are at similarly high-risk for a complicated COVID-19 course and the need to develop a roadmap of translational and clinical research on COVID-19 in this challenging group of patients.","Chamilos, Georgios; Lionakis, Michail S; Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P",Clin Infect Dis,705,13

This paucity of information may have led to the heterogeneity of treatment protocols and misinterpretation of available findings. GCs are agonist compounds that bind to the GC receptor (GR) producing a pharmacological response. Clinical efficacy depends on the magnitude and duration of exposure to GR. We updated the meta-analysis of randomized trials investigating GC treatment in ARDS, focusing on treatment protocols and response. We synthesized the current literature on the role of the GR in GC therapy including genomic and non-genomic effects, and integrated current clinical pharmacology knowledge of various GCs, including hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. This review addresses the role dosage, timing of initiation, mode of administration, duration, and tapering play in achieving optimal response to GC therapy in ARDS. Based on RCTs’ findings, GC plasma concentration–time profiles, and pharmacodynamic studies, optimal results are most likely achievable with early intervention, an initial bolus dose to achieve close to maximal GRα saturation, followed by a continuous infusion to maintain high levels of response throughout the treatment period. In addition, patients receiving similar GC doses may experience substantial between-patient variability in plasma concentrations affecting clinical response. GC should be dose-adjusted and administered for a duration targeting clinical and laboratory improvement, followed by dose-tapering to achieve gradual recovery of the suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. These findings have practical clinical relevance. Future RCTs should consider these pharmacological principles in the study design and interpretation of findings.

Chest CT scan may be helpful in early diagnosing of COVID-19. We investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CT using RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 as reference standard and investigated reasons for discordant results between the two tests. METHODS: In this prospective single centre study in the Netherlands, all adult symptomatic ED patients had both a CT scan and a RT-PCR upon arrival at the ED. CT results were compared with PCR test(s). Diagnostic accuracy was calculated. Discordant results were investigated using discharge diagnoses. RESULTS: Between March 13(th) and March 24(th) 2020, 193 symptomatic ED patients were included. In total, 43.0% of patients had a positive PCR and 56.5% a positive CT, resulting in a sensitivity of 89.2%, specificity 68.2%, likelihood ratio (LR)+ 2.81 and LR- 0.16. Sensitivity was higher in patients with high risk pneumonia (CURB-65 score ≥3; n = 17, 100%) and with sepsis (SOFA score ≥2; n = 137, 95.5%). Of the 35 patients (31.8%) with a suspicious CT and a negative RT-PCR, 9 had another respiratory viral pathogen, and in 7 patients, COVID-19 was considered likely. One of nine patients with a non-suspicious CT and a positive PCR had developed symptoms within 48 hours before scanning. DISCUSSION: The accuracy of chest CT in symptomatic ED patients is high, but used as a single diagnostic test, CT can not safely diagnose or exclude COVID-19. However, CT can be used as a quick tool to categorize patients into “probably positive” and “probably negative” cohorts.","Gietema, Hester A.; Zelis, Noortje; Nobel, J. Martijn; Lambriks, Lars J.

Cancer patients, in particular, are vulnerable and oncology departments drastically needed to modify their care systems and established new priorities. We evaluated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the activity of a single cancer center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of (i) volumes of oncological activities (2020 vs 2019), (ii) patients’ perception rate of the preventive measures, (iii) patients’ SARS-CoV-2 infections, clinical signs thereof, and (iv) new diagnoses made during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: As compared with a similar time frame in 2019, the overall activity in total numbers of outpatient chemotherapy administrations and specialist visits was not statistically different (P = .961 and P = .252), while inpatient admissions decreased for both medical oncology and thoracic oncology (18% (P = .0018) and 44% (P < .0001), respectively). Cancer diagnosis plummeted (−34%), but no stage shift could be demonstrated. Acceptance and adoption of hygienic measures was high, as measured by a targeted questionnaire (>85%). However, only 46.2% of responding patients regarded telemedicine, although widely deployed, as an efficient surrogate to a consultation. Thirty-three patients developed SARS-CoV-2, 27 were hospitalized, and 11 died within this time frame. These infected patients were younger, current smokers, and suffered more comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective cohort analysis adds to the evidence that continuation of active cancer therapy and specialist visits is feasible and safe with the implementation of telemedicine. These data further confirm the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on cancer care management, cancer diagnosis, and impact of infection on cancer patients.","Rasschaert, Marika; Vanclooster, Pieterjan; Depauw, Laura; Mertens, Tim; Roelant, Ella; Coenen, Elke; Anguille, Sebastien; Janssens, Annelies; Van Dam, Peter; Peeters, Marc",Cancer Control,705,1
