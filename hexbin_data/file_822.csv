55058,Expression of SARS‐CoV‐2 Viroporins Triggers Cardiac Arrhythmia,2021-05-14,"Trillions of microbes exist in the human body, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, coevolved with the host in a mutually beneficial relationship. The main role of the intestinal microbiome is the fermentation of non-digestible substrates and increased growth of beneficial microbes that produce key antimicrobial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, etc., to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microbes besides other functions. Intestinal microbiota can prevent pathogen colonization through the mechanism of colonization resistance. A wide range of resistomes are present in both beneficial and pathogenic microbes. Giving antibiotic exposure to the intestinal microbiome (both beneficial and hostile) can trigger a resistome response, affecting colonization resistance. The following review provides a mechanistic overview of the intestinal microbiome and the impacts of antibiotic therapy on pathogen colonization and diseases. Further, we also discuss the epidemiology of immunocompromised patients who are at high risk for nosocomial infections, colonization and decolonization of multi-drug resistant organisms in the intestine, and the direct and indirect mechanisms that govern colonization resistance to the pathogens.","Shah, Taif; Baloch, Zulqarnain; Shah, Zahir; Cui, Xiuming; Xia, Xueshan",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8235228/,822
60815,"A SARS-CoV-2 Peptide Spectral Library Enables Rapid, Sensitive Identification of Virus Peptides in Complex Biological Samples.",2021-03-08,"Corona virus disease 2019 started in December 2019 as an outbreak of unexplained pneumonias in Wuhan, a city in Hubei province of China. This illness emerged as an epidemic in China and later spread to almost all countries over the globe except Antarctica. This is caused by a beta Corona virus, which is genetically similar to SARS virus. The predominant mode of transmission is via droplet spread, when the infected person coughs, sneezes or talks the virus is released in the respiratory secretions. As there are only a few cases of COVID 19 in neonates, there is no convincing evidence to support the possibility of vertical transmission. Clinical presentation in neonates is nonspecific, commonly observed are temperature instability, respiratory distress, poor feeding, lethargy, vomiting and diarrhea. Laboratory examinations may be nonspecific. Definitive test for 2019-nCoV is the detection of viral nucleic acid by real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Suspected and confirmed COVID positive mothers should be delivered in separate delivery rooms and operation theaters. Since there is no approved treatment or drug for this disease, prevention of infection and breaking the chain of transmission plays a crucial role.","Kallem, Venkat Reddy; Sharma, Deepak","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1759542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419544/,822

In this study, we compared the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of recombinant proteins corresponding to different domains of the SARS-coronavirus spike protein. Trimeric recombinant proteins were created by fusing the foldon domain derived from T4 bacteriophage to the carboxy-termini of individual domains of the spike protein. While the full-length ectodomain (S) of the spike protein, the full-length ectodomain fused to foldon (S-foldon), the S1 domain (S1), S1-foldon, and the S2 domain(S2) antigens all elicited comparable antibody titers as measured by ELISA, S-foldon induced a significantly higher titer of neutralizing antibody and S2 protein did not elicit virus neutralizing antibodies.

DESIGN Cross-sectional on-line survey conducted between 24 April and 22 July 2020. SETTING Twenty-one European countries. PARTICIPANTS A total of 31 964 adults reporting past-year drinking. MEASUREMENTS Changes in alcohol consumption were measured by asking respondents about changes over the previous month in their drinking frequency, the quantity they consumed and incidence of heavy episodic drinking events. Individual indicators were combined into an aggregated consumption-change score and scaled to a possible range of -1 to +1. Using this score as the outcome, multi-level linear regressions tested changes in overall drinking, taking into account sampling weights and baseline alcohol consumption [Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT-C)] and country of residence serving as random intercept. Similar models were conducted for each single consumption-change indicator. FINDINGS The aggregated consumption-change score indicated an average decrease in alcohol consumption of -0.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.18, -0.10]. Statistically significant decreases in consumption were found in all countries, except Ireland (-0.08, 95% CI = -0.17, 0.01) and the United Kingdom (+0.10, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.17). Decreases in drinking were mainly driven by a reduced frequency of heavy episodic drinking events (-0.17, 95% CI = -0.20, -0.14). Declines in consumption were less marked among those with low- or average incomes and those experiencing distress. CONCLUSIONS On average, alcohol consumption appears to have declined during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Both reduced availability of alcohol and increased distress may have affected consumption, although the former seems to have had a greater impact in terms of immediate effects.","Kilian, Carolin; Rehm, Jürgen; Allebeck, Peter; Braddick, Fleur; Gual, Antoni; Barták, Miroslav; Bloomfield, Kim; Gil, Artyom; Neufeld, Maria; O'Donnell, Amy; Petruželka, Benjamin; Rogalewicz, Vladimir; Schulte, Bernd; Manthey, Jakob",Addiction,https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109685/,822
94393,SARS-CoV-2 safety: Guidelines for shielding frontline nurses.,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare workers increasingly encounter serious ethical issues that negatively affect their professionalism. PURPOSE The study aims to examine the ethical sensitivity levels of physicians and nurses working in surgical units during the Covid-19 pandemic and the associating factors. METHOD The sample of this cross-sectional online questionnaire-based study consists of 161 healthcare workers working at the surgical units in Turkish hospitals. The data were collected using the ""Nurse Descriptive Information Form"" developed by the researchers and the ""Ethical Sensitivity Questionnaire."" ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Approval was granted by the ethics committee. Verbal and written consent was received from the healthcare workers. RESULTS Ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict was found to be higher in healthcare workers who had ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, who were married, who were nurses, who worked more than 45 h, and who had a work experience of 7-10 years (p < 0.05). Healthcare workers with a family member diagnosed with Covid-19 had high ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict (p = 0.008), while those who reported being fully competent and ready (p = 0.038) about Covid-19 were found to have low ethical sensitivity. Besides, those who experienced inadequate supplies (p = 0.045), long working hours (p = 0.038), and problems in asepsis-sterilization (p = 0.046) during the Covid-19 pandemic were found to have low sensitivity in the holistic approach dimension. CONCLUSION The study revealed that ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge-skills about Covid-19, and the problems encountered in the work environment during the pandemic affect the ethical sensitivity of healthcare workers in the dimensions of conflict and holistic approach. Therefore, it is recommended that governments and all healthcare workers, and stakeholders in the health system in our country and other countries take action to promote ethical sensitivity in response to the rapidly increasing epidemic by considering the factors that adversely affect ethical sensitivity.","Mert, Selda; Sayilan, Aylin Aydin; Karatoprak, Ayfer Peker; Baydemir, Canan",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/09697330211003231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910398/,822
104193,Bispecific IgG neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants and prevents escape in mice.,2021-03-25,"The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) since December 2019 forced Intensive Care Units to face high numbers of patients admitted simultaneously with limited resources. COVID-19 critically ill patients, especially those on mechanical ventilators, demand special attention as they can develop potential complications with critical hemodynamic and respiratory consequences. Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS) might have important roles in assessing the critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patient. Mostly, lung ultrasound has been presented as having a role in diagnosis and monitoring, but airway examination and hemodynamic evaluation are of interest also. We propose an A.B.C. POCUS approach focusing on A-airway (orotracheal intubation), B-breathing (interstitial syn-dromes, pneumothorax, atelectasis, pneumonia), and C-circulation (cardiac function, pulmonary embolism, volume status, deep veins thrombosis). This A.B.C. approach has emerged during ICU care for 22 adult COVID-19 critically ill patients, along with the analysis of recent papers describing ultrasound in COVID-19 patients including the use of ultrasound that is currently applied in the management of the general critically ill population. This A.B.C- POCUS algorithm parallels the well-established clinical A.B.C. algorithms. There are few extensive ultrasonographic studies in COVID-19 critically ill patients up to now, but techniques extrapolated from non-COVID studies seem reasonable even though comparative studies are not available yet.","Simon, Robert; Petrișor, Cristina; Bodolea, Constantin; Csipak, Gabriela; Oancea, Cristian; Golea, Adela",Medical ultrasonography,https://doi.org/10.11152/mu-2733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245734/,822
112687,Mutation-specific SARS-CoV-2 PCR Screen: Rapid and Accurate Detection of Variants of Concern and the Identification of a Newly Emerging Variant with Spike L452R Mutation.,2021-05-19,"The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein plays an essential role in virion assembly via interactions with the large, positive-strand RNA viral genome and the carboxy-terminal endodomain of the membrane protein (M). To learn about the functions of N protein domains in the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we replaced the MHV N gene with its counterpart from the closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV). The resulting viral mutant was severely defective, even though individual domains of the N protein responsible for N-RNA, N-M, or N-N interactions were completely interchangeable between BCoV and MHV. The lesion in the BCoV N substitution mutant could be compensated for by reverting mutations in the central, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) domain of the N protein. Surprisingly, a second class of reverting mutations were mapped to the amino terminus of a replicase subunit, nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). A similarly defective MHV N mutant bearing an insertion of the SR region from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus N protein was rescued by the same two classes of reverting mutations. Our genetic results were corroborated by the demonstration that the expressed amino-terminal segment of nsp3 bound selectively to N protein from infected cells, and this interaction was RNA independent. Moreover, we found a direct correlation between the N-nsp3 interaction and the ability of N protein to stimulate the infectivity of transfected MHV genomic RNA (gRNA). Our results suggest a role for this previously unknown N-nsp3 interaction in the localization of genomic RNA to the replicase complex at an early stage of infection.","Hurst, Kelley R; Ye, Rong; Goebel, Scott J; Jayaraman, Priya; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01287-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660183/,822

We report our institution's experience treating AT-IVC using endovascular methods. METHODS A 10-year retrospective review of patients presenting with symptomatic IVC thrombosis between the years 2005 and 2014 was performed. Demographic data, treatment modalities, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS Twenty-five patients (44% men) underwent treatment for acute (<2 weeks) symptomatic IVC thrombosis. Presenting symptoms included pain and limb swelling in 23 (92%), motor dysfunction in 16 (64%), sensory loss in 14 (56%), and pulmonary embolism (PE) in 2 (8%) patients. Phlegmasia cerulea dolens was present in 5 patients, a history of malignancy was identified in 7 patients, and 21 patients had an IVC filter at presentation (Trapease 12, G2X 3, Option 2, Eclipse 2, Meridian 2). Four patients had a documented hypercoagulable state, 21 patients underwent venous angioplasty, and 7 (28%) patients underwent venous stenting of the IVC or iliofemoral veins. Significant (>50% luminal gain) angiographic resolution of venous thrombus was achieved in all 25 patients. Twenty-one (84%) patients reported moderate-to-complete symptomatic improvement immediately after completion of the procedures. Two patients had a clinically symptomatic PE and 1 patient underwent an above-knee amputation secondary to venous gangrene. Other complications included 6 minor bleeding complications (2 local hematoma, 4 hematuria) all of which resolved spontaneously. There were 2 major bleeding complications (1 disseminated intravascular coagulation, 1 retroperitoneal hematoma). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of AT-IVC, regardless of etiology, is safe and effective with excellent short-term clinical results. An aggressive endovascular approach to treatment of AT-IVC is warranted even in the presence of a thrombosed vena cava filter.","Nagarsheth, Khanjan H; Sticco, Charles; Aparajita, Ritu; Schor, Jonathan; Singh, Kuldeep; Zia, Saqib; Deitch, Jonathan",Annals of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2015.04.076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26130433/,822

To test the hypothesis that host factors, including age and sex, play a role in determining the effect of repeat vaccination and levels of pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza, we evaluated pre- and post-vaccination strain-specific hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers in adults over 75 years of age who received a high-dose influenza vaccine in at least four out of six influenza seasons (NCT02200276). Neither age, sex, body mass index, frailty, nor repeat vaccination were significantly associated with post-vaccination HAI titer outcomes. Pre-vaccination titers, however, were significantly predictive of post-vaccination outcomes. Pre-vaccination titers to H1N1 remained constant with age, while those to H3N2 and influenza B decreased substantially with age in males but not in females. Our findings highlight the importance of pre-existing immunity in this highly vaccinated older adult population and suggest that older males are particularly vulnerable to reduced pre-existing humoral immunity to influenza from previous annual vaccination.","Shapiro, J.

One of the main bottlenecks for COVID-19 detection is reagent and material shortages for sample collection, preservation, and purification prior to testing. Currently, most authorized diagnostic tests require RNA extraction from patient samples and detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RNA purification is expensive, time consuming, and requires technical expertise to perform. Additionally, there have been reported shortages of the RNA purification kits needed for most tests. With these challenges in mind, we report on extraction-free amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from patient samples. In addition, we have developed a multiplex RT-PCR using the CDC singleplex targets. This multiplex has a limit of detection of 2 copies/L. We have demonstrated these improvements to the current diagnostic workflow, which reduce complexity and cost, minimize reagent usage, expedite time to results, and increase testing capacity.","Byrnes, Samantha A.; Gallagher, Ryan; Steadman, Amy; Bennett, Crissa; Rivera, Rafael; Ortega, Corrie; Motley, S.

Standard methods for assessing autochthonous (local) transmission risk make either indirect estimates based on ecological suitability or direct estimates only after local cases accumulate. However, an overlooked source of epidemiological data that can meaningfully inform risk assessments prior to outbreak emergence is the absence of transmission by imported cases. Here, we present a method for updating a priori ecological estimates of transmission risk using real-time importation data. We demonstrate our method using Zika importation and transmission data from Texas in 2016, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our updated risk estimates are lower than previously reported, with only six counties in Texas likely to sustain a Zika epidemic, and consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017. Importation events can thereby provide critical, early insight into local transmission risks as infectious diseases expand their global reach.","Fox, Spencer J; Bellan, Steven E; Perkins, T Alex; Johansson, Michael A; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/265942,822

There is increasing evidence to suggest Vitamin D deficiency may increase individuals risk of COVID-19 infection and susceptibility. We aimed to determine the relationship between severity of vitamin D deficiency and sufficiency and COVID-19 infection within healthcare workers. Methods: The study included an observational cohort of healthcare workers who isolated due to COVID-19 symptoms from 12th to 22nd May 2020, from the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (UHBFT). This was part of the COVID-19 convalescent immunity study (COCO). Data collected included SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion status, serum 25(OH)D3 levels as well as age, body mass index (BMI), sex, ethnicity, job role, and co-morbidities. Participants were grouped into four vitamin D (VD) categories. 1) Severe VD deficiency (VD <30 nmol/L); 2) VD deficiency (VD > or equal to 30 nmol/L and <50 nmol/L); 3) VD insufficiency (VD > or equal to 50 nmol/L and <75 nmol/L); 4) VD sufficiency (VD > or equal to 75 nmol/L). Results: When VD levels were compared against COVID-19 seropositivity rate, a U-shaped curve was identified in the total population. This trend repeated when split into subgroups of age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, and co-morbidity status. Significant difference was identified in the COVID-19 seropositivity rate between VD groups between multiple VD groups in the total population, males, females, BAME, BMI<30 (kg/m2), 0 and +1 comorbidities; the majority of which were differences when the severely VD deficient category were compared to the other group. A significantly larger proportion of those within the Black, Asian, minority ethnic (BAME) group (vs. white ethnicity) were severely vitamin D deficient (P <0.00001). A significantly higher proportion of the 0-comorbidity subgroup were vitamin D deficient in comparison to the 1+ comorbidity subgroup (P = 0.046). Conclusions: Further investigation of the U-shaped curves is required to determine whether high VD levels can have a detrimental effect on susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. Future randomised clinical trials of VD supplementation could potentially identify optimal VD levels. This would allow for targeted therapeutic treatment for those at-risk such as in the BAME group.","Mackay, W. R.; Lugg, S. T.; Faniyi, A.

This novel pandemic and citywide implemented lockdown measures are affecting virus transmission, people's travel patterns, and air quality. Many studies have been conducted to predict the COVID-19 diffusion, assess the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility and air quality, and assess the impacts of lockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This review study aims to analyze results from past research to understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates that urban form, people's socioeconomic and physical conditions, social cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility and COVID-19 transmission. during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are inclined to use private transportation for necessary travel purposes to mitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also noticed that COVID-19 related lockdown measures significantly improve air quality by reducing the concentration of air pollutants, which in turn improves the COVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory-related sickness and deaths of people. It is argued that ML is a powerful, effective, and robust analytic paradigm to handle complex and wicked problems such as a global pandemic.

Such events often take place indoors when many people come together. Various systems for automated contact tracing (ACT) have been proposed which warn users if they have come near an infected person. These generally fail to detect potential super-spreader events as only users who have come in close contact with the infected person, but not others who also visited the same location, are warned. Other ACT approaches allow users to check into locations, but this requires user interaction. We propose two designs how broadcast-based ACT systems can be enhanced by using location-specific information without the need for GPS traces or scanning of QR codes. This makes it possible to alert attendees of a potential super-spreader event while providing privacy. Our idea relies on cooperating ""lighthouses""which cover a large area and send out pseudonyms.

177798,Reduced serum neutralization capacity against SARS-CoV-2 variants in a multiplex ACE2 RBD competition assay,2021-08-22,"Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are important regulators of the posttranslational protein ubiquitination system. Mammalian genomes encode about hundred different DUBs, which can be grouped into seven different classes. Members of other DUB classes are found in pathogenic bacteria, which use them to target the host defense. By combining bioinformatical and experimental approaches, we address the question if the known DUB families have a common evolutionary ancestry and share conserved features that set them apart from other proteases. By systematically comparing family-specific Hidden-Markov-Models, we uncovered distant relationships between established DUBs and other cysteine protease families. Most DUB families share a conserved aromatic residue linked to the active site, which restricts the cleavage of substrates with sidechains at the S2 position, corresponding to Gly-75 in ubiquitin. By applying these criteria to Legionella pneumophila ORFs, we identified lpg1621 and lpg1148 as deubiquitinases, characterized their cleavage specificities, and confirmed the importance of the aromatic gatekeeper motif for substrate selection.","Hermanns, Thomas; Woiwode, Ilka; Guerreiro, Ricardo F.

Those measures will have longlasting impacts on well-being of all groups affected by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID- 19), but the underrepresented minorities and immunocompromised are at the greater risk and has a significant mortality rate. In the present study, we try to review current data about nutrition management of cancer patients within this pandemic, and nutritional prevention’s tools, in order to understand the outcomes of infected cancer patients, and avoid complications that can be associated with nutritional deficiencies.

Increased familiarity with telehealth has led to calls to continue its use after the pandemic ends. Yet national patterns of oncology telehealth utilization by visit type, preferences for telehealth use post-pandemic and barriers to telehealth for patients with cancer have not been described. Methods: 9,336 survey invitations were emailed to US-based ASCO members who have agreed to receive communications. Survey distribution was equally divided over five US regions, and practice type (e.g., academic, community) was reflective of ASCO membership proportions. The survey was open and data collected from January 4-28, 2021. Non-respondents received two reminder emails at week intervals. Analysis is descriptive. Results: 200 respondents completed the survey (2%). Respondents were 72% medical oncologists, 66% urban, 64% academic-affiliated, and from 42 states. 99% currently offered telehealth. 63% used telehealth for &lt;=30% of all patient visits in the last 30 days;18% used telehealth for more than half of visits. Telehealth utilization varied by visit type (table). 64% reported that the care delivered in telehealth visits was similar quality to in-person visits (29% worse). Assuming no regulatory or financial barriers to telehealth use after the pandemic, 92% would like to use telehealth for at least some visit types;only 8% prefer not to use telehealth. 20% would like to use telehealth for all visits types, and 64%, 54%, 33% and 17% would like to use telehealth for survivorship, symptom management, evaluation of patients receiving treatment and new patient visits, respectively (multiple selections allowed). Major barriers to telehealth were lack of patient access to technology (reported by 81%), limited patient technological proficiency (80%), language barriers (45%), uncertainty about future reimbursement (41%) and lack of administrative resources to support clinicians (33%). 68% agreed that the barriers increase cancer care disparities. Conclusions: Telehealth utilization was widespread during the COVID pandemic and varied by visit type. Most respondents plan to use telehealth in the future, but report barriers to continued use that worsen disparities.","Manz, C.; Baxter, N. N.; DuPont, N. C.; Markham, M.

211421,Forecasting the Effects of the New SARS-CoV-2 Variant in Europe,2021,"In this paper, we address the problem of face recognition with masks. Given the global health crisis caused by COVID-19, mouth and nose-covering masks have become an essential everyday-clothing-accessory. This sanitary measure has put the state-of-the-art face recognition models on the ropes since they have not been designed to work with masked faces. In addition, the need has arisen for applications capable of detecting whether the subjects are wearing masks to control the spread of the virus. To overcome these problems a full training pipeline is presented based on the ArcFace work, with several modifications for the backbone and the loss function. From the original face-recognition dataset, a masked version is generated using data augmentation, and both datasets are combined during the training process. The selected network, based on ResNet-50, is modified to also output the probability of mask usage without adding any computational cost. Furthermore, the ArcFace loss is combined with the mask-usage classification loss, resulting in a new function named Multi-Task ArcFace (MTArcFace). Experimental results show that the proposed approach highly boosts the original model accuracy when dealing with masked faces, while preserving almost the same accuracy on the original non-masked datasets. Furthermore, it achieves an average accuracy of 99.78% in mask-usage classification.","Montero, David; Nieto, Marcos; Leskovsky, Peter; Aginako, Naiara",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09874v2.pdf,822

248465,Development of Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assays Targeting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020,"Since December 2019, a global pandemic has been observed, caused by the emergence of a new coronavirus, SARS CoV‐2. The latter is responsible for the respiratory disease, COVID‐19. The infection is also characterized by renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal dysfunctions suggesting the spread of the virus to other organs. A dysregulated immune response was also reported. To date, there is no measure to treat or prevent SARS CoV‐2 infection. Additionally, as gut microbiota composition is altered in patients with COVID‐19, alternative therapies using probiotics can be con-sidered to fight SARS CoV‐2 infection. This review aims at summarizing the current knowledge about next‐generation probiotics (NGPs) and their benefits in viral respiratory tract infections and in COVID‐19. We describe these bacteria, highlighted by studies using metagenomic approaches. In addition, these bacteria generate metabolites such as butyrate, desaminotyrosine, and secondary bile acid, suggested to prevent viral respiratory infections. Gut microbial metabolites transported via the circulation to the lungs could inhibit viral replication or improve the immune response against viruses. The use of probiotics and/or their metabolites may target either the virus itself and/or the immunologic process. However, this review showed that more studies are needed to determine the benefits of probiotics and metabolite products in COVID‐19. © 2021 by the authors.

OBJECTIVE.­: To critically evaluate 2 commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serology tests. DESIGN.­: A total of 333 unique, nonduplicated serum samples obtained from COVID-19 patients (n = 170) and negative controls (n = 163) obtained before December 2019 were used in the study. Samples were tested on the Roche E411 and Abbott Architect i4000SR platforms, and results were correlated to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results and clinical symptoms. RESULTS.­: There was a strong level of agreement in the qualitative results between both assays, with a Cohen &#954; value of .840, P < .001. The specificity for both Roche and Abbott were excellent at 100%. Roche exhibited marginally better performance in the 21 days or more group with a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI, 75.8%-96.8%) versus an Abbott sensitivity of 84.4% (95% CI, 68.3%-93.1%), as well as in the 14- to 20-day group with a sensitivity of 85.7% (95% CI, 65.4%-95.0%) versus an Abbott sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI, 60.0%-92.3%). Less than 14 days of symptoms groups exhibited poor sensitivity at less than 50% for both assays. The areas under curve (± standard error) for Roche (0.894 ± 0.025, P < .001) and Abbott (0.884 ± 0.026, P < .001) were very similar. Potential confounders for negative serologic results include antiretroviral medication use and pauci-symptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS.­: Specificities for high-throughput Roche and Abbott immunoassays are excellent, but users need to be cautious to interpret serologic test results after 14 days of symptoms to avoid false negatives.","Tan, Shaun S; Saw, Sharon; Chew, Ka Lip; Wang, Cindy; Pajarillaga, Anastacia; Khoo, Candy; Wang, Weixuan; Ali, Zahidah Mohamed; Yang, Zhixin; Chan, Yiong Huak; Tambyah, Paul; Jureen, Roland; Sethi, Sunil K",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,822

How vulnerable are EMDEs to the current COVID-19 shock compared to the global financial crisis (GFC)?Design/methodology/approachIn addition to a descriptive analysis of the determinants of EMDEs external vulnerability, this paper designs two sub-indices of overindebtedness and financial fragility that capture EMDEs’ distinct characteristics. The two sub-indices together illustrate the overall external vulnerability to the current shock.FindingsEMDEs are more vulnerable compared to the GFC era. Current debt threats arise mainly from debt architecture and the domination of volatile debt forms – primarily foreign currency-denominated bonds. Excessive fear of debt-deflation spirals after the GFC prompted EMDEs to expand their growth trajectories through a pattern of cheap private lending, loose measures and unmonitored fiscal expansion.Research limitations/implicationsConclusive post-crisis data are still unavailable.Practical implicationsEMDEs need to balance between temporary accommodative measures and a post-shock policy mix that prevent a deflation spiral without worsening indebtedness and financial fragility. Moreover, financial prudence in face of growing credit demand is crucial, particularly in light of the monetary expansion and injected liquidity.Originality/valueThe indices offer a framework for examining external vulnerability in EMDEs based on theoretical and historical revisions, IMF benchmarks and EMDEs specific debt characteristics. The indices components can be offered for empirical examination in separate future research once conclusive data become available.","Elkhishin, Sarah Mohieldin Mahmoud",Review of Economics and Political Science,,822

It aims to explain and understand the introduction, implementation and effect of health policy instrument mixes. It argues that although ‘presidentialisation’ of executive, and ‘presidential bureaucracy’ under presidential system of government are critical to introduce policies and implement their instrument mixes without delay or being vetoed or watered down which would otherwise occur in the parliamentary system of government, these features of impositional and exclusive policy style pose risks of policy design and implementation failures when the policy problems are poorly diagnosed, their policy solutions are wrong and/or complementary policy instrument mixes implemented ineffectively. However, a temporal, albeit temporary divergence from a dominant administrative tradition and policy style is most likely when a policy issue is esoteric (i.e. technical, scientific and expert-led) and framed as an existential crisis under high uncertainty that require scientific, expert-led, inclusive, early, quick and decisive responses to pressing policy problems.","Bakir, Caner",Policy Soc.,,822

321451,"Evolution, Correlation, Structural Impact and Dynamics of Emerging SARS-CoV-2 Variants",2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has brought to light unprecedented challenges to global public health security. Researchers have devoted their efforts to in-depth research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to bring the epidemic under control as rapidly as possible. Among the many areas of burgeoning SARS-CoV-2 related research, various analytical technologies have been applied to the advancement of virus detection, and development of vaccines and innovative therapies. Separation technologies with the merits of simple operation, high separation efficiency, and high selectivity, have become widely used and are key to progress in life science, medicine, pharmaceutical discovery and development, and other fields. Separation technologies have played an irreplaceable role in the isolation, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of this novel coronavirus. In this review, an overview of the relevant literature is presented from ISI Web of Science spanning Jan. 1st, 2020-Dec. 31, 2020, using ""SARS-CoV-2"" or ""COVID-19"" as keywords. The top 20 research directions are summarized, based on papers published in high impact international journals (e. g. Nature, Science, and Cell). Incorporating the impact of published papers, this review summarizes the primary separation technologies applied in these coronavirus studies, and discusses contributions of the following six technologies: affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, liquid chromatography, magnetic bead separation technology, centrifugal technology, micro/nano-separation technology, and electrophoresis. First, affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography are discussed, which are the most frequently used protein purification techniques in Nature, Science, and Cell. The SARS-CoV-2 related proteins purified by affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography are summarized, and their applications in coronavirus transmission, infection mechanisms, and drug screening are introduced. Subsequently, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is introduced, which is mainly employed for assessing the purity of candidate drugs. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) incorporates the strengths of HPLC and MS, offering both high separation efficiency and structural analysis capabilities with extended applications. LC-MS/MS has been applied to characterization of the binding of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins to potential inhibitors, and to metabolic analyses of candidate drugs. In SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests, magnetic bead separation technology plays a crucial role in the separation of novel coronaviruses. In combination with other analytical techniques, magnetic bead separation technology can be applied to cytological analyses and immunological detection by functionalization of bead surfaces. Centrifugal technology is undoubtedly the most basic separation technology. It has been employed in almost all SARS-CoV-2 related researches. By controlling centrifugation speed, centrifugal technology can rapidly isolate virus particles or cultured cells from complex samples. Micro-nano separation technologies, such as microfluidics, offer advantages including small size, low sample consumption, rapid diffusion, and large surface area. In general, microfluidic technologies are often used in combination with other technologies to realize highly sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 related proteins. Finally, the applications of electrophoresis are introduced, which commonly engages in the analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. In novel coronavirus studies, the application of electrophoresis has been relatively limited but has potential with further development to contribute significantly to future research. In conclusion, this review summarizes the contributions of six primary separation technologies to novel coronavirus studies, including epidemic detection and prevention, analyzes the main problems facing coronavirus detection efforts, and discusses the role of separation technologies in addressing these problems, with the aim of providing references for broader application of separation technologies.","Li, Linsen; Zhu, Chao; Zhao, Xinying; Qu, Feng",Se Pu,,822
324896,"SARS-CoV-2: Structural diversity, phylogeny, and potential animal host identification of spike glycoprotein",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound and differential impacts on metropolitan areas across the United States and around the world. Within the United States, metropolitan areas that were hit earliest with the pandemic and reacted with scientifically based health policy were able to contain the virus by late spring. For other areas that kept businesses open, the first wave in the United States hit in mid-summer. As the weather turns colder, universities resume classes, and people tire of lockdowns, a second wave is ascending in both metropolitan and rural areas. It becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed at the local level to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand and manage risk in metropolitan areas. Existing surveillance measures coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until, and after, an effective vaccine is developed. Here, we provide values for novel indicators to measure COVID-19 transmission at the metropolitan area level. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 260 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas as a function of the prior number of cases and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Minneapolis and Chicago have the greatest average number of daily new positive results per standardized 100,000 population (which we refer to as speed). Extreme behavior in Minneapolis showed an increase in speed from 17 to 30 (67%) in 1 week. The jerk and acceleration calculated for these areas also showed extreme behavior. The dynamic panel data model shows that Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit have the largest persistence effects, meaning that new cases pertaining to a specific week are statistically attributable to new cases from the prior week. CONCLUSIONS: Three of the metropolitan areas with historically early and harsh winters have the highest persistence effects out of the top 25 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States at the beginning of their cold weather season. With these persistence effects, and with indoor activities becoming more popular as the weather gets colder, stringent COVID-19 regulations will be more important than ever to flatten the second wave of the pandemic. As colder weather grips more of the nation, southern metropolitan areas may also see large spikes in the number of cases.","Oehmke, Theresa B; Post, Lori A; Moss, Charles B; Issa, Tariq Z; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James F",J Med Internet Res,,822

Here, we studied 246 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive (COVIDpos) patients and propensity-matched 2460 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative (COVIDneg) patients subjected to around 700,000 lab tests cumulatively across 194 assays. Compared to COVIDneg patients at the time of diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and lower platelet counts. However, as the infection evolves, COVIDpos patients distinctively show declining fibrinogen, increasing platelet counts, and lower white blood cell counts. Augmented curation of EHRs suggests that only a minority of COVIDpos patients develop thromboembolism, and rarely, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with patients generally not displaying platelet reductions typical of consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends provide fine-grained resolution into COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC) and set the stage for personalizing thromboprophylaxis.","Pawlowski, Colin; Wagner, Tyler; Puranik, Arjun; Murugadoss, Karthik; Loscalzo, Liam; Venkatakrishnan, A J; Pruthi, Rajiv K; Houghton, Damon E; O039,; Horo, John C; Morice, William G; Williams, Amy W; Gores, Gregory J; Halamka, John; Badley, Andrew D; Barnathan, Elliot S; Makimura, Hideo; Khan, Najat; Soundararajan, Venky",eLife (Cambridge),,822

The effects of this sudden transition to distance learning affect multiple aspects of training, from recruitment to patient care, scholarly activity, and well-being. Clinical educators must also understand how to consider and maintain equity while implementing distance learning strategies. METHODS: Resources were collected from multiple sites that are openly accessible to sleep medicine educators. These resources are presented within their topic domains to provide guidance on how to effectively implement distance learning strategies into a clinical training program. RESULTS: Links to helpful resources are provided for each of the following topics: virtual clinical care, didactic delivery in a virtual clinical learning environment, generating scholarship via distance learning, well-being in the setting of distance learning, virtual interviews, and equity in a virtual clinical learning environment. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical training programs, including sleep medicine fellowships, can utilize virtual and distance learning methodologies to deliver, and even enhance, currently existing curricula. The widespread adoption of distance learning strategies opens new opportunities for educational innovation and collaboration among training programs.","Shelgikar, Anita Valanju",J Clin Sleep Med,,822

448176,Spike mutation D614G alters SARS-CoV-2 fitness and neutralization susceptibility,2020,"Multi-label text classification refers to the problem of assigning each given document its most relevant labels from the label set. Commonly, the metadata of the given documents and the hierarchy of the labels are available in real-world applications. However, most existing studies focus on only modeling the text information, with a few attempts to utilize either metadata or hierarchy signals, but not both of them. In this paper, we bridge the gap by formalizing the problem of metadata-aware text classification in a large label hierarchy (e.g., with tens of thousands of labels). To address this problem, we present the MATCH solution -- an end-to-end framework that leverages both metadata and hierarchy information. To incorporate metadata, we pre-train the embeddings of text and metadata in the same space and also leverage the fully-connected attentions to capture the interrelations between them. To leverage the label hierarchy, we propose different ways to regularize the parameters and output probability of each child label by its parents. Extensive experiments on two massive text datasets with large-scale label hierarchies demonstrate the effectiveness of MATCH over state-of-the-art deep learning baselines.","Zhang, Yu; Shen, Zhihong; Dong, Yuxiao; Wang, Kuansan; Han, Jiawei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.07349v1.pdf,822

This article describes a study that investigated the pandemic-related work of community-based adult educators in the ethno-culturally diverse Canadian province of British Columbia. Interviews were conducted with 18 educators who were working on the ""front lines"" of the pandemic, to document their support of low-income and newcomer communities, to understand how these educators responded in terms of pedagogies and strategies, and to map how these pedagogies and practices might be leveraged for more equitable relationships in post-pandemic community-based education. The authors found that the educators developed a range of inventive and dynamic pedagogies oriented to social solidarity and to taking up intersectional oppressions. These ""pandemic pedagogies"" may contribute to more equitable and inclusive social-technology relationships in a post-pandemic future.","Smythe, Suzanne; Wilbur, Amea; Hunter, Emily",Int Rev Educ,,822

459701,Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the Australian context,2021,"Vaccine-preventable diseases are global mainly in a globalized world that is characterized by a continuous movement of people and goods across countries. Vaccine hesitancy, the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines, is rising worldwide. What if the problem of vaccine hesitancy could be most effectively managed when treated globally rather than on a national or regional basis? What if a global vaccine-hesitant segment exists and the differences among countries are not so significant? Based on the Global Marketing Strategy paradigm, this paper shows that seven different cross-European segments exist based on the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors collected in 28 European countries. These pan-European segments are differentiable (people in those segments have similar characteristics that are visibly dissimilar from the ones in other segments) and actionable (organizations would be able to propose interventions to the hesitant segments based on their profiles). With segmentation being the starting point of many public health intervention strategies for avoiding vaccine-hesitancy, the results recommend moderating the full-adaptation strategy that follows the “context matters” principle suggested by several political and public health international organizations. Embracing a more standardized strategy will allow the development of better services and strategies that support and enable desirable vaccination behaviors.","Recio-Menéndez, Manuel Román-González María Victoria",Vaccines,,822

This study aimed to assess the contribution of different air pollution indicators in different spaces on the newly confirmed cases of coronavirus. According to causality's results between air pollution (AP) and COVID-19 infection in 9 countries, first, we examined the non-linear relationship from AP to COVID-19 with PM2.5 as the rating variable (the cut point is 35 µg/m3) at the national level. It is concluded that the effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on COVID-19 are more sensitive in Russia, England, Germany, and France, while O3 and PM2.5 are more sensitive in America and Canada from 21 Jan to 20 May. Second, we examined the threshold effects from AP to COVID-19 with PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 as the threshold variables, respectively, at the municipal level in China during the period 28 Jan to 31 May. It is concluded that except CO, the remaining 5 indicators are very sensitive to the increase of newly confirmed cases, and the spread of COVID-19 can be prevented and controlled by the determination of thresholds. In addition, the 9 countries and 27 provinces show that PM2.5 in high concentrations is the more sensitive pollutant on the spread of COVID-19 infection.","Liu, Qiang; Xu, Shengxia; Lu, Xiaoli",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

In this manuscript, we highlight the recent biochemical and biophysical methodological advancements that yielded more in-depth insight into the structural and functional composition of coronaviruses cis-acting RNA motifs. We discuss the complexity of these RNA regulatory elements, their intermolecular interactions, post-transcriptional regulation, and their potential as druggable targets.

488209,SARS-CoV-2 spike E484K mutation reduces antibody neutralisation,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many people, including those in the fields of science and engineering, to work from home. The new working environment caused by the pandemic is assumed to have a different impact on the amount of work that women and men can do from home. Particularly, if the major burden of child and other types of care is still predominantly on the shoulders of women. As such, a survey was conducted to assess the main issues that biomedical engineers, medical physicists (academics and professionals), and other similar professionals have been facing when working from home during the pandemic. A survey was created and disseminated worldwide. It originated from a committee of International Union for Physical and Engineering Sciences in Medicine (IUPESM; Women in Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering Task Group) and supported by the Union. The ethics clearance was received from Carleton University. The survey was deployed on the Survey Monkey platform and the results were analyzed using IBM SPSS software. The analyses mainly consisted of frequency of the demographic parameters and the cross-tabulation of gender with all relevant variables describing the impact of work at home. A total of 921 responses from biomedical professions in 76 countries were received: 339 males, 573 females, and nine prefer-not-to-say/other. Regarding marital/partnership status, 85% of males were married or in partnership, and 15% were single, whereas 72% of females were married or in partnership, and 26% were single. More women were working from home during the pandemic (68%) versus 50% of men. More men had access to an office at home (68%) versus 64% for women. The proportion of men spending more than 3 h on child care and schooling per day was 12%, while for women it was 22%; for household duties, 8% of men spent more than 3 h; for women, this was 12.5%. It is interesting to note that 44% of men spent between 1 and 3 h per day on household duties, while for women, it was 55%. The high number of survey responses can be considered excellent. It is interesting to note that men participate in childcare and household duties in a relatively high percentage; although this corresponds to less hours daily than for women. It is far more than can be found 2 and 3 decades ago. This may reflect the situation in the developed countries only-as majority of responses (75%) was received from these countries. It is evident that the burden of childcare and household duties will have a negative impact on the careers of women if the burden is not more similar for both sexes. It is important to recognize that a change in policies of organizations that hire them may be required to provide accommodation and compensation to minimize the negative impact on the professional status and career of men and women who work in STEM fields.","Frize, Monique; Lhotska, Lenka; Marcu, Loredana G; Stoeva, Magdalena; Barabino, Gilda; Ibrahim, Fatimah; Lim, Sierin; Kaldoudi, Eleni; Marques da Silva, Ana Maria; Tan, Peck Ha; Tsapaki, Virginia; Bezak, Eva","Gender, work and organization",,822

The strict disciplinary measures implemented by China were very effective and thus were subsequently adopted by most world countries to various degrees. The infection duration and number of infected persons are of critical importance for the battle against the pandemic. We use the quantitative landscape of the disease spreading in China as a benchmark and utilize infection data from eight countries to estimate the complete evolution of the infection in each of these countries. The analysis predicts successfully both the expected number of daily infections per country and, perhaps more importantly, the duration of the epidemic in each country. Our quantitative approach is based on a Gaussian spreading hypothesis that is shown to arise as a result of imposed measures in a simple dynamical infection model. This may have consequences and shed light in the efficiency of policies once the phenomenon is over.","Barmparis, G D; Tsironis, G P",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,822

As of July 5, case severity rate, based on World Health Organization (WHO) severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but 91.3% (95% CI 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive > 3 weeks before serology testing. Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to growing immunity levels in the population.","Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Ayoub, Houssein H; Al Kanaani, Zaina; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Kuwari, Einas; Butt, Adeel A; Coyle, Peter; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Kaleeckal, Anvar Hassan; Latif, Ali Nizar; Owen, Robert C; Rahim, Hanan F Abdul; Al Abdulla, Samya A; Al Kuwari, Mohamed G; Kandy, Mujeeb C; Saeb, Hatoun; Ahmed, Shazia Nadeem N; Al Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Bansal, Devendra; Dalton, Louise; Al-Thani, Mohamed H; Bertollini, Roberto",Sci Rep,,822

519882,Inferring Transmission Fitness Advantage of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in Wastewater Using Digital PCR,2021,"CONTEXT: Chronic immunosuppression is associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections. Although kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have higher mortality than the general population, data on their risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are unknown. Subject of Review: A recent single-center screening study from the UK (Transplantation. 2021 Jan 1;105(1):151-7) showed that 89 (10.4%) of 855 consecutive kidney transplant recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Risk factors for infection included a nonwhite background, diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. Risk factors for mortality in individuals who developed COVID-19 were older age and receiving steroids. Second Opinion: This study shows that the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients is similar to the one observed in the general population in the same area (13%), indicating that transplant recipients are not at increased risk of COVID-19. However, the investigators raise the interesting point that since transplant individuals were advised to shelter earlier than the general population, they may be in fact more susceptible. This statement is hard to substantiate, but the identification of specific risk factors for infection and poor outcomes is crucial to tailor strategies to prevent spread of the infection. This is particularly important, considering that kidney transplant recipients may be at increased risk of prolonged viral spread and in-host viral mutations, making them not just a particularly fragile population for COVID-19 but also a potentially major source of further contagions.","Riella, Leonardo V; Azzi, Jamil R; Cravedi, Paolo",Nephron,,822

Hence, to date, the diagnosis of COVID-19 from lung imaging is proved to be a major evidence for early diagnosis of the disease. Although nucleic acid detection using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) remains a gold standard for the detection of COVID-19, the proposed approach focuses on the automated diagnosis and prognosis of the disease from a non-contrast chest computed tomography (CT)scan for timely diagnosis and triage of the patient. The prognosis covers the quantification and assessment of the disease to help hospitals with the management and planning of crucial resources, such as medical staff, ventilators and intensive care units (ICUs) capacity. The approach utilises deep learning techniques for automated quantification of the severity of COVID-19 disease via measuring the area of multiple rounded ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidations in the periphery (CP) of the lungs and accumulating them to form a severity score. The severity of the disease can be correlated with the medicines prescribed during the triage to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. The proposed approach shows promising results where the classification model achieved 93% accuracy on hold-out data.","Ali, Abbas Raza; Budka, Marcin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14116v1.pdf,822

However, patients not alredy followed-up via RM represent a challenging group of patients to be managed during the lockdown. METHODS: We reviewed patient files scheduled for an outpatient visit between January 1, 2020 and May 11th, 2020 to assess the proportion of patients in whom RM activation was possible without office visit, and compared them to those scheduled for visit before the lockdown. RESULTS: During COVID-19 pandemic, RM activation was feasible in a minority of patients (7.8% of patients) expected at outpatient clinic for a follow-up visit and device check-up. This was possible in a good proportion of complex implantable devices such as cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator but only in 3 patients with a pacemaker the RM function could be activated during the period of restricted access to hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience strongly suggest to consider the systematic activation of RM function at the time of implantation or – by default programming - in all cardiac rhythm management devices.","Auricchio, Angelo; Conte, Giulio; Demarchi, Andrea; Baldi, Enrico; Ozkartal, Tardu; Regoli, Francois; Moccetti, Tiziano",Int J Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33278416/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.11.063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527320342327?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167527320342327,822

Research has shown that ASIC channels are involved in the proliferation and growth of cancer cells; therefore, Mambalgin-1 can be a potential anti-cancer by inhibiting these channels. In the present study, the Nicotiana benthamiana codon optimized Mambalgin-1 gene was synthesized and cloned in PVX (potato virus X) viral vector. The two cultures of Agrobacterium containing Mambalgin-1 and P19 silencing suppressor genes were co-agroinfiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. Five days post infiltration, the production of recombinant Mambalgin-1 was determined by western blotting. For biological activity, MTT (3(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was analyzed for the cytotoxicity recombinant Mambalgin-1 from the transformed plants on nervous (SH-SY5Y) and breast (MCF7) cancer cells. The results showed that the plants expressing open reading frame of Mambalgin-1 showed recombinant 7.4 kDa proteins in the entire plant extract. In the MTT test, it was found that Mambalgin-1 had cytotoxic effects on SH-SY5Y cancer cells, yet no effects on MCF7 cancer cells were observed. According to the results, the expression of the biologically active recombinant Mambalgin-1 in the transformed plant leaves was confirmed and Mambalgin-1 can also have anti-cancer (inhibition of ASIC channels) potential along with its already known analgesic effect.

Fatigue and memory impairment are common post-COVID symptoms. We aimed to explore associations between the timeline and severity of post-COVID fatigue and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Fatigue and memory impairment were assessed in a total of 101 post-COVID subjects using the Chalder fatigue scale (CFQ-11) and a visual analogue scale. Using the bimodal scoring system generated from CFQ-11, a score ≥4 was defined as severe fatigue. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (anti-S-Ig) and nucleocapsid (anti-NC-Ig) antibodies were examined at two time points: 4–12 weeks after onset of symptoms, and beyond 12 weeks. Results: The serum level of anti-S-Ig was significantly higher in patients with non-severe fatigue compared to those with severe fatigue at 4–12 weeks (p = 0.006) and beyond 12 weeks (p = 0.016). The serum level of anti-NC-Ig remained high in patients with non-severe fatigue at both time points. In contrast, anti-NC-Ig decreased significantly in severe fatigue cases regardless of the elapsed time (4–12 weeks: p = 0.024; beyond 12 weeks: p = 0.005). The incidence of memory impairment was significantly correlated with lower anti-S-Ig levels (−0.359, p < 0.001).

However, the magnitude of this reduction varies between studies. METHOD: Electronic databases were searched from January 2020 to May 2021. Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and, when necessary, full text to determine if studies met inclusion criteria. A modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. A narrative summary of eligible studies was synthesised, and meta-analysis was conducted using a random effect model to pool the rate ratio and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for hospital admissions. Exacerbation reduction was compared against the COVID-19 Containment and Health Index. RESULTS: A total of 13 of 745 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review, with data from nine countries. Nine studies could be included in the meta-analysis. The pooled rate ratio of hospital admissions for COPD exacerbations during the pandemic period was 0.50 (95% CI 0.44–0.57). Findings on the rate of community-treated exacerbations were inconclusive. Three studies reported a significant decrease in the incidence of respiratory viral infections compared with the pre-pandemic period. There was not a significant relationship between exacerbation reduction and the COVID-19 Containment and Health Index (rho = 0.20, p = 0.53). CONCLUSION: There was a 50% reduction in admissions for COPD exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic period compared to pre-pandemic times, likely associated with a reduction in respiratory viral infections that trigger exacerbations. Future guidelines should consider including recommendations on respiratory virus infection control measures to reduce the burden of COPD exacerbations beyond the pandemic period.","Alqahtani, Jaber S.; Oyelade, Tope; Aldhahir, Abdulelah M.; Mendes, Renata Gonçalves; Alghamdi, Saeed M.; Miravitlles, Marc; Mandal, Swapna; Hurst, John R.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34343205/,822

644883,Nanobodies from camelid mice and llamas neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants,2021-06-07,"Background: Repetitive elements contribute a large part of eukaryotic genomes. For example, about 40 to 50% of human, mouse and rat genomes are repetitive. So identifying and classifying repeats is an important step in genome annotation. This annotation step is traditionally performed using alignment based methods, either in a de novo approach or by aligning the genome sequence to a species specific set of repetitive sequences. Recently, Li (Bioinformatics 35:4408–4410, 2019) developed a novel software tool dna-brnn to annotate repetitive sequences using a recurrent neural network trained on sample annotations of repetitive elements. Results: We have developed the methods of dna-brnn further and engineered a new software tool DeepGRP. This combines the basic concepts of Li (Bioinformatics 35:4408–4410, 2019) with current techniques developed for neural machine translation, the attention mechanism, for the task of nucleotide-level annotation of repetitive elements. An evaluation on the human genome shows a 20% improvement of the Matthews correlation coefficient for the predictions delivered by DeepGRP, when compared to dna-brnn. DeepGRP predicts two additional classes of repeats (compared to dna-brnn) and is able to transfer repeat annotations, using RepeatMasker-based training data to a different species (mouse). Additionally, we could show that DeepGRP predicts repeats annotated in the Dfam database, but not annotated by RepeatMasker. DeepGRP is highly scalable due to its implementation in the TensorFlow framework. For example, the GPU-accelerated version of DeepGRP is approx. 1.8 times faster than dna-brnn, approx. 8.6 times faster than RepeatMasker and over 100 times faster than HMMER searching for models of the Dfam database. Conclusions: By incorporating methods from neural machine translation, DeepGRP achieves a consistent improvement of the quality of the predictions compared to dna-brnn. Improved running times are obtained by employing TensorFlow as implementation framework and the use of GPUs. By incorporating two additional classes of repeats, DeepGRP provides more complete annotations, which were evaluated against three state-of-the-art tools for repeat annotation.

We have previously developed an efficient surface-display system by genetically engineering 987P fimbriae to present transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) C and A epitopes for the induction of anti-TGEV antibodies with a Salmonella vaccine vector. Here, this system was compared with an autotransporter protein surface display system. The TGEV C and A epitopes were fused to the passenger domain of the MisL autotransporter of Salmonella. Expression of both the MisL- and 987P subunit FasA-fusions to the TGEV epitopes were under the control of in vivo-induced promoters. Expression of the TGEV epitopes from the Salmonella typhimurium CS4552 (crp cya asd pgtE) vaccine strain was greater when the epitopes were fused to MisL than when they were fused to the 987P FasA subunit. However, when BALB/c mice were orally immunized with the Salmonella vector expressing the TGEV epitopes from either one of the fusion constructs or both together, the highest level of anti-TGEV antibody was obtained with the 987P-TGEV immunogen-displaying vector.

The aim of this research is to identify technological and patient-related barriers to inclusion of this population in a clinical eHealth study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study with older patients (≥ 65 years) undergoing cancer-related surgery, who were identified for a perioperative telemonitoring study. Reasons for ineligibility and refusal had been prospectively registered. Characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared between participants and non-participants. RESULTS: Between May 2018 and March 2020, 151 patients were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 65 participants and 86 non-participants. The main reason for ineligibility was lack of internet access at home (n = 16), while main reasons for refusal were perceived high mental burden (n = 46) and insufficient digital skills (n = 12). Compared with participants, non-participants were significantly older (mean age 75 vs. 73, p = 0.01); more often female (64% vs. 35%, p = 0.00), unmarried (42% vs. 8%, p = 0.01) living alone (38% vs. 19%, p = 0.02); had a higher ASA classification (43% vs. 19%, p = 0.00); often had polypharmacy (67% vs. 43%, p = 0.00); and were more often discharged to skilled nursing facilities (0% vs. 15%, p = 0.00).

It has been established that this virus can survive on a variety of available surfaces ranging from a few hours to a few days, which has increased the risk of COVID-19 spread to large populations.

Apart from the urgent development of vaccine and antiviral drugs, there is also a need to design and develop surface disinfectant antiviral coatings for long-term applications even for new variants. The unique physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) have been widely investigated for antimicrobial applications. However, the research work for their use in antimicrobial surface coatings is minimal. This perspective enlightens the scope of using GBNs as antimicrobial/antiviral surface coatings to reduce the spread of transmittable microorganisms, precisely, SARS-CoV-2. This study attempts to demonstrate the synergistic effect of GBNs and metallic nanoparticles (MNPs), for their potential antiviral applications in the development of surface disinfectant coatings. Some proposed mechanisms for the antiviral activity of the graphene family against SARS-CoV-2 has also been explained. It is anticipated that this study will potentially lead to new insights and future trends to develop a framework for further investigation on this research area of pivotal importance to minimize the transmission of current and any future viral outbreaks.","Ayub, Muhammad; Othman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan; Khan, Imran Ullah; Yusop, Mohd Zamri Mohd; Kurniawan, Tonni Agustiono",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S246802302100537X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S246802302100537X?v=s5,822

The goal of this study was to assess the contributions of CXCL10 to the pathogenesis of experimental septic shock in mice. METHODS: Septic shock was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice resuscitated with lactated Ringer’s solution and, in some cases, the broad spectrum antibiotic Primaxin. Studies were performed in CXCL10 knockout mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 immunoglobulin G (IgG). Endpoints included leukocyte trafficking and activation, core body temperature, plasma cytokine concentrations, bacterial clearance and survival. RESULTS: CXCL10 was present at high concentrations in plasma and peritoneal cavity during CLP-induced septic shock. Survival was significantly improved in CXCL10 knockout (CXCL10KO) mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG compared to controls. CXCL10KO mice and mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG showed attenuated hypothermia, lower concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) in plasma and lessened natural killer (NK) cell activation compared to control mice. Compared to control mice, bacterial burden in blood and lungs was lower in CXCL10-deficient mice but not in mice treated with anti-CXCL10 IgG. Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 IgG plus fluids and Primaxin at 2 or 6 hours after CLP significantly improved survival compared to mice treated with non-specific IgG under the same conditions. CONCLUSIONS: CXCL10 plays a role in the pathogenesis of CLP-induced septic shock and could serve as a therapeutic target during the acute phase of septic shock.","Herzig, Daniela S; Luan, Liming; Bohannon, Julia K; Toliver-Kinsky, Tracy E; Guo, Yin; Sherwood, Edward R",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24890566/; https://doi.org/10.1186/cc13902,822
