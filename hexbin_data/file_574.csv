8908,Clinical results obtained in cattle and swine by means of biological immunostimulators(),2002-11-14,"Members of the Bunyaviridae family acquire their envelopes by budding into the Golgi complex (GC). The accumulation of the membrane glycoproteins G1 and G2 in the GC probably determines the site of maturation. Here we have studied the intracellular transport and targeting to the GC of G1 and G2 of Uukuniemi virus, a member of the Phlebovirus genus, and report on their expression from cloned cDNAs either together or separately by using a T7 RNA polymerase-driven vaccinia virus expression system. When G1 and G2 were expressed together from a full-length cDNA as the p110 precursor, both proteins were localized to the Golgi complex, as evidenced by colocalization with the Golgi marker enzyme mannosidase II. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 expressed alone also localized to the GC. However, pulse-chase experiments showed that G1 remained endoglycosidase H sensitive. G2 expressed alone remained associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). G2 could be rescued from the ER and transported to the GC by coexpression with G1 from separate mRNAs. Coexpression also increased the efficiency of G1 transport to the GC. With none of the constructs could the glycoproteins be observed on the cell surface. These results show that efficient export of G1 and G2 from the ER requires coexpression of both proteins, in conformity with our previous results showing that G1 and G2 from heterodimeric complexes in the ER. Since G1 expressed alone is retained in the GC, we conclude that G1 contains a retention signal for localization to the GC. G2 might thus become associated with the GC indirectly via its interaction with G1.","Melin, Lars; Persson, Robert; Andersson, Agneta; Bergström, Anita; Rönnholm, Ragna; Pettersson, Ralf F.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133855/,574
8921,Laboratory techniques of veterinary clinical immunology: A review,2002-11-14,"Mucosal resistance to infection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) has been previously demonstrated, and the LDV system presents an important murine model for the study of mucosal barriers to viral infection. In the present study, duodenal molecules were isolated from normal mice which had potent virucidal activity, when tested against LDV as well as canine herpes, canine hepatitis, Semliki forest, and visna viruses. The virucidal activity was demonstrated to be non-immune in nature, and was present in apparently non-enzymatic protein molecules, having a molecular mass of between 10–100 kDa by membrane filtration and 10–17 kDa by gel filtration. The anti-LDV activity of these molecules was suppressed by anti-duodenum antibodies in vitro, and in vivo studies suggested a possible protective role for the anti-viral molecules. We conclude that the normal mouse duodenum contains potent virucidal molecules, which are of interest to the study of biological and molecular mechanisms of viral resistance.","Broen, James J.; DesJarlais, Scott E.; Duman, Richard G.; Anderson, Steven N.; Mueller, Richard A.; Cafruny, William A.",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133942/,574
8960,Transmissibility of the contagious equine metritis organism for the cat,2002-11-14,"Antiviral activities of four Schiff bases of aminohydroxyguanidine, designated ML1, ML4, ATL14 and LK11, were tested against human adenovirus types 5 and 8 (Ad5 and Ad8) in A549 cells by plaque reduction and virus yield reduction methods. Compound ML1 1-(2′-hydroxy-5′-methoxybenzylidene)amino-3-hydroxyguanidine tosylate gave the best therapeutic indices (TC(50)/IC(50)) of 27.2 and 17.8 for Ad5 and Ad8, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with ML1 did not affect the adsorption nor the penetration of virus. Ultrastructure studies showed that only the drug treated infected cells had unidentified irregular shaped electron dense structures that might be drug altered viral macromolecules that were not assembled into complete infectious virus particles. Since these compounds have metal chelating properties, their antiviral activity may involve the early IA (EIA) gene which encodes a viral protein of 289 amino acid which has a zinc finger moiety that is required for its transactivation activity.","Hui, M.B.V.; Lien, E.J.; Trousdale, M.D.",Antiviral Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134180/,574
8970,Studies on the suitability of alpha-hybrid interferon application in cattle,2001-06-07,"Brefeldin A (BFA), a unique fungal metabolite of a 13-membered lactone ring, exhibits various biological actions, including antitumor, antifungal and antiviral activities. In the present study, mouse L(B) cells were treated with various concentrations of interferon (IFN) and/or BFA overnight and infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) after removal of IFN and BFA. Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2–5A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in L(B) cells after BFA treatment. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a decrease (2–3-fold) in the mRNA of 2′–5′ oligoadenylate (2–5A) synthetase after BFA treatment. BFA also inhibited the activity of 2–5A synthetase, 2–5A dependent RNase and phosphorylation of PKR in cellular extracts, indicating that BFA may be exerting its inhibitory effect both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This study reports a new biological action of BFA, demonstrating that BFA antagonized the antiviral action of IFN by inhibiting IFN-induced enzymatic pathways. These studies also suggest that both 2–5A and PKR are important in the antiviral activity of IFN against EMCV.","Sidhu, G.S.; Singh, A.K.; Raghunath, P.N.; Sivaram, S.; Maheshwari, R.K.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134369/,574

9756,Dendritic DNA Building Blocks for Amplified Detection Assays and Biomaterials,2009-06-27,"Objective To establish the cost to the Queensland dairy industry of cattle tick infestation and its control, excluding the costs incurred from control measures directed specifically at tick fever and morbidity and mortality arising from tick fever. Study design Economic models are described that have been based on empirical data relating to liveweight and milk yield loss, and on a survey of control practices and tick infestation. The first two models were designed to estimate costs of control and losses resulting from tick infestation on a single dairy farm. The third model developed estimates of the cost of tick infestation for each of four regions within the tick‐infested area of Queensland. Results The overall cost to the Queensland dairy industry of the cattle tick (excluding the costs associated specifically with tick fever) and based on 1998 management practices, was $4,096,000 per annum. About 49% of this cost was related to the costs of control and 51% to losses in production. Conclusion Cattle tick infestation represents a significant impost on dairy producers in Queensland, and although the actual cost will change as deregulation results in economic changes in the industry, infestations of ticks will continue to be expensive to control.","JONSSON, NN; DAVIS, R; De WITT, M",Aust Vet J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159636/,574
9763,A Stable Calcium Alumanyl,2020-01-30,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the utility of serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) for disease monitoring in rats with chronic pristane‐induced arthritis, and to examine the influence of age, sex, and genes on COMP concentrations in rat serum. METHODS: Serum COMP levels were quantified by immunoassay. Sera were obtained from DA, E3, and (E3 × DA)F(1) rats each week between the ages of 4 and 30 weeks. The (E3 × DA)F(2) (second generation after intercrossing) rats were injected intradermally with the synthetic oil pristane. Arthritis was monitored by a macroscopic scoring system, and serum levels of COMP were measured on days 6, 35, and 49 after immunization. RESULTS: Serum levels of COMP decreased during growth, and reached a plateau after the age of 12 weeks. The DA rats had higher COMP levels than the E3 rats, and the (E3 × DA)F(1) rats had intermediate levels. No differences were observed in these levels when the rats were grouped by sex. Arthritic (E3 × DA)F(2) rats had increased serum concentrations of COMP on days 35 and 49 after pristane injection (P < 0.0001 versus the nonarthritic animals). COMP levels correlated with the severity of macroscopically detectable arthritis at both time points (r > 0.9). Rats with a chronic disease course were distinguished by higher serum concentrations of COMP during the acute stage than animals with similar clinical scores but with resolving arthritis (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Serum analyses of COMP offer promise for monitoring tissue involvement in experimental arthritis. Such analyses should be useful for monitoring therapeutic interventions aimed at retarding tissue destruction as well as for studies of the genetically determined regulation of COMP turnover and susceptibility to arthritis. The application of molecular marker measurements to experimental arthritis offers a new possibility for verifying the utility of such measurements in human arthritis.","Vingsbo‐Lundberg, Carina; Saxne, Tore; Olsson, Henric; Holmdahl, Rikard",Arthritis Rheum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159671/,574

20088,Discovery of Novel Bacterial Chalcone Isomerases by a Sequence‐Structure‐Function‐Evolution Strategy for Enzymatic Synthesis of (S)‐Flavanones,2021-06-30,"The purpose of this study is to understand children’s clinical characteristics with pertussis and analyze risk factors on critical pertussis patients. Demographic data from patients with pertussis at Children’s Hospital affiliated to the Capital Institute of Pediatrics between March 2011 and December 2018 were collected. We retrospectively gathered more information with the positive exposure, vaccination, antibiotic usage before diagnosis, clinical manifestation, laboratory tests, therapy, and complications for hospitalized children. We divided the patients into severe and non-severe groups, comparing related factors and clinical characteristics among each group. In particular, we summarize the clinical features of the severe patients before aggravation. A total of 967 pertussis cases were diagnosed, of which 227 were hospitalized. The onset age younger than 3 months old accounted for the highest proportion, and 126 patients received hospitalization. For those patients, the incidence of post-tussive vomiting, paroxysmal cyanosis, post-tussive heart rate decrease, hypoxemia, severe pneumonia, and mechanical ventilation was significantly higher than that in the ≥ 3-month-old group (p < 0.05). Among 227 hospitalized patients, 54 suffered from severe pertussis. Risk factors for severe patients included early age of onset, pathogen exposure, and unvaccinated status. Cough paroxysms, post-tussive vomiting, paroxysmal cyanosis, facial flushing/cyanosis/fever during cough, increased WBC, and chest X-ray revealing pneumonia/consolidation/atelectasis were important indications of severe pertussis. Unvaccinated status was an independent risk factor for severe pertussis. The most vulnerable population was infants < 3 months old to pertussis, and may be on the severe end of the disease. Pediatricians must detect and treat severe cases promptly and recommend timely vaccination for all eligible children.","Kang, Limin; Cui, Xiaodai; Fu, Jin; Wang, Wenpeng; Li, Li; Li, Tiegeng; Wang, Xiaoying; Xiao, Fei; Jia, Huixue; Mi, Rong; Hou, Xinlin",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8365282/,574

65014,"Effects of non-drug interventions on depression, anxiety and sleep in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Plethysmographic variability index (PVI) is an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. However, the site of measurement of the plethysmographic waveform impacts its morphology and its respiratory variation. The goal of this study was to investigate the ability of PVI to predict fluid responsiveness at three sites of measurement (the forehead, ear, and finger) in mechanically ventilated patients under general anaesthesia. METHODS We studied 28 subjects after induction of general anaesthesia. Subjects were monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter and three pulse oximeter sensors (the finger, ear, and forehead). Pulse pressure variation, central venous pressure, cardiac index (CI), and PVI measured at the forehead, ear, and finger (PVI(forehead), PVI(ear), and PVI(finger)) were recorded before and after fluid loading (FL). Subjects were responders to volume expansion if CI increased >15% after FL. RESULTS Areas under the receiver-operating curves to predict fluid responsiveness were 0.906, 0.880, and 0.836 for PVI(forehead), PVI(ear), and PVI(finger), respectively (P<0.05). PVI(forehead), PVI(ear), and PVI(finger) had a threshold value to predict fluid responsiveness of 15%, 16%, and 12% with sensitivities of 89%, 74%, and 74% and specificities of 78%, 74%, and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS PVI can predict fluid responsiveness in anaesthetized and ventilated subjects at all three sites of measurement. However, the threshold values for predicting fluid responsiveness differ with the site of measurement. These results support the use of this plethysmographic dynamic index in the cephalic region when the finger is inaccessible or during states of low peripheral perfusion.","Desgranges, F-P; Desebbe, O; Ghazouani, A; Gilbert, K; Keller, G; Chiari, P; Robin, J; Bastien, O; Lehot, J-J; Cannesson, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aer165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21680600/,574

A sense of belonging in childhood and adolescence contributes to a number of adult behavioural and psychological outcomes. A high sense of belonging has been associated with better health, longevity, psychological well-being, and disease recovery. METHODS In this study, the Persian version of the Sense of Belonging Instrument (SOBI) for older adults in Iran was evaluated psychometrically to develop an accurate measure for belonging. Participants in the study were 302 older adults, 60 years old and above, living independently in Iran and chosen through convenience sampling. RESULTS An exploratory factor analysis indicated that the four-factor structure, which included 16 items, accounted for 54.12% of the total variance, and was characterized by strong factor loadings, with values ranging from .50 to .87. Thereafter, a confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the four-factor latent structure of the SOBI, providing adequate data-model fit statistics. All latent structures were characterized by adequate-to-strong latent construct (H) internal reliability (α) coefficients. CONCLUSIONS The Persian version of the SOBI is a useful tool in understanding older adult patients' sense of belonging when living independently within the community. The implications for practice and research are discussed.","Allen, Kelly-Ann; Arslan, Gökmen; Craig, Heather; Arefi, Sedigheh; Yaghoobzadeh, Ameneh; Sharif Nia, Hamid",BMC geriatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02115-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33781233/,574

The current state of internal medicine (IM) interns' telehealth training at the start of residency is unknown. Objective: To characterize the attitudes, training, and preparedness of IM interns regarding the use of telehealth video and phone visits in ambulatory care. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of IM interns at four IM residency programs in the United States in 2020. Results: One hundred fifty-six surveys were analyzed (response rate 82%). Seventy-five percent of interns rated training in the use of real-time video and phone visits for ambulatory care as important or very important. The vast majority received no training (74%) or clinical experience (90% no prior video visits, 81% no prior phone visits) during medical school. More interns believed that primary care may be effectively delivered via video visits compared with phone visits (77% vs. 35%). Most interns (69%) missed clinical time during medical school due to the COVID-19 pandemic; 41% felt that the pandemic negatively affected their ambulatory care preparation. Overall, the majority of interns (58%) felt prepared for primary care; only 12% felt prepared to deliver primary care using either video or phone visits. Conclusions: Although IM interns had favorable attitudes toward video and phone visits, few had training or clinical experience; most felt unprepared. Residency programs may need to close training gaps for current interns in conducting telehealth video and phone visits.","Wong, Christopher J; Nath, Julia B; Pincavage, Amber T; Bird, Amber; Oyler, Julie L; Gill, Katherine; Kimel-Scott, Karen; Palecek, Eric; Overland, Maryann K",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085854/,574

Drug-induced respiratory depression is a major cause of serious adverse effects during sedation. Capnographic monitoring of respiratory activity improves patient safety during procedural sedation. This bench study compares the performance of the nasal cannulas and oral bite blocks used to monitor exhaled CO2 during sedation. We used a spontaneously breathing mechanical lung to evaluated four CO2 sampling nasal cannulas and three CO2 sampling bite blocks. We placed pneumatic resistors in the mouth of the manikin to simulate different levels of mouth opening. We compared CO2 measurements taken from the sampling device to CO2 measurements taken directly from the trachea. The end tidal CO2 concentration (PETCO2) measured through the bite blocks and nasal cannulas was always lower than the corresponding PETCO2 measured at the trachea. The difference became larger as the amount of oxygen delivered through the devices increased. The difference was larger during normal ventilation than during hypoventilation. The difference became larger as the amount of oral breathing increased. The two nasal cannulas without oral cups failed to provide sufficient CO2 for breath detection when the mouth was fully open and oxygen was delivered at 10 L/min. Our simulation found that respiratory rate can be accurately monitored during the procedure using a CO2 sampling bite block or a nasal cannula with oral cup. The accuracy of PETCO2 measurements depends on the device used, the amount of supplement oxygen, the amount of oral breathing and the patient's minute ventilation.","Chang, Kuo-Chen; Orr, Joe; Hsu, Wei-Chih; Yu, Lu; Tsou, Mei-Yung; Westenskow, Dwayne R; Ting, Chien-Kun",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-015-9696-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25895481/,574

We have demonstrated previously that the open reading frame 45 (ORF45) of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus interacts with p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) and strongly stimulates their kinase activities ( Kuang, E., Tang, Q., Maul, G. G., and Zhu, F. (2008) J. Virol. 82, 1838-1850 ). Here, we define the mechanism by which ORF45 activates RSKs. We demonstrated that binding of ORF45 to RSK increases the association of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) with RSK, such that ORF45, RSK, and ERK formed high molecular mass protein complexes. We further demonstrated that the complexes shielded active pERK and pRSK from dephosphorylation. As a result, the complex-associated RSK and ERK were activated and sustained at high levels. Finally, we provide evidence that this mechanism contributes to the sustained activation of ERK and RSK in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic replication.","Kuang, Ersheng; Wu, Fayi; Zhu, Fanxiu",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m900025200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19304659/,574

Factors such as increased social media exposure, weight gain memes, and peer conversations about appearance during lockdown might be the potential contributing factors, which need further exploration. The study examined the contribution of 'fat talk' and societal influences in determining body dissatisfaction among Indian women. The likely content of the 'fat talk' during the lockdown was also analyzed. METHODS The study followed a cross-sectional online based design. Participants comprised of 265 women, aged 15 to 50 years. The Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ-8c), Sociocultural Attitudes toward Appearance Questionnaire (SATAQ-3), and Negative Body Talk Scale were used to measure body satisfaction, societal influences, and fat talk respectively. Further, participants were asked to respond to a friend's comment about her supposed weight gain in the pandemic (fat talk). RESULTS Fat talk, social influence, weight, and age were significantly correlated with body dissatisfaction. Multiple Regression models indicated that fat talk, social influence, weight, and age accounted for 53.33% of the variance in body satisfaction. Thematic analysis of responses to fat-talk conversations revealed two dominant themes: focus on exercise and diet, as well as acknowledging weight gain and normalizing it in the context of the pandemic. CONCLUSION Fat talk amongst peers, societal influence and body-image stereotypes were the most potent contributors in determining body dissatisfaction among Indian women during the pandemic, which can contribute to significant dysfunction. These factors need addressal in the socio-cultural context through health campaigns, interpersonal strategies, and more positive and constructive forms of weight and body image-related communication.","Ahuja, Kanika K; Khandelwal, Ananya; Banerjee, Debanjan",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764021992814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33541182/,574

Emerging data suggest that a ""Rapid Drink Challenge"" (RDC) increases sensitivity for motility disorders. This study establishes normal values and diagnostic thresholds for RDC in clinical practice. METHODS Two cohort studies were performed in patients with dysphagia or reflux symptoms (development and validation sets). Healthy subjects and patient controls provided reference values. Ten SWS and two 200-mL RDC were performed. Primary diagnosis for SWS was established by the Chicago Classification. Abnormal RDC was defined by impaired esophagogastric junction (EGJ) function (elevated integrated relaxation pressure during RDC [IRP-RDC]); incomplete inhibition of contractility during and ineffective contraction after RDC. Diagnostic thresholds identified in the development set were prospectively tested in the validation set. RESULTS Normal values were determined in healthy (n=95; age 37.8 ± 12) and patient controls (n=44; age 46.4 ± 15). Development and validation sets included 178 (54 ± 17 years) and 226 (53 ± 16 years) patients, respectively. Integrated relaxation pressure during RDC was higher for SWS than RDC in all groups (overall P<.001), except achalasia. Rapid Drink Challenge suppressed contractility, except in achalasia type III, spasm, and hypercontractile motility disorders (P<.001). An effective after-contraction was present more often in health than disease (P<.001).

105848,Reduced long noncoding RNA PGM5-AS1 facilitated proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer through sponging miR-100-5p.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Acid mist can suspend in the air and enter the body via skin contact, the respiratory tract, or even oral intake, which pose various health hazards. Previous studies have shown that occupational exposure to acid mist or acidic solutions is a major risk factor for oral diseases. However, the findings are inconsistent and do not consider individual factors and lifestyles that may cause the same oral diseases. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive oral health survey and collected detail information to confirm the effect of acidic solution exposure on worker's oral health. METHODS From 4 acidic solution factories, a total of 309 subjects (157 in control and 152 in exposed group) was enrolled. All participants competed oral examinations and self-report questionnaire, including the decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index, community periodontal index (CPI), loss of attachment (LA) index, and tooth erosion. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between the acidic solution exposure and oral health. RESULTS The results showed that acid exposure was correlated with soft oral tissue injury rather than hard oral tissue in our survey. In the multivariate model (adjusted for sex, age, worked years, education level, mouthwash use, dental floss use, tooth brushing, mask use, smoking, drinking, chewing areca and dietary habits with acidic foods), significant relationships of acid exposure with LA score were observed (OR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.03-5.26). However, the presence of acid exposure was not significantly associated with tooth erosion, DMFT, and CPITN. CONCLUSION Our study highlighted that occupational acid exposure was an independent risk factor for periodontal health, especially LA. It is important to strengthen occupational hazard control, educate workers on oral disease and related factors, and raise the awareness of oral hygiene.","Chen, Wei-Liang; Chen, Yuan-Yuei; Wu, Wei-Te; Lai, Ching-Huang; Sun, Yu-Shan; Wang, Chung-Ching",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09496-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894125/,574

In the 1970s and 1980s infusion pumps began to emerge in the UK market and were basic, mechanical devices with limited functions. Today, infusion pumps have a plethora of functions and features and a range of alarms to help alert the user and the patient that infusions are nearing completion, have ended or their range of sensors has detected that the infusion pump, or patient, requires attention. The role of the nurse in safely managing this ever-changing technology should not be underestimated. This paper reviews the progress made over the past 40 years in the UK healthcare setting and how the nurses have had to keep up to speed with the technology as it develops. It highlights the importance of fully integrating infusion pumps into intravenous (IV) therapy training and assessment. The important role the nurse plays is highlighted as well as exploring how he or she can help organisations better understand infusion pumps in the day-to-day management of patients undergoing intravenous therapy.","Lee, Paul",British journal of nursing,https://doi.org/10.12968/bjon.2015.24.sup19.s30; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26496875/,574

Groups of photosensitive birds were exposed for four weeks to resonance light dark cycles comprising of a light phase of 6 h (L) combined with dark phase of different durations (D) such that the period of LD cycles varied by 12 h increments viz. 12- (6 L/6D), 24- (6 L/18D), 36- (6 L/30D), 48- (6 L/42D), 60- (6 L/54D) and 72- (6 L/66D)h. In addition, a control group (C) was maintained under long day length (14 L/10D). Observations, recorded at the beginning and end of experiment, revealed significant testicular growth with corresponding increase in the hypothalamic expression of GnRH-I peptide but low levels of GnIH mRNA and peptide in the birds exposed to resonance cycles of 12, 36 and 60 h which were read as long days. On the other hand, birds experiencing resonance cycles of 24, 48 and 72 h read them as short days wherein they maintained their quiescent gonads and low levels of GnRH-I peptide but exhibited significant increase in GnIH mRNA and peptide expressions. Thus, sparrows responded to resonance light dark cycles differently despite the fact that each of them contained only 6 h of light. These findings suggest that an endogenous circadian rhythm is involved in photoperiodic expressions of above molecules and indicate a shift in their expressions depending upon whether the light falls in the photoinducible or non-photoinducible phase of an endogenous circadian rhythm.","Dixit, Anand S; Byrsat, Sanborlang; Singh, Namram Sushindrajit","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

As there is a paucity of randomized studies, this expert consensus document represents an initiative by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society to provide guidance on their management. PATIENTS AND METHODS Bibliographical searches were carried out in PubMed for the terms 'pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors', 'bronchial neuroendocrine tumors', 'bronchial carcinoid tumors', 'pulmonary carcinoid', 'pulmonary typical/atypical carcinoid', and 'pulmonary carcinoid and diagnosis/treatment/epidemiology/prognosis'. A systematic review of the relevant literature was carried out, followed by expert review. RESULTS PCs are well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and include low- and intermediate-grade malignant tumors, i.e. typical (TC) and atypical carcinoid (AC), respectively. Contrast CT scan is the diagnostic gold standard for PCs, but pathology examination is mandatory for their correct classification. Somatostatin receptor imaging may visualize nearly 80% of the primary tumors and is most sensitive for metastatic disease. Plasma chromogranin A can be increased in PCs. Surgery is the treatment of choice for PCs with the aim of removing the tumor and preserving as much lung tissue as possible. Resection of metastases should be considered whenever possible with curative intent. Somatostatin analogs are the first-line treatment of carcinoid syndrome and may be considered as first-line systemic antiproliferative treatment in unresectable PCs, particularly of low-grade TC and AC. Locoregional or radiotargeted therapies should be considered for metastatic disease. Systemic chemotherapy is used for progressive PCs, although cytotoxic regimens have demonstrated limited effects with etoposide and platinum combination the most commonly used, however, temozolomide has shown most clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS PCs are complex tumors which require a multidisciplinary approach and long-term follow-up.","Caplin, M E; Baudin, E; Ferolla, P; Filosso, P; Garcia-Yuste, M; Lim, E; Oberg, K; Pelosi, G; Perren, A; Rossi, R E; Travis, W D",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdv041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25646366/,574
134647,"Mechanism of RET gene mediated EGFR signaling pathway on epithelial-mesenchymal transition, proliferation and apoptosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma cells.",2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND To satisfy the increasing demand of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke treatment, new organizational concepts for patient care are required. This study evaluates time intervals of acute stroke management in two stroke care models, including one based on transportation of the interventionalist from a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) to treat patients in two primary stroke centers (PSC). We hypothesized that time intervals were not inferior for the 'drip-and-drive' concept compared with the traditional 'drip-and-ship' concept. METHODS Patients treated with MT at the PSC ('drip-and-drive', 'D+D group') were compared with patients transferred from PSC to CSC for MT ('drip-and-ship', 'D+S group') with regard to time delays. Time intervals assessed were: symptom onset to initial CT, to angiography, and to recanalization; time from initial CT to telephone call activation, to arrival, and to angiography; and time from telephone call activation to arrival and from arrival to angiography. RESULTS 42 patients were treated at the PSC after transfer of the interventionalist, and 32 patients were transferred to the CSC for MT. The groups did not differ with regard to median Onset-CT and CT-Phone times. Significant differences between the groups were found for the primary outcome measure CT-Arrival time ('D+D group': median 121 (IQR 108-134) min vs 181 (157-219) min for the 'D+S group'; P<0.001). Time difference between the groups increased to more than 2 hours for median CT-Angio times (median 123 (IQR 93-147) min vs 252 (228-275) min; P<0.001). CONCLUSION Time intervals for the 'D+D group' were not inferior to those of the 'D+S group'. Moreover, under certain conditions, the 'drip-and-drive' concept might even be superior.","Brekenfeld, Caspar; Goebell, Einar; Schmidt, Holger; Henningsen, Henning; Kraemer, Christoffer; Tebben, Jörg; Flottmann, Fabian; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29436505/,574
135104,Prescribing patterns and clinical outcomes of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis in Spain.,2020-08-01,"To determine how different constituents of pulmonary surfactant affect its phase behavior, we measured wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from oriented bilayers. Samples contained the nonpolar and phospholipids (N&PL) obtained from calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE), which also contains the hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C. Mixtures with different ratios of N&PL and CLSE provided the same set of lipids with different amounts of the proteins. At 37 °C, N&PL by itself forms coexisting Lα and Lβ phases. In the Lβ structure, the acyl chains of the phospholipids occupy an ordered array that has melted by 40 °C. This behavior suggests that the Lβ composition is dominated by dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which is the most prevalent component of CLSE. The Lβ chains, however, lack the tilt of the Lβ' phase formed by pure DPPC. At 40 °C, WAXS also detects an additional diffracted intensity, the location of which suggests a correlation among the phospholipid headgroups. The mixed samples of N&PL with CLSE show that increasing amounts of the proteins disrupt both the Lβ phase and the headgroup correlation. With physiological levels of the proteins in CLSE, both types of order are absent. These results with bilayers at physiological temperatures indicate that the hydrophobic surfactant proteins disrupt the ordered structures that have long been considered essential for the ability of pulmonary surfactant to sustain low surface tensions. They agree with prior fluorescence micrographic results from monomolecular films of CLSE, suggesting that at physiological temperatures, any ordered phase is likely to be absent or occupy a minimal interfacial area.","Fritz, Jonathan R; Loney, Ryan W; Hall, Stephen B; Tristram-Nagle, Stephanie",Biophysical journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.12.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347885/,574

156814,MiR-182-5p inhibited proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells by targeting BNIP3.,2019,"The first influenza pandemic of the new millennium was caused by a newly emerged swine-origin influenza virus (SOIV) (H1N1). This new virus is characterized by a previously unknown constellation of gene segments derived from North American and Eurasian swine lineages and the absence of common markers predictive of human adaptation. Overall, human infections appeared to be mild, but an alarming number of young individuals presented with symptoms atypical for seasonal influenza. The new SOIV also showed a sustained human-to-human transmissibility and higher reproduction ratio than common seasonal viruses, altogether indicating a higher pathogenic potential for this newly emerged virus. To study the virulence of the SOIV, we used a recently established cynomolgus macaque model and compared parameters of clinical disease, virology, host responses, and pathology/histopathology with a current seasonal H1N1 virus. We here show that infection of macaques with two genetically similar but clinically distinct SOIV isolates from the early stage of the pandemic (A/Mexico/4108/2009 and A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009) resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infections and clinical disease ranging from mild to severe pneumonia that was clearly advanced over the mild infection caused by A/Kawasaki/UTK-4/2009, a current seasonal strain. Unexpectedly, we observed heterogeneity among the two SOIV isolates in virus replication, host transcriptional and cytokine responses, and disease progression, demonstrating a higher pathogenic potential for A/Mexico/InDRE4487/2009. Differences in virulence may explain more severe disease, as was seen with certain individuals infected with the emerged pandemic influenza virus.

Our aim was to explore the relationship between hand washing frequency and the impact on disease, and give recommendations on the number of times to wash hands. Methods We searched seven electronic databases from their inception to April 11, 2020, and reference lists of related reviews for all studies on hand washing frequency and disease prevention. The Review Manager 5.3. software was used to conduct a meta-analysis. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies, and quality of evidence of the main findings. Results A total of eight studies were included. The results of the meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical significance between the effect of disease prevention and washing more than 4 times/day compared to not [odds ratio (OR) =0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37 to 1.01]. The results of a case-control study showed that compared with hand washing ≤4 times/day, hand washing 5-10 times/day (OR =0.75, 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.91) and hand washing >10 times/day (OR =0.65, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.80) could reduce the risk of disease infection. There was no statistical significance advantage to hand washing more than 10 times/day compared to 5-10 times/day (OR =0.86, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.06). Comparing hand washing ≤10 times/day with hand washing >10 times/day, increased hand washing was a protective factor against infection (OR =0.59, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.97). Conclusions The more frequently hands were washed, the lower risk of disease.

The Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM) programme consisted of three parallel, randomised, double-blind clinical trials comparing candesartan with placebo in patients with heart failure (HF) categorised according to left ventricular ejection fraction and tolerability to an ACE inhibitor. We conducted a pharmacogenomic study of the CHARM studies to identify genetic predictors of heart failure progression and the efficacy and safety of treatment with candesartan. Methods. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure in 2727 patients from CHARM-Overall and stratified by CHARM study according to preserved and reduced ejection fraction. The safety endpoints were hyperkalaemia, renal dysfunction, hypotension, and change in systolic blood pressure. We also conducted a genome-wide gene-level collapsing analysis from whole-exome sequencing data with the composite cardiovascular endpoint. Results. We found the genetic variant rs66886237 at 8p21.3 near the gene GFRA2 to be associated with the composite cardiovascular endpoint in 1029 HF patients with preserved ejection fraction from the CHARM-Preserved study [hazard ratio (HR): 1.91, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.55-2.35; P=1.7x10-9], but not in patients with reduced ejection fraction. None of the GWAS for candesartan safety or efficacy passed the significance threshold. Conclusions. We have identified a candidate genetic variant potentially predictive of the progression of heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction.

Galectin-3 is known to play a key role in the inflammation and fibrosis process. We aimed to evaluate the predictive role of Galectin-3 levels for pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Total of 176 patients with COVID-19, confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, admitted to the Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital was analyzed. The study was designed as a cross sectional. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including galectin-3 were collected at the time of diagnosis. CT images evaluated by a single radiologist according to the recommendation of the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Document for pulmonary involvement. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was assessed using the total severity score. RESULTS: The mean Galectin-3 level in patients with typical pneumonia was found to be significantly higher than those patients with atypical (p<0.01) and indeterminate appearance (p<0.01) and patients without pneumonia (p: <0.01). The severity of lung involvement was significantly associated with Galectin-3 levels (p<0.01 r: 0.76). Stepwise logistic regression model showed that the levels of ferritin (odds ratio [OR] = 0.05, p:0.08) and Galectin-3 (OR = 0.1, p:<0.01) were significantly and independently associated with typical pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.

326434,Corrigendum: The Nature of Hydrogen Adsorption on Platinum in the Aqueous Phase,2020,"Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases and fatalities worldwide. Outbreaks in US nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions beginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing homes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland, WA, to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff connections between nursing homes-and the role these connections serve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection-is currently unknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility employment. We perform a large-scale analysis of nursing home connections via shared staff and contractors using device-level geolocation data from 50 million smartphones, and find that 5.1% of smartphone users who visited a nursing home for at least 1 h also visited another facility during our 11-wk study period-even after visitor restrictions were imposed. We construct network measures of connectedness and estimate that nursing homes, on average, share connections with 7.1 other facilities. Traditional federal regulatory metrics of nursing home quality are unimportant in predicting outbreaks, consistent with recent research. Controlling for demographic and other factors, a home's staff network connections and its centrality within the greater network strongly predict COVID-19 cases.","Chen, M Keith; Chevalier, Judith A; Long, Elisa F",Proc.

354824,Quinacrine as a potential treatment for COVID-19 virus infection,2021,"Spell check is a useful application which processes noisy human-generated text. Spell check for Chinese poses unresolved problems due to the large number of characters, the sparse distribution of errors, and the dearth of resources with sufficient coverage of heterogeneous and shifting error domains. For Chinese spell check, filtering using confusion sets narrows the search space and makes finding corrections easier. However, most, if not all, confusion sets used to date are fixed and thus do not include new, shifting error domains. We propose a scalable adaptable filter that exploits hierarchical character embeddings to (1) obviate the need to handcraft confusion sets, and (2) resolve sparsity problems related to infrequent errors. Our approach compares favorably with competitive baselines and obtains SOTA results on the 2014 and 2015 Chinese Spelling Check Bake-off datasets.","Nguyen, Minh; Ngo, Gia H.; Chen, Nancy F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12281v3.pdf,574

In the chaotic modern society, there is an increasing demand for the realisation of true ‘fairness’. In this study, we propose a fair distribution method ‘using physics’, which imitates the Greek mythology, Themis, having a ‘balance of judgement’ in her left hand, for the profit in games of characteristic function form. Specifically, we show that the linear programming problem for calculating ‘nucleolus (a solution for the fair distribution)’ can be efficiently solved by considering it as a physical system in which gravity works. In addition to significantly reducing the computational complexity, the proposed scheme provides a new perspective to open up a physics-based policymaker that is adaptable to real-time changes. We will be able to implement it not only in liquid systems but also in many other physical systems, including semiconductor chips. The fair distribution problem can be solved immediately using physical systems, which should reduce disputes and conflicts based on inaccurate information and misunderstandings, eliminating fraud and injustice.","Song-Ju, Kim Takahashi Taiki Sano Kazuo",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,,574

As healthcare system performance and medical education are directly and reciprocally linked, a substantial part of healthcare services' dysfunctions could be partially attributed to the training of the young doctors. Thus, in order to improve the performance of the healthcare system in the best interest of patients and communities, the education of healthcare personnel should be a priority. By reviewing the existing literature in combination with our experience we attempt to delineate the weak points of the undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Greece. Additionally, based on medical curricula from other countries, we suggest reforms in order to achieve a uniform, clinically oriented, emphasis on training in public health issues in undergraduate medical education. Reforms are also suggested for postgraduate training with regard not only to specialization curricula, but also to the accredited institutions which provide specialty training. Finally, the necessity for Continuing Medical Education (CME) is underlined; medical education must have a continuum that begins with undergraduate training but does not end there; it is life-long learning.","Cinoku, Ilir I; Zampeli, Evangelia; Moutsopoulos, Haralampos M",Med Teach,,574

Simultaneously, planned renovation of the campus swine teaching farm required depopulation of the existing herd. Hence, animal access for course laboratories was restricted for the 2020 spring and fall semesters. The objective is to present strategies to achieve effective laboratory learning objectives with limited livestock access. Average course enrollment in 2020 spring and fall semesters was 11 students of junior and senior standing. The course laboratory was held for two hours weekly for fifteen weeks. COVID-19 interruption of the spring semester, and arrival of pigs to the campus swine teaching farm in the fall semester, necessitated creation of ten equivalent laboratory sessions per semester. Example laboratory sessions include: panels with swine industry professionals, Pork Quality Assurance version 4.0 certification, virtual farm tours, evaluating genetic merit with National Swine Registry Swine Testing and Genetic Evaluation System EPD data and indexes, understanding leastcost diet formulation with diet formulation software, creating and implementing a Secure Pork Supply enhanced biosecurity plan for the campus swine farm, and multiple case study models of troubleshooting reproductive deficiencies with the US Pork Center of Excellence National Swine Reproduction Guide. Laboratory session execution facilitated achievement of TAMU Department of Animal Science programmatic learning outcomes, specifically: understanding animal breeding programs, animal husbandry, reproductive management, and nutrient conversion, and assessing business models and application of animal management strategies. In future semesters with unrestricted swine access for teaching, live-animal handling will be emphasized in the syllabus, yet preservation of effective classroom-based laboratories will persist. These methods have value for instructors operating without campus swine resources and those whose laboratory content has been impacted by COVID-19 disruption.

Moreover, as COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets, it is critical to understand how to mitigate these risks during assessment and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To promote safety, and effective clinical practice to voice assessment and rehabilitation in the pandemic COVID-19 context for speech-language pathologists. METHODS: A group of 11 experts in voice and swallowing disorders from five different countries conducted a consensus recommendation following the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery rules building a clinical guide for speech-language pathologists during this pandemic context. RESULT: The clinical guide provides 79 recommendations for clinicians in the management of voice disorders during the pandemic and includes advice from assessment, direct treatment, telepractice, and teamwork. The consensus was reached 95% for all topics. CONCLUSION: This guideline should be taken only as recommendation; each clinician must attempt to mitigate the risk of infection and achieve the best therapeutic results taking into account the patient's particular reality.","Castillo-Allendes, Adrián; Contreras-Ruston, Francisco; Cantor, Lady; Codino, Juliana; Guzman, Marco; Malebran, Celina; Manzano, Carlos; Pavez, Axel; Vaiano, Thays; Wilder, Fabiana; Behlau, Mara",J. voice,,574

This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children with cancer or hematologic disorders treated at a large children's hospital. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020. All patients with a primary hematology-oncology diagnosis and SARS-CoV-2 positivity by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were identified. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical record. Descriptive analyses were performed to evaluate COVID-19-related outcomes and risk factors for severe disease in this population. We identified 109 patients with COVID-19 disease, including 52 hematology, 51 oncology, and 6 HSCT patients; median age was 10.3 years (IQR 4.4-15.9), and 58.7% were male. Seventy-four percent of the patients were managed in the outpatient setting. Patients with sickle cell disease were more likely to require hospitalization. ICU care was needed in 8% (n = 9) of the entire cohort, and mechanical ventilation was required in 6.4% (6 oncology patients, 1 hematology patient). COVID-19 contributed to the deaths of two cancer patients. No deaths occurred in hematology or HSCT patients.

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 76 controls and 41 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (AOR 0.27, 95% CI, 0.15–0.51) was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Those involved in physical activity (AOR 3.06 95% CI, 1.18–7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION: Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 μg/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated with a 73% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers for the following month. Chemoprophylaxis has relevance in the containment of pandemic.","Behera, Priyamadhaba; Patro, Binod Kumar; Singh, Arvind Kumar; Chandanshive, Pradnya Dilip; S.

METHODS: We used homozygous (+/+) and heterozygous (+/−) human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) transgenic mice to study the effect of hDPP4 on MERS-CoV infection. Specifically, we determined values of 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of MERS-CoV for the 2 strains of mice, compared and correlated their levels of soluble (s)hDPP4 expression to susceptibility, and explored recombinant (r)shDPP4 as an effective MCM for MERS infection. RESULTS: hDPP4(+/+) mice were unexpectedly more resistant than hDPP4(+/−) mice to MERS-CoV infection, as judged by increased LD(50), reduced lung viral infection, attenuated morbidity and mortality, and reduced histopathology. Additionally, the resistance to MERS-CoV infection directly correlated with increased serum shDPP4 and serum virus neutralizing activity. Finally, administration of rshDPP4 led to reduced lung virus titer and histopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest that the serum shDPP4 levels play a role in MERS pathogenesis and demonstrate a potential of rshDPP4 as a treatment option for MERS. Additionally, it offers a validated pair of Tg mice strains for characterizing the effect of shDPP4 on MERS pathogenesis.","Algaissi, Abdullah; Agrawal, Anurodh S; Han, Song; Peng, Bi-Hung; Luo, Chuming; Li, Fang; Chan, Teh-Sheng; Couch, Robert B; Tseng, Chien-Te K",The Journal of Infectious Diseases,https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-pdf/219/5/829/27785783/jiy574.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30256968/,574

640012,Emerging Viral Infections in India,2012-01-18,"The current integrative literature review examined the existing evidence on the connection between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and cognitive changes in African American older adults. Using the Covidence platform, several databases were searched, resulting in 266 publications dated 2008-2020. Ten articles met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Findings indicate that four ACEs (physical, sexual, and verbal abuse, and low socioeconomic status) are associated with impaired cognition in African American older adults. Four gaps were identified: lack of (a) older adult participants in research investigating original and expanded ACEs; (b) exclusively African American samples of participants in studies examining the relationship between ACEs and cognition; (c) consensus about what specific ACEs contribute to changes in cognition in older adults; and (d) information about successful interventions created to prevent and mitigate the effects of ACEs in older adults. This review provides a synthesis of the limited evidence on the effects of ACEs on cognition among other outcomes. Findings on the effects of ACEs on African American older adults' cognition are limited, thus making a compelling case for further investigating the role of childhood adversity in the disparity of cognitive changes in African American communities.

Titania (TiO(2)) nanocomposite antimicrobial coatings is one of the ideal remedies to disinfect pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi) from common surfaces under light illumination. The photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of recent TiO(2) nanocomposite antimicrobial coatings for surfaces, dental and orthopaedic implants are emphasized in this review. Mostly, inorganic metals (e.g. copper (Cu), silver (Ag), manganese (Mn), etc), non-metals (e.g. fluorine (F), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P)) and two-dimensional materials (e.g. MXenes, MOF, graphdiyne) were incorporated with TiO(2) to regulate the charge transfer mechanism, surface porosity, crystallinity, and the microbial disinfection efficiency. The antimicrobial activity of TiO(2) coatings was evaluated against the most crucial pathogenic microbes such as Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, T2 bacteriophage, H1N1, HCoV-NL63, vesicular stomatitis virus, bovine coronavirus. Silane functionalizing agents and polymers were used to coat the titanium (Ti) metal implants to introduce superhydrophobic features to avoid the microbial adhesion. TiO(2) nanocomposite coatings in dental and orthopaedic metal implants disclosed an exceptional bio-corrosion resistance, durability, biocompatibility, bone-formation capability, and long-term antimicrobial efficiency. Moreover, the commercial trend, techno-economics, challenges, and prospects of antimicrobial nanocomposite coatings are also discussed briefly.","Kumaravel, Vignesh; Nair, Keerthi M.; Mathew, Snehamol; Bartlett, John; Kennedy, James E.; Manning, Hugh G.; Whelan, Barry J.; Leyland, Nigel S.; Pillai, Suresh C.",Chem Eng J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642937/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1385894721006628; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.129071; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894721006628?v=s5,574

The sample consisted of 1578 Brazilian adults aged 18–73 years who answered facets from the PID-5, the Affective resonance factor of the ACME, and a questionnaire about compliance with containment measures. Latent profile analyses indicated a 2-profile solution: the antisocial pattern profile which presented higher scores in Callousness, Deceitfulness, Hostility, Impulsivity, Irresponsibility, Manipulativeness, and Risk-taking, as well as lower scores in Affective resonance; and the empathy pattern profile which presented higher scores in Affective resonance and lower scores in ASPD typical traits. The latent profile groups showed significant differences between them and interaction with the containment measures and weeks. The antisocial and empathy groups showed significant differences. These differences were sustained in the interaction with the containment measures and weeks separately, but not when all were interacting together. Our findings indicated that antisocial traits, especially lower levels of empathy and higher levels of Callousness, Deceitfulness, and Risk-taking, are directly associated with lower compliance with containment measures. These traits explain, at least partially, the reason why people continue not adhering to the containment measures even with increasing numbers of cases and deaths.","Miguel, Fabiano Koich; Machado, Gisele Magarotto; Pianowski, Giselle; Carvalho, Lucas de Francisco",Pers Individ Dif,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305377?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32863507/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110346; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920305377,574

Chest radiographs and Computed Tomography (CT) are principal radiological modalities to assess the lung abnormalities. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to investigate the chest images characteristic of H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of 11 cases diagnosed as H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza were collected from 4 cities in the southern region of the Yangtze River, China. The chest imaging manifestations were analyzed by the assigned expert group. The analyzed cases include 7 males and 4 females aged from 20 to 84 years, with a mean of 55.6 years. The clinical symptoms were mainly fever (100%, 11/11) and cough (72.7%, 8/11). RESULTS: Segmental or lobar ground-glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation was shown in 8 cases (72.7% or 8/11). Air bronchogram was found in 7 cases (63.6% or 7/11). The lesions developed into multiple or diffuse in both lungs rapidly at the progressive stage.

Recent research has revealed that non-coding RNAs can be found in extracellular vesicles consistent with a functional importance of these molecular vehicles in virus propagation and suggesting that these essential membrane-bound bodies can be highjacked by viruses to promote disease pathogenesis. Newly emerging evidence that coronaviruses generate non-coding RNAs and use extracellular vesicles to facilitate viral pathogenicity may have important implications for the development of effective strategies to combat COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

Prior data on seroprevalence have been subject to variations in selection of individuals and nature as well as timing of testing in relation to exposures. Objective: We sought to determine the extent of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalance and the factors associated with seroprevelance across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers. Design: Observational cohort study of healthcare workers, including SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and participant questionaires. Participants: A diverse and unselected population of adults (n=6,062) employed in a multi-site healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County, including individuals with direct patient contact and others with non-patient-oriented work functions. Exposure: Exposure and infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as determined by seropositivity. Main Outcomes: Using Bayesian and multi-variate analyses, we estimated seroprevalence and factors associated with seropositivity and antibody titers, including pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics; potential Covid-19 illness related exposures; and, symptoms consistent with Covid-19 infection. Results: We observed a seroprevalence rate of 4.1%, with anosmia as the most prominently associated self-reported symptom in addition to fever, dry cough, anorexia, and myalgias. After adjusting for potential confounders, pre-existing medical conditions were not associated with antibody positivity. However, seroprevalence was associated with younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, and African-American race, as well as presence of either a personal or household member having a prior diagnosis of Covid-19. Importantly, African American race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with antibody positivity even after adjusting for personal Covid-19 diagnosis status, suggesting the contribution of unmeasured structural or societally factors. Notably, number of people, or children, in the home was not associated with antibody positivity. Conclusion and Relevance: The demographic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among our healthcare workers underscore the importance of exposure sources beyond the workplace. The size and diversity of our study population, combined with robust survey and modeling techniques, provide a vibrant picture of the demographic factors, exposures, and symptoms that can identify individuals with susceptibility as well as potential to mount an immune response to Covid-19.","Ebinger, J.; Botwin, G.

There are several proteins interplay during the entry and replication of this virus in human. Here, we have used text mining and named entity recognition method to identify co-occurrence of the important COVID 19 genes/proteins in the interaction network based on the frequency of the interaction. Network analysis revealed a set of genes/proteins, highly dense genes/protein clusters and sub-networks of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Helicase, spike (S) protein (trimeric), membrane (M) protein, envelop (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The isolated proteins are screened against procyanidin-a flavonoid from plants using molecular docking. Further, molecular dynamics simulation of critical proteins such as ACE2, Mpro and spike proteins are performed to elucidate the inhibition mechanism. The strong network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions along with van der Waals interactions inhibit receptors, which are essential to the entry and replication of the SARS-CoV-2. The binding energy which largely arises from van der Waals interactions is calculated (ACE2=-50.21 ± 6.3, Mpro=-89.50 ± 6.32 and spike=-23.06 ± 4.39) through molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area also confirm the affinity of procyanidin towards the critical receptors.
