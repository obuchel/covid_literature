2770,2770,2770,Importance of whole genome sequencing for the assessment of outbreaks in diagnostic laboratories: analysis of a case series of invasive Streptococcus pyogenes infections,13.606473,11.639559,2017-01-26,"Outbreaks of Streptococcus pyogenes hypervirulent clones are constant public health threats. In western Switzerland, an increase of severe cases of S. pyogenes invasive infections was observed between December 2015 and March 2016. Our aim was (i) to investigate these cases by the use of Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and (ii) to determine the specific virulome and resistome of each isolate in order to undertake adequate public health measures. Eleven Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from 11 patients with severe invasive infections between December 13, 2015 and March 12, 2016 were included in our study. Practically, emm-typing, MLST and WGS were used to investigate the relatedness between the isolates. The presence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes as well as mutations in transcriptional regulators of virulence and in genes encoding for antibiotic targets were assessed. Three and two groups of isolates shared the same emm-type and ST type, respectively. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed 14 to 32 SNPs between the strains of the same emm-type group, ruling out the possibility of a clonal outbreak. Mutations found in covS and rocA could partially explain an increased virulence. As these reassuring results were obtained in less than 10 days, no specific hospital hygiene and no dedicated public health measures had to be undertaken. WGS is a powerful technique to discriminate between closely related strains, excluding an outbreak in less than 10 days. Moreover, WGS provided extensive data on the virulome and resistome of all these strains.

Previous investigations have focused predominantly on the prospective identification of cases that meet researchers’ specific criteria. The genuine demand from patients with regard to information on PE and related issues may thus be neglected. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the online search trend and user demand related to PE on a national and regional scale using the dominant major search engine in mainland China. METHODS: The Baidu Index was queried using the PE-related terms for the period of January 2011 to December 2020. The search volume for each term was recorded to analyze the search trend and demographic distributions. For user interest, the demand and trend data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 36 available PE search keywords, 4 PE searching topics were identified. The Baidu Search Index for each PE topic varied from 46.30% (86,840,487/187,558,154) to 6.40% (12,009,307/187,558,154). The annual percent change (APC) for the complaint topic was 48.80% (P<.001) for 2011 to 2014 and –16.82% (P<.001) for 2014 to 2020. The APC for the inquiry topic was 16.21% (P=.41) for 2011 to 2014 and –11.00% (P<.001) for 2014 to 2020. For the prognosis topic, the annual APC was 11.18% (P<.001) for 2011 to 2017 and –19.86% (P<.001) for 2017 to 2020. For the treatment topic, the annual APC was 14.04% (P<.001) for 2011 to 2016 and –38.83% (P<.001) for 2016 to 2020. The age distribution of those searching for topics related to PE showed that the population aged 20 to 40 years comprised nearly 70% of the total search inquiries (second was 17.95% in the age group younger than 19 years). People from East China made over 50% of the total search queries. CONCLUSIONS: The fluctuating online popularity of PE searches reflects the real-time population demands. It may help medical professionals better understand population interest, population concerns, regional variations, and gender differences on a nationwide scale and make disease-specific health care policies. The internet search data could be more reliable when the insufficient and lagging registry data are completed.","Wei, Shanzun; Ma, Ming; Wen, Xi; Wu, Changjing; Zhu, Guonian; Zhou, Xiangfu",J Med Internet Res,717,1

Most PDAC patients receive chemotherapy, which often worsens their nutritional status owing to the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Malnutrition of PDAC patients is known to be associated with poor prognosis; therefore, nutritional management during chemotherapy is a key factor influencing the outcome of the treatment. Mobile apps have the potential to provide readily accessible nutritional support for patients with PDAC. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile app–based program, Noom, in patients receiving chemotherapy for PDAC. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 40 patients who were newly diagnosed with unresectable PDAC from a single university-affiliated hospital in South Korea, and randomly assigned them into a Noom user group (n=20) and a non-Noom user group (n=20). The 12-week in-app interventions included meal and physical activity logging as well as nutritional education feedback from dietitians. The non-Noom user group did not receive any nutrition intervention. The primary outcomes were the changes in the nutritional status and quality of life (QoL) from the baseline to 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes included the changes in the skeletal muscle index (SMI) from the baseline to 12 weeks. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) were used as paper questionnaires to assess the QoL and nutritional status of the patients. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. Regarding the study data collection time points, we assessed the nutritional status and QoL at the baseline (T0), and at 4 (T1), 8 (T2), and 12 (T3) weeks. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging was conducted at the baseline and after 8 weeks for tumor response and SMI evaluation. The skeletal muscle area (cm(2)) was calculated using routine CT images. The cross-sectional areas (cm(2)) of the L3 skeletal muscles were analyzed. RESULTS: Between February 2017 and January 2018, 48 patients were assessed for eligibility. Totally 40 patients with pancreatic cancer were included by random allocation. Only 17 participants in the Noom user group and 16 in the non-Noom user group completed all follow-ups. All the study participants showed a significant improvement in the nutritional status according to the PG-SGA score regardless of Noom app usage. Noom users showed statistically significant improvements on the global health status (GHS) and QoL scales compared to non-Noom users, based on the EORTC QLQ (P=.004). The SMI decreased in both groups during chemotherapy (Noom users, 49.08±12.27 cm(2)/m(2) to 46.08±10.55 cm(2)/m(2); non-Noom users, 50.60±9.05 cm(2)/m(2) to 42.97±8.12 cm(2)/m(2)). The decrement was higher in the non-Noom user group than in the Noom user group, but it was not statistically significant (-13.96% vs. -3.27%; P=.11). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that a mobile app–based approach is beneficial for nutritional and psychological support for PDAC patients receiving chemotherapy.

METHODS: Healthy adults admitted to the NIH Clinical Center (Day -1) underwent a 9 day inpatient quarantine after intranasal challenge with H1N1pdm (Day 0). Participants completed the 32 item FLU-PRO diary twice daily for 14 days to assess presence and severity of symptoms across six body systems. Secondary analyses included descriptive statistics to examine FLU-PRO scores over the course of illness and analysis of variance to compare severity scores on Day 3 post-challenge by viral shedding, and pre-challenge hemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibition (HAI and NAI) titers. RESULTS: 61 of 65 subjects reported symptoms (Days: Median 5, Mean 6 ± 7), of which 37 (61%) had viral shedding. Pre-challenge, 39 (64%) and 10 (16%) subjects had low (<40) HAI and NAI titers, respectively. Mean daily FLU-PRO symptom severity domain and total scores are shown in Figure 1. Symptoms were present across all FLU-PRO domains from Day 1 post-challenge. Nose, throat, body, and GI symptoms reached peak severity at Day 3, followed by chest and eye symptoms at Day 4. Subjects with viral shedding had significantly higher mean FLU-PRO scores compared with those without, except for Eye and GI domains (P < .05); mean FLU-PRO scores were significantly higher for subjects with low NAI titer (P < .05) across all domains. No significant differences were observed between HAI titer groups. FLU-PRO scores of the low HAI-low NAI group (n = 10) were significantly higher (more severe) than the other two groups (P < .05) ((high HAI-low NAI (n = 22), low HAI-high NAI (n = 29)). CONCLUSION: The FLU-PRO can be used to track symptom onset, severity, and recovery from influenza infection in clinical research. In this challenge study, scores were responsive to change even in mild disease and distinguished known clinical subgroups. The use of NAI as an independent predictor of influenza disease severity was also supported.

Frameshifting is a potential antiviral target. It is possible that the replication cycle of any virus that uses this process could be disrupted by modulation of frameshift efficiencies, but a better understanding of the occurrence and the molecular basis of frameshifting will be required before it can be considered a genuine target. To date, there are no confirmed examples of frameshift signals from conventional eukaryotic cellular genes, although computer-assisted database searches have identified a number of candidates. The frameshift allows the required ratio of viral proteins to be produced, but it may also serve to downregulate levels of viral replicases that may be toxic in high amounts.","Brierley, Ian; Vidakovic, Marijana",Perspect Med Virol,717,1

To help our funeral colleagues minimize their risk of infection, this manipulator was created to help prevent such serious events, as well as other conditions related to airborne diseases. This article provides some technical details necessary for creating an autopsy saw, including the machinery design, control system design, specification of devices, and other abilities of this machine. METHODS: The manipulator consists of a control system, linear actuator motors, a gearbox with DC gear motor, DC gear servo coreless motor, and the out-runner brushless DC electric motor. RESULTS: The results showed that the manipulator can be assembled to fit to, and be removed from, an autopsy bed without drilling into the bed surfaces. There is adjustment of the cutting range, both vertically and horizontally, via a remote control. The saw frame can be rotated through 360° for skull and tissue cutting. The saw blade depth can be adjusted from 0 to 3 cm. The rotational speed of the saw blade can be regulated from 0 to 10,080 RPM. The cutting procedure can be controlled remotely, up to 20 m away from the manipulator. CONCLUSION: In future projects, the instrument design should allow control incorporating “Internet of things” technology, be constructed under a multipurpose autopsy machine concept, and also autonomously conduct a full autopsy procedure.","Jumlongkul, Arnon",Res,717,17

This paper addresses the problem of precise data flow analysis for such systems. To obtain good precision, data flow analysis needs to somehow skip execution paths that read more messages than the number of messages sent so far in the path, as such paths are infeasible at run time. Existing data flow analysis techniques do elide a subset of such infeasible paths, but have the restriction that they admit only finite abstract analysis domains. In this paper we propose a generalization of these approaches to admit infinite abstract analysis domains, as such domains are commonly used in practice to obtain high precision. We have implemented our approach, and have analyzed its performance on a set of 14 benchmarks. On these benchmarks our tool obtains significantly higher precision compared to a baseline approach that does not elide any infeasible paths and to another baseline that elides infeasible paths but admits only finite abstract domains.","Athaiya, Snigdha; Komondoor, Raghavan; Kumar, K.

This interpretation can be seen as a refinement of Bayesian networks. Bayesian strategies are based on a new form of event structure, with two causal dependency relations respectively modelling control flow and data flow. This gives a graphical representation for probabilistic programs which resembles the concrete representations used in modern implementations of probabilistic programming. From a theoretical viewpoint, Bayesian strategies provide a rich setting for denotational semantics. To demonstrate this we give a model for a general higher-order programming language with recursion, conditional statements, and primitives for sampling from continuous distributions and trace re-weighting. This is significant because Bayesian networks do not easily support higher-order functions or conditionals.","Paquet, Hugo",Programming Languages and Systems,717,13

We aimed to assess whether COVID19 related social isolation affects lifestyle and weight control in women with PCOS. We performed an online survey including 232 women with PCOS and 157 healthy controls on isolation characteristics, weight alterations, physical activity, sleeping and eating patterns by validated questionnaires. Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-18), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) were used. PCOS-related quality of life questionnaire (PCOSQ) was also completed by patients. During over 14 weeks of isolation, 48.5% participants gained weight, 13.9% participants’ weight was stable, and 37.6% participants lost weight. The patient and control groups did not show any difference in weight alteration (p=0.44). Physical activity was reduced (p<0.001 for both), eating patterns did not show a significant change in both groups, whereas sleep quality was reduced in PCOS group only (p<0.001). Within the weight gainers, increase in BMI was more prominent in PCOS group (1.3±1 kg/m(2)) than controls (1.0±0.6 kg/m(2)) (p=0.01). In weight gainer group, delta BMI values showed positive correlations with delta PSQI scores (r = 0.24, p=0.004), delta sleep induction time (r=0.25, p=0.001) and delta TFEQ-18 scores (r=0.25, p=0.001). Weight changes during social isolation are similar in women with PCOS and healthy women. However, the increase in BMI of weight gainers is higher in PCOS and is mainly related to sleep quality and eating habits rather than reduced physical activity.","Eyupoglu, Nesrin Damla; Aksun, Seren; Ozturk, Mervenur; Yildiz, Bulent Okan",J Endocr Soc,717,1

METHODS Between January 2005 and June 2010, 81 consecutive patients (46 men; mean age 69.1 years, range 43-86) underwent directional atherectomy (41 SH, 40 ELA) for femoropopliteal ISR lesions. Data were reviewed retrospectively on procedural outcomes, major adverse events, and 1-year target lesion revascularization (TLR) obtained from medical records and supplemented with telephone calls. The primary endpoint was symptom-driven TLR at 1 year; secondary endpoints were death and amputation. RESULTS ELA was utilized more frequently than SH in longer lesions (210.4±104 vs. 126.2±79.3 mm, respectively; p=0.001), subacute presentation (55% vs. 14.6%, p=0.001), TASC D lesions (47.5% vs. 12.2%), and in patients with more angiographic thrombus (42.5% vs. 4.9%, p=0.001). Final angiographic success (<30% residual narrowing post final treatment) was similar between ELA and SH (92.5% vs. 100%, respectively, p=0.12). Bailout stenting was significantly higher with ELA vs. SH (50.0% vs. 24.4%, p=0.022). At 1 year, TLR had occurred in 48.7% of the ELA patients vs. 31.7% of the SH cases (p=0.171). Regression analysis confirmed that SH was a predictor of TLR at 1 year (hazard ratio 2.679, 95% CI 1.015 to 7.073, p=0.047). CONCLUSION Both SH and ELA continue to have a high TLR rate in treating ISR of the femoral and popliteal arteries. A higher rate of delayed failure is seen with SH and an earlier, steeper loss of TLR-free survival is seen with ELA.","Shammas, Nicolas W; Shammas, Gail A; Jerin, Michael",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,717,1

A major mechanism in epigenetics is the DNA methylation (DNAm). Hypo- and hyper-methylation are generalized responses to control gene expression however recent studies have demonstrated that classes of contaminants could mark specific DNAm signatures, that could usefully signal prior environmental exposure. We collected skin and blubber from 6 free-ranging fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) individuals sampled as a part of a previous published study in the northern Mediterranean Sea. Genomic DNA extracted from the skin of the fin whales and levels of contaminants measured in the blubber of the same individuals were used for DNAm profiling through reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). We tested the hypothesis that differences in the methylation patterns could be related to environmental exposure to contaminants and load in the whale tissues. The aims of this study were to determine the DNAm profiles of the methylation contexts (CpGs and non-CpGs) of differently contaminated groups using the RRBS, and to identify potential contaminant exposure related genes. Amount and proportion of methylcytosines in CpG and non-CpG regions (CHH and CHG) was very similar across the 6 samples. The proportion of methylcytosines sites in CpG was n = 32,682, the highest among all the sequence contexts (n = 3216 in CHH; n = 1743 in CHG). The majority of the methylcytosine occurred in the intron regions, followed by exon and promoter regions in CpG, CHH and CHG. Gene Ontology results indicated that DNAm affected genes that take place in cell differentiation and function in cutaneous, vascular and nervous systems.

Cub domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a cell-surface protein that confers poor prognosis of patients with certain solid tumors, was recently identified as one of the most significantly upregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected children who developed systemic vasculitis, a hallmark of KD. However, a potential role of CDCP1 in KD has not previously been explored. In this study, we found that CDCP1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited attenuated coronary and aortic vasculitis and decreased serum Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS)-specific IgM/IgG2a and IL-6 concentrations compared with wild-type mice in an established model of KD induced by CAWS administration. CDCP1 expression was not detectable in cardiomyocytes, cardio fibroblasts, or coronary endothelium, but constitutive expression of CDCP1 was observed on dendritic cells (DCs) and was upregulated by CAWS stimulation. CAWS-induced IL-6 production was significantly reduced in CDCP1 KO DCs, in association with impaired Syk-MAPK signaling pathway activation. These novel findings suggest that CDCP1 might regulate KD development by modulating IL-6 production from DCs via the Syk-MAPK signaling pathway.","Lun, Yu; Borjini, Nozha; Miura, Noriko N; Ohno, Naohito; Singer, Nora G; Lin, Feng",Journal of immunology,717,31

With the hypothesis that neurologists do not get sufficient training during their residency, the Young European Sleep Neurologist Association (YESNA) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) performed a survey on postgraduate sleep education. METHODS A 16-item questionnaire was developed and distributed among neurologists and residents across European countries. Questions assessed demographic, training and learning preferences in sleep disorders, as well as a self-evaluation on the knowledge-based on 5 basic multiple-choice questions (MCQ) on sleep-wake disorders. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 568 participants from 20 European countries. The mean age of participants was 31.9 years (standard deviation: 7.4 years) and composed mostly of residents (73 %). Three-quarters of the participants reported undergraduate training in sleep medicine, while less than 60% did not receive any training on sleep disorders during their residencies. Almost half of the participants (45 %) did not feel prepared to treat neurological patients with sleep problems. Only one-third of the participants responded correctly to at least 3 MCQ. Notably, 80 % of participants favoured more education on sleep-wake disorders during the neurology residency. CONCLUSIONS Education and knowledge on sleep-wake disorders in European neurological residents is generally insufficient, despite a strong interest in the topic. The results of our study may be useful to improve the European Neurology curriculum and other postgraduate educational programs.","Rakusa, Martin; Sieminski, Mariusz; Rakusa, Sofia; Falup-Pecurariu, Cristian; Fronzcek, Rolf; Hidalgo, Hildegard; Muntean, Maria-Lucia; Pijpers, Angelique; Cochen De Cock, Valerie; Pizza, Fabio; Schmidt, Markus; Schreier, David R; Baldin, Elisa; Bassetti, Claudio L A; Kallweit, Ulf",European journal of neurology,717,27

Personal discomfort has been associated with use of PPE, and anecdotal reports describe pressure injuries related to wearing PPE. OBJECTIVES To investigate the occurrence of device-related pressure injuries due to wearing PPE among Italian nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in critical care settings. METHODS This descriptive study used an online survey investigating both the demographic characteristics of respondents and complications related to wearing PPE, including the development of pressure injuries. RESULTS A total of 266 nurses throughout Italy completed the survey; 32% of respondents were men. Nurses' median age was 36 years (range 22-59 years), and the median time spent working in their current clinical setting (an intensive care or high-dependency unit) was 3 years (range 0-32 years). Personal protective equipment was worn for a median duration of 5 hours (range 2-12 hours). While wearing PPE, 92.8% of nurses experienced pain and 77.1% developed device-related pressure injuries, mainly on the nose and forehead. Pain was more frequent among nurses with such injuries. Transparent dressings, emollient cream, and no dressing were associated with development of device-related pressure injury. CONCLUSIONS Pressure injuries related to PPE represent an important adverse effect for nurses caring for patients with COVID-19. This topic deserves study to determine adequate solutions for preventing and treating such injuries and their potential influence on nurses' work tolerance.","Bambi, Stefano; Giusti, Gian Domenico; Galazzi, Alessandro; Mattiussi, Elisa; Comisso, Irene; Manici, Matteo; Rosati, Moris; Lucchini, Alberto","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",717,1

Different viral load and host response related to genetic and immune background are probably the reasons for these differences. We aimed to sought clinical and pathological correlation that justifies the different clinical outcomes among COVID-19 autopsies cases. Methods Minimally invasive autopsy was performed on forty-seven confirmed COVID-19 patients from May-July, 2020. Electronic medical record of all patients was collected and a comprehensive histopathological evaluation was performed. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, special stain, western blotting and post-mortem real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on fresh lung tissue were performed. Resultss We show that 5/47 (10,6%) patients present a progressive decline in oxygenation index for acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), low compliance levels, interstitial fibrosis, high -SMA+ cells/protein expression, high collagens I/III deposition and NETs(P<0.05), named as fibrotic phenotype (N=5). Conversely, 10/47 (21,2%) patients demonstrated progressive increase in PaO2/FiO2 ratio, high pulmonary compliance levels, preserved elastic framework, increase thrombus formation and high platelets and D-dimer levels at admission (P<0.05), named as thrombotic phenotype. While 32/47 (68,1%) had a mixed phenotypes between both ones. Conclusions We believe that categorization of patients based on these two phenotypes can be used to develop prognostic tools and potential therapies since the PaO2/FiO2 ratio variation and D-dimer levels correlate with the underlying fibrotic or thrombotic pathologic process, respectively; which may indicate possible clinical outcome of the patient.","Batah, S.; Benatti, M.; Siyuan, L.; Telini, W.; Barbosa, J.; Menezes, M.; Nadai, T.; S, K.; Vaswani, C.; Gupta, S.; Zamboni, D.; Wada, D.; Calado, R.; Oliveira, R.; Louzada-Junior, P.; Auxiliadora-Martins, M.; Veras, F.; Cunha, L.; Cunha, T.; Luppino-Assad, R.; Balancin, M.; Morais, S.; Martins, R.; Arruda, E.; Chahud, F.; Koenigkam-Santos, M.; Cetlin, A.; Cunha, F.; Santos, C.; Capelozzi, V.; Fukuoka, J.; Duarte-Achcar, R.; Fabro, A.",,717,17

It has been demonstrated that, besides the major canonical transcripts, the viral genome also codes for non-canonical RNA molecules. While the structural characterizations have revealed a detailed transcriptomic architecture of the virus, the kinetic studies provided poor and often misleading results on the dynamics of both the viral and host transcripts due to the low temporal resolution of the infection event and the low virus/cell ratio (MOI=0.1) applied for the infection.

In this paper, an ex vivo study of a prototype BWI detecting wound dressing is reported. Consenting patients with burns were recruited from four burns services in the United Kingdom, their burn infection state recorded at time of recruitment and retrospectively following treatment. Their wound dressings were used as a source of inoculating bacteria to create an ex vivo biofilm model in the laboratory with reasonable fidelity to the original microbial state of their wound. The prototype infection detecting wound dressing, which responds to cytolytic toxins secreted by bacteria, was placed on the ex vivo biofilm and the response of the dressing correlated with the clinical decision on the patient's wound infection state. The study illustrated a number of broader issues with clinical BWI diagnosis, notably the absence of objective diagnostic criteria: a 'reference standard' for BWI. The absence of such a reference standard made analysis of the relationship between the dressing response and BWI diagnosis challenging, however a point estimate of 68% sensitivity from the study suggests the potential future utility of using a sensor which detects secreted bacterial virulence factors to assist in BWI diagnosis.","Thet, N.

Some patients delay seeking emergency care or even do not call it at all because of fear of contracting covid-19 at hospitals. ? The presentations of STEMI and covid-19 can overlap and mimic each other. Both conditions may coexist. Uncertainty regarding diagnosis may add to delays. ? Provider?s concerns about the covid-19 infection or lack of cath lab staff may lead to changes in treatment algorhithms. ? There may also be delay due to the infection-control measures employed by medical staff. ? Reduction in non-covid care, overwhelmed emergency medical services and hospitals, staff-absences, and lack of beds may all lead to treatment delay or even inability to provide it. ? Inflammatory and prothrombotic states in patients with covid-19 increase the risk of developing STEMI as well as that of STEMI complications. ? Hypoxia due to covid-19 lung disease deepens myocardial ischemia during STEMI and may extend the volume of STEMI and increase the risk of heart failure. ? Covid myocarditis. Conclusion: It is apparent that STEMI in covid-19 infected patients is not the same disease process as STEMI that without covid-19 infection. Patients with STEMI and covid-19 have a higher risk of heart failure, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, greater intracoronary thrombosis and stent thrombosis, resulting in higher cardiac and non-cardiac mortality. Aggressive antithrombotic treatment is recommended. Even in the covid era it is essential to insist on timely treatment of STEMI.

In this final study report, we evaluate an a priori hypothesis that greater benefit of bamlanivimab would be identified in those without detectable endogenous neutralizing antibody levels at study entry, especially if viral levels were high. METHODS Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomized to receive bamlanivimab (7000mg) or placebo and followed for 90 days for sustained recovery (home for 14 consecutive days); recovery rate ratios (RRRs) are cited. RESULTS Among 314 participants (163 on bamlanivimab and 151 on placebo), the median time to sustained recovery was 19 days and RRR=0.99 (95% CI: 0.79-1.22; p=0.89). At entry, 50% evidenced production of anti-spike neutralizing antibodies; 50% had SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid plasma antigen levels [≥] 1,000 ng/L. Among those without and with antibodies at study entry, the RRRs were 1.24 (95% CI: 0.90-1.70) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.54-1.00) (p=0.02 for interaction).

In this technique, the biosensor chip surface spotted with different DNA sequences is converted to a multiplexed antibody array by flowing antibody-DNA conjugates and allowing specific DNA-DNA hybridization. The resulting antibody array is shown to detect three different recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Viruses (rVSVs) genetically engineered to express surface glycoproteins of Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa viruses in real-time in a disposable microfluidic cartridge. We also show that this method can be modified to produce a single-step, homogeneous assay format by mixing the antibody-DNA conjugates with the virus sample in solution phase prior to flowing in the microfluidic cartridge, eliminating the antibody immobilization step. This homogenous approach achieved detection of the model Ebola virus, rVSV-EBOV, at a concentration of 100 PFU/ml in 1 hour. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this homogeneous technique as a rapid test using a passive microfluidic cartridge. A concentration of 104 PFU/ml was detectable under 10 minutes for the rVSV-Ebola virus.

Previous reports have noted a negative correlation between enFeLV copy number and exogenous FeLV infection outcomes in domestic cats. Since felids outside the genus Felis do not harbor enFeLV genomes, we hypothesized absence of enFeLV results in more severe disease consequences in felid species lacking these genomic elements. We infected primary fibroblasts isolated from domestic cats (Felis catus) and pumas (Puma concolor) with FeLV and quantitated proviral and viral antigen loads. Domestic cat enFeLV env and LTR copy numbers were determined for each individual and compared to FeLV viral outcomes. FeLV proviral and antigen levels were also measured in 6 naturally infected domestic cats and 11 naturally infected Florida panthers (P. concolor coryi). We demonstrated that puma fibroblasts are more permissive to FeLV than domestic cat cells, and domestic cat FeLV restriction was highly related to enFeLV LTR copy number. Terminal tissues from FeLV-infected Florida panthers and domestic cats had similar exFeLV proviral copy numbers, but Florida panther tissues have higher FeLV antigen loads. Our work indicates enFeLV LTR elements negatively regulate exogenous FeLV replication. Further, Puma concolor lacking enFeLV are more permissive to FeLV infection than domestic cats, suggesting endogenization can play a beneficial role in mitigating exogenous retroviral infections. Conversely, presence of endogenous retroelements may relate to new host susceptibility during viral spillover events. Importance Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) can infect a variety of felid species. Only the primary domestic cat host and related small cat species harbor a related endogenous virus in their genomes. Previous studies noted a negative association between the endogenous virus copy number and exogenous virus infection in domestic cats. This report shows that puma cells, which lack endogenous FeLV, produce more virus more rapidly than domestic cat fibroblasts following cell culture challenge. We document a strong association between domestic cat cell susceptibility and FeLV long terminal repeat (LTR) copy number, similar to observations in natural FeLV infections. Viral replication does not, however, correlate with FeLV env copy number, suggesting this effect is specific to FeLV LTR elements. This discovery indicates a protective capacity of the endogenous virus against the exogenous form, either via direct interference or indirectly via gene regulation, and may suggest evolutionary outcomes of retroviral endogenization.","Chiu, Elliott S.; VandeWoude, Sue",bioRxiv,717,22

While the global race for vaccines against COVID-19 has already lead to first authorizations and vaccinations in some countries, multiple questions arise for access and provisions as well as for the acceptance of vaccine policies by immunocompromised patients. Objectives: We conducted an international survey about expectations and potential concerns regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in patients with AIIRDs and healthcare professionals. Methods: The online study consisted of 57 questions which addressed determinants associated with SARS-2-CoV-2 vaccine willingness. Dissemination was ensured through social media and patient associations between December 12 and December 21, 2020. Results: The study included 1266 patients with AIIRDs and 265 healthcare professionals from 56 countries. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine willingness was reported by 54.2% of AIIRD patients (uncertainty in 32.2% and unwillingness in 13.6%) and 74.0% of healthcare professionals. In patients, the willingness to get vaccinated increased significantly with age (p<0.0001) and was strongly associated with the fear to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.0001) or to develop severe COVID19 (p<0.0001) but not with presence of additional comorbidities (p=0.71) or immunocompromised status (p=0.94). The most trusted healthcare professional regarding the recommendation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was their specialist (rheumatologist, internist, etc.) for 69.9%. Vaccine unwillingness was low (7.9%) among healthcare professionals and willingness was significantly increased in those who had been vaccinated against influenza in the last 3 years (p=0.01). Conclusion: Data from this study are crucial to understand the main expectations and concerns regarding SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with AIIRDs and healthcare workers and allow the identification of valuable strategies to increase vaccine coverage in those populations.","Felten, R.; Dubois, M.; Ugarte-Gil, M.

In addition, some measures adopted by most countries in order to contain the virus spread, such as isolation and social distancing, leading to the interruption of routine activities, including partial or complete interruption of face-to-face classes may be associated with increased stress, depression and anxiety among undergraduate medical students (1). From March to September, 2020, the Brazilian Society of Rheumatology carried out the Mario Pinotti II Project (MPII), a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study designed to monitor the COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic disease on hydroxychloroquine, using periodic telephone calls performed by undergraduate medical students (2). Objectives: To compare the mental health status of medical students who were participating from the MPII with theirs colleagues not involved in this project. Methods: A web-based survey via google forms platform was developed by a panel composed of undergraduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. It included details on demographic and life habits data and domains regarding depression, anxiety and stress, using the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety & Stress Scale), Brazilian version. Data collection occurred from July 20th to August 31st, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 20.0. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis were performed to verify associations with the DASS-21, defined as dependent variable. A p-value < 0.05 was deemed as significant. This study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee. Results: A total of 684 undergraduate medical students were included in this study, of whom 228 as MPII volunteers (VG) and 456 as control group (CG). Median age was 23 years (IQ 21-24) and the CG was older than the VG (p<0.03). Most of them were white (68.8%) and women (63%). There were no significant differences regarding comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity. Older age, male gender, participation of MPII study, absence of a worsening in sleep pattern during the pandemic and a lower number of prior comorbidities were associated with lower DASS21 scores, suggesting a better mental health (Table 1). Conclusion: Several aspects may be involved with mental health, including increased emotional maturity, gender and sleep pattern. Although with marginal independent association, medical students with participation in the MPII study had better mental health than their student colleagues not engaged with this research. Our data pointed out that voluntary participation in a research project which foresees interaction by telephone contact with rheumatic patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues is associated with better mental health.","Basualto, S.; Ziroldo Lopes, J.

This is done through an initial analysis of longitudinal reflective data spanning seven years and connecting these reflections to the concepts: being-in-the-world, belonging and Ba.Design/methodology/approachThis research takes a practice based phenomenological and reflective approach. The value of this approach is to seek a new understanding, through three distinct conceptual frames, of the effective use of walking within management development.FindingsThe findings connect three conceptual approaches of being-in-the-world, belonging and “Ba” to the practicalities of delivery, thus encouraging practitioners and designers to deeply reflect on the role of walking in management development.Research limitations/implicationsA limitation is that this is largely a personal story exploring the impact of an intuitively developed set of interventions. Despite this, the paper represents a unique and deep interpretation of walking as a mechanism for management development.Practical implicationsThe paper concludes with three recommendations to practitioners wanting to use walking in management development programmes. These are: facilitators need to be familiar with their surroundings;they should look for spaces and places where participants can connect and build relationships;and organisers and sponsors need to recognise how walking not only consolidates knowledge but can help create knowledge too.Originality/valueThis is a unique, seven-year longitudinal study that broadens the theoretical focus of walking as a mechanism for management and leadership development that combines the theoretical lenses of being-in-the-world, belonging and “Ba”, the authors believe, for the first time in research on management development.","Turner, Arthur F.; Edwards, Gareth Latham Catherine Shortt Harriet",The Journal of Management Development,717,1

The purpose of the article is to identify and evaluate Gen Z's views in Russia and Slovakia on the search and assessment of information in a semi-digital society. The empirical research methods are a questionnaire survey, in-depth interviews, and a focus group. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, they were conducted remotely. The study reveals that the views of the Slovak and Russian Generation Z are similar in terms of searching and speeding up the acquisition of information and especially in the high assessment of their capabilities in information search and low confidence in advertising campaigns. The Slovak Gen Z is informationally mature and, at the same time, Internet-dependent. A difference in the perception of AI in Russian and Slovak Gen Z is identified. The results can be used to improve youth policies and provide information to society in the transition to fully digital life.

Even in practice, the discussions of corporate entrepreneurship revolve around the appropriate level necessary and the preferred method of action. This paper proposes an evolutionary model that outlines corporate entrepreneurship overall in terms of an organization’s entrepreneurial activities. For the research objective, this paper includes in-depth case studies on Samsung’s Creative Lab. The Creative-Lab of Samsung has been actively implementing corporate venture system for eight years. We conducted collective case studies by focusing on a single case (Creative-Lab) and then moving to multiple cases (Creative-Lab spin-off companies). Firstly, the study identifies the development process of entrepreneurship from the individual-level to the firm-level, and from the firm-level to the social-level. Secondly, the study confirms that corporate venturing and the corporate spin-off system have a positive impact on entrepreneurial behavior, which is crucial to seize opportunities. Thirdly, based on the growth factors and performance of corporate entrepreneurship, an evolutionary model of corporate entrepreneurship is proposed in this paper. This study can contribute to the establishment of an integrated and structured mechanism of related research as it comprehensively reviews the antecedents, elements, and outcomes of corporate entrepreneurship.","Bo Young, Shin Cho Keun Tae",Sustainability,717,24

To investigate the usefulness of a serological assay to predict vaccine efficacy, we analyzed the levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in the sera from BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals in Japan. METHODS: This study included 219 individuals who received two doses of BNT162b2. The levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA against RBD were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after the first and second vaccination, respectively. The relationship between antibody levels and several factors including age, gender, and hypertension were analyzed. Virus-neutralizing activity in sera was measured to determine the correlation with the levels of antibodies. A chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method to measure IgG against RBD was developed and validated for the clinical setting. RESULTS: The levels of all antibody isotypes were increased after vaccination. Among them, RBD-IgG was dramatically increased after the second vaccination. The IgG levels in females were significantly higher than in males. There was a negative correlation between age and IgG levels in males. The IgG levels significantly correlated with the neutralizing activity. The CLEIA assay measuring IgG against RBD showed a reliable performance and a high correlation with neutralizing activity. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring of IgG against RBD is a powerful tool to predict the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and provides useful information in considering a personalized vaccination strategy for COVID-19.","Fujigaki, H.; Yamamoto, Y.; Koseki, T.; Banno, S.; Ando, T.; Ito, H.; Fujita, T.; Naruse, H.; Hata, T.; Moriyama, S.; Takahashi, Y.; Suzuki, T.; Murakami, T.; Yoshida, Y.; Yagura, Y.; Oyamada, T.; Takemura, M.; Kondo, M.; Iwata, M.; Saito, K.",,717,1

Risk of COVID-19 infection in the different rheumatic IMID (R-IMID) remains controversial. Objectives: To assess the epidemiology and comorbidities of COVID-19 in R-IMID from a Single-University hospital. Methods: Cross-sectional study in a Single-University hospital. We included all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of a R-IMID and a positive test for COVID-19 up to November 6th, 2020. Medical records of 11,199 patients that suffered COVID-19 in our region, and 6891 with R-IMID from our hospital were reviewed. Incidence data in the different underlying R-IMID were calculated for patients with follow-up in our hospital. Confirmed infection was defined if the patient had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Results: We included 147 patients from our region (96 women/51 men), mean age 60±18 years. Underlying R-IMID were: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n=36, 24.5%), Axial spondyloarthritis/Psoriatic arthritis (SpA/PsA) (n=54, 36.7%), Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) (n=16, 10.9%), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n=10, 6.8%), sarcoidosis (n=5, 3.4%), Sjögren's syndrome (SS) (n=4, 2.7%), giant cell arteritis (GCA) (n=3, 2%), Behet's disease (n=3. 2%), ANCA-vasculitis (n=2, 1.4%) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) (n=1, 0.7%). Main comorbidities were hypertension (n=65, 44.2%), dyslipidemia (n=64, 43.5%), age higher than 65 years old (n=55, 37.4%), obesity (n=35, 23.8%), coronary vascular disease (n=27, 18.4%), diabetes mellitus (n=22, 15%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=15, 10.2%) and chronic kidney disease (n=15, 10.2%). Total cumulative COVID-19 incidence in all patients from our region was 1.9% (11,199 /582,905). From 147 patients with COVID-19 from our region, 115 (76 women/39 men;mean age, 59±18 years) were followed in our hospital. In the latter, the global cumulative incidence in R-IMID was 1.7% (115/6891), ranging from 1.3% in Systemic Scleroderma (SSc) and Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) up to 5.3% in Behcet's disease (Table 1 and Figure 1). In addition, Relative Risk (RR) in different R-IMID compared to the general population was calculated (Table 1). Although RR did not reach statistical significance in any R-IMID, most R-IMID showed a tendency to a higher risk, with the exception of RA, GCA and SSc. Conclusion: In our series, the total cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in R-IMID was similar to the general population. Higher RR, without statistical significance, was observed in Behet's disease, ANCA-vasculitis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica.

A review of the current literature,13.445636,9.899399,2020,"Abstract Increasing customer demand for individualized and cost-effective products within shorter production times is reshaping the manufacturing and production environment. Human workers and machines must be able to react to changes with increased flexibility and efficiency. To meet these needs, the tools and products of modern assembly have continually updated and changed, but much work remains to incorporate the natural intelligence of an assembly worker more deeply into future assembly system information flow, both to and from the worker (feedback loop). This work presents a pilot lab evaluation of varied real-time feedback mechanisms for human workers on manual assembly processes to understand better how the method of the information feedback loop to the assembly associate affects their assembly time, variance, and accuracy as well as their perceived acceptance of each mechanism for information feedback. Lego building block models were used as the assembly product to build while wearing a wireless feedback mechanism device. The device incorporated LED lights, vibration, a text screen, and an image screen to provide feedback to the worker. All feedback was provided by an administrator who was able to send commands to the respective feedback methods as needed. Early conclusions in the pilot show a difference in the assembly time depending on both the feedback mechanism used and the complexity of the assembled model. Future work will include expanding the number of participants per test case and increasing the number and types of feedback provided to include non-wearable types such as stationary monitors and sound.","Krugh, Matthew; Garimella, Ravi Shankar; Baburaj, Adithya; Wescoat, Ethan; Mears, Laine",Procedia Manufacturing,717,16

Background: So far, many computational methods have focused on predicting PPIs within the same species rather than PPIs across different species. Methods: From the extensive analysis of PPIs between Yersinia pestis bacteria and humans, we recently discovered an interesting relation;a linear relation between amino acid composition and sequence length was observed in many proteins involved in PPIs. We have built a support vector machine (SVM) model, which predicts PPIs between human and bacteria using two feature types derived from the relation. The two feature types used in the SVM are the amino acid composition group (AACG) and the difference in amino acid composition between host and pathogen proteins. Results: The SVM model achieved high performance in predicting bacteria-human PPIs. The model showed an accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 94%, and specificity of 98% in predicting PPIs between humans and Yersinia pestis, in which there is a strong relation between amino acid composition and sequence length. The SVM model was also tested in predicting PPIs between human and viruses, which include Ebola, HCV, and SARS-CoV-2, and showed a good performance. Conclusion: The feature types identified in our study are simple yet powerful in predicting pathogenhuman PPIs. Although preliminary, our method will be useful for finding unknown target host proteins or pathogen proteins and designing in vitro or in vivo experiments.","Alguwaizani, S.; Ren, S. L.; Huang, D.

This right to legal immunity was created with the issuance of Government Regulation in Lieu of Law (Perppu) Number 1 of Year 2020, which was approved and enacted by the People’s Representative Council of the Republic of Indonesia into law by the ratification of Law Number 2 of Year 2020. Article 27 explicitly states that government officials, in their execution of this Government Regulation in Lieu of Law, cannot be prosecuted civilly or criminally if the execution of their tasks is based on good faith and is in line with the stipulations of legal regulations. This paper uses the normatif legal research with the statute approach and the conceptual approach. The research results shows that there is a certain recognition of regulations regarding immunity rights. This is affirmed by a verdict of the Constitutional Court, by which according to the Constitutional Court, regulation of immunity rights is not in conflict with the concept of rule of law, with several conditions. In addition, although several stipulations in Indonesian positive law that provide immunity prevent a person from being prosecuted criminally while performing their duties, at a practical level, the specifically provided immunity is meaningless if the person in question fulfills the elements of an article that stipulates a criminal act, because the intention of a person is the essence of an act, and judges in court will decide the matter.","Madjid, A.",Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology,717,1

It is important to remember that patients with RT-PCR test positive for COVID-19 infection may have normal chest CT. Material and Methods: This study included patients who underwent RT-PCR and chest CT tests, as well as patients with suspected and confirmed COVID-19 positive cases according to the algorithm of the Institute of Science of Ministry of Health in Turkey were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups as positive and negative according to RT-PCR results. These groups were divided into two subgroups: with CT findings compatible with COVID-19 and without them. When the RT-PCR test was taken as the gold standard, the specificity, sensitivity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy rates of chest CT were investigated in detecting COVID-19 infection. Results: RT-PCR was positive in 192 patients and negative in 418 patients. The chest CT scan was positive in 43% (82/192) of 192 patients whose RT-PCR results were positive. Chest CT scan was positive in 25% (108/418) of 418 patients whose RT-PCR results were negative. In 31% of the patients (190/610), chest CT findings were positive for COVID-19. When RT-PCR results were taken as a reference, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity values in terms of COVID-19 infection of chest CT were 44% (95% CI, 392/610 patients), 43% (95% CI, 82/192 patients), and 74% (95% CI, 310/418 patients) respectively. Discussion: According to these data, we think that chest CT is not very successful in detecting patients infected with COVID-19, contrary to the literature. Clinicians should always be careful to identify patients with COVID-19 infection with normal thorax CT or negative RT-PCR testing.","Arslan, Ş Delice O.; Kahraman, M.; Yılmaz, S. amp; Iacute,; AslanM., H.",Annals of Clinical and Analytical Medicine,717,22

This paper examines whether self-reported mental health concerns increased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic times. Design/methodology/approach: A comparison was made between service data captured in one contract area – West Sussex, England – pre-pandemic (April 2019 to March 2020) and during pandemic (April 2020 to March 2021). Findings: Self-reported mental health treatment needs increased during the pandemic period (71.2% of presentations compared to 50% pre-pandemic) via the online coaching service. Male referrals increased by 74% during the pandemic period compared to the previous year. Female referrals decreased by 4% in the same time period. Feelings of shame and guilt as well as loss of a confidential space to engage in online interventions were common concerns reported by service users. Research limitations/implications: Research limitations include the relatively small sample size, the sample comprised of self-referred treatment seeking clients, and there was no control group. All data collected is self-report therefore subjective and not necessarily meeting diagnostic criteria. Practical implications: Of note was the impact of the pandemic on women and their reduced access to the online service during the pandemic. Commissioners and services must adapt their service design and delivery alongside the new “normal” way of living and working. Routine screening of mental health and alcohol use are recommended.

This binding is mediated by the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD). The COVID-19 pandemic has brought devastating consequences at a clinical, social and economical levels. Therefore, anticipation of potential novel SARS-causing species or SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced binding to ACE2 is key in the prevention of future threats to come. We have characterized a de novo single substitution, Q498Y, in SARS-CoV-2 RBD that confers stronger adherence to ACE2. While the SARS-CoV-2 β variant, which includes three simultaneous amino acid replacements, induces a 4-fold stronger affinity, a single Q498Y substitution results in 2.5-fold tighter binding, compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 2019 strain. Additionally, we crystallized RBDQ498Y complexed with ACE2 and provide here the structural basis for this enhanced affinity.

Findings: To date over 600 kidney-related articles have been uploaded to bioRxiv and medRxiv. The average time from study completion to publication was over 10 months. 16 of the top 20 nephrology journals currently accept research submitted to a preprint server. Transparency and collaboration, visibility and recognition, and rapid dissemination of results were identified as benefits of preprint servers. Concerns exist regarding the potential risk of non-peer reviewed medical research being publicly available. Limitations: Preprint servers remain a recent phenomenon in health sciences and their long-term impact on the medical literature remains to be seen. Implications: The quantity of research submitted to preprint servers is likely to continue to grow. The model for dissemination of research results will need to adapt to incorporate preprint servers.","Vlasschaert, C.; Giles, C.; Hiremath, S.; Lanktree, M.",,717,16

The virus spread to India in January, 2020. It is highly contagious. In its severe form, the victims of the virus suffered from symptoms such as breathing difficulties, fever, weakness, loss of taste and smell, amongst others. Patients were put on mechanical ventilators and as a result, the requirement of the role of cardio-respiratory physiotherapists became more and more essential. Even after weaning off from the ventilators and being detected Coronavirus negative, the role of the physiotherapists still remained indispensable in order to bring about improvement in the muscle strength of the affected weakened muscles, especially for patients whose movements were limited for extended periods of times due to being dependent on the ventilators;physiotherapists were also required to bring about improvement in the lung capacities and function, to teach gait training for those who find it difficult to walk, to improve in-coordination and overall allow the patients to come back to normal and carry out all the ADL independently and well. He had a severe difficulty in breathing and coughing, along with a generalized weakness all over his body, specifically both his lower limbs.

The present empirical research intends to identify the constructs (latent variables) caused mainly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and analyze their influence on the education system's performance. Design/methodology/approach: A pilot study was carried out with 105 responses to gain deeper insights into the factor structure and validate the scale. Then, the exploratory factor analysis was applied to explore five factors. Later on, the confirmatory factor analysis was employed to check the model's unidimensionality, validity and reliability. Finally, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to explore the factors influencing educational performance. Findings: Four hypotheses were tested, out of which two were supported, i.e. “compatibility with online mode” and “new opportunities” were found to influence educational performance significantly. Practical implications: This investigation aims to provide vital information to the ministry of human resource development and educationists/academicians to understand the influence of the higher education system's factors. Also, it offers some strategies and plans to improve the higher educational systems performance in similar situations. Originality/value: The previous studies did not identify and analyze the factors that influence the educational system's performance;especially, amid COVID-19 using the exploratory, confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling approach. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gardas, B.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mixed methods research approach and foregrounds the discussions of the results with the social roles theory. Using the quota sampling procedure, this study used 467 semi-structured interviews of tenants from five old informal settlement neighbourhoods in urban Ghana. This study adopted the thematic analytical technique in the results section. Findings: This study uncovered that landlords perform a gate-keeping social relationship role in ensuring tenant safety during the COVID-19 pandemic season through the provision of security, care and support, discipline, hard work, morale building to accountability. However, this study found that most landlords do not provide tenancy agreements to tenants which strained some social relationships in tenant management. Originality/value: The application of social roles theory in this study provides a cutting-edge approach to the study of welfare of tenants living in informal settlement housing units during periods of pandemic.

From early scattered regional outbreaks to current country-wide spread, and from rural areas to highly populated cities, the contagion exhibits diverse patterns at various timescales and locations. We thus conduct a graph frequency analysis to investigate the spread patterns of COVID-19 in different US counties. The commute flows between all 3142 US counties were used to construct a graph capturing the population mobility. The numbers of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases per county were collected and represented as graph signals, which were then mapped into the frequency domain via the graph Fourier transform. The concept of graph frequency in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) enables the decomposition of graph signals (i.e., daily confirmed cases) into modes with smooth or rapid variations with respect to the underlying mobility graph. These different modes of variability are shown to relate to COVID-19 spread patterns within and across counties. Changes in the nature of spread within geographical regions are also revealed by graph frequency analysis at finer temporal scales. Overall, our GSP-based approach leverages case count and mobility data to unveil spatio-temporal contagion patterns of COVID-19 incidence for each US county. Results here support the promising prospect of using GSP tools for epidemiology knowledge discovery on graphs. © 2021 IEEE","Li, Y.; Mateos, G.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2021",717,16

It is critical for clinicians to identify the patients in a timely manner whose status may deteriorate in the near future and therefore need mechanical ventilators. We propose a prediction model to estimate the probability of requiring mechanical ventilation for in-hospital patients at least 24 hours after their admission. Our model is a multi-modal encoder-decoder attention model that takes full usages of the electronic health record (EHR) database. The EHR database consists of heterogeneous data tables of different formats (diagnosis, drug administrations, medicine prescriptions, lab tests, vital sign observations, clinical procedures, and demographics). We leverage the attention mechanism to increase model performance and promote result interpretability. The attention mechanism also serves the role of the missing data imputation technique, which is often used on irregularly sampled temporal data. We name the model as DBNet as the model takes the database as input. DBNet is evaluated on a large cohort of COVID-19 patients and the result shows it outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline deep learning models in predicting the future requirement of mechanical ventilation. It also outperforms several machine learning models even with sophisticated feature engineering. Due to its ability to handle multiple tables and also longitudinal data, the DBNet can also is not limited to this single application and can be generalized to other healthcare prediction tasks. © 2021 ACM.","Zhang, K.; Jiang, X.; Madadi, M.; Chen, L.; Savitz, S.; Shams, S.","12th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics, BCB 2021",717,1

The strategies of problematization of COVID-19 using by the media in current Russia were in our focus. The relevance of addressing this topic is due to two main factors: the shortage of research of complex and nonlinear relations between the media and the audience in Russian sociological discourse, and the unprecedented medical and social situation, accompanied by infodemic. The manifestations of the public burnout, the main factors of its formation, as well as some socio-demographic differences, gender first, in the perception of news about coronavirus were discovered. As a result, an increase in tiredness and irritation among respondents in the first month of the epidemic is recorded. Its strongly statistical correlation with purposeful avoidance of information about the current situation indicates “compassion fatigue” of Internet users. The assessment of news about coronavirus as dramatic and sensational is a significant factor of negative emotions, while the intensity of media consumption does not play a key role. The obtained data indicate the resistance of active Internet users to strategies of dramatization of situation. The rather rapid emotional burnout of the audience in the first wave of the epidemic is explained by the fact that today “compassion fatigue” becomes an a priori attitude. So, modern media consumption practices can be described using the metaphor of surfing on the crest of information waves. © 2021, Russian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.","Bogomiagkova, E.

Clinical observations have shown that Qing-Fei-Da-Yuan (QFDY) granules have good anti-COVID-19 effects, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we explored the potential mechanism of QFDY with regard to its anti-COVID-19 effect. We first screened the active chemical constituents of QFDY based on the pharmacodynamic activity parameters, followed by screening with the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform. The Uniprot database was used for querying the corresponding genes of the target, and Cyoscape 3.6.1 software was used to construct the network of herb-compound-target. Protein interaction analysis, target gene function enrichment analysis, and signal pathway analysis were performed via STRING database, Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, and KEGG Pathway database. Molecular docking was used to predict the binding capacity of the core compound with COVID-19 hydrolase 3CL and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The results showed that a network of herb-compound-target was successfully constructed, with key targets involving PTGS2, HSP90AA1, CAMKK2, NCOA2, and ESR1. Major metabolic pathways affected were those in cancer, procancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and apoptosis. The core compounds, such as quercetin, luteolin, and naringenin, showed a strong binding ability with COVID-19 3CL hydrolase; compounds such as anemasaponin C and medicocarpin showed a strong binding ability with ACE2. Thus, it is predicted that QFDY has the characteristics for multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel overall control. The mechanism of action of QFDY in the treatment of COVID-19 may be associated with the regulation of genes co-expressed with ACE2, the regulation of inflammation and immune-related signaling pathways, and the influence of COVID-19 3CL hydrolase and ACE2 binding ability.","Hong, Zongchao; Duan, Xueyun; Wu, Songtao; Yanfang, Yang; Wu, Hezhen",Nat.

Title/abstract and full-text screening, data abstraction, and quality appraisal (AGREE-II) were carried out by single reviewers. Results: A total of 17 relevant CPGs were identified, published in the USA (n=8), Canada (n=6), Australia (n=2), and the United Kingdom (n=1). All of the CPGs dealt with infection control in long-term care facilities (LTCF) and addressed various types of viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome). Ten or more CPGs recommended the following infection control measures in LTCF: hand hygiene (n=13), wearing personal protective equipment (n=13), social distancing or isolation (n=13), disinfecting surfaces (n=12), droplet precautions (n=12), surveillance and evaluation (n=11), and using diagnostic testing to confirm illness (n=10). While only two or more CPGs recommended these infection control measures: policies and procedures for visitors, staff and/or residents (n=9), respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette (n=9), providing supplies (n=9), staff and/or residents education (n=8), increasing communication (n=6), consulting or notifying health professionals (n=6), appropriate ventilation practices (n=2), and cohorting equipment (n=2). Ten CPGs also addressed management of viral respiratory infections in LTCF and recommended antiviral chemoprophylaxis (n=10) and one CPG recommended early mobilization of residents. Conclusion: The recommendations from current guidelines overall seem to support environmental measures for infection prevention and antiviral chemoprophylaxis for infection management as the most appropriate first-line response to viral respiratory illness in long-term care.","Rios, Patricia; Radhakrishnan, Amruta; Thomas, Sonia M.; Darvesh, Nazia; Straus, Sharon E.; Tricco, Andrea C.",,717,1

The relevance of highly fit, or multi-drug resistant lineages such as ST131 to overall E. coli disease burden remains to be fully determined. We set out to characterise the prevalence of E. coli multi-locus sequence types (MLST) and determine if these were associated with adverse outcomes in an urban population of E. coli bacteraemia patients. Methods We undertook whole genome sequencing of E. coli blood isolates from all patients with diagnosed E. coli bacteraemia in north-west London from July 2015 to August 2016 and assigned multi-locus sequence types to all isolates. Isolate sequence types were linked to routinely collected antimicrobial susceptibility, patient demographic, and clinical outcome data to explore relationships between the E. coli sequence types, patient factors, and outcomes. Findings A total of 551 E. coli genomes were available for analysis. More than half of these cases were caused by four E. coli sequence types: ST131 (21%), ST73 (15%), ST69 (9%) and ST95 (8%). E. coli genotype ST131-C2 was associated with non-susceptibility to quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, and also to amoxicillin, augmentin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. An association between the ST131-C2 lineage and longer length-of-stay was detected, although multivariable regression modelling did not demonstrate an association between E. coli sequence type and mortality. However, a number of unexpected associations were identified, including gentamicin non-susceptibility, ethnicity, and sex that might influence mortality and length-of-stay, requiring further research. Interpretation Although E. coli sequence type was associated with antimicrobial non-susceptibility patterns and length-of-stay, we did not find that E. coli sequence type was associated with increased mortality. Where ST131 is prevalent, caution is required when pairing beta-lactam agents with gentamicin or using single agent aminoglycosides.","Jauneikaite, E.; Honeyford, K.; Blandy, O.; Mosavie, M.; Pearson, M.; Ramzan, F.

This has resulted in stark price increases and accusations of price gouging. We survey the existing philosophical literature that examines price gouging and identify the key arguments for regulators permitting such behavior and for regulators restricting such behavior. We demonstrate how the existing accounts are designed for localized emergencies rather than global persistent crises such as the coronavirus pandemic. In light of this, we highlight an understudied justification for price gouging that is much more salient during global crises: Incentivizing increased production of essential goods.

Methods: The original study included 201 patients who were treated in a large referral center from March to May 2020. Ninty percent of the patients reported physical or psychological symptoms within 9 months post-COVID. Findings: Easy fatigability was the most common 51.04 % long-COVID symptoms followed by anxiety 38.54 %, dyspnea 38.54 %, and new headache 38.54%. There was no association between COVID-19 severity in the acute phase (admission status) and the number of long-COVID symptoms (F(1, 93) = 0.75, p = 0.45 (n.s.)), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (F(1,93) = -0.49, p = 0.62 (n.s.), MOCA scores (F(1, 90) = 0.073, p = 0.787 (n.s.)) in the future.

Sex, age and comorbidities have been associated with worse outcome in the general population. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a severe, autoimmune disease with frequent multi-organ involvement. Objectives: To assess the impact of COVID-19 and to determine factors associated with worse outcome in SSc patients from the European Scleroderma Trial and Research (EUSTAR) database. Methods: SSc patients from the EUSTAR database with COVID-19 were prospectively collected between 15.03.-31.12.2020. Two outcomes were chosen: (1) hospitalization;and (2) severe outcome defined as either non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation/extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death. General risk factors assessed were sex, age and number of comorbidities. SSc related risk factors were SSc subtype, autoantibodies, disease duration, SSc associated organ manifestations including interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), and musculoskeletal involvement;digital ulcers (DU), CRP at last visit, renal disease (scleroderma renal crisis and SSc associated renal insufficiency), modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) and immunosuppressive treatment. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were applied. Results: In total, 178 European SSc patients with COVID-19 were registered with a median observation time of 5.5 weeks (Table 1). 95 patients (53%) could recall SAR-Cov-2 contact, while 47 (26%) had no contact. 156 (88%) were symptomatic at COVID-19 onset with fever, cough, malaise and dyspnea being most prevalent. Over the disease course, 63 (36%) developed pneumonia. In total, 67/176 (38%) were hospitalized which were in 84% due to COVID-19. 41/170 (24%) had a severe outcome including 21 (12%) deaths. 128 (72%) recovered completely, while 14 (8%) complained of sequela, with 7 (50%) stating respiratory complications. Age, non-SSc comorbidities, presence of ILD, PAH and SSc associated renal or cardiac disease were numerically associated with hospitalization and severe outcome (Table 1). Univariable logistic analyses for hospitalization and severe outcome are shown in Figure 1. In multivariable logistic regression, age (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.07, p=0.019), presence of non-SSc comorbidities (OR 2.52, 95%CI 1.16-5.47, p=0.019) and SSc-related renal disease (predicting success perfectly) were associated with hospitalization and for severe outcome age (OR 1.05, 95%CI 1.01-1.08). Conclusion: SSc patients at older age, with non-SSc comorbidities, SSc related renal disease or ILD are at risk of a more severe outcome and should follow precautions to avoid COVID-19 infections and need careful monitoring in case of COVID-19.","Hoffmann-Vold, A.

Telemedicine visits conducted between 3/23/2020 and 5/14/2020 were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and follow up data. To ascertain patient satisfaction, voluntary patient surveys were conducted by phone after their telemedicine visit using a validated survey used in other telemedicine studies. Physician and advanced practice provider (APP) satisfaction were surveyed at two clinical locations. Proportions compared using chi-square tests. Data analyzed using Stata SE statistical software. From 3/23/2020-5/14/2020 there were a total of 281 telemedicine encounters. A total of 42 (15.0%) were new consults, 66 (23.5%) surveillance visits, 104 (37.0%) chemotherapy visits, 27 (9.6%) were postop visits, 30 (10.7%) were problem visits, and 12 (4.3%) were uncategorized visits. A total of 120 visits were for patients with ovarian cancer and 71 visits were for patients with uterine cancer. The remainder of the visits included patients with cervical cancer, vulvar/vaginal cancers, and benign conditions. A total of 11 visits were for patients on a clinical trial and 10/11 (90.9%) were able to continue on trial during this time period. With regards to imaging and labs for patients on trials, there were no protocol deviations. A total of 112 patients who completed telemedicine visits responded to a post visit survey. A total of 109 (97.3%) agreed or strongly agreed that their privacy was respected and 103 (92%) agreed or strongly agreed that their diagnosis and treatment options were adequately explained. A total of 83 (74.1%) of survey participants indicated that they preferred a mixture of telemedicine and in-person visits moving forward, 14 (12.5%) indicated they preferred only in-person visits moving forward and 15 (13.4%) indicated that they preferred only telemedicine visits moving forward. There were no significant differences between telephone and televideo visits with regard to patients agreeing or strongly agreeing that their diagnosis and treatment options were adequately explained (96.8% vs 86%, p=0.12). Similarly, patients agreed or strongly agreed that they could ask questions and seek clarification easily with both telephone and televideo visits (100% vs 94%, p=0.268). Additional patient perceived benefits of telemedicine are displayed in Figure 1. Approximately 80% of physicians and APPs at both clinical locations felt very satisfied or satisfied that clinical goals were achieved. [Display omitted] Telemedicine has been underutilized in the care of women with gynecologic malignancies until the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from our institution demonstrate successful implementation of a telemedicine program that can be used for all visit types including for patients on clinical trials.

The state of Texas ranks 2nd in infection with over 2.71 million cases and has seen a disproportionate rate of death across the state. The TX CARES project was funded by the state of Texas to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody status in children and adults. Materials and Methods: The TX CARES (Texas Coronavirus Antibody Response Survey) is an ongoing prospective population-based convenience sample from the Texas general population that commenced in October 2020. Volunteer participants are recruited across the state to participate in a 3-time point data collection TX CARES to assess antibody response over time. We use the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay to determine SARS-CoV-2 antibody status. Results: The crude antibody positivity prevalence in Phase I was 26.1% (80/307). The fully adjusted seroprevalence of the sample was 31.5%. Specifically, 41.1% of males and 21.9% of females were seropositive. For age categories, 33.5% of those 18-34; 24.4% of those 35-44; 33.2% of those 45-54; and 32.8% of those 55+ were seropositive. In this sample, 42.2% (89/211) of those negative for the antibody test reported having had a COVID-19 test. Conclusions: In this first phase we enrolled and analyzed data for 319 participants, demonstrating a high survey and antibody test completion rate, and ability to implement a questionnaire and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing within FQHC clinical settings. We were also able to determine our capability to estimate the cross-sectional seroprevalence within Texas FQHC clinical settings. The crude positivity prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in this sample was 26.1% indicating potentially high exposure to COVID-19 for FQHC clinic employees and patients. These methods are being used to guide the completion of a large longitudinal survey in the state of Texas with implications for practice and population health.","Valerio-Shewmaker, M.

However, technical complexity and operational costs might have been barriers for its wide use and implementation in some jurisdictions, thereby decreasing accessibility. OBJECTIVE Our main goal was to test the feasibility of a novel rTMS protocol optimized for practicality, scalability and cost-effectiveness. We hypothesized that our novel rTMS protocol would be simple to implement and well-tolerated, but less costly and allow for more treatment capacity. METHODS Treatment was administered in an open-room setting, allowing a single technician to attend to multiple patients. Large non-focal parabolic coils held by custom-built arms allowed simple yet efficient and accurate placement. We employed a low-frequency (LF) 1 Hz stimulation protocol (360 pulses per session), delivered on the most affordable FDA-approved devices. MDD participants received an initial accelerated rTMS course (arTMS) of 6 sessions/day over 5 days (30 total), followed by a tapering course of daily sessions (up to 25) to decrease the odds of relapse. The self-reported Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) was used to measure severity of depression. RESULTS Forty-eight (48) patients completed the arTMS course. No serious adverse events occurred, and all patients reported manageable pain levels. Response and remission rates were 35.4% and 27.1% on the BDI-II, respectively, at the end of the tapering course. CONCLUSION If rTMS could be delivered for lower cost at higher volume, while preserving efficacy, safety and tolerability, it could warrant further investigation of this treatment as a first-line intervention in MDD.

Here, we have investigated the role of the Secretome of the SARS-CoV-2 infected pancreas and mechanistically linked it with the multi-organ dysfunction using the scRNA-seq analysis. We found that acinar-specific PRSS2, REG3A, REG1A, SPINK1, and ductal-specific SPP1, MMP7 genes are upregulated in alpha, beta, delta, and mesenchyme cells. Using extensive documented experimental evidence, we validated the association of upregulated pancreatic Secretome with coagulation cascade, complement activation, renin angiotensinogen system dysregulation, endothelial cell injury and thrombosis, immune system dysregulation, and fibrosis. Our finding suggests the influence of upregulated Secretome on multi-organ systems such as Nervous, Cardiovascular, Immune, Digestive, and Urogenital systems. In addition, we report that the secretory proteins IL1B, AGT, ALB, SPP1, CRP, SERPINA1, C3, TFRC, TNFSF10, and MIF are associated with diverse diseases.

Objectives: The aim is to evaluate country differences on the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on life habits, healthcare access, health status, mental health and wellbeing in European patients with RMDs. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research group at the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organisations and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Participants were recruited by patient organisations (April-July 2020). The Kruskal-Wallis and χ2 tests were used to analyse differences between countries and independent variables. Results: 1,800 patients participated in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (REUMAVID). 37.8% of Spanish patients increased their smoking consumption during the pandemic followed by Cyprus (32.1%) and Portugal (31.0%), while alcohol consumption was higher in the UK (36.3%) and France (27.0%). 82.3% of patients in Spain unable to attend their appointment with their rheumatologist, either due to cancellations or other personal reasons. Access to primary care was most limited in Portugal and Italy, where only 45.0% and 51.6% got access. 61.9% in Italy and 53.3% in Spain experienced a worsening of their health during the pandemic. 68.5% in Spain and 67.8% in Portugal were at risk of anxiety. The highest proportion at risk of depression was found in Greece (55.4%), Cyprus (55.1%), and Italy (54.8%). 66.9% of patients in Spain reported poor wellbeing, compared to 23.8% in Italy and 30.1% in Portugal (Table 1).

However, typical turnaround times for batch-processed laboratory PCR tests remain 12-24h. Although rapid antigen lateral flow testing (LFD) has been widely adopted in UK emergency care settings, sensitivity is limited. We recently demonstrated that AI-driven triage (CURIAL-1.0) allows high-throughput COVID-19 screening using clinical data routinely available within 1h of arrival to hospital. Here we aimed to determine operational and safety improvements over standard-care, performing external/prospective evaluation across four NHS trusts with updated algorithms optimised for generalisability and speed, and deploying a novel lab-free screening pathway in a UK emergency department. Methods We rationalised predictors in CURIAL-1.0 to optimise separately for generalisability and speed, developing CURIAL-Lab with vital signs and routine laboratory blood predictors (FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP) and CURIAL-Rapide with vital signs and FBC alone. Models were calibrated during training to 90% sensitivity and validated externally for unscheduled admissions to Portsmouth University Hospitals, University Hospitals Birmingham and Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS trusts, and prospectively during the second-wave of the UK COVID-19 epidemic at Oxford University Hospitals (OUH). Predictions were generated using first-performed blood tests and vital signs and compared against confirmatory viral nucleic acid testing. Next, we retrospectively evaluated a novel clinical pathway triaging patients to COVID-19-suspected clinical areas where either model prediction or LFD results were positive, comparing sensitivity and NPV with LFD results alone. Lastly, we deployed CURIAL-Rapide alongside an approved point-of-care FBC analyser (OLO; SightDiagnostics, Israel) to provide lab-free COVID-19 screening in the John Radcliffe Hospital's Emergency Department (Oxford, UK), as trust-approved service improvement. Our primary improvement outcome was time-to-result availability; secondary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV assessed against a PCR reference standard. We compared CURIAL-Rapide's performance with clinician triage and LFD results within standard-care. Results 72,223 patients met eligibility criteria across external and prospective validation sites. Model performance was consistent across trusts (CURIAL-Lab: AUROCs range 0.858-0.881; CURIAL-Rapide 0.836-0.854), with highest sensitivity achieved at Portsmouth University Hospitals (CURIAL-Lab:84.1% [95% Wilson's score CIs 82.5-85.7]; CURIAL-Rapide:83.5% [81.8 - 85.1]) at specificities of 71.3% (95% Wilson's score CIs: 70.9 - 71.8) and 63.6% (63.1 - 64.1). For 3,207 patients receiving LFD-triage within routine care for OUH admissions between December 23, 2021 and March 6, 2021, a combined clinical pathway increased sensitivity from 56.9% for LFDs alone (95% CI 51.7-62.0) to 88.2% with CURIAL-Rapide (84.4-91.1; AUROC 0.919) and 85.6% with CURIAL-Lab (81.6-88.9; AUROC 0.925). 520 patients were prospectively enrolled for point-of-care FBC analysis between February 18, 2021 and May 10, 2021, of whom 436 received confirmatory PCR testing within routine care and 10 (2.3%) tested positive. Median time from patient arrival to availability of CURIAL-Rapide result was 45:00 min (32-64), 16 minutes (26.3%) sooner than LFD results (61:00 min, 37-99; log-rank p<0.0001), and 6:52 h (90.2%) sooner than PCR results (7:37 h, 6:05-15:39; p<0.0001). Sensitivity and specificity of CURIAL-Rapide were 87.5% (52.9-97.8) and 85.4% (81.3-88.7), therefore achieving high NPV (99.7%, 98.2-99.9). CURIAL-Rapide correctly excluded COVID-19 for 58.5% of negative patients who were triaged by a clinician to COVID-19-suspected (amber) areas. Impact CURIAL-Lab & CURIAL-Rapide are generalisable, high-throughput screening tests for COVID-19, rapidly excluding the illness with higher NPV than LFDs. CURIAL-Rapide can be used in combination with near-patient FBC analysis for rapid, lab-free screening, and may reduce the number of COVID-19-negative patients triaged to enhanced precautions (amber) clinical areas.","Soltan, A.

Models using EHR data to predict OUD often rely on case/control classifications focused on extreme opioid use. There is a need to expand this work to characterize the spectrum of problematic opioid use. Methods: Using a large academic medical center database, we developed 2 data-driven methods of OUD detection: (1) a Comorbidity Score developed from a Phenome-Wide Association Study of phenotypes associated with OUD and (2) a Text-based Score using natural language processing to identify OUD-related concepts in clinical notes. We evaluated the performance of both scores against a manual review with correlation coefficients, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and area-under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Records with the highest Comorbidity and Text-based scores were re-evaluated by manual review to explore discrepancies. Results: Both the Comorbidity and Text-based OUD risk scores were significantly elevated in the patients judged as High Evidence for OUD in the manual review compared to those with No Evidence (p = 1.3E-5 and 1.3E-6, respectively). The risk scores were positively correlated with each other (rho = 0.52, p < 0.001). AUCs for the Comorbidity and Text-based scores were high (0.79 and 0.76, respectively). Follow-up manual review of discrepant findings revealed strengths of data-driven methods over manual review, and opportunities for improvement in risk assessment. Conclusion: Risk scores comprising comorbidities and text offer differing but synergistic insights into characterizing problematic opioid use.

Undoubtedly, the main consequence was the loss of human lives and as a protection mechanism to try to avoid such losses, social isolation measures were put in place on a global scale. This social isolation caused a drop in the demand for electrical energy (around 6 % in Uruguay) and a greater drop in the global consumption of fuels derived from petroleum, which implied a drop in fuel prices due to the impossibility of instantaneously reducing the offer.

In turn, these improvements reduce capital investment and operating costs, facility size, feedstock consumption, and emissions from chemical processing. However, conventional microreactor fabrication has employed inefficient material removal and bonding processes to create devices formed of layers of metal shim stock. This research investigates the relative costs and environmental impacts of metal additive manufacturing and powder metallurgy processes for making microreactor components for a range of market sizes. Binder jetting additive technology and metal injection molding were studied for producing two plates for a microscale chemical reactor used in dimethyl ether production. The manufacturing process design method was applied to quantify the cost of goods sold, and life cycle assessment was applied to model environmental impacts. The manufacturing process design analysis showed that metal injection molding would have better cost performance than binder jetting for a greenfield facility due to lower capital tooling cost and shorter cycle time in making the green part. However, the life cycle assessment indicated, at lower annual production volumes, metal injection molding would have higher cumulative energy demand, global warming potential, and other impacts due to the mold plates and solvent use. While this work reports on model development and a single use case, it motivates a focus on validating analysis results for a range of part sizes and geometries, as well as alternative production routes. This future work would provide design and manufacturing decision makers with richer information regarding process capabilities, production costs, and product environmental impacts for a range of product complexities.","Raoufi, Kamyar; Manoharan, Sriram; Etheridge, Tom; Paul, Brian K.; Haapala, Karl R.",Procedia Manufacturing,717,10

Several investigations began to explore its psychological impact since it began, but there are no data about its effect on social and family behavior. Objectives Were: First, to analyze the reliability of an ad-hoc designed questionnaire to measure sociofamily behavior changes in a sample of parents of children from one to twelve years old. Second, to characterize effects of voluntary social isolation by COVID-19 over sociofamily behavior at a personal level and over children's activities at home. Third, to determine vulnerability predictors for a negative experience by isolation itself. Method An online Questionnaire for Perceptions of Changes in Sociofamily Behavior was applied to 365 Mexican participants. Results Factor analysis showed a reliability of the ad-hoc designed questionnaire for this study. Correlations were found between voluntary social isolation and self-perceived experiences, such as sleep quality, irritability, emotional control, hope about the future, motivation, attention span, and problem solving. Discussion and conclusion The results of this study suggest that family well-being during voluntary social isolation is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon, which addresses specific effects in different domains, especially in sociofamily behavior.","Torres González, Cynthia; Galindo-Aldana, Gilberto; García León, Ibza America; Padilla-López, Luis Alfredo; Alvarez Núñez, Daniel Nikolaus; Espinoza Gutiérrez, Yojana Irlanda",Salud ment,717,1

These efforts have mobilized millions of specimens with significant economies of scale and accelerated advances in scientific investigations, including phenological studies of climate change, species range assessments, and biotic interactions (Hedrick et al., 2020; Meineke et al., 2019; Meineke et al., 2018; Pearson et al., 2020; Willis et al., 2017). In addition, the use of natural history collections to answer scientific questions using only their digitized representation, rather than the physical specimen itself–i.e., Digitization 2.0 sensu Hedrick et al.

This relates to both hardware and workflow innovations as well as their integration with advancements in software. Along these lines, innovations in these areas have greatly increased the cost-effectiveness of digitizing herbarium specimens and enabled the successful mobilization of entire collections and whole floristic regions (Heerlien et al., 2015; Pignal and Michiels, 2012; Schorn et al., 2016; Slijkhuis, 2014; Sweeney et al., 2018; van Oever and Gofferjé, 2012).

We have previously shown that ultraviolet-A (UVA) therapy can prevent virus-induced cell death in human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells (HTEpC) infected with coronavirus-229E, and that UVA treatment results in an increase in intracellular levels of MAVS. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanisms by which UVA light can activate MAVS, and whether local UVA light application can activate MAVS at locations distant from the light source (such as via cell-to-cell communication). MAVS levels were compared in HTEpC exposed to 2 mW/cm2 narrow band (NB)-UVA for 20 minutes and in unexposed controls, at 30-40% and at 100% confluency. MAVS levels were also compared in unexposed HTEpC treated with supernatants or lysates from UVA-exposed cells or from unexposed controls. Also, MAVS was assessed in different sections of confluent monolayer plates where only one section was exposed to NB-UVA. The results show that UVA increases the expression of MAVS protein. Cells in a confluent monolayer exposed to UVA were able to confer an elevation in MAVS in cells adjacent to the exposed section, and even cells in the most distant sections not exposed to UVA. In this study, human ciliated tracheal epithelial cells exposed to UVA demonstrate increased MAVS protein, and also appear to transmit this influence to distant confluent cells not exposed to light.","Leite, Gabriela; Rezaie, Ali; Mathur, Ruchi; Barlow, Gillian; Melmed, Gil Y.; Pimentel, Mark",bioRxiv,717,1

Using microfluidic diffusional sizing, we determined the dissociation constant (KD) for the interaction between receptor binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-2 in its original version (WT) as well as alpha and beta variants with the host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). For RBD-alpha, the ACE2-binding affinity was increased by a factor of ten when compared with RBD-WT, while ACE2-binding of RBD-beta was largely unaffected. However, when challenged with a neutralizing antibody that binds to both RBD-WT and RBD-alpha with low nanomolar KD values, RBD-beta displayed no binding, suggesting a substantial epitope change. In SARS-CoV-2 convalescent sera, RBD-binding antibodies showed low nanomolar affinities to both wild-type and variant RBD proteins—strikingly, the concentration of antibodies binding to RBD-beta was half that of RBD-WT and RBD-alpha, again indicating considerable epitope changes in the beta variant. Our data therefore suggests that one factor contributing to the higher transmissibility and antibody evasion of SARS-CoV-2 alpha and beta is a larger fraction of viruses that can form a complex with ACE2. However, the two variants employ different mechanisms to achieve this goal. While SARS-CoV-2 alpha RBD binds with greater affinity to ACE2 and is thus more difficult to displace from the receptor by neutralizing antibodies, RBD-beta is less accessible to antibodies due to epitope changes which increases the chances of ACE2-binding and infection.","Fiedler, Sebastian; Denninger, Viola; Morgunov, Alexey S.; Ilsley, Alison; Worth, Roland; Meisl, Georg; Xu, Catherine K.; Piziorska, Monika A.; Ricci, Francesco; Malik, Anisa Y.; Devenish, Sean R.

This study aimed to elicit and explore the views of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and their ophthalmic care. Methods Between April 29th and September 4th 2020, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with thirty-five patients with nAMD taking part in a larger diagnostic accuracy study of home-monitoring tests. Participants were recruited using maximum variation sampling to capture a range of key characteristics including age, gender and time since initial treatment. Transcribed interview data were analysed using a deductive and inductive thematic approach. Results Three themes emerged from the analysis: i. access to eye clinic care. ii. COVID-19 mitigating factors and care delivery and iii. social and personal circumstances. Participants reported anxieties about cancelled or delayed appointments, limited communication from clinic-based services about appointments, and the impact of this on their ongoing care. Despite these concerns, there was apprehension about attending appointments due to infection risk and a perception that nAMD patients are a high risk group. Views of those who attended clinics during the study period were, however, positive, with social distancing and infection control measures providing reassurance. Conclusions These findings contribute to our understanding about experiences of patients with nAMD during the COVID-19 pandemic and have potential implications for future planning of care services. Innovative approaches may be required to address issues related to access to care, including concerns about delayed or cancelled appointments.","O'Connor, S. R.; Treanor, C.; Ward, E.; Wickens, R.

We investigate how well they can be characterized using classical constraints (photometry, astrometry), and validate our results using spectroscopic values.

We use our sample to demonstrate that subgiants are ideal targets for mass and age determination based on HR diagram location alone, discuss the advantages of stellar parameters derived from a detailed characterization over widely available catalogs, show that the generally used 3D extinction maps tend to overestimate the extinction for nearby stars (distance $\lesssim$ 500 pc), and find a correlation that supports the rotation-activity connection in post main sequence stars.

His reflections on how a society should deal with risks are of great value in assessing policies to combat the spread of viruses. Nozick introduces a surprising element in his theory that is an important factor for a potential justification of lockdown policies – the incidence of fear.

The olfactory epithelium (OE) in the nasal fossa is the peripheral organ for olfaction, and is subject to acquired damage, suggesting a likely site of pathology in aging. OE basal stem cells reconstitute the neuroepithelium in response to cell loss under normal conditions. In aged OE, patches of respiratory-like metaplasia have been observed histologically, consistent with a failure in normal neuroepithelial homeostasis or repair. Accordingly, we have focused on identifying cellular and molecular changes in presbyosmic OE. Combining psychophysical testing with olfactory mucosa biopsy analysis, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and human olfactory culture studies, we identified evidence for inflammation-associated changes in the OE stem cells of presbyosmic patients. The presbyosmic basal stem cells exhibited increased expression of genes involved in response to cytokines or stress, or the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. To facilitate further study of human OE stem cells, we developed an adult human basal cell culture model. Characterization of cultures using scRNA-seq confirmed maintenance of a reserve stem cell-like phenotype, and brief cytokine exposure in basal cell cultures resulted in increased expression of TP63, a transcription factor acting to prevent OE stem cell differentiation. Our data are consistent with a process by which aging-related inflammatory changes in OE stem cells may contribute to presbyosmia, via the disruption of normal epithelial homeostasis, suggesting that OE stem cells may represent a rational therapeutic target for restoration of olfaction. One Sentence Summary Single cell profiling suggests that inflammatory-associated olfactory epithelial stem cell dysfunction is associated with presbyosmia in humans.","Oliva, Allison D.; Issa, Khalil; Hachem, Ralph Abi; Jang, David; Gupta, Rupali; Moseman, E.

The National Health Service (NHS) is one such complex system within the UK that is facing a number of challenges. These range from an ageing and growing population with evolving healthcare needs, to increasing costs and reliance on private services. As such, a number of programmes and models have been introduced to transform care. Digital-first Primary Care (DfPC) is one such example. DfPC allows for faster and improved patient access to primary care by providing the choice of telephone and online consultations via the patient's GP practice or digital GP providers. The DfPC model has been at the forefront of primary care during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, hence the need for current research to evaluate its impact, suitability, and value in a post-pandemic world. Whilst this area is of high interest in the research community, there exists a gap in the method of analysis used.

In response, Chinese people poured into the stall economy, especially individual peddlers, with great expectations for street vending. Street vending has become a hot topic on Chinese social network sites (SNSs). Based on the push-pull-mooring framework, SNS information overload theory was introduced and combined with the actual situations of street vending in China, and a structural equation model was established to study factors affecting individual Chinese peddlers' intention to engage in street vending and the effects of SNS information overload on these factors. Results revealed that perceived policy benefits, subjective norms, and switching cost perceptions of individual peddlers were positive factors affecting their intention to engage in street vending. SNS information overload positively affected individual peddlers' dissatisfaction with their original business model, anxieties over their livings, perception of policy benefits, and subjective norms but negatively affected individual peddlers’ perception of switching costs.","Cao, Junwei Liu Feng Shang Meng Zhou Xiaotong",Technology in Society,717,1

Although underappreciated, many gut “anaerobes” are able to respire using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. The oxygen continually released from gut epithelial cells creates an oxygen gradient from the mucus layer to the anaerobic lumen (1), with oxygen available to bacteria growing at the mucus layer. Using a combination of analyses, we show that Bacteroides species are metabolically and energetically robust and do not mount stress responses in the presence of 0.10 - 0.14% oxygen, defined as nanaerobic conditions (2). Taking advantage of this metabolic capability, we show that nanaerobic growth provides sufficient oxygen for the maturation of oxygen-requiring fluorescent proteins in Bacteroides species. Type strains of four different Bacteroides species show bright GFP fluorescence when grown nanaerobically versus anaerobically. We compared four different red fluorescent proteins and found that mKate2 yields high fluorescence intensity in our assay. We show that GFP-tagged proteins can be localized in nanaerobically growing bacteria. In addition, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to image dynamic Type VI secretion system processes in metabolically active B. fragilis. The ability to visualize fluorescently-labeled Bacteroides and fluorescently-linked proteins in actively growing nanaerobic gut symbionts ushers in a new age of imaging analyses in these bacteria. Significance Despite many recent technological advances to study the human gut microbiota, we still lack a facile system to image dynamic cellular processes in most abundant gut species due to the requirement of oxygen for chromophore maturation of commonly used fluorescent proteins. Here, we took advantage of the ability of anaerobes of the gut microbiota to respire aerobically and grow robustly at 0.10– 0.14% oxygen. This physiologic concentration of oxygen is sufficient for fluorescent proteins to mature, allowing for visualization of biological processes never before imaged in these bacteria. This advance will allow for numerous types of analyses in actively-growing “nanaerobic” gut bacteria including subcellular protein localizations, single-cell analyses, biofilm imaging, and protein interactions with other microbes and the host.","García-Bayona, Leonor; Coyne, Michael J.; Hantman, Noam; Montero-Llopis, Paula; Von, Salena; Ito, Takeshi; Malamy, Michael H.; Basler, Marek; Barquera, Blanca; Comstock, Laurie E.",bioRxiv,717,20

In 2009-2011, an influenza pandemic occurred, with pH1N1 infecting millions of people worldwide. Here, we have used novel bioinformatic methods to combine clinical, protein biomarker, and genomic data from patients with influenza-associated acute respiratory failure to identify three mechanistically discrete sub-types with significantly different clinical outcomes. The three endotypes identified can be described as neutrophil-driven (16.3%), adaptive (51.9%), and endothelial leak (31.7%). The neutrophil driven patients display evidence of innate immune activation with associated multi-organ dysfunction and reduced 30-day survival. These patients could be differentiated from the adaptive endotype by an alteration in the GAIT-mechanism, a late transcriptional regulatory response to IFN-gamma; that acts to suppress innate immunity by reducing caeruloplasmin mRNA translation. Patients with the neutrophil-driven endotype had significantly increased IFN-gamma; levels but appeared unable to suppress their innate immune response. The endothelial leak endotype could be distinguished from both the neutrophil driven and adaptive endotypes by alterations in Slit-Robo signalling, a pathway important in the maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity; Although patients with this endotype required mechanical ventilation, they did not develop multi-organ failure in the manner of the neutrophil-driven endotype patients, and had significantly better clinical outcomes. Importantly, the endotypes identified were stable over 48 hours opening up the possibility of stratified interventional clinical trials in the future.","Samanta, R.; Dunning, J.; Taylor, A.; Bayliffe, A.

The previous training model involved training with actual patients and was time-consuming. Hence, the model was revamped and standardised patients (SPs) were engaged for nurses' training. This study further investigated nurses' feedback about the new training model and compared the efficiency and learner-reported outcomes of the previous and new models. Methods: Nurses who completed WST training from January 2018 to July 2020 were enrolled. Training records were accessed to determine the number of nurses trained under the previous and new models. Nurses were invited to complete post-training evaluation forms and their responses were analysed. Descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test were used for data analysis. Results: Under the previous model, 52 nurses were trained over 2 years, whereas under the new model, 112 nurses were trained over two months. From the evaluation form responses, the majority of nurses trained under the new model agreed that they achieved the learning objectives and were confident in performing the WST. There was also no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) found between learner-reported outcomes for both training models. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that the new model that engaged SPs was more efficient in training more nurses. Nurses were also satisfied with the new training model, which achieved similar learner-reported outcomes as the previous model.

MSI Reproductive Choices UK (MSUK), one of the largest service providers of abortion services in England, launched a telemedicine EMA pathway on 6th April 2020. Methods A sample of all MSUK's telemedicine EMA patients between April and August 2020 were invited to opt in to a follow-up call to answer clinical and satisfaction questions. 1,243 (13.7% of all telemedicine EMAs) were successfully followed-up, on average within five days post-procedure. Responses were analysed quantitatively and descriptively. The sample was compared to the total telemedicine EMA population on nine sets of background characteristics to check sample validity, and all results were tested across the same nine characteristics for variation. Results Patients reported high confidence in telemedicine EMA and high satisfaction with the convenience, privacy and ease of managing their abortion at home. No patient reported that they were unable to consult privately. Over 80% of patients reported preferring the telemedicine pathway, and two-thirds that they would choose telemedicine again if COVID-19 were no longer an issue. Discussion Telemedicine EMA is a valued, private, convenient and easier option that is highly acceptable for patients seeking an abortion, especially those for whom in-clinic visits are logistically or emotionally challenging. Evidence that this pathway would be a first choice again in future for most patients supports the case to make access to telemedicine EMA permanent.","Porter, C.; Lord, J.; Church, K.",,717,28

Design Case-control study with follow-up linkage to administrative healthcare databases for up to 25 years. Setting The study population comprises all children (0-14 years) registered for primary care with the National Health Service (NHS) in England 1992-1996. Participants 1082 five-year survivors of ALL diagnosed <15 years of age, and 2018 age- and sex-matched population-based controls; followed to 15 March 2020. Main outcome measures Associations with hospital activity, cancer, and mortality were assessed using incidence rate ratios and absolute risk difference. Results Mortality 5-25 years after diagnosis was 20 times higher in cases than controls (Rate Ratio 21.3, 95% Confidence Interval 11.2-45.6), and cancer incidence 10 time higher (IRR 9.9 95% CI 4.1-29.1). Hospital activity was increased for many clinical specialties, the strongest effects being for endocrinology; outpatient IRR 36.7, 95% CI 17.3-93.4 and inpatient 19.7, 95% CI 1.9-25.5 for males, and 11.0, 95% CI 6.2-21.1 and 6.2 95% CI 3.1-13.5 respectively for females. Notable excesses were also evident for cardiology, neurology, ophthalmology, respiratory medicine and general medicine. Males were also more likely to attend gastroenterology, ENT (ear, nose and throat), urology, and dermatology; while females were more likely to be seen in plastic surgery and less likely in midwifery. Conclusions Adding to a large excess risk of death and cancer, survivors of childhood ALL experience excess outpatient and inpatient activity across their TYA years. Involving most clinical specialties, the observed effects are striking, showing no signs of diminishing over the first 25 years of follow-up. These findings underscore the need to take prior ALL drug and/or radiation treatment into account when interpreting seemingly unrelated symptoms in later life.","Kane, E.; Kinsey, S.; Bonaventure, A.; Johnston, T.; Simpson, J.; Howell, D.; Smith, A.

The findings demonstrate the need for OTT providers to be clear of their gamification objectives before selecting the combination of game mechanics.Research limitations/implicationsThis study adds to the body of knowledge on consumer attitude toward gamification, especially in the OTT market where there is still literature is limited.Practical implicationsOTT providers should determine their objectives for using gamification and design the game mechanics according to the optimal combination of elements – components, controls and courses.Originality/valueAccording to the author’s knowledge, this is the first paper to examine consumer attitude toward gamification and OTT provider based on game mechanics. It provides an understanding on the interaction of elements in game mechanics and shows that different element combinations can be used to meet different goals.","Tan, Caroline S.

With globalization, a larger amount of N2O emissions arearticulated especially from human activities (30%, 6.7 Tg N per year), which are primarily dominated by agriculture that is even above the emissions of all oceans (26%). The synthesis of N2O reflects the general chemistry and readily from a substrate Nitric oxide (NO) in the environment. The modeling of infectious disease dynamics covering common pathogen-transmission factors, for example intrinsic (or microbes nutrient supply) at a population level, is indeed imperative to curb the menace of any disease. Nonetheless, in areas where novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was at its worst, for example, Wuhan China, Mumbai India, Milan Italy, Washington USA etc., the reduction in N2O emissions was well noticed. Nonetheless, viruses exhibit greater mobility than humans and hijack nutrients including nitrogen to complete their epidemiological cycle all due to limited sequence space of viral genomes, the high probability of genetic drift, extremely large population sizes, the high mutation and recombination rates. In consequence of drastic fall in N2O emissions, lower human transport can not be an all alone contributor, but contrarily it may also be associated with coronavirus intrinsic factors. This prompted us to analyze freely accessible and large global data from two authenticated sources, the World Health Organization and World Bank. We hereby argue that intrinsic factor N2O emissions fueling the COVID-19 progression significantly. Entire predictions were found consistent with the recently observed shreds of evidence. These insights enhanced scientific ability to interrogate viral epidemiology and recommended a 7-points framework covering all-natural lifestyle and dietary supplements for COVID-19 prevention before the arrival of a front-line therapeutic(s) or preventable vaccine.","Thapliyal, N.; Joshi, G.; Gahtori, P.",,717,1

To measure the impact of COVID-19 on cross-market linkages and deeply explore the dynamic evolution of risk transmission relations and paths among G20 stock markets, we statically and dynamically measure total, net, and pairwise volatility connectedness among G20 stock markets based on the DY approach by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014). The results indicate that the total volatility connectedness among G20 stock markets increases significantly during the COVID-19 crisis, moreover, the volatility connectedness display dynamic evolution characteristics during different periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, we also find that the developed markets are the main spillover transmitters while the emerging markets are the main spillover receivers. Furthermore, to capture the impact of COVID-19 on the volatility spillovers of G20 stock markets, we individually apply the spatial econometrics methods to analyze both the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the stock markets’ volatility spillovers based on the “volatility spillover network matrix” innovatively constructed in this paper.

Beyond its pathogenicity and its contagious nature, it is of the utmost importance to explore the epidemiological determinants of its health outcomes. I focus on the thirty-six OECD member states and examine country-level characteristics of the timing of the coronavirus outbreak and its morbidity and case-fatality rates. I harvested data on dependent variables from daily WHO reports and information on the independent variables from official publications of major world organizations. I clustered the latter information under three rubrics—socio-demographic, risk behaviours, and economic and public health—and subjected the totality of the data to OLS regressions. Independent variables successfully explain much of the overall variance among OECD countries in the timing of the outbreak (R 2 =63.0%), in morbidity (R2=50.0%) and mortality (R2=41.5%). Immigration stock enhanced the outbreak of the pandemic in host countries;it did not, however, had a significant effect neither on morbidity nor on mortality rates. Country economic status and healthcare services are significant in moderating the health outcomes of coronavirus infection. Nevertheless, the paramount determinants for restraining contagion and mortality are governmental measures.

This situation has also challenged the Muslim communities and institutions across the world to shift to the online mode of teaching Quran and Islamic studies. This research explored undergraduate students’ and instructors’ perceptions of the emergency online learning of Quran reading in Indonesia. Several aspects were analysed to compare the students’ perspective towards face-to-face class versus online learning, including class interaction, learning experience, motivation, satisfaction and comfort level. The study also compared students’ Quran reading performance in the online-learning setting with the records from a traditional face-to-face class during the previous year. The survey and performance data were obtained from 923 students. The findings indicated no significant difference in students’ performance between Quran reading classes in face-to-face and online classroom settings. Furthermore, although students and instructors felt that some aspects had changed, they generally tended to accept the Quran class in online mode. This is likely because, amidst the pandemic, students and instructors have no other options except to adapt to the rapid change and embrace the transition.

Although one-stop clinics have become accepted standard practice for combined assessment and injections, there is little guidance regarding eventual discharge of patients, and practice varies between clinicians. In 2018, NHS Lothian started a multidisciplinary one-stop clinic involving an Ophthalmologist, a Medical Photographer, a specialist Low Vision Optometrist, and a Low Vision Counsellor. We aimed to detail our experiences of this novel multidisciplinary discharge clinic for advanced macular disease patients. We also aimed to assess patient-reported anxiety and depression outcomes following this clinic. Retrospective data on 60 patients who attended the clinic from August 2018 to January 2019 were collected and included in analysis. Average age at presentation to the clinic was 85.76?±?8.18?years old and patients had been followed up in the macula clinic for a mean of 4.80?±?2.43?years prior to attending the clinic. In all, 31 patients responded to a survey on anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression score (HADS). Three (10%) of the patients reported scores abnormal for anxiety, and there were no abnormal scores for depression.

While each omics data can be examined separately, jointly integrating multiple omics data allows for a deeper understanding and insights to be gained from the study. In particular data integration can be performed horizontally, where biological entities from multiple omics measurements are mapped to common reactions and pathways. However, data integration remains a challenge due to the complexity of the data and the difficulty in interpreting analysis results. Results Here we present GraphOmics, a user-friendly platform to explore, integrate multiple omics datasets and support hypothesis generations. Users can upload transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data to GraphOmics. Relevant entities are connected based on their biochemical relationships, and mapped to reactions and pathways from Reactome. From the Data Browser in GraphOmics, mapped entities and pathways can be ranked, sorted and filtered according to their statistical significance (p-values) and fold changes. Context-sensitive panels provide information on the currently selected entities, while interactive heatmaps and clustering functionalities are also available. As a case study, we demonstrated how GraphOmics was used to interactively explore multi-omics data and support hypothesis generations using two complex datasets from existing Zebrafish regeneration and Covid-19 human studies. Conclusions GraphOmics is fully open-sourced and freely accessible from https://graphomics.glasgowcompbio.org/. It can be used to integrate multiple omics data horizontally by mapping entities across omics to reactions and pathways.

The disease leads to the destruction of joints due to erosion of both bone and cartilage. The other inflammatory polyarthropathies are a group composed of 61 diseases, according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Drug treatment is carried out through outpatient follow-up, with no need for hospitalization in mild and / or controlled cases. When surgical treatment is recommended or there are complications from rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory polyarthropathies, hospitalization is indicated. In addition, Brazil has a broad public health system, called the Unified Health System (UHS), responsible for most health procedures carried out at the national level, especially with regard to the socioeconomically vulnerable population. Objectives: To investigate the number of hospital admissions for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory polyarthropathies in UHS during the past three years. Methods: This is a quantitative and retrospective survey based on the data available on the website of the Department of Informatics of the Brazilian Unified Health System. The data are freely accessible and public domain. Information was collected about the period between December 2017 and November 2020, referring to the number of hospitalizations for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory polyarthropathies in all five regions that make up Brazil. Results: The number of hospitalizations for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory polyarthropathies fluctuated, between December 2017 and November 2020, from 1083 to 1311 per month, with an average of 1184 and a total of 38228 hospitalizations over the three years analyzed. Throughout the national territory, the region with the least monthly admissions was the central-west (which comprises the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal and Goiás), with 2562 total admissions and an average of 71.1 monthly admissions. In contrast, the region with the highest number of cases was the southeastern region (where the states of Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, São Paulo and Rio De Janeiro are located), with a total of 13173 hospitalizations and a monthly average of 365.9, representing 34,4% of hospitalizations in the country. Such data is in line with the Brazilian demography, since the central-west region is the second least inhabited (with 16.09 million inhabitants) and the southeastern region is the most densely inhabited (with 80.35 million inhabitants). The number of monthly hospitalizations, which remained above 1000 from the first month analyzed (December 2017) until February 2020, dropped to 990 in March of the same year and 651 in April, maintaining an average of 678.2 in next seven months. Conclusion: It is concluded that the number of hospitalizations for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory polyarthropathies in Brazil dropped significantly between March and April 2020, a period that coincides with the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, possibly as a result both of the changes in the Brazilian medical care model (in relation to the requirements for hospitalization) and as a result of the lower demand by individuals for hospitals due to fear of contamination by the new coronavirus.","Dal Pra Wendt, A.; Milene Cardozo, F.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,717,20

Purpose of the study. Conduct a comparative analysis of the seroprevalence of the population of the Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk regions – the largest administrative territorial entities of the Middle and Southern Urals – against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods. The work was carried out under the program of the first stage of assessing the seroprevalence of the population of the Russian Federation according to a unified methodology developed by Rospotrebnadzor of the Russian Federation with the participation of the Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute. The selection of participants was carried out by the method of questioning and randomization. The presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid was determined in blood serum by the enzyme immunoassay. Results. Comparative analysis of the results showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the Chelyabinsk region was consistently lower, and the seroprevalence at the first stage of the study was statistically significantly higher (p <0/05) than in the Sverdlovsk region. It was found that the incidence in both regions had a direct correlation with population density (r = 0.59;p <0.05). There were no differences between the compared areas in terms of seroprevalence among convalescents, people who had contact with COVID-19 patients, and asymptomatic volunteers with a positive PCR test. When analyzing seroprevalent volunteers in both regions, it was shown that the number of asymptomatic individuals varied within 94.4 ± 1.2% – 95.0 ± 0.95%. These data indicate that the majority of volunteers tolerated COVID-19 asymptomatically. Conclusions. A comparative study showed a statistically significant predominance of seroprevalence among the population of the Chelyabinsk region. It was found that an increase in seroprevalence at the population level was accompanied by a decrease in morbidity. Shown is a direct relationship between population density and the incidence rate. More than 90% of seropositive individuals in the compared areas showed asymptomatic course of coronavirus infection. © 2021, Numikom. All rights reserved.","Popova, A. Y.; Ezhlova, E.

Methods: COVID-19 case series (March 6, 2020 - January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 days to approximate the infection date. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on Rt using EpiEstim. We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case count varies across counties with different population size. Results: Rt shifted from 2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. Rt rose over the summer and stayed between 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associated with a decline in Rt (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening, an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%). Less densely populated counties had higher attack rate (p<0.0001). Conclusion: The Rt dynamics over time indicated that public health interventions substantially slowed COVID-19 transmission in South Carolina, while their relaxation may have promoted further transmission. Policies encouraging people to stay home, such as closing non-essential businesses, were associated with Rt reduction, while policies that encouraged more movement, such as re-opening schools, were associated with Rt increase.","Davies, M.

We performed state-wide SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiological investigations to identify HCW transmission dynamics and provide recommendations to optimise healthcare system preparedness for future outbreaks. Methods Genome sequencing was attempted on all COVID-19 cases in Victoria, Australia. We combined genomic and epidemiologic data to investigate the source of HCW infections across multiple healthcare facilities (HCFs) in the state. Phylogenetic analysis and fine-scale hierarchical clustering were performed for the entire Victorian dataset including community and healthcare cases. Facilities provided standardised epidemiological data and putative transmission links. Findings Between March and October 2020, approximately 1,240 HCW COVID-19 infection cases were identified; 765 are included here. Genomic sequencing was successful for 612 (80%) cases. Thirty-six investigations were undertaken across 12 HCFs. Genomic analysis revealed that multiple introductions of COVID-19 into facilities (31/36) were more common than single introductions (5/36). Major contributors to HCW acquisitions included mobility of staff and patients between wards and facilities, and characteristics and behaviours of individual patients including super-spreading events. Key limitations at the HCF level were identified. Interpretation Genomic epidemiological analyses enhanced understanding of HCW infections, revealing unsuspected clusters and transmission networks. Combined analysis of all HCWs and patients in a HCF should be conducted, supported by high rates of sequencing coverage for all cases in the population. Established systems for integrated genomic epidemiological investigations in healthcare settings will improve HCW safety in future pandemics.","Watt, A. E.; Sherry, N. L.; Andersson, P.; Lane, C.

As curriculums were hectically redesigned and adapted to fit an online format, hold and innovative approaches had to he undergone. Reflecting on the outcomes of these new measures, the question emerges whether we have just taken the first step towards a sustainable and lasting transformation of university (and in particular engineering) education or if the majority of these new procedures will remain a temporary compromise.

No vaccine or drug has been developed to treat the outbreak, still. According to the data of the World Health Organization (WHO), the COVID-19 virus can be easily transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact routes. States need to take necessary measures to control the outbreak. In this study, pandemic data for eight countries in the European region are analyzed between 22 January 2020 and 30 April 2020. These countries are Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, UK, Spain, France, Italy, and Turkey. The number of cases is taken into consideration in the selection of countries. Gaussian regression analysis is preferred for the COVID-19 outbreak analysis. A comparative analysis is performed using Ard-Exponential kernel function, Rational-Quadratic kernel function, and Squared Exponential kernel functions. The quasi-Newton algorithm is used to optimize regression models. Confirmed death and recovered case data are processed in the scope of the analysis. The first 90 days of the data are used for the training of Gaussian regression models. The last nine days are evaluated for prediction. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Median Error (ME), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) error metrics are used for metric of performance. In general, it is seen that the Ard-Exponential kernel with Gaussian Regression (AEGR) method obtained high metric performances for all cases and countries. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Özkaya, U.; Öztürk, Ş",Studies in Computational Intelligence,717,16

Unfortunately, recent studies have found that DL models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which manipulate models into making incorrect predictions with high confidence. There is a need for better understanding of how adversarial attacks impact the predictive ability of DL models in the medical image domain. Methods: We studied the adversarial attack susceptibility of DL models for three common imaging tasks within oncology. We investigated how PGD adversarial training could be employed to increase model robustness against FGSM, PGD, and BIM attacks. Finally, we studied the utility of adversarial sensitivity as a metric to improve model performance. Results: Our experiments showed that medical DL models were highly sensitive to adversarial attacks, as visually imperceptible degrees of perturbation (<0.004) were sufficient to deceive the model the majority of the time. DL models for medical images were more vulnerable to adversarial attacks compared to DL models for non-medical images. Adversarial training increased model performance on adversarial samples for all classification tasks. We were able to increase model accuracy on clean images for all datasets by excluding images most vulnerable to adversarial perturbation. Conclusion: Our results indicated that while medical DL systems are extremely susceptible to adversarial attacks, adversarial training show promise as an effective defense against attacks. Adversarial susceptibility of individual images can be used to increase model performance by identifying images most at-risk for misclassification. Our findings provide a useful basis for designing more robust and accurate medical DL models as well as techniques to defend models from adversarial attack.","Joel, M.

Material and Methods: One hundred forty health workers who studied at pandemic hospital were included in the study. The data were collected using the Pandemic Period Data Form (PPDF), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), prepared for assessing anxiety levels of health workers in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: In the study there was a significant difference between the health care workers working in intensive care units and those working in non-intensive care units in terms of age, gender, and presence of children. We found that there was a significant difference in STAI state anxiety scores (p < .05) of health workers in terms of having children, and they had higher levels of state anxiety. On average, the health workers from intensive care units had higher levels of PPDF anxiety. In this study, we detected that the COVID-19 anxiety levels of the health workers between the ages of 20 and 30 were higher compared with those aged 41 and above (p < .05). Discussion: It was found that the pandemic process had a negative impact on health workers as their anxiety increased in this process.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. Fifty professionally active nurses were recruited from various psychiatric facilities and asked to fill out a set of questionnaires: the authors' survey on sociodemographic data, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS), the revised version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-R), and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Linear regression models were constructed to predict the AIS, CESD-R and MBI-GS dimensions scores, with the CAS score as a predictor. The models were adjusted for sex, marital status, place of residence, length of service and working hours per week. Results: A rise in the CAS score was associated with rises in the CESD-R, MBI Exhaustion and MBI Cynicism scores. The effects were of similar size regardless of whether models were adjusted or unadjusted. Unadjusted and adjusted models predicting AIS total scores and MBI-Efficacy score were not fit to empirical data. In these models, the CAS score was not found to be significantly associated with the AIS and MBI-Efficacy scores. Conclusions: The severity of coronavirus anxiety contributed to the severity of depressive symptoms, cynicism and exhaustion among nurses. The ability to cope effectively with fear of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be crucial in preventing and mitigating other mental health sequelae.","Mokros, L.; Januszczak, J.; Baka, L.; Sienkiewicz-Jarosz, H.; Switaj, P.",Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii,717,1

It is due and identified by three orders of factors: those at the access (input);those related to the patient’s process (throughput);and those at the exit from the ED (output).ObjectivesWe evaluated all the population who went to ED for intossication and substance abuse. Due to the high level of care needed by these, an excessive duration of LOS (length of Stay) can be counterproductive.MethodsWe evaluated all patients accessing our ED for intossication and substance abuse from February 22 to May 1, 2020 and during the same period of the previous year.ResultsWe enrolled 142 patients. The Crowding input factors are lower in the pandemic period: reduced attenders (41 vs 101) and reduced average waiting times (59 min vs 86 min). The Crowding throughput factors have instead worsened: LOS for both the visit rooms (810 vs 544 min) and the holding area (1205 min vs 947 min). The Crowding output factors also worsened: the percentage of access block is higher during the pandemic (10% vs 5%). The Total Access Block Time is significantly higher in the CoViD period for the holding area (1053 vs 930 min).ConclusionsThe pandemic period presented a worsened crowding for these patients due to the Access Block.","Savioli, G.; Pesenti, S.; Ceresa, I.; Oddone, E.; Bressan, M.

We simulated a worst-case contamination scenario by spraying 40mL of a standardized inoculum [1x107 colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter] of test organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC1228 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC39327, while test participants made mock connections for therapy. We then compared the incidence of fluid path contamination by test organisms in the touchless connector system and the standard of care. 4 participants were recruited to perform a total of 56 tests, divided in a 1:1 ratio between both systems. Peritoneal dialysis fluid sample from each test was collected and maintained at body temperature (37 C) for 16 hours before being plated on Luria Bertani agar, Mannitol Salts Agar and Pseudomonas isolation agar for enumeration. No contamination was observed in the test samples from the touchless connector system, compared to 65%, 75% and 70% incidence contamination for the standard of care on Luria Bertani agar, Mannitol Salts Agar and Pseudomonas isolation agar respectively. In conclusion, the results show that the touchless connector system can prevent fluid path contamination even in heavy bacterial exposures and may help reduce peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis risks from inadvertent contamination with further development.","Yekinni, I.

This study analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, including the first case of each Regional Health Coordination and cases from three epidemic peaks. Methods Ninety SARS-CoV-2 genomes from RS were sequenced and analyzed against SARS-CoV-2 datasets available in GISAID for phylogenetic inference and mutation analysis. Results SARS-CoV-2 lineages among the first cases in RS were B.1 (33.3%), B.1.1.28 (26.7%), B.1.1 (13.3%), B.1.1.33 (10.0%), and A (6.7%), evidencing SARS-CoV-2 introduction by both international origin and community-driven transmission. We found predominance of B.1.1.33 (50.0%) and B.1.1.28 (35.0%) during the first epidemic peak (July–August, 2020), emergence of P.2 (55.6%) in the second peak (November–December, 2020), and massive spread of P.1 and related sequences (78.4%), such as P.1-like-II, P.1.1 and P.1.2 in the third peak (February–April, 2021). Eighteen novel mutation combinations were found among P.1 genomes, and 22 different spike mutations and/or deletions among P.1 and related sequences. Conclusions This study shows the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Southern Brazil, and describes SARS-CoV-2 diversity during three epidemic peaks, highlighting the spread of P.1 and the high genetic diversity of currently circulating lineages. Genomic monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to guide health authorities’ decisions to control COVID-19 in Brazil.

Discovered in Wuhan city, China in 2019, COV-SARS-2 and most viral respiratory diseases presently do not have a definitive cure. This paper aims to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of ginseng for the prevention and control of acute respiratory illness including SARS-COV-2 in the adult population. Method: We performed a systematic literature review using databases PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Cochrane library from 1st through the 27th of April 2020. All related articles that reported the use of Ginseng in COVID-19 patients were included in this analysis. The screening was done by 2-independent researchers. The meta-analysis was performed using a comprehensive meta-analysis package. Result: 596 articles were retrieved for the time frame. After screening, 5 articles with RCTs outcomes relevant to the review were selected. Ginseng was found to be effective in the reduction of risk by 38 % and 3-days shorter duration of acute respiratory illness (ARI) in all trials than placebo. Conclusion: As the world continues to race to find a cure, it is important to consider the use of ginseng which has been proven over the years to be effective in the treatment of acute respiratory illnesses. Further studies should however be conducted to determine the right dosage to improve efficacy and prevent adverse events.","Adusei-Mensah, F.; Agjei, R. O.; Awoniyi, L. O.; Lekpa, D. K.; Awoniyi, F.

Surface concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), together with a thorough microphysical (size), chemical, and optical (light absorption) aerosol characterisation, complemented by observations along the vertical column are considered. Even in the relatively pristine environment of the Alps, the «lockdown effect» is well discernible, both in the early confinement phase and in late 2020. The variations observed during the first confinement period in the city of Aosta (−61% NO, −43% NO2, +5% O3, +9% PM2.5, −12% PM10, relative to average 2015–2019 conditions) are attributed to the competing effects of air pollution lockdown-induced changes (−74%, −52%, +18%, −13%, −27%, relative to the counterfactual scenario for 2020 provided by a predictive statistical model trained on past measurements) and meteorology (+52%, +18%, −11%, +25%, +20%, relative to average conditions). These changes agree well with the ones obtained from a chemical transport model with modified emissions according to the restrictions. With regard to column-integrated quantities and vertical profiles, the NO2 column density decreases by >20% due to the lockdown, whereas tropospheric aerosols are mainly influenced by large-scale dynamics (transport of secondary particles from the Po basin and mineral dust from the Sahara desert and the Caspian Sea), except a shallow layer about 500 m thick close to the surface, possibly sensitive to curtailed emissions (especially exhaust and non-exhaust particles from road traffic and fugitive emissions from the industry).","Diémoz, Henri Magri Tiziana Pession Giordano Tarricone Claudia Tombolato Ivan Karl Friedrich Fasano Gabriele Zublena Manuela",Atmosphere,717,16

Coronavirus belongs to family coronaviridae with four genus viz. α/b and g-coronavirus, infecting both aves and mammals. The SARS-Cov-2 emerged in Wuhan, China in Dec, 2019 and since then had spread to 213 countries. Its origin is debatable with both natural origin and conspiracy theory providing no conclusive evidences. Coronavirus have ‘+’ive RNA and encodes for 29 proteins, which carries out its life cycle including infection and disease progression. The study of its proteome organization could illustrate the proteins which act as the key molecular players in the infection cycle of the virus. These proteins can also act as important drug targets in combating COVID-19 infection. Majority of the drugs have been formulated in order to act as agonist to spike proteins inhibiting infection by binding to ACE2 receptors. Proteome analysis has also revealed the critical mutated proteins that are responsible for COVID-19 pathogenesis and virulence. mRNA based vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162) also targets these spike proteins. Although DNA vaccine has also been attempted using RDT, but the high rate of mutation associated with COVID-19 have made such vaccines ineffective even before use. Thus evolutionarily conserved proteins have been the best candidature for vaccine development. Similarly phylogenetic analysis of its proteins could help us to understand the evolutionary pattern of COVID-19. It could be used to develop a predictable model for such pathogenic infections, preparing ourselves to take preventive action against its reoccurrence.","Bharadwaj, Alok; Wahi, Nitin; Saxena, Aditya; Chaudhary, Divya",J.

This project assesses the extent to which participants maintained health behaviors after nutrition education interventions and how program learnings informed strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a qualitative case-study approach, participants (n = 41) were recruited at least 6 months post-intervention from 5 Michigan Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) programs. Structured interviews occurred via telephone by 13 trained interviewers in August and September 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. A 5-person evaluation team collaboratively developed inductive codes, double-coded each interview, and analyzed data using NVivo software. Based on NVivo theming, participants reported to have learned strategies regarding healthier shopping, cooking, and eating that were maintained after the class. Prominent examples included reading food labels, making food substitutions, incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, and leaner meats into meals, and reducing sodium intake. New obstacles to shopping, cooking, and eating were identified by participants amid the pandemic. Common obstacles were shopping routine changes, increased cooking at home, and food access and attainability. Most participants reported that new habits established from classes were not only maintained during the pandemic but helped them deal with changing circumstances caused by the pandemic. Although nutrition education classes occurred before the pandemic, participants gained knowledge and skills that helped them maintain healthy habits during the pandemic and cope with changes to shopping, cooking, and eating. Results from this study were shared back with SNAP-Ed programs that recruited participants. Findings can help future nutrition education programs identify and incorporate coping strategies into future classes, contributing to sustainable outcomes and better preparing participants for the ongoing pandemic and possible future public health crises.

Procedurally, the exigencies of responding to such crises make a mockery of the apparatus of normal budgeting. Standard near-term constraints and targets for fiscal choice lose utility as guides for budgeters;extraordinary procedures are invoked. Assessing the initial fiscal response reveals the extraordinary role the federal government plays during such a period as ultimate guarantor of the economy and social order. The federal government has constitutional responsibility and, under duress, is the only set of institutions with the capacity to play this role. Federal responses to ordinary emergencies generally assess their contribution to relief and recovery. In an extraordinary emergency such as the pandemic, responses may be assessed for their contributions to two additional policy objectives: readiness and resilience. An event of this magnitude also offers an opportunity to reconsider the aims of fiscal policies and whether the terms for measuring and judging policy outcomes are appropriate for such a period. The standard budget baseline lacks a component for the average multiyear cost of the federal government's exercise of its role as societal guarantor. The standard metric for judging fiscal policy-public debt as a percent of gross domestic product-is problematic as a fiscal policy target. An alternative would capture changes in public sector net worth, highlighting the net fiscal and economic benefit or cost of any policy to borrow in order to invest in long-term policy objectives. Applications for Practice The framework provided here can be used to assess the unfolding budget responses to crisis and how those responses are affected by procedures used to develop and execute the federal budget, addressing such questions as: Whether costs arising from the federal government's broad responsibility for social order in severe crises should be recognized in the budget baseline and reserved in the budget as they arise, that is, as an estimate of the average annual cost of the government's role as societal guarantor. Whether the budget horizon should be extended and whether decisions should be organized around major policy objectives, including readiness and resilience, to encourage more strategic responses. To what extent the budget process should privilege investment in public assets that build readiness and resilience and thus sustain fiscal capacity to meet current commitments and future shocks. (Because of uncertainty, budgeters cannot predict returns for any specific investment or investment category. It follows that they need a budgetary strategy that maximizes average net returns from a broadly diversified investment portfolio-a classic strategy to cope with uncertainty. This implies purchasing a broad set of options that may be exercised in the future to either [1] capture for the public the large returns on investments that pay off [opportunity options] or [2] hedge against disruptive, even catastrophic events that generate large losses [insurance options] [Redburn, 2015, 12]). Whether traditional targets of fiscal policy-deficits and debt to gross domestic product ratios-should be augmented or replaced by metrics that capture changes in public net worth, thus recognizing ongoing creation of public assets as well as accruing commitments in the primary target for fiscal policies.","Redburn, F.

Each caused pneumonia with mortality of 10%, 35% and 2%, respectively (2019-nCoV estimated). GLS-5300 DNA vaccine targeting MERS-CoV Spike (S) was first to enter clinical trial, was safe and immunogenic (Lancet ID;2019). In Phase I, a 3 dose series at Day0, 4 and 12 weeks of GLS-5300 at either 0.67, 2 or 6mg was given IM followed by electroporation (EP, IM+EP) with CELLECTRA-5P device. GLS-5300 induced antibodies (Abs) in 94%, Tcell response in 76%, and neutralizing Abs in 50% of participants. No dose response was observed. GLS-5300 response was similar to those recovered from natural MERS-CoV infection. The absence of dose response and prior experience showing benefits of ID+EP vs IM+EP (JID;2019) led us to design this trial of lower ID dosing with an arm for a 2-dose regimen. We report results from MERS-002, the ongoing Phase I/IIa study of GLS-5300. Methods: MERS-002 is an open label, dose ranging, phase I/IIa study of GLS-5300. Participants were enrolled at 2 Korean sites into 3 groups receiving GLS-5300 ID+EP with the CELLECTRA-3P device: Group 1 received three 0.3mg doses at Day0 and weeks 4 and 12;Group 2 received three 0.6mg doses at Day0 and weeks 4 and 12;Group 3 received two 0.6mg doses at Day0 and week 8. Safety and tolerability of GLS-5300 was evaluated at each visit. Samples were collected at baseline, before each dose, and at both 2 and 4 weeks post dose 2 and post dose 3. Study data through 4 weeks after the primary series for a subset of immunoassays were included here. Findings: GLS-5300 given ID+EP was well-tolerated with no vaccine-associated SAEs. Preliminary results were available for: full length S (flS) ELISA, EMC2012-Vero neutralization (MERS-neut) and MERS-CoV S IFNg ELISPOT. GLS-5300 at 0.6mg induced MERS-CoV-specific Abs by flS ELISA and MERS-neut in 74% and 48%, respectively, after 1 dose. After the 2 or 3 dose vaccine series at 0.6mg per dose, flS ELISA response was seen in 100% and 92% of participants, respectively. MERS-neut response was 92% in both 2 and 3 dose 0.6mg groups. Antibody responses and rates were higher during and after primary series in 0.6mg group regardless of regimen than 0.3mg per dose. GLS-5300 induced Tcell responses via MERS-CoV IFNg ELISPOT in 60% and 84% receiving 0.6mg after the 2 or 3 dose series, respectively. Compared to 0.67mg of GLS-5300 given IM+EP in the first trial, 0.6mg of GLS-5300 given ID+EP in MERS-002, binding Abs appeared sooner and neutralizing Abs were observed in a higher fraction of participants (92% vs 50%) while Tcell reactivity was similar between vaccination schema. Conclusions: GLS-5300 was well tolerated with no vaccine-associated SAEs. Like prior studies, DNA vaccines given by ID+EP had fewer injection-related AEs relative to IM+EP. In MERS-002, 0.6mg of GLS-5300 in a 2-dose regimen spanning 8 weeks had similar reactivity and rate to the longer 3-dose regimen. GLS-5300 was safe and immunogenic when given IM+EP and, similarly, when given ID+EP in both 2- and 3-dose regimens in this ongoing MERS-002 Phase I/IIa trial. A Phase II clinical evaluation of the use of GLS-5300 to prevent MERS-CoV infection in endemic regions is planned.","Roberts, C. C.; Oh, M. D.; Kim, E.

Despite evidence of higher rates of victimization, behavioral health disorders, and hazardous drinking among Deaf individuals, they remain one of the most understudied populations in behavioral health research (Anderson et al., 2018;Fellinger et al., 2012). Significant disparities exist in access to and utilization of behavioral health services among Deaf individuals due to limited access to health information, fear and mistrust in healthcare settings, cultural and linguistic oppression, fear of stigmatization within the Deaf community, communication barriers, and a lack of culturally appropriate services (Barnett et al., 2011;Fellinger et al., 2012). CBT for Treatment Seeking (CBT-TS) has shown promise as an intervention to promote the use of treatment services among hearing individuals (Stecker et al., 2012), but it is unknown whether the intervention would be effective with Deaf individuals and what modifications might be necessary to increase its accessibility and applicability. This paper will present an ongoing project funded by an NIAAA diversity supplement [R01AA026815-03S1] to adapt CBT-TS for Deaf individuals using the ADAPT-ITT model, a pragmatic framework for adapting evidence-based interventions (Wingood & DiClemente, 2008). The first part of this project involves elicitation interviews with members of the new target population regarding their attitudes and beliefs about treatment, facilitators and barriers to treatment seeking, and the impact of COVID-19 on treatment seeking. The second part involves soliciting feedback of the materials, content, and delivery of CBT-TS from the target population and key stakeholders in the community via a pretesting methodology called “theater testing.” Finally, data from the elicitation interviews and the theater testing sessions will be combined to produce an adapted version of CBT-TS for Deaf individuals. This paper will present background information about behavioral health disparities among Deaf individuals and the rationale, plan, progress, and initial data of the ongoing project. An adaptation of CBT-TS for Deaf individuals would benefit a historically underserved community with potentially higher rates of hazardous drinking and behavioral health disorders and lower rates of treatment use.","Aldalur, A.; Conner, K.",Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,717,24

Historically volatile egg prices were even more volatile in April 2020, with a large spike in prices that led the state of Texas to sue the firm for price gouging. Added to this, Cal-Maine had an unexpectedly bad earnings report a few months earlier, and prior to that, the firm cut its dividend. How should the analyst incorporate these shocks - or should they be included at all? How can the analyst assess the risk of a company that has volatile revenues and costs and a widely varying beta?

Previous studies have found little evidence that vitamin D levels causally influence the risk of AD, but the reverse direction has not yet been investigated. Here we used Mendelian Randomization to assess the causal relationship between AD and serum vitamin D levels, using genetic data from the most recent GWA studies of vitamin D and AD. There was little evidence for vitamin D levels causally influencing AD risk (odds per standard deviations increase in log-transformed vitamin D levels =1.233, 95% CI 0.927 to 1.639, P-value =0.150). However, genetic liability for AD raises serum vitamin D levels by 0.043 (95% CI 0.017 to 0.069) standard deviations per doubling of odds of disease (P-value =0.001). The AD-associated filaggrin (FLG) mutation R501X appears to show a particularly strong relationship with vitamin D. However, the relationship between AD and vitamin D holds when R501X is omitted (0.018, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.031, P-value =0.008). We found evidence that AD is causally associated with an increase in serum vitamin D levels. Whilst the AD-associated FLG gene has a particularly strong relationship with vitamin D, other AD SNPs show a consistent direction of effect, suggesting that AD more generally influences serum vitamin D levels.","Drodge, D.

Despite the ribosome helicase, certain mRNA stem-loops stimulate programmed ribosomal frameshift by inhibiting translation elongation. Here, using mutagenesis, biochemical and single-molecule experiments, we examine whether high stability of three basepairs, which are unwound by the translating ribosome, is critical for inducing ribosome pauses. We find that encountering frameshift-inducing mRNA stem-loops from the E. coli dnaX mRNA and the gag-pol transcript of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) hinders A-site tRNA binding and slows down ribosome translocation by 15-20 folds. By contrast, unwinding of first three basepairs adjacent to the mRNA entry channel slows down the translating ribosome by only 2-3 folds. Rather than high thermodynamic stability, specific length and structure enable regulatory mRNA stem-loops to stall translation by forming inhibitory interactions with the ribosome. Our data provide the basis for rationalizing transcriptome-wide studies of translation and searching for novel regulatory mRNA stem-loops.","Bao, Chen; Zhu, Mingyi; Nykonchuk, Inna; Wakabayashi, Hironao; Mathews, David H.; Ermolenko, Dmitri N.",bioRxiv,717,17

We examined the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 and its determinants in six ethnic groups in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Methods We analyzed participants enrolled in the population-based HELIUS cohort, who were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and answered COVID-19-related questions between June 24-October 9, 2020 (after the first wave) and November 23, 2020-March 31, 2021 (during the second wave). We modeled SARS-CoV-2 incidence from January 1, 2020-March 31, 2021 using Markov models adjusted for age and sex. We compared incidence between ethnic groups over time and identified determinants of incident infection within ethnic groups. Findings 2,497 participants were tested after the first wave; 2,083 (83.4%) were tested during the second wave. Median age at first visit was 54 years (interquartile range=44-61); 56.6% were female. Compared to Dutch-origin participants (15.9%), cumulative SARS-CoV-2 incidence was higher in participants of South-Asian Surinamese (25.0%; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=1.66;95%CI=1.16-2.40), African Surinamese (28.9%;aHR=1.97;95%CI=1.37-2.83), Turkish (37.0%;aHR=2.67;95%CI=1.89-3.78), Moroccan (41.9%;aHR=3.13;95%CI=2.22-4.42), and Ghanaian (64.6%;aHR=6.00;95%CI=4.33-8.30) origin. Compared to those of Dutch origin, differences in incidence became wider during the second versus first wave for all ethnic minority groups (all p for interaction<0.05), except Ghanaians. Having household members with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, larger household size, and low health literacy were common determinants of SARS-CoV-2 incidence across groups. Interpretation SARS-CoV-2 incidence was higher in the largest ethnic minority groups of Amsterdam, particularly during the second wave.

This virus, declared a pandemic by the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO), given its high rate of transmissibility. The protocol most often used to detect the virus is PCR. It is a time-consuming and less sensitive procedure with high false-negative results. These problems are solved through radiographic imaging techniques to detect radioactive symptoms related to COVID-19. Furthermore, significant time is required to complete the analytical task, and mistakes can occur, meaning that automation is necessary. The use of advanced Artificial intelligence tools can significantly accelerate both the time and quality of the analysis. We suggest DenTcov, a computer-aided approach to detect COVID-19 infection via chest X-ray images. Our model is a two-phase process: Phase (1) Pre-Processing and data augmentation, Phase (2) COVID-19 detection based DensNet121, a pre-trained model, then trained with the dataset prepared by us. During the experimental phase of DenTcov, we measure the performances of the architecture by calculating a set of common metrics, both 2-class and 3-class classification.

Since April 2020, we followed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in plasma samples across the Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service. We developed an IgG ELISA against full length spike protein. Validated in locally-observed, PCR-positive COVID-19 cases and in pre-pandemic sera, sensitivity was 92.7% and sensitivity was 99.0%. Using sera from 9,922 donors, we estimated national seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 4.3% in April-June 2020 and 9.1% in August-September 2020. The second COVID-19 wave peaked in November 2020. Here we estimate national seroprevalence in early 2021. Between January 3 and March 15, 2021, we collected 3,062 samples from donors aged 16-64 years. Among 3,018 samples that met our study criteria 1,333 were seropositive (crude seroprevalence 44.2%, 95% CI 42.4-46.0%). After Bayesian test-performance adjustment and population weighting to represent the national population distribution, the national estimate of seroprevalence was 48.5% (95% CI 45.2-52.1%). Seroprevalence varied little by age or sex but was higher in Nairobi, the capital city, and lower in two rural regions. Almost half of Kenyan adult donors had evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection by March 2021. Although high, the estimate is corroborated by other population-specific estimates in country. Between March and June, 2% of the population were vaccinated against COVID-19 and the country experienced a third epidemic wave.

Catalase, a heme-containing tetramer protein expressed in a broad range of aerobic fungi, has been utilized as an essential enzymatic ROS detoxifying mechanism, and shows remarkable efficiency in degrading hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for fungal cell survival and host invasion. Here, we demonstrate that catalase inactivation with blue light renders fungal cells highly susceptible to ROS attack, thus resembling a ‘strength-to-weakness optical switch’. To unveil catalase as the underlying molecular target of blue light and its inactivation mechanism, we systematically compared wild-type Candida albicans to a catalase-deficient mutant strain for susceptibility to ROS in the absence/presence of 410 nm treatment. Upon testing on a wide range of fungal species and strains, we found that intracellular catalase could be effectively and universally inactivated by 410 nm blue light. We find that the photoinactivation of catalase in combination with ROS-generating agents is highly effective and potent in achieving full eradication of multiple fungal species and strains, including multiple clinical strains of Candida auris, the causative agent of the global fungal epidemic. In addition, photoinactivation of catalase is shown to facilitate macrophage killing of intracellular Candida albicans. The antifungal efficacy of catalase photoinactivation is further validated using a Candida albicans-induced mouse model of skin abrasion. Taken together, our findings offer a novel catalase-photoinactivation approach to address multidrug-resistant Candida infections.","Dong, Pu-Ting; Zhan, Yuewei; Jusuf, Sebastian; Hui, Jie; Dagher, Zeina; Mansour, Michael K.; Cheng, Ji-Xin",bioRxiv,717,16

DESIGN Evaluation and in vitro validation study. SETTING Ventilator shortage during the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic. PARTICIPANTS The design and validation team consisted of intensive care physicians, bioengineers, computer programmers, and representatives from the medtech sector. METHODS Using standard clinical components, a system of shared ventilation consisting of two ventilatory limbs was assembled and connected to a single ventilator. Individual monitors for each circuit were developed using widely available equipment and open source software. System performance was determined under 2 sets of conditions. First, the effect of altering ventilator settings (Inspiratory Pressure, Respiratory rate, I:E ratio) on the tidal volumes delivered to each lung circuit was determined. Second, the impact of altering the compliance and resistance in one simulated lung circuit on the tidal volumes delivered to that lung and the second lung circuit was determined. All measurements at each setting were repeated three times to determine the variability in the system. RESULTS The system permitted accurate and reproducible titration of tidal volumes to each lung circuit over a wide range of ventilator settings and simulated lung conditions. Alteration of ventilator inspiratory pressures stepwise from 4-20cm H2O, of respiratory rates from 6-20 breaths/minute and I:E ratio from 1:1 to 1:4 resulted in near identical tidal volumes delivered under each set of conditions to each simulated lung. Stepwise alteration of compliance and resistance in one test lung circuit resulted in reproducible alterations in tidal volume to the test lung, with little change to tidal volumes in the control lung (a change of only 6% is noted). All tidal volumes delivered were highly reproducible upon repetition. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate the reliability of a simple shared ventilation system assembled using commonly available clinical components that allows individual titration of tidal volumes. This system may be useful as a temporary strategy of last resort where the numbers of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation exceeds supply of ventilators.","Laffey, J. G.; Hannon, D.

Methods: Nationwide survey in February-March 2021 of adults representative across sex, age and location. Vaccine uptake and a range of putative drivers of uptake, including vaccine confidence, socioeconomic status, and sources of trust, were examined using logistic and Bayesian regressions for vaccines generally and for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Results: Overall 1,166 surveys were collected from participants aged 18 to 90 years (mean 52, SD of 19). Seventy-eight percent reported being likely to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. Higher SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions were associated with: increasing age (OR: 1.04 95%CI [1.03-1.044]), being male (OR: 1.37, 95% CI [1.08-1.72]), residing in the least disadvantaged area quintile (OR: 2.27 95%CI [1.53-3.37]) and a self-perceived high risk of getting COVID-19 (OR: 1.52 95% CI [1.08-2.14]). However, 72% of participants did not believe that they were at a high risk of getting COVID-19. Findings regarding vaccines in general were similar except there were no sex differences. For both the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and vaccines in general, there were no differences in intentions to vaccinate as a function of education level, perceived income level, and rurality. Knowing that the vaccine is safe and effective, and that getting vaccinated will protect others, trusting the company that made it and getting vaccination recommended by a doctor were reported to influence a large proportion of the study cohort to uptake the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Seventy-eight percent reported the intent to continue engaging in virus-protecting behaviours (mask wearing, social distancing etc.) post-vaccine. Conclusions: Seventy-eight percent of Australians are likely to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Key influencing factors identified in this study (e.g. knowing that the vaccine is safe and effective, getting a doctor's recommendation to get vaccinated) can be used to inform public health messaging to enhance vaccination rates.

Here we reported the interim results from an ongoing phase Ib dose escalation and expansion study assessing the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy for KN026 in combination with KN046 in Patients with HER2 aberrated solid tumors.MethodsThis study enrolled pts with solid tumors who failed available standard of care, HER2 aberration status confirmed locally (HER2 mutation, HER2 amplification and/or HER2 overexpression). Eligible pts received combination of KN026 and KN046 at three dose levels until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of informed consent (DL1: KN026 20 mg/kg Q2W + KN046 3 mg/kg Q2W;DL2: KN026 20 mg/kg Q2W with loading on Days 1, 8 of Cycle 1 + KN046 5 mg/kg Q3W;DL3: KN026 30 mg/kg Q3W with loading on Days 1, 8 of Cycle 1 + KN046 5 mg/kg Q3W). Tumor response was evaluated Q8W per RECIST 1.1. Primary endpoint was DLT and key secondary endpoints were efficacy parameters (ORR, DOR, PFS).ResultsAs of the Sep. 08, 2020, 25 pts were enrolled into DL1 (n = 20, 3 for dose escalation), DL2 (n = 3) and DL3 (n = 2) (mGC/GEJ 15 pts;mCRC 8 pts;other solid tumors 2 pts). 15 pts remained on the study treatment and 10 pts discontinued treatment due to disease progression (n=5), death (n=2) and other reasons (n=3). 18 pts had HER2-positive status (12 of 18 failed previous trastuzumab therapy), 2 pts had HER2 mutation and 5 pts had HER2 low expression (without FISH amplification). No DLTs were observed. No pts experienced LVEF decreased or other clinically meaningful cardiac AEs. Treatment-related TEAEs occurred in 23 (92%) pts, of which 6 (24%) pts experienced grade 3 or above treatment-related TEAEs. 11 (44%) pts experienced irAEs, majority were of grade 1 or 2 except that 1 patient experienced grade 3 immune-mediated endocrinopathy. The most common (frequency ≥ 15%) KN026 or KN046 related TEAEs were infusion related reaction (n=11, 44.0%), anaemia (n=9, 36.0%), white blood cell count decreased (n=6, 24.0%), diarrhea (n=5, 20.0%), AST increased (n=5, 20.0%), platelet count decreased (n=5, 20.0%), rash (n=5, 20.0%) and ALT increased (n=4, 16.0%). The objective response rate in pts with HER2-positive tumors (n = 14 efficacy evaluable pts) was 9/14 (64.3%, 95% CI 35.1~87.2%) and disease control rate 13/14 (92.9%, 95% CI 66.1~99.8%). 4 out of 5 pts with HER2 mutation or low expression achieved SD including one patient with SD for more than 24 weeks. 2 death cases due to disease progression were reported, both only received one cycle of KN026 plus KN046 due to COVID-19 restriction.ConclusionsKN026 combined with KN046 is well tolerated and has demonstrated preliminary albeit profound anti-tumor activity in HER2-positive solid tumors.Trial RegistrationClinical trial information: NCT04040699ReferenceShiying Wu, Qian Zhang, Fei Zhang, et al.

We demonstrated noninvasive control of Drosophila cardiac rhythms, including simulated tachycardia in ReaChR-expressing flies and bradycardia and cardiac arrest in halorhodopsin (NpHR)-expressing flies at multiple developmental stages. By using red excitation light, we were able to pace flies at higher efficiency and with lower power than with equivalent blue light excitation systems. The recovery dynamics after red-light stimulation of NpHR flies were observed and quantified.

ABCs are an emerging population of CD11c+ T-bet+ B cells critical for antiviral responses and autoimmune disorders. DEF6 and SWAP70, are two homologous molecules whose combined absence in double-knock-out mice (DKOs) leads to a lupus syndrome in females marked by an accumulation of ABCs. Here we demonstrate that DKO ABCs exhibit sex-specific differences in their expansion, upregulation of an ISG signature, and further differentiation. BCR sequencing and fate mapping experiments reveal that DKO ABCs undergo oligoclonal expansion and differentiate into both CD11c+ and CD11c- effector populations with pathogenic and proinflammatory potential. Tlr7 duplication in DKO males overrides the sex-bias and further augments the dissemination and pathogenicity of ABCs resulting in severe pulmonary inflammation and early mortality. Thus, sexual dimorphism shapes the expansion, function, and differentiation of ABCs contributing to the sex-bias that accompanies TLR7-driven immunopathogenesis.","Ricker, Edd; Manni, Michela; Flores-Castro, Danny; Jenkins, Daniel; Gupta, Sanjay; Rivera-Correa, Juan; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M.; Pannellini, Tania; Bachu, Mahesh; Chinenov, Yurii; Sculco, Peter K.; Jessberger, Rolf; Prak, Eline T.

It significantly increases in institutionalised subjects, especially in presence of cognitive impairments. For this reason, it is essential to early detect nutritional deficiencies and unhealthy dietary habits and to timely trigger proper feedback and interventions. Malnutrition assessment in clinical settings is generally based on standard screening tools including questionnaires, rating scales, and biometrics. Technological solutions based on IoT and mobile devices, along with AI techniques for data analysis, could provide important advantages in the risk assessment and prevention. In this paper we present a Decision Support System for the early detection of malnutrition risk based on data collected by a m-health application for nutritional and body composition monitoring. The application has been in use in a nursing home in Italy from March 2018 and, considering drop-outs and the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, we have been able to collect consistent data over three different trial periods. In collaboration with a medical specialist, we performed feature engineering to estimate daily intake for the major food components, meal completeness, variability, considering also physiological data. Then, we ran several Machine Learning models using the results of Mini Nutritional Assessment rating scale as ground truth, and applying SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning to deal with the dataset imbalance.

However, the success of COVID-19 vaccination programme will be dependent on the development of effective and safer vaccines and also on the public acceptance which in turn reliant on the beliefs and perception towards the vaccine. Therefore, this study was aimed to analyse the beliefs and barriers associated with COVID-19 vaccination among the general population in India. The study conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire that was distributed among the general population of India during the month of October 2020. The online questionnaire addressed several variables including the socio-demographic parameters, beliefs toward COVID-19 vaccine/vaccination, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, potential barriers that may prevent from being vaccinated and factors that can improve COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Among the 351 participants, 55% believed that the COVID-19 vaccination will be safe while only 46.2% believed that it will be effective. Majority of the participants (86.3%) were planning to get COVID-19 vaccination, whereas 13.7% admitted hesitancy. However, only 65.8% of the participants responded that they will receive vaccination as soon as possible whenever the vaccine is available. The study also identified that the concerns regarding the vaccine side effects acted as the key barrier for vaccine acceptance. The major findings of this study can be utilized in planning vaccination campaigns. Furthermore, the level of vaccine acceptance can be increased within the population if additional studies can confirm the safety and effectiveness of available vaccine candidates.","Khan, Sharun Rahman C.

Social distancing and isolation measures have negatively impacted physical functioning (PF) and mental health (MH), and are known to have reduced physical activity (PA) generally within the population. A significant proportion of patients with autoimmune rheumatic disease (ARD) are considered 'clinically extremely vulnerable' (CEV), at high risk from COVID19 and been advised to follow stricter social distancing precautions than the general population. Evidence in ARD patients highlights the importance of PA in maintaining physical and psychological wellbeing. Prior to the pandemic limitations in both PF and MH in patients with ARD were recognised and early in the pandemic MH was noted to be impacted by distancing measures in this population. Objectives: This is an interim report of a research study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04542031) exploring the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the physical and psychological wellbeing of patients with rheumatic disease, to inform guidelines and target service provision as the pandemic continues. Methods: We distributed two web-based surveys, eight months apart during the first (April-2020) and second wave (December-2020) of the pandemic. Surveys were communicated via a linked mobile-phone SMS message, to all rheumatology patients with a validated mobile number under follow-up at the Royal Wolverhampton Trust. We assessed patients using the Short Form-12 version 2 made up of mental (MCS) and physical component scores (PCS). For each survey, data were collected 4-weeks following distribution;comparative analysis was conducted using SPSS version-27. Results: Initial surveys were sent to 7911 active follow up patients;1694/7911 (21.4%) responded and consented for further follow up, of which 1636 were linked to a validated mobile number. 899/1636 (55.0%) responded to the second survey and 824/899 (91.7%) responses were linked across both surveys. These 824 patients were predominately female (69.5%), aged 61 years and 76.3% had an ARD;388/824 patients were CEV, 436 were in the comparator group. For the CEV group, scores remained significantly lower than the comparator for PCS (survey 1: 36.40 vs 39.61 [P<0.001], survey 2: 36.11 vs 38.66 [P<0.001]) and MCS (41.61 vs 43.44 P<0.001;41.19 vs 43.60 [P<0.001]);there was no deterioration in CEV scores. In the comparator group, while MCS did not differ in patients with ARD, PCS significantly decreased (1.39;95% CI: 0.69, 2.08;P<0.001);PCS in the non-inflammatory group did not significantly change (-0.23, P=0.65). Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that while the physical and mental health of CEV patients is significantly lower in this cohort, surprisingly, neither aspects of health have been worsened by the impacts of the pandemic over an 8-month period. However, the physical functioning of patients with ARD significantly decreased in this time, which may reflect the reduction in PA faced by society, and reduced contact with secondary care services. These data suggest services need to adapt to provide additional support to patients with ARD to maintain physical functioning during the pandemic. Further work exploring the evolving pattern of the physical and psychological responses to the pandemic is ongoing.","Cleaton, N.; Raizada, S.; Sheeran, T.; Bateman, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,717,27

The overuse of antibiotics leads to the emergence of ‘superbugs’;therefore, it is urgent to develop effective strategies to fight bacteria. Herein, a superparamagnetic nickel (Ni) colloidal nanocrystal clusters (SNCNCs) that can kill and capture bacteria without any camouflage is reported. It binds to amino groups on the surface of bacteria, imparts magnetism to them, and orients them in response to magnetic fields. SNCNCs kill and capture bacteria to avoid inflammation, infection, and organ damage caused by lipopolysaccharide and exotoxin released by bacterial rupture in the remaining bacterial remains in comparison with other antibacterial agents. In this study, in the treatment of traumatic oral ulcers, we found that SNCNCs could kill and capture and remove bacteria from the ulcers to reduce inflammation at the site of the wound. Furthermore, the fibrin gel sprayed on the ulcer was used as a substrate, and the bacteria captured by the SNCNCs moved to the surface of the fibrin gel after a magnetic field was applied. Therefore, the bacteria in the ulcer could be removed with the SNCNCs and fibrin gel magnet, alleviating inflammation caused by bacteria and promoting ulcer healing. This magnetically controlled method of directional movement of bacteria may provide an applicative perspective for the therapy of bacterial infections. © 2021 The Author(s)","Zheng, B.; Guo, M.; Bai, Y.; Wang, S.; Li, B.; Gu, Y.; Hou, B.; Wang, T.; Ming, D.",Materials Today Advances,717,24

Every moment, the hands are used to greet people and handle objects, but shortly thereafter, it is common to use them to touch the face. Such an involuntary action can take all kinds of harmful agents into our bodies. Hence, this work aims to present and share the development of a low cost bracelet that helps the user not to touch the face with the hands. As a result, it is expected to reduce the spread of this virus through this type of contagion. For this, the bracelet monitors the position of the hands and issues an alert when it detects the approach of the hand to the face as a warning to the user not do this. Initially, a first prototype was made to observe local public (state of Alagoas-Brazil) interest in the product. This way, there were a positive feedback from public. The sequence of the project was extended in the development of the product such a way that it can be used by the final public in risky regions. Due to its low cost, this bracelet can be used by people from underdeveloped countries like Brazil, and countries in Africa to stop practicing this harmful habit for their health. In this sense, some financial grants for Humanitarian relief efforts can be considered. Thanks to government funding, 500 bracelet units are being made for donation to the state of Alagoas, Brazil. It is important to mention that the objective of this work is not to replace the existing preventing methods, but to offer a bracelet proposition to come as an extra support to reduce even more that risk to contract COVID-19. Hence, the solution can be added with all other existing in order to decrease even more the chances of contracting COVID-19. Therefore, the social distance, the use ofmasks and a good hand hygiene are still the safest way to avoid COVID-19. However, our bracelet can help people to avoid the eye touching, such habit can lead to COVID-19 that traditional low cost cotton masks do not protect and is more comfortably for hours of use than face shields.","Vieira, D.

Numerous reports consistently demonstrate that CVDs are a major risk factor for severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including higher risks of hospitalizations and inpatient mortality. In the context of the current pandemic, managing patients with CVDs requires special attention from doctors. There are now more and more reports of the long-term effects of COVID-19. The long-term effects on cardiovascular system of millions of COVID-19 survivors are currently unknown. The aim of the review was to systematize the accumulated knowledge about the mutual influence of COVID-19 and CVDs. The features of CVD impact on the course and outcomes of COVID-19, as well as the reasons for the worsening of CVD course in patients with COVID-19 are considered. The impact of redistribution of health care resources and large-scale isolation measures on the management of patients with CVDs is discussed. The review also presents the most relevant data on long COVID. Predictors of a long-term disease course were identified for risk stratification in order to timely implement preventive measures and develop an individualized treatment. The authors focused on finding novel approaches to reduce CVD mortality during a pandemic.

Многочисленные отчеты неизменно демонстрируют, что болезни системы кровообращения являются одним из основных факто- ров риска увеличения тяжести новой коронавирусной инфекции (COVID-19, CoronaVIrus Disease 2019), включая более высокие риски госпитализаций и внутрибольничной смертности. В условиях те- кущей пандемии сопровождение пациентов с кардиоваскулярной патологией требует особо пристального внимания врачей. В на- стоящее время появляется все больше сообщений о долгосрочных эффектах COVID-19. Отдаленные последствия заболевания для здоровья сердечно-сосудистой системы миллионов людей, пере- живших инфекцию, в настоящий момент неизвестны. Цель обзора -- систематизация накопленных знаний о взаимном влиянии COVID-19 и ССЗ. Рассматриваются особенности воздей- ствия ССЗ на течение и исходы COVID-19, причины ухудшения те- чения кардиоваскулярной патологии у больных коронавирусной инфекцией. Обсуждается влияние перераспределения ресурсов здравоохранения и масштабных мер изоляции на курацию паци- ентов с ССЗ. Также в обзоре представлены наиболее актуальные данные о постковидном синдроме. Выделены предикторы затяж- ного течения заболевания для стратификации риска с целью своевременной реализации профилактических мер и разработки ин- дивидуализированного лечения.

The paper examines institutional efforts to both introduce and implement ESD curricula and provide SL.Design/methodology/approachThe methods used in this paper included reviews of university Web pages and course materials. Structured interviews were also conducted with program leaders, to examine the level of ESD, as input affecting the business programs curricula of the universities concerned.FindingsInitial findings suggest that, in the three HEIs surveyed, there is still a tendency to talk about issues related to ESD but actions that confirm this interest are not sufficiently advanced. The authors surveys a sample of business programs curricula and interviewed its leaders and a mixed and dated picture emerged. When compared to other regions particularly the USA and Europe, the findings show that the HEIs surveyed still have not developed enough work to distinguish conceptually between sustainable development, ESD and SL making the embedment of these concepts in the curriculum not fully developed.Originality/valueIn LA HEIs, the ESD message seems to be slowly taking ground, equipping HEIs to respond to SL concerns. Implementation and practice in some HEIs are still at an embryonic and conceptually confused stage with regard to LA HEIs SL. This paper sheds light to help ESD delivery. It offers some strategies for moving on from this inception phase to a more structured SL provision and ESD outlook.","Melissa Franchini, Cavalcanti-Bandos Quispe-Prieto Silvia Paucar-Caceres Alberto Burrowes-Cromwel Toni Héctor Heraldo Rojas-Jiménez",International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education,717,26

In each sample, measures of internalizing problems were obtained from ongoing data collections pre-pandemic (NGS= 35,357; NCS= 4,487) and twice during the pandemic, in Apr.-May 2020 (NGS= 3,938; clinical: NCS= 1,008) and in Nov.-Dec. 2020 (NGS= 1,489; NCS= 1,536), in children and adolescents (8-18 years) with parent- (Brief Problem Monitor) and/or child reports (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System). Results show significantly greater proportions of worrisome internalizing problems (based on validated cut-offs) and significantly higher internalizing problems mean levels from pre-pandemic to pandemic measurements in the general population. These levels stabilized or decreased over the course of the pandemic. In the clinical sample, we found an increase in child-reported internalizing problems measures over the course of the pandemic, but parents reported no differences in internalizing problems measures over the course of the pandemic, nor from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic. Overall, the findings indicate that children and adolescents of both the general and clinical population were affected negatively by the pandemic in terms of their internalizing problems. Attention is therefore warranted to investigate what long-term effects this may cause and to monitor if internalizing problems return back to pre-pandemic levels or if they remain elevated post-pandemic.","Fischer, K.; Tieskens, J.; Luijten, M.; Zijlmans, J.; van Oers, H.; de Groot, R.; van der Doelen, D.; van Ewijk, H.; Klip, H.; van der Lans, R.; de Meyer, R.; van der Mheen, M.; van Muilekom, M.; Ruisch, H.; Teela, L.; van den Berg, G.; Bruining, H.; van der Rijken, R.; Buitelaar, J.; Hoekstra, P.; Lindauer, R.; Oostrom, K.; Staal, W.; Vermeiren, R.; Cornet, R.; Haverman, L.; Bartels, M.; Polderman, T.; Popma, A.",,717,1

Additionally to these functional roles, T and B-cell lymphocytes rely on the diversity of their receptor chains to recognize different pathogens. The lymphocyte subclasses emerge from common ancestors generated with the same diversity of receptors during selection processes. Here we leverage biophysical models of receptor generation with machine learning models of selection to identify specific sequence features characteristic of functional lymphocyte repertoires and subrepertoires. Specifically, using only repertoire level sequence information, we classify CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, find correlations between receptor chains arising during selection, and identify T-cell subsets that are targets of pathogenic epitopes. We also show examples of when simple linear classifiers do as well as more complex machine learning methods.","Isacchini, Giulio; Walczak, Aleksandra M.; Mora, Thierry; Nourmohammad, Armita",bioRxiv,717,1

A major endeavour in visual neuroscience, therefore, is to uncover the image statistics that predict perceptual and cognitive function. When searching for targets in natural images, for example, it has recently been proposed that target detection is inversely related to the spatial similarity of the target to its local background. We tested this hypothesis by measuring observers’ sensitivity to targets that were blended with natural image backgrounds. Importantly, targets were designed to have a spatial structure that was either similar or dissimilar to the background. Contrary to masking from similarity, however, we found that observers were most sensitive to targets that were most similar to their backgrounds. We hypothesised that a coincidence of phase-alignment between target and background results in a local contrast signal that facilitates detection when target-background similarity is high. We confirmed this prediction in a second experiment. Indeed, we show that, by solely manipulating the phase of a target relative to its background, the target can be rendered easily visible or completely undetectable. Our study thus reveals a set of image statistics that predict how well people can perform the ubiquitous task of detecting an object in clutter.","Rideaux, Reuben; West, Rebecca K.; Bex, Peter J.; Mattingley, Jason B.; Harrison, William J.",bioRxiv,717,16

Currently, that role is being hampered by a climate that constrains teaching, research, hiring, and overall discourse. There are three core beliefs that define this climate. First, any initiative framed as an antidote to historical societal ills is automatically deemed meritorious, and thus exempted from objective scrutiny of its potential effectiveness. However, to use a medical analogy, not all proposed cures for a disease are good cures. Second, all differences in group-level outcomes are assumed to be due entirely to discrimination, with little tolerance given to exploring the potential role of factors such as culture or preferences. Third, everything must be interpreted through the lens of identity. Non-identity-centered perspectives, regardless of how worthy they might be, are viewed as less legitimate or even illegitimate. All of these beliefs are well intentioned and have arisen in response to important historical and continuing injustices. However, they are enforced in uncompromising terms through the use of social media, which has gained an ascendant role in shaping the culture of American campuses. The result is a climate that forecloses entire lines of research, entire discussions, and entire ways of conducting classroom teaching. The book explains these three beliefs in detail and provides an extensive list of case studies illustrating how they are impacting education and knowledge creation-and increasingly the world beyond campus. The book also provides a detailed set of recommendations on ways to help foster an environment on American campuses that would be more tolerant of diverse perspectives and open inquiry. A note about Covid-19: While the production of this book was done in spring and summer of 2020, we completed the manuscript in 2019, well before the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered American college campuses in March 2020. To put it mildly, the dynamics of campus discourse are very different when dorms have been largely emptied and instruction has been moved to Zoom. Of course, at present we cannot know when students will be able to return to campus in significant numbers. That said, we are confident that our call for a culture of more open discourse in higher education will remain relevant both during the pandemic and after it has passed. © Oxford University Press 2020.","Redstone, I.; Villasenor, J.",Unassailable Ideas: How Unwritten Rules and Social Media Shape Discourse in American Higher Education,717,7

In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). While double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-coronavirus RO element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional coronavirus-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative EM autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells infected with the beta-CoVs MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in coronavirus infection.","Snijder, Eric J.; Limpens, Ronald W.A.L.; de Wilde, Adriaan H.; de Jong, Anja W.

L’objectif principal de notre étude était de comparer la variabilité de l’activité chirurgicale et de consultation de 2 centres SOS main entre la période de pandémie et hors pandémie. Les objectifs secondaires étaient d’identifier les patients à risque afin de développer des moyens de prévention en traumatologie de la main. Méthodes: Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective bi-centrique à visée épidémiologique sur les admissions aux urgences traumatologiques pendant le premier confinement français. Les données ont été comparées à la même période en 2019 (groupe contrôle). 2055 patients ont consulté pour un traumatisme de la main ou du poignet. Résultats: En 2020, l’activité des centres SOS main a diminué de 35% en zone COVID-19 contre 24% en zone non COVID-19 par rapport à la même période en 2019 (p<0,0001 IC95 6,5-15,6). En comparant 2019 et 2020, l’incidence des plaies a augmenté en zone COVID-19 (58% vs 78% p<0,0001) et diminué en zone non COVID-19 (55% vs 50% p<0,0001). Les plaies complexes (16% vs 35% p<0,0001 et 15% vs 17% p<0,0001) et les fractures ouvertes (8% vs 14% p 0,019 et 4,5% vs 5,3% p<0,0001) ont augmenté dans les 2 zones pendant la pandémie.

From January to May 2020, we documented over 500 design interventions that have been created by individuals, networks, amateurs, professionals, and public and private organizations and institutions. This international response witnessed the rapid design and development of products, networks and systems such as facemasks, hospitals, infographics, respirators, sanitizers, and virtual communities all created in an effort to save us. In response to the Covid-19 virus the problems that the world faced were highly complex, interdependent, and could not be addressed by conventional means. As such, this paper presents over 500 design-led responses that illustrate comprehensively that when pressed we can find new ways of designing. In short, this work outlines what we might think of as a new model for designing. This new model does not describe a new condition to come after what we currently call design. Rather, what we witness here is the revival of the practice of design-from handmaiden of Capital to one of Care-which is expressed in a new critical attitude for looking at the design world, probing its practice, its theoretical position and its product. © 2020 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

Here, we determined circulating miRNA and cytokine and chemokine (CC) profiles in 171 blood plasma samples from 58 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Thirty-two miRNAs were differentially expressed in severe cases when compared to moderate and mild cases. These miRNAs and their predicted targets reflected key COVID-19 features including cell death and hypoxia. Compared to mild cases, moderate and severe cases were characterised by a global decrease in circulating miRNA levels. Partial least squares regression using miRNA and CC measurements allowed for discrimination of severe cases with greater accuracy (87%) than using miRNA or CC levels alone. Correlation analysis revealed severity group-specific associations between CC and miRNA levels. Importantly, the miRNAs that correlated with IL6 and CXCL10, two cardinal COVID-19-associated cytokines, were distinct between severity groups, providing a novel qualitative way to stratify patients with similar levels of proinflammatory cytokines but different disease severity. Integration of miRNA and CC levels with clinical parameters revealed severity-specific signatures associated with clinical hallmarks of COVID-19.

The subsequent efficient human-to-human transmission of this virus eventually affected millions of people worldwide. The most devastating thing is that the infection rate is continuously uprising and resulting in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. This enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus is chiefly responsible for the infection of the upper respiratory system. The virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 is mostly regulated by its proteins like entry to the host cell through fusion mechanism, fusion of infected cells with neighboring uninfected cells to spread the virus, inhibition of host gene expression, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, etc. But very little is known about the protein structures and functionalities. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to learn more about these proteins through bioinformatics approaches. In this study, ORF10, ORF7b, ORF7a, ORF6, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein have been selected from a Bangladeshi Corona-virus strain G039392 and a number of bioinformatics tools (MEGA-X-V10.1.7, PONDR®, ProtScale, ProtParam, SCRIBER, NetSurfP v2.0, IntFOLD, UCSF Chimera, and PyMol) and strategies were implemented for multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny analysis with 9 different variants, predicting hydropathicity, amino acid compositions, protein-binding propensity, protein disorders, 2D and 3D protein modeling. Selected proteins were characterized as highly flexible, structurally and electrostatically extremely stable, ordered, biologically active, hydrophobic, and closely related to the proteins of different variants. This detailed information regarding the characterization and structure of proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Bangladeshi variant was performed for the first time ever to unveil the deep mechanism behind the virulence features and also, this robust appraisal paves the future way for molecular docking, vaccine development targeting these characterized proteins.","Debnath, Pinky; Khan, Umama; Khan, Md.

This study aimed to estimate the long-term impacts of the pandemic on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada using a mathematical model. Methods: We developed a stochastic microsimulation model to estimate the cancer care disruptions and its long-term impact on cancer incidence and mortality in Canada. The model reproduces cancer incidence, survival, and epidemiology in Canada, by using cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis and survival data from the Canadian Cancer Registries. We modeled reported declines in cancer diagnoses and treatments recorded in provincial administrative datasets from March 2020-June 2021. We assumed that diagnostic and treatment delays lead to an increased rate of death. Based on the literature, we assumed each 4-week delay in diagnosis and treatment would lead to a 6% to 50% higher rate of cancer death. Results are the median predictions of 10 stochastic simulations. Findings: The model predicts that cancer care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to 21,247 (2.0%) more cancer deaths in Canada in 2020-2030, assuming treatment capacity is recovered to 2019 pre-pandemic levels in 2021. This represents 355,172 life years lost expected due to pandemic-related diagnostic and treatment delays. The highest absolute expected excess cancer mortality was predicted in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, and in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Diagnostic and treatment capacity in 2021 onwards highly influenced the number of predicted cancer deaths over the next decade. Interpretation: Cancer care disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to significant life loss; however, most of these could be mitigated by increasing diagnostic and treatment capacity in the post-pandemic era to address the service backlog.

Venetoclax (VEN) in particular is able to obtain undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD), though only in a proportion of patients (pts) when given as single agent, thus warranting the need of different strategies in those not achieving uMRD. We designed a phase 2 multicenter Italian study where ibrutinib (IBR) is added to VEN based on a MRD-driven strategy aiming at obtaining uMRD and discontinuing both treatments in pts who did not achieve uMRD with VEN mono. Study treatment started with VEN (ramp up to 400 mg/day as per current label) for 12 months. MRD status in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) was evaluated using the 6-color flow cytometry assay recommended by ERIC (CD5/CD81/CD79b/CD19/CD43/CD20). Pts with uMRD in both PB and BM at C12D1 discontinued VEN at C12D28 and entered the follow-up phase. Pts with detectable MRD in PB and/or BM added IBR 420 mg/day starting from C13D1 and continued both drugs up to maximum C24D28, uMRD, progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever occurs first). After C24D28, pts with detectable MRD and still in response continued IBR alone. The primary endpoint was uMRD4 (<1 CLL cell in 104 leukocytes) in both PB and BM. We report here the results as of 15Jul2020 (data cutoff). Thirty-eight pts (recruited from Nov 2017 to Jul 2018) fulfilled eligibility and started VEN. Baseline characteristics included: median number of prior therapies 1 (range 1-4) (60.6% previously treated with FCR or FC);del(17p) in 8/33 (24%);TP53 mutations in 10/30 (33%), and unmutated IGHV in 24/30 (80%). At the data cut-off, 35/38 evaluable pts still in the study have reached C24D1, 1 pt discontinued treatment due to myelodisplasia (considered unrelated to study treatment) before C12D1 and 1 pt progressed on VEN monotherapy shortly before that timepoint, 1 evaluation is still missing due to COVID-19 restrictions. At C12D1, uMRD4 in PB was achieved in 19/38 (50%) pts (Figure 1), 17/19 (89.5%) had uMRD4 confirmed in BM. Overall response rate with VEN single-agent was 36/38 (94.7%), 9 CR and 27 PR. As per protocol, the 17 pts (45%) with uMRD4 in PB and BM at C12D1 discontinued VEN at C12D28. Nineteen responsive cases with detectable MRD at C12D1 added IBR to VEN starting from C13D1. The combination of IBR and VEN led to an improved reduction of the depth of MRD in all but 3 pts with 16/19 (84%) achieving uMRD4 in both PB and BM between C16D1 (first MRD assessment after starting IBR) and C24D1, thus stopping both therapies as per protocol. After a median follow-up of 25.4 months (range 6.1-33.5) from treatment initiation, no clinical progression was observed among those discontinuing treatment in uMRD, while MRD4 relapse occurred in 21/33. Median time to MRD4 relapse in those who achieved uMRD at any timepoint and discontinued treatment was 4 months (range 2-13). Twelve pts (6 treated with VEN only) remain uMRD after stopping treatment, with a median observation of 13 months (range 3+-18+) since confirmed uMRD4. Safety data were analyzed in the intention-to-treat cohort (39 pts). No cases of clinical tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and/or biochemical TLS were reported in the 39 pts exposed to VEN. Adverse events (AEs) were mild, with no treatment discontinuations or dose reductions. Five Serious AEs (Table 1) and 130 AEs (Table 2) occurred in 28 patients, without any SUSARs. All 5 SAEs were deemed unrelated to study drug(s) and 4/5 have resolved without sequelae. In conclusion, we here present the updated results of our study including the combination phase of VEN with IBR. This sequential MRD-guided approach was feasible and led to deeper responses in about 85% of pts not achieving uMRD4 after VEN alone. With this tailored and time-limited strategy 33 out of 38 pts (87%) obtained uMRD4 in PB and BM either after VEN monotherapy or the IBR-VEN combination, indicating we may reach identical depth of re ponse with a personalized intensification and avoid unnecessary drug exposure. Time to clinical progression and response to VEN retreatment in this cohort remain to be established as well as the biological characteristics of those pts with persistent MRD despite the combined treatment. Updated results with further sequential MRD and clinical monitoring after treatment discontinuation will be presented at the meeting.

Methods: Instructors were invited to complete a survey that requested perceptions on methods, perceived quality, and challenges regarding course delivery and assessment in their online classrooms. Results: Despite the fact that more than half of the participants (59%) had some training, the majority (63%) reported that they had no experience in conducting online classrooms. Furthermore, more than 50% of the participants described the quality of the course delivery and assessment as the same or inferior to traditional classrooms. Most participants reported having an issue with measuring student involvement or gaining class interaction. Regarding the course assessment, the vast majority of the participants reported concerns about integrity issues associated with assignments and exams. Implications for Practice and Conclusion: Since instructors reported intention to continue online instruction post-pandemic, industrial engineering programs can begin strengthening the online learning infrastructure and providing some training to the instructors to minimize the discrepancies between face-to-face and online instruction. © 2021 Laureate Education.

Deformability cytometry allows for the characterization of mechanical properties of hundreds of cells per second, opening the way to differentiating cells via mechanotyping. A remaining challenge for detecting and classifying rare sub-populations is the creation of a combined experimental and analysis protocol that would assure classification accuracy approaching 100%. In order to maximize the accuracy, we designed a microfluidic channel that subjects each cell to repeated deformations and relaxations. We also track the shape dynamics of individual cells with high time resolution, and apply sequence-based deep learning models for feature extraction. HL60 cells with and without treatment with cytochalasin D (cytoD), a reagent previously shown to perturb the actin network, were used as a model system to understand the classification potential of our approach. Multiple recurrent and convolutional neural network architectures were trained using time sequences of cell shapes, and shown to achieve high classification accuracy based on cytoskeletal properties alone. The best model classified the two sub-populations of HL60 cells with an accuracy of 95%.

Recent cost reductions and growth of whole genome sequencing has produced a wealth of data in which viral presence and integration detection is possible. While key research and clinically relevant insights can be uncovered, existing software has not achieved widespread adoption, limited in part due to high computational costs, the inability to detect a wide range of viruses, as well as precision and sensitivity. Here, we describe VIRUSBreakend, a high-speed tool that identifies viral DNA presence and genomic integration recognition tool using single breakend variant calling. Single breakends are breakpoints in which only one side has been unambiguously placed. We show that by using a novel virus-centric single breakend variant calling and assembly approach, viral integrations can be identified with high sensitivity and a near-zero false discovery rate, even when integrated in regions of the host genome with low mappability, such as centromeres and telomeres that cannot be reliably called by existing tools. Applying VIRUSBreakend to a large metastatic cancer cohort, we demonstrate that it can reliably detect clinically relevant viral presence and integration including HPV, HBV, MCPyV, EBV, and HHV-8.","Cameron, Daniel L.; Papenfuss, Anthony T.",bioRxiv,717,1

Based on real-life pandemic scenarios encountered in Germany, we develop and use a discrete-event simulation model to examine SC operations and performance dynamics with the help of anyLogistix digital SC twin. The computational results show that food retail SC resilience at the upheaval times is triangulated by the pandemic intensity and associated lockdown/shutdown governmental measures, inventory-ordering dynamics in the SC, and customer behaviours. We observe that surges in demand and supplier shutdowns have had the highest impact on SC operations and performance, whereas the impact of transportation disruptions was rather low. Transportation costs have spiked because of chaotic inventory-ordering dynamics leading to more frequent and irregular shipments. On bright side, we observe the demand growth and utilization of online sales channels yielding higher revenues. We propose several directions and practical implementation guidelines to improve the food retail SC resilience. We stress the importance of SC digital twins and end-to-end visibility along with resilient demand, inventory, and capacity management. The outcomes of our study can be instructive for enhancing the resilience of food retail SCs in preparation for future pandemics and pandemic-like crises.","Burgos, Diana Ivanov Dmitry",Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,717,23

The main issue is the reconfirmation of the virus after recovery. South Korean experts believe the reconfirmed cases are caused by reactivation of the virus inside the patients' body, rather than by virus reinfection after recovery. When considering reconfirmed COVID-19 cases, it is important to keep social distancing even after treating the infection.

This may signify the need for using immunomodulatory drugs. Patients with rheumatic diseases (RDs) are prone to severe infectious diseases. Objectives: Whether the presence of the RD itself or the use of its drugs in patients with COVID-19 increases the severity of symptoms and outcomes remains largely unknown. Patients and Methods: In a prospective cohort study conducted in Khorshid hospital of Isfahan, Iran, 219 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled and divided into two groups of patients with a positive history for RD (n=19) and those without this history (NRD, n=200). The severity of symptoms and outcomes was compared between the groups. Results: Shortness of breath (P = 0.001), cough (P = 0.019), and weakness (P = 0.001) were significantly higher in the RD than the NRD group after, but not before, recovery. All the patients in the RD group had comorbid diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease), the number of which was significantly higher than that of the NRD group (P &lt; 0.001). The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to predict 10-year survival in patients with multiple comorbidities. It was significantly lower in the RD group as opposed to the NRD group (P &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression also showed a non-significantly higher chance of the composite outcome (ICU admission, death status, and intubation status) in the RD group as opposed to the NRD group, both before and after adjustment for confounding factors. However, no difference was found between the RD patient who received corticosteroid as a treatment (RD-CS) and those who did not (RD-NCS). Conclusion: The results showed an increased risk for severe forms of COVID-19 in RD patients. This risk is possibly attributable to a high prevalence of comorbidities in these patients.","Salesi, M.; Sami, R.; Ahmadi, S.

Robots require computer vision to interact with the surrounding environment. Computer vision is an area of study which deals with the algorithms which interpret the data from images or videos. One scenario in which robots could be helpful is in the medical field. This paper presents a set of algorithms which cater to the needs of a medical robot. An object detection algorithm is trained for the objects expected in medical environment. The detected object's 3-D coordinates are extracted. To find the 2-D orientation of the object a novel approach based on edge detection and linear regression is described and implemented. These algorithms help the robots to serve in the medical environment where the contagious diseases are a threat to healthcare workers as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 IEEE.,"Bharath Chandra, A.

For healthcare projects in the UK, this includes statutory and guidance documents. Existing research indicates that they contain subjective requirements, which challenge the practical adoption of automated compliance checking, leading to limited outcomes. This paper aims to propose recommendations for the adoption of automated compliance checking in the design of healthcare buildings. Design Science Research was used to gain a detailed understanding of how information from existing regulatory requirements affects automation, through an empirical study in the design of a primary healthcare facility. In this study, a previously proposed taxonomy was implemented and refined, resulting in the identification of different types of subjective requirements. Based on empirical data emerging from the research, a set of recommendations was proposed focusing on the revision of regulatory documents, as well as to aid designers implementing automated compliance in practice.","Soliman-Junior, Joao Tzortzopoulos Patricia Baldauf Juliana Parise Pedo Barbara Kagioglou Mike Formoso Carlos Torres Humphreys Julian",Automation in Construction,717,9

This was a general pattern across countries, but Canada's agricultural trade increased by at least 11%, more than the world aggregate and that of the U.S. This was mostly due to the success of crop exports, specifically in oilseeds, lentils, and cereals. Although some of the increase was due to rising commodity prices, for the most part trade volumes also increased substantially. Not only was Canada's export boom not expected but it was also not closely related to the pandemic. It was due to commodity‐specific circumstances, such as China's rebuilding of its depleted hog herd, a short crop of lentils in India, and demand shifts to Canadian wheat, durum and barley. Increased Asian demand helped this export growth, but accounted for less than a third of it. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Contrairement aux prévisions d’avril 2020 concernant les effets de la pandémie sur le commerce agricole du Canada, nous constatons un an plus tard que la récession a été plus profonde, que les échanges totaux ont moins diminué que ce qui était généralement prévu et que le commerce agricole n’a pas chuté, mais a plutôt augmenté. Ceci est une tendance générale pour tous les pays, mais le commerce agricole du Canada a augmenté d'au moins 11 pourcents, ce qui représente plus que la moyenne mondiale et la hausse des États‐Unis. Cela a été principalement dû au succès des exportations de grains, en particulier les oléagineux, les lentilles et les céréales. Bien qu'une partie de l'augmentation soit due à la hausse des prix de ces denrées, les volumes des échanges ont, pour la plupart, aussi augmenté considérablement. Non seulement le boom des exportations du Canada n’était pas prévu, mais il n’était pas non plus étroitement lié à la pandémie. Cela est dû à des circonstances propres à chaque produit, telles que la reconstitution par la Chine de son troupeau décimé de porcs, une faible récolte de lentilles en Inde et des déplacements de la demande vers le blé, le blé dur et l'orge canadiens. L'augmentation de la demande asiatique a contribué à cette croissance des exportations, mais en a représenté moins du tiers.

The corresponding molecular pathways switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, due to changes in glucose degradation mechanisms known as the 'Warburg reprogramming' of cancer cells. Key glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters and transcription factors involved in the Warburg transformation are frequently dysregulated during carcinogenesis considered as promising diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as treatment targets. Flavonoids are molecules with pleiotropic activities. The metabolism-regulating anticancer effects of flavonoids are broadly demonstrated in preclinical studies. Flavonoids modulate key pathways involved in the Warburg phenotype including but not limited to PKM2, HK2, GLUT1 and HIF-1. The corresponding molecular mechanisms and clinical relevance of 'anti-Warburg' effects of flavonoids are discussed in this review article.

In doing so, it summarizes the origin of coronavirus, epidemiology, mode of transmission, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of the disease. Although many steps have been taken by the Government and the private sector of Bangladesh to create awareness about measures needed to prevent the deadly infections, many people are unaware of and reluctant to accept the prescribed rules. Inadequacy of diagnostic facilities and limitations of clinical care and health care services were major constraints faced in treating COVID-19 infected people in Bangladesh. Greater compliance by the people in following the suggested measures may help reduce the rapid spread of the disease and overcome the challenges faced by this pandemic.","Islam, Sufia; Mannan, Fouzia; Islam, Tahiya; Rahman, Sabera; Liza, Saki Sultana; Chisti, Mohammod Jobayer; Islam, Rizwanul",J Infect Dev Ctries,717,24

Presently, COVID-19 is an unprecedented worldwide biohazard, and a nosocomial outbreak can occur in any hospital at any time. Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding hospital preparedness, the initial management of COVID-19, and the surveillance of healthcare workers (HCWs) to find information that would be generally useful for physicians when confronted with COVID-19. In terms of hospital preparedness, each hospital should develop an incident management system and establish a designated multidisciplinary medical team. To initiate case management, COVID-19 should be suspected based on patient symptoms and/or high-risk history and then should be confirmed by viral testing, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Although some patients will become critically ill, the guidelines for respiratory failure and septic shock for non-COVID-19 cases can be followed for supportive treatment. Antiviral medications should be carefully selected because the available information is confused by the large volume of preprint literature and unreliable data. HCWs who have come into contact with patients with COVID-19 can generate new in-hospital clusters of COVID-19 cases. Quarantine following contact tracking with risk stratification is effective in preventing transmission, and the essentials of medical surveillance include monitoring different types of symptoms, delegation of supervision, and continuation of surveillance regardless of the RT-PCR results.

Mobile mental health apps can be scalable, useful tools in large-scale disaster responses and are particularly promising for reaching vulnerable populations. COVID Coach is a free, evidence-informed mobile app designed specifically to provide tools and resources for addressing COVID-19 related stress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to characterize overall usage of COVID Coach, explore retention and return usage, and assess whether the app was reaching individuals that may benefit from mental health resources. METHODS: Anonymous usage data collected from COVID Coach between May 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020 were extracted and analyzed for this study. The sample included 49,287 unique user codes and 3,368,931 in-app events. RESULTS: Usage of interactive tools for coping and stress management comprised the majority of key app events (70.4%) and the majority of app users tried a tool for managing stress (58.8%). COVID Coach was utilized for 3 days or fewer among 80.9% of the sample whose first day of app use occurred within the 6-month observation window. Usage of the key content in COVID Coach predicted returning to the app for a second day. Among those who tried at least one coping tool on their first day of app use, 57.2% returned for a second visit; whereas only 46.3% of those who did not try a tool returned (P < .001). Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were prevalent among app users. For example, among app users that completed an anxiety assessment on their first day of app use (n = 4,870; 11.4% of users), 55.1% (n = 2,680) reported levels of anxiety that were moderate to severe, and 29.9% (n = 1,455) of scores fell into the severe symptom range. On average, those with moderate levels of depression on their first day of app use returned to the app for a greater number of days (M = 3.72 days) than those with minimal symptoms (M = 3.08 days, (t(1) = 3.01, P = .003) and individuals with significant PTSD symptoms on their first day of app use utilized the app for a significantly greater number of days (M = 3.79 days) than those with fewer symptoms (M = 3.13 days, (t(1) = 2.29, P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: As the mental health impacts of the pandemic continue to be widespread and increasing, digital health resources, such as apps like COVID Coach, are a scalable way to provide evidence-informed tools and resources. Future research is needed to better understand for whom and under what conditions the app is most helpful and how to increase and sustain engagement.","Jaworski, Beth K; Taylor, Katherine; Ramsey, Kelly M; Heinz, Adrienne; Steinmetz, Sarah; Pagano, Ian; Moraja, Giovanni; Owen, Jason E",J. med. internet res,717,21

The unprecedented, surreal pandemic crisis that surfaced in 2020 brought into especially sharp relief many of the core claims of critical criminology in relation to domination, inequality and injustice within a contemporary capitalist political economy, while it also raised the need to broaden critical criminology studies to incorporate the specificities of the health care systems and the pharmaceutical industry. Following this challenge, the article proposes to foster a ""critical health criminology"" within state-corporate crime research. To do so, this article explores the ""big picture"" in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and reveals how it can be understood as a criminological phenomenon. Such a project incorporates the identification of some conceptual issues requiring attention in relation to advancing an enriched form of criminological analysis in these times, and toward building a foundation for a more fully realized twenty-first century criminology.","Friedrichs, D.

Even though several structures were reported to date, its dynamics is not understood well. In particular, impact of dimerization and ligand binding on the dynamics is an important issue to investigate. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases to investigate influence of dimerization on the dynamics by modeling monomeric and dimeric apo and holo forms. The dimerization causes an organization of the interdomain dynamics as well as some local structural changes. Moreover, we investigated impact of a peptide mimetic (N3) on the dynamics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The ligand binding to the dimeric forms causes some key local changes at the dimer interface and it causes an allosteric interaction between the active sites of two protomers. Our results support the idea that only one protomer is active on SARS-CoV-2 due to this allosteric interaction. Additionally, we analyzed the molecular dynamics trajectories from graph theoretical perspective and found that the most influential residues - as measured by eigenvector centrality - are a group of residues in active site and dimeric interface of the protease. This study may form a bridge between what we know about the dynamics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We think that enlightening allosteric communication of the active sites and the role of dimerization in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro can contribute to development of novel drugs against this global health problem as well as other similar proteases.

Little is known about the associations between loneliness and symptom burden in oncology patients before and during the pandemic. Study purposes include determining the prevalence of loneliness in a sample of oncology patients; evaluating for differences in demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics between lonely and nonlonely patients; and determining which demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics were associated with membership in the lonely group. METHODS: A convenience sample (n = 606) completed online surveys that evaluated the severity of loneliness, social isolation, and common symptoms (ie, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and pain) in oncology patients. Parametric and nonparametric tests were used to evaluate for differences in scores between the lonely and nonlonely groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for membership in the loneliness group. RESULTS: Of the 606 patients, 53.0% were categorized in the lonely group. The lonely group reported higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher symptom severity scores for all of the symptoms evaluated. In the multivariate model, being unmarried, having higher levels of social isolation, as well as higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were associated with membership in the lonely group. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that a significant number of oncology patients are experiencing loneliness, most likely as a result of mandate social distancing and isolation procedures. The symptom burden of these patients is extremely high and warrants clinical evaluation and interventions.","Miaskowski, Christine; Paul, Steven M; Snowberg, Karin; Abbott, Maura; Borno, Hala T; Chang, Susan M; Chen, Lee May; Cohen, Bevin; Cooper, Bruce A; Hammer, Marilyn J; Kenfield, Stacey A; Kober, Kord M; Laffan, Angela; Levine, Jon D; Pozzar, Rachel; Rhoads, Kim; Tsai, Katy K; Van Blarigan, Erin L; Van Loon, Katherine",Cancer,717,1

The optimum condition to remove off-flavor of the bean and maximize functionality and efficiency was light roasting and cryogenic grinding (<53 µm). In this condition, extraction yield was 16.75%, total phenolic content (TPC) was 69.82 ± 0.35 mg gallic acid equivalents/g, and total flavonoid content (TFC) was 168.81 ± 1.64 mg quercetin equivalents/100 g. The antioxidant properties were 77.58 ± 0.27% for DPPH radical scavenging activity and 58.02 ± 0.76 mg Trolox equivalents/g for ABTS radical scavenging activity. The values of TFC and ABTS radical scavenging activity were significantly higher (p<0.05) than in other conditions, and TPC and DPPH radical scavenging activity were second highest in lightly roasted beans following raw beans. HS-SPME/GC-MS analysis confirmed that the amino acids and carbohydrates that are the main components of sword bean were condensed into other volatile flavor compounds such as derivatives of furan, pyrazine, and pyrrole during roasting. Roasted and cryogenic-ground sword beans showed higher functionality in terms of TFC, DPPH, and ABTS radical scavenging activities compared to those of coffee. Overall results showed that light roasting and cryogenic grinding are the most suitable processing conditions for enhancing the bioactivity of sword beans.","Jung, Ju-Yeong; Rhee, Jin-Kyu",,717,23

Specifically, we analyze how the presence of their children influences parents' work at home and examine how the effect differs by the parent's gender. After controlling for various factors, we find that in cases where parents are full-time employees and the children are: (1) in primary school, mothers are more likely to work remotely, while fathers are less likely to do so and (2) in junior high school, the parents' work styles are hardly affected. This shows that mothers shoulder the burden of working remotely and caring for small children at home, while fathers tend to work in the office and spend less time with their childcare at home.

In the absence of specific antiviral medication, symptomatic treatment and physical isolation remain the options to control the contagion. The recent clinical trials on antiviral drugs highlighted some promising compounds such as umifenovir (haemagglutinin-mediated fusion inhibitor), remdesivir (RdRp nucleoside inhibitor), and favipiravir (RdRp Inhibitor). WHO launched a multinational clinical trial on several promising analogs as a potential treatment to combat SARS infection. This situation urges a holistic approach to invent safe and specific drugs as a prophylactic and therapeutic cure for SARS-related-viral diseases, including COVID-19. It is significant to note that researchers worldwide have been doing their best to handle the crisis and have produced an extensive and promising literature body. It opens a scope and allows understanding the viral entry at the molecular level. A structure-based approach can reveal the molecular-level understanding of viral entry interaction. The ligand profiling and non-covalent interactions among participating amino-acid residues are critical information to delineate a structural interpretation. The structural investigation of SARS virus entry into host cells will reveal the possible strategy for designing drugs like entry inhibitors. The structure-based approach demonstrates details at the 3D molecular level. It shows specificity about SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction, which uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for entry, and the human protease completes the process of viral fusion and infection. The 3D structural studies reveal the existence of two units, namely S1 and S2. S1 is called a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and responsible for interacting with the host (ACE2), and the S2 unit participates in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. TMPRSS2 mediates the cleavage at S1/S2 subunit interface in S-protein of SARS CoV-2, leading to viral fusion. Conformational difference associated with S1 binding alters ACE2 interaction and inhibits viral fusion. Overall, the detailed 3D structural studies help understand the 3D structural basis of interaction between viruses with host factors and available scope for the new drug discovery process targeting SARS-related virus entry into the host cell.","Kushwaha, Prem Kumar; Kumari, Neha; Nayak, Sneha; Kishor, Keshav; Sharon, Ashoke",Curr. med. chem,717,16

Outcomes included symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence (primary) and prevalence of proper mask-wearing, physical distancing, and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (secondary). Mask-wearing and physical distancing were assessed through direct observation at least weekly at mosques, markets, the main entrance roads to villages, and tea stalls. At 5 and 9 weeks follow-up, we surveyed all reachable participants about COVID-related symptoms. Blood samples collected at 10-12 weeks of follow-up for symptomatic individuals were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Results: There were 178,288 individuals in the intervention group and 163,838 individuals in the control group. The intervention increased proper mask-wearing from 13.3% in control villages (N=806,547 observations) to 42.3% in treatment villages (N=797,715 observations) (adjusted percentage point difference = 0.29 [0.27, 0.31]). This tripling of mask usage was sustained during the intervention period and two weeks after. Physical distancing increased from 24.1% in control villages to 29.2% in treatment villages (adjusted percentage point difference = 0.05 [0.04, 0.06]). After 5 months, the impact of the intervention faded, but mask-wearing remained 10 percentage points higher in the intervention group. The proportion of individuals with COVID-like symptoms was 7.62% (N=13,273) in the intervention arm and 8.62% (N=13,893) in the control arm. Blood samples were collected from N=10,952 consenting, symptomatic individuals. Adjusting for baseline covariates, the intervention reduced symptomatic seroprevalence by 9.3% (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.91 [0.82, 1.00];control prevalence 0.76%;treatment prevalence 0.68%). In villages randomized to surgical masks (n = 200), the relative reduction was 11.2% overall (aPR = 0.89 [0.78, 1.00]) and 34.7% among individuals 60+ (aPR = 0.65 [0.46, 0.85]). No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Our intervention demonstrates a scalable and effective method to promote mask adoption and reduce symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Abaluck, Jason Kwong Laura H.; Styczynski, Ashley Haque Ashraful Kabir Alamgir Bates-Jefferys Ellen Crawford Emily Benjamin-Chung Jade Benhachmi Salim Raihan Shabib Rahman Shadman Zaman Neeti Luby Stephen Mobarak Mushfiq Ashraful Haque Mohammad Kabir Alamgir Bates-Jefferys Ellen Raihan Shabib Rahman Shadman Zaman Neeti",,717,24

Subjective experiences were reported for each trainee using questionnaires. Methods: During the first four weeks of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, the objective impact of the pandemic on each trainee's surgical caseload exposure was assessed using data from individual trainee logbook profiles in the deanery of the Republic of Ireland. Independent predictor variables included the trainee grade (ST 3 to 8), the individual trainee, the unit that the logbook was reported from, and the year in which the logbook was recorded. We used the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test to assess for any statistically significant predictor variables. The subjective experience of each trainee was captured using an electronic questionnaire. Results: The mean number of total procedures per trainee over four weeks was 36.8 (7 to 99; standard deviation (SD) 19.67) in 2018, 40.6 (6 to 81; SD 17.90) in 2019, and 18.3 (3 to 65; SD 11.70) during the pandemic of 2020 (p = 0.043). Significant reductions were noted for all elective indicative procedures, including arthroplasty (p = 0.019), osteotomy (p = 0.045), nerve decompression (p = 0.024) and arthroscopy (p = 0.024). In contrast, none of the nine indicative procedures for trauma were reduced. There was a significant inter-unit difference in the mean number of total cases (p = 0.029) and indicative cases (p = 0.0005) per trainee. We noted that 7.69% (n = 3) of trainees contracted COVID-19. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mean number of operative cases per trainee has been significantly reduced for four of the 13 indicative procedures, as outlined by the JCST. Reassignment of trainees to high-volume institutions in the future may be a plausible approach to mitigate significant training deficits in those trainees worst impacted by the reduction in operative exposure.","Sheridan, Gerard A; Hughes, Andrew J; Quinlan, John F; Sheehan, Eoin; O039,; Byrne, John M",Bone Jt Open,717,15

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not an exception to this paradigm. Although the relatively recent emergence does not allow to draw definitive conclusions on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostics, some standpoints can be conveyed. First and foremost, it seems now clear that we will be living together with this virus for quite a long time, so that our vigilance and responsiveness against the emergence of new local outbreaks shall be maintained at the highest possible levels. The etiological diagnosis of COVID-19 is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, deeply based on direct identification of viral RNA by means of molecular biology techniques in biological materials, especially upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. Whether other materials, such as blood, urine, stools, saliva and throat washing, will become valid alternatives has not been unequivocally defined so far. As concerns serological testing, promising information can be garnered from preliminary investigations, showing that the vast majority of COVID-19 patients seem to develop a sustained immune response against the virus, characterized especially by emergence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA, 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of fever and/or respiratory symptoms. Whether these antibodies will have persistent neutralizing activity against the virus is still to be elucidated on individual and general basis. The availability of rapid tests for detecting either viral antigens or anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a potentially viable opportunity for purposes of epidemiologic surveillance, though more information is needed on accuracy and reliability of these portable immunoassays.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Mattiuzzi, Camilla; Bovo, Chiara; Plebani, Mario",Acta Biomed,717,24

METHODS: We performed a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CochraneLibrary, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and medRxiv pre-print databases using available MeSH terms for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine. Data from all studies that focused on the effectiveness of HCQ with or without the addition of azithromycin (AZM) in confirmed COVID-19 patients, which were published up to 12 September 2020, were collated for analysis using CMA v.2.2.064. RESULTS: Our systematic review retrieved 41 studies. Among these, 37 studies including 45,913 participants fulfilled the criteria for subsequent meta-analysis. The data showed no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the HCQ and control groups (RR: 1.02, 95% CI, 0.81-1.27). Combination of HCQ with AZM also did not lead to improved treatment outcomes (RR: 1.26, 95% CI, 0.91-1.74). Furthermore, the mortality difference was not significant, neither in HCQ treatment group (RR: 0.86, 95% CI, 0.71-1.03) nor in HCQ plus AZM treatment group (RR: 1.28, 95% CI, 0.76-2.14) in comparison to controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that age was the factor that significantly affected mortality (P<0.00001). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis found that there was no clinical benefit of using either HCQ by itself or in combination with AZM for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Hence, it may be prudent for clinicians and researchers to focus on other therapeutic options that may show greater promise in this disease.","Shamshirian, Amir; Hessami, Amirhossein; Heydari, Keyvan; Navaei, Reza Alizadeh; Ebrahimzadeh, Mohammad Ali; Yip, George W; Ghasemian, Roya; Sedaghat, Meghdad; Baradaran, Hananeh; Yazdi, Soheil Mohammadi; Aboufazeli, Elham; Jafarpour, Hamed; Dadgostar, Ehsan; Tirandazi, Behnaz; Sadeghnezhad, Reza; Karimifar, Keyvan; Eftekhari, Aida; Shamshirian, Danial",Ann Acad Med Singap,717,12

METHODS: This is a prospective, single-centre, three-arm randomised trial. A total of 99 eyes of 99 patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the 360° incision group (n=34), the upper-180° incision group (n=34) and the lower-180° incision group (n=31). Intraocular pressure (IOP), number of medications and complications were evaluated until 12 months after surgery. Surgical success (with or without medication) was defined as IOP &#8804;21 mmHg and &#8805;20% IOP reduction (criterion A) or IOP &#8804;15 mmHg and &#8805;20% IOP reduction (criterion B). RESULTS: The mean IOP (±SD) in all eyes was reduced from 18.6 (5.9) mmHg with 3.1 (1.1) medications to 13.7 (3.4) mmHg (20.8% reduction; p<0.001) with 1.4 (1.3) medications (p<0.001) at postoperative 12-month. Each group produced comparable mean reductions in both IOP and the number of medications throughout 12 months of follow-up. Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival analyses showed no significance among these three groups for criterion A and criterion B. Postoperative hyphema with niveau formation occurred significantly more in the 360° group than in the lower-180° group (p=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: The different extents and locations of Schlemm's canal incisions during suture trabeculotomy ab interno for OAG, including the 360° incision, the upper-180° incision and the lower-180° incision, do not affect both the IOP reduction and the medications throughout 12 months of follow-up.

To validate the potential application of THEIA as clinical decision making assistant in a national screening program. Methods: 902 patients were recruited from either an urban large eye hospital, or a semi-rural optometrist led screening provider, as they were attending their appointment as part of New Zealand Diabetic Screening programme. These clinics used a variety of retinal cameras and a range of operators. The de-identified images were then graded independently by three senior retinal specialists, and final results were aggregated using New Zealand grading scheme, which is then converted to referable\non-referable and Healthy\mild\more than mild\vision threatening categories. Results: compared to ground truth, THEIA achieved 100% sensitivity and [95.35%-97.44%] specificity, and negative predictive value of 100%. THEIA also did not miss any patients with more than mild or vision threatening disease. The level of agreement between the clinicians and the aggregated results was (k value: 0.9881, 0.9557, and 0.9175), and the level of agreement between THEIA and the aggregated labels was (k value: 0.9515). Conclusion: Our multi-centre prospective trial showed that THEIA does not miss referable disease when screening for diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy. It also has a very high level of granularity in reporting the disease level. Since THEIA is being tested on a variety of cameras, operating in a range of clinics (rural\urban, ophthalmologist-led\optometrist-led), we believe that it will be a suitable addition to a public diabetic screening program.","Vaghefi, Ehsan; Yang, Song; Xie, Li; Han, David; Squirrell, David",,717,26

Vegetation and green spaces have shown reductive effects on air-borne pollutants concentrations, especially of particulate matter (PM). Guidance on green space utilisation for air quality control remains scarce, however, as does its application in practise. To strengthen the foundation for research and interventions, we undertook a critical review of the state of science from a public health perspective. We used inter-disciplinary search strategies for published reviews on green spaces and air pollution in key scientific databases. Using the PRISMA checklist, we systematically identified reviews with quantitative analyses. For each of the presented PM mitigation mechanisms, we conducted additional searches focused on the most recent articles published between 2016 and early 2021. The included reviews differentiate three mitigation mechanisms of green spaces for PM: deposition, dispersion and modification. The most studied mechanism is deposition, particularly measures of mass and settling velocity of PM on plant leaves. We consolidate how green space setups differ by scale and context in their potentials to reduce peak exposures, stationary (point) or mobile (line) pollution sources, and the potentially most harmful PM components. The assessed findings suggest diverse optimisation options for green space interventions, particularly concerning plant selection, spatial setup, ventilation and maintenance - all alongside the consideration of supplementary vegetation effects like on temperature or water. Green spaces' reductive effects on air-borne PM concentrations are considerable, multi-mechanistic and varied by scale, context and vegetation characteristics. Such effect-modifying factors must be considered when rethinking public space design, as accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Weak linkages amid involved disciplines motivate the development of a research framework to strengthen health-oriented guidance. We conclude on an urgent need for an integrated and risk-based approach to PM mitigation through green space interventions.","Diener, Arnt; Mudu, Pierpaolo",Sci Total Environ,717,6

METHODS AND RESULTS: We aimed to design and investigate the utility of an anatomically accurate three-dimensional (3D) printed model of the nose in the training for nasopharyngeal swabs. These models were implemented during training sessions for healthcare workers. All participants surveyed felt that the 3D printed models were useful and beneficial in the training of nasopharyngeal swab techniques. CONCLUSIONS: 3D printed nose models are a useful tool in nasopharyngeal swab training. Their usage may help to facilitate the training of potential swabbing manpower in the upscaling of testing capabilities and volumes in this COVID-19 era.","Chee, Jeremy; Lin, Xinyi; Lim, Wei Sian; Loh, Woei Shyang; Thong, Mark; Ng, Lishia",Oral Oncol,717,5

While, for the former reliable data are available (in the form of number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision-makers to plan ahead (e.g., medical structures and equipment). Previous work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e., the proportion of the number of persons tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospitals and intensive care units. In this paper, we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIMA). The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e., the stochastic processes theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead of those quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision-makers to forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.","Fenga, Livio; Gaspari, Mauro",Sensors (Basel),717,33

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.","Thompson, Hayley A; Mousa, Andria; Dighe, Amy; Fu, Han; Arnedo-Pena, Alberto; Barrett, Peter; Bellido-Blasco, Juan; Bi, Qifang; Caputi, Antonio; Chaw, Liling; De Maria, Luigi; Hoffmann, Matthias; Mahapure, Kiran; Ng, Kangqi; Raghuram, Jagadesan; Singh, Gurpreet; Soman, Biju; Soriano, Vicente; Valent, Francesca; Vimercati, Luigi; Wee, Liang En; Wong, Justin; Ghani, Azra C; Ferguson, Neil M",Clin. infect. dis,717,16

The purpose of this research was to assess the risk of COVID-19 epidemic dissemination in Japan by estimating the current state of epidemic dissemination and providing some epidemic prevention and control recommendations. Firstly, the period from 6 January to 31 March 2020 was divided into four stages and the relevant parameters were estimated according to the imported cases in Japan. The basic reproduction number of the current stage is 1.954 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025), which means COVID-19 will spread quickly, and the self-healing rate of Japanese is about 0.495 (95% CI 0.437-0.506), with small variations in the four stages. Secondly, the results were applied to the actual reported cases from 1 to 5 April 2020, verifying the reliability of the estimated data using the accumulated reported cases located within the 95% confidence interval and the relative error of forecast data of five days being less than 2.5% 2.5%. Thirdly, considering the medical resources in Japan, the times the epidemic beds and ventilators become fully occupied are predicted as 5 and 15 May 2020, respectively. Keeping with the current situation, the final death toll in Japan may reach into the millions. Finally, based on experience with COVID-19 prevention and control in China, robust measures such as nationwide shutdown, store closures, citizens isolating themselves at home, and increasing PCR testing would quickly and effectively prevent COVID-19 spread.","Chen, ZhongXiang Yang Jun Dai BinXiang",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,717,16

Previously, device checks were performed infrequently in large volume, face-to-face rural clinics by visiting cardiologists and technicians. Access to remote areas and social distancing restrictions have made these clinics unfeasible to operate. The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) COVID-19 consensus statements have suggested the utilisation of remote monitoring to minimise the potential spread of COVID-19 infections between clinicians and high-risk patients. A novel solution to this challenge was the implementation of a remote device interrogation (RI) service located in two kiosks at two rural pharmacies. This service was termed Remote Device Interrogation Kiosks (ReDInK). AIM: This cross-sectional observational study aimed to describe the set-up process, safety and efficacy of RI and customer satisfaction of the ReDInK program. METHODS: Two-hundred-and-ninety-two (292) rurally located patients with implantable cardiac devices were identified via the cardiology department database. Of these, 101 (44%) were enrolled into the ReDInK program across two rurally located pharmacies between April and July 2020. RI was performed and download outcomes were reviewed. A customer satisfaction survey assessed attitudes towards the program and explored options of ongoing service application. RESULTS: Of 101 patients enrolled into ReDInK, 96 (95%) resulted in satisfactory device checks. Four (4) individuals failed-to-attend and one individual experienced technical download issues. Of the 96 satisfactory device checks, three required in-person follow-up for reasons including battery replacement, lead repositioning and in-person programming. No adverse events were reported. A satisfaction telephone survey was conducted with 81 (83%) participants enrolled in ReDInK. Seventy-one (71) individuals (88%) of those surveyed expressed satisfaction and 73 (90%) labelled the process as efficiently conducted. Sixty-nine (69) (85%) participants felt reassured that this service was established during the pandemic. However 47 (58%) participants reported they would still feel comfortable to undergo in-person reviews despite social distancing recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: With the COVID-19 pandemic posing restrictions to social distancing and reducing unnecessary in-person interaction, the ReDInK program emerges as an efficacious and safe solution for patients in rural Victoria. The program's widely positive reception and successful conduction in rural Victoria invites further opportunity for a wider application of similar programs, expanding its role to metropolitan areas.","Wong, Joshua; Longhitano, Anthony; Yao, Jessica; Jayadeva, Pavithra; Arendshorst, Kim; Grigg, Leeanne; Wynn, Gareth; Stevenson, Irene",Heart lung circ,717,16

Nevertheless, some patients lack confidence in or access to AS. Focal therapy (FT) is a possible alternative to radical treatment for such patients. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated dominant tumor (DT) progression across serial biopsies to determine whether men on AS could be reasonable candidates for FT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Men enrolled in AS at University of California, San Francisco between 1996 and 2017 with low/intermediate risk were included. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Changes in biopsy grade, volume, and focality of the DT over time were assessed. Focality (good or poor for FT) was defined by the number of cores, laterality, and contiguity of prostate sites containing tumor (based on pathology reports). Candidates (either for targeted/quadrant ablation or for hemigland ablation) were defined based on good focality, grade group (GG) &#8804;2, and low-volume disease. Patients were classified as favorable (GG &#8804; 2 with good focality and concordant multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging [mpMRI]) or unfavorable (poor focality or high-volume disease or discordant mpMRI) for FT at surveillance biopsies. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 1057 men met the inclusion criteria. The median number of biopsies per patient was three (interquartile range 2-4), and 196 patients (18.5%) underwent five or more biopsies. At confirmatory biopsy, 43% remained candidates for FT (67% for targeted/quadrant ablation and 33% for hemigland ablation) and 20% had a negative biopsy. Of the candidates for FT at initial biopsy, 11% had less favorable characteristics at confirmatory biopsy. Among candidates for FT based on both initial and confirmatory biopsies, 70% remained favorable for hemigland ablation at subsequent biopsies. Limitations include retrospective design and mpMRI information only at surveillance biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Serial biopsy findings in men with early-stage cancer on AS show that tumor location remains relatively stable and significant changes in grade and/or volume occur largely in the DT. Combined diagnostic and confirmatory biopsy findings help better select patients for FT than the use of the diagnostic biopsy alone. PATIENT SUMMARY: In a large cohort of patients on active surveillance for prostate cancer, we evaluated changes across serial biopsies to identify potential candidates for focal therapy (FT). Our findings showed that the dominant tumor remained stable over time and the majority of men were favorable candidates for FT.","Fasulo, Vittorio; Cowan, Janet E; Maggi, Martina; Washington, Samuel L; Nguyen, Hao G; Shinohara, Katsuto; Lazzeri, Massimo; Casale, Paolo; Carroll, Peter R",,717,24

Secondary outcomes include dyspnoea, cognitive function, health utility, physical activity participation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, work status, health and social care resource use, death - measured at three, six and 12 months post-randomisation. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomised to best practice usual care or the REGAIN programme on a 1:1.03 basis using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, performed by minimisation and stratified by age, level of hospital care, and case level mental health symptomatology. Once consent and baseline questionnaires have been completed by the participant online at home, randomisation will be performed automatically by a bespoke web-based system. BLINDING (MASKING): To ensure allocation concealment from both participant and REGAIN practitioner at baseline, randomisation will be performed only after the baseline questionnaires have been completed online at home by the participant. After randomisation has been performed, participants and REGAIN practitioners cannot be blind to group allocation. Follow-up outcome assessments will be completed by participants online at home. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 535 participants will be randomised: 263 to the best-practice usual care arm, and 272 participants to the REGAIN programme arm.

Texture-based analysis in scope of other pulmonary diseases has been used to screen, monitor, and provide valuable information for several kinds of diagnoses. To differentiate COVID-19 patients from healthy subjects and patients with other pulmonary diseases is crucial. Our goal is to quantify lung modifications in two pulmonary pathologies: COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). For this purpose, we propose the use of a three-dimensional multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE3D) algorithm. The three groups tested (COVID-19 patients, IPF, and healthy subjects) were found to be statistically different for 9 scale factors ( p < 0.01 ). A complexity index (CI) based on the sum of entropy values is used to classify healthy subjects and COVID-19 patients showing an accuracy of 89.6 % , a sensitivity of 96.1 % , and a specificity of 76.9 % . Moreover, 4 different machine-learning models were also used to classify the same COVID-19 dataset for comparison purposes.","Gaudêncio, Andreia S; Vaz, Pedro G; Hilal, Mirvana; Mahé, Guillaume; Lederlin, Mathieu; Humeau-Heurtier, Anne; Cardoso, João M",Biomed Signal Process Control,717,13

In response to this challenge, in 2007, the African Centre for Integrated Laboratory Training (ACILT) was established in South Africa with a mission to train staffs from countries with high burdens of diseases in skills needed to strengthen sustainable laboratory systems. This study was undertaken to assess the transference of newly gained knowledge and skills to other laboratory staff, and to identify enabling and obstructive factors to their implementation. METHODS: We used Kirkpatrick model to determine training effectiveness by assessing the transference of newly gained knowledge and skills to participant's work environment, along with measuring enabling and obstructive factors. In addition to regular course evaluations at ACILT (pre and post training), in 2015 we sent e-questionnaires to 867 participants in 43 countries for course participation between 2008 and 2014. Diagnostics courses included Viral Load, and systems strengthening included strategic planning and Biosafety and Biosecurity. SAS v9.44 and Excel were used to analyze retrospective de-identified data collected at six months pre and post-training. RESULTS: Of the 867 participants, 203 (23.4%) responded and reported average improvements in accuracy and timeliness in Viral Load programs and to systems strengthening. For Viral Load testing, frequency of corrective action for unsatisfactory proficiency scores improved from 57 to 91%, testing error rates reduced from 12.9% to 4.9%; 88% responders contributed to the first national strategic plan development and 91% developed strategies to mitigate biosafety risks in their institutions. Key enabling factors were team and management support, and key obstructive factors included insufficient resources and staff's resistance to change. CONCLUSIONS: Training at ACILT had a documented positive impact on strengthening the laboratory capacity and laboratory workforce and substantial cost savings. ACILT's investment produced a multiplier effect whereby national laboratory systems, personnel and leadership reaped training benefits. This laboratory training centre with a global clientele contributed to improve existing laboratory services, systems and networks for the HIV epidemic and is now being leveraged for COVID-19 testing that has infected 41,332,899 people globally.","Shrivastava, Ritu; Poxon, Richard; Rottinghaus, Erin; Essop, Leyya; Sanon, Victoria; Chipeta, Zawadi; van-Schalkwyk, Elsie; Sekwadi, Phuti; Murangandi, Pelagia; Nguyen, Shon; Devos, Josh; Nesby-Odell, Shanna; Stevens, Thomas; Umaru, Farouk; Cox, Alex; Kim, Andrea; Yang, Chunfu; Parsons, Linda M; Malope-Kgokong, Babatyi; Nkengasong, John N",BMC Health Serv Res,717,8

In the present paper, the investigation is focused on the control of mechatronic systems, in particular actuated rotational joints, but the findings can be easily extended to actuated translational joints.AbstractFractional Calculus is usually applied to control systems by means of the well-known PIλDμ scheme, which adopts integral and derivative components of non-integer orders λ and µ. An alternative approach is to add equally distributed fractional-order terms to the PID scheme instead of replacing the integer-order terms (Distributed Order PID, DOPID). This work analyzes the properties of the DOPID scheme with five terms, that is the PII1/2DD1/2 (the half-integral and the half-derivative components are added to the classical PID). The frequency domain responses of the PID, PIλDμ and PII1/2DD1/2 controllers are compared, then stability features of the PII1/2DD1/2 controller are discussed. A Bode plot-based tuning method for the PII1/2DD1/2 controller is proposed and then applied to the position control of a mechatronic axis. The closed-loop behaviours of PID and PII1/2DD1/2 are compared by simulation and by experimental tests. The results show that the PII1/2DD1/2 scheme with the proposed tuning criterium allows remarkable reduction in the position error with respect to the PID, with a similar control effort and maximum torque. For the considered mechatronic axis and trapezoidal speed law, the reduction in maximum tracking error is −71% and the reduction in mean tracking error is −77%, in correspondence to a limited increase in maximum torque (+5%) and in control effort (+4%).","Baggetta, Mario Fanghella Pietro",Applied Sciences,717,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of COVID-19 on the IBD Unit's activity and provide information on restructuring with available resources. METHODS: an observational study was performed in a referral hospital in Madrid (Spain). Type of appointment, loss of follow-up, hospital admission, treatment changes, endoscopic activity, surgeries and blood tests were evaluated between March 15th and May 15th, 2020. This data was compared with the usual activity a year before. RESULTS: among the 510 patients included, 476 (93.33 %) received had a remote consultation, representing an increase of 92.38 % compared with the previous year (0.95 %). There was a loss of follow-up in 26 patients (5.1 %) vs 15 (3.58 %) the previous year. A total of 60 (35.09 %) blood tests, 64 (76.19 %) endoscopies and all scheduled surgeries were suspended. Besides, 484 (94.9 %) patients remained adherent vs 417/419 (99.5 %) in the pre-pandemic period and 48 (9.41 %) reported symptoms of an IBD flare. Thirty-nine (7.6 %) patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: a large number of tests and on-site outpatient visit consultations were suspended. However, a rapid adaptation to telemedicine allowed these patients to be closely followed up. Although it was possible to maintain therapeutic compliance, with a loss to follow-up slightly higher than the previous year, suspensions and delays of tests could have significant negative consequences in the long term.","El Hajra, Ismael; Calvo, Marta; Santos Pérez, Elena; Blanco Rey, Santiago; González Partida, Irene; Matallana, Virginia; González-Lama, Yago; Vera, María Isabel",Rev Esp Enferm Dig,717,20

We calculated the expected rates of 21 potential AESI following COVID-19 vaccination among vaccinated persons within 1 day, 7 days, and 42 days of vaccination. MethodsWe used meta-analytic methods to estimate background rates of 21 medical conditions considered potential AESI and calculated expected rates of each potential AESI within 1 day, 7 days, and 42 days of vaccination. ResultsBackground rates of three commonly monitored AESI, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), myopericarditis, and all-cause deaths were 2.0 GBS cases/100,000 person-years, 1.3 myopericarditis cases/100,000 person-years, and 863.8 all-cause deaths/100,000 person-years, respectively. Based on these background rates, if 10,000,000 persons are vaccinated, we would expect 0.5, 3.7, and 22.5 GBS cases; 0.3, 2.4, and 14.3 myopericarditis cases; and 236.5, 1655.5, and 9932.8 all-cause deaths to occur in coincident temporal association (i.e., as a result of background incidence) within 1 day, 7 days, and 42 days of vaccination, respectively. ConclusionKnowledge of expected rates of potential AESI can help contextualize adverse health events associated temporally with immunization, aid in safety signal detection, guide COVID-19 vaccine public health communication, and inform benefit-risk assessments of COVID-19 vaccines.","Abara, Winston E.; Gee, Julianne; Mu, Yi; Delorey, Mark J; Ye, Tun; Shay, David K; Shimabukuro, Tom",,717,24

As a protective factor, sense of coherence (SOC) may play a role to reduce some psychological discomfort. This study aimed to analyze the relationships of SOC with anxiety, digital health literacy (DHL), information, and financial satisfaction among older adults during the outbreak. Methods: This is part of a large-scale DHL study with a cross-sectional survey across 41 countries. This study extracted data from three Asian countries (China, the Philippines, and Singapore) and included people aged &#8805;60. Structural equation modeling with path analysis was utilized to examine the relationships of SOC with anxiety about the future and other variables. Results: A total of 266 older adults were included, with 43.2% expressed anxiety about the future. DHL (ß=-0.13, p < 0.05) and SOC (ß=-0.26, p = 0.01) were negatively associated with anxiety, while financial and information satisfaction were not. However, financial satisfaction (ß = 0.34, p < 0.01) and DHL (ß = 0.32, p = 0.01) were positively associated with SOC. Higher SOC further mediated the negative relationships of DHL (ß= -0.11, p = 0.004) and financial satisfaction (ß= -0.12, p = 0.004) on anxiety of older adults. Conclusions: SOC had direct negative effect on anxiety and mediated the relationships between anxiety and DHL/financial satisfaction. Strategies should be developed to enhance SOC and DHL among older adults, as these capacities may help to manage anxiety during the pandemic.","Leung, Angela Yee Man; Parial, Laurence Lloyd; Tolabing, Ma Carmen; Sim, Timothy; Mo, Phoenix; Okan, Orkan; Dadaczynski, Kevin",Aging Ment Health,717,16

We assessed associations between various social network aspects and practicing behavior to prevent respiratory infectious diseases. METHODS: We analyzed baseline-data (2019) from the SaNAE-cohort on social networks and health, collected by an online questionnaire in Dutch community-dwelling people aged 40-99 years. Outcome was the number of preventive behaviors in past two months [range 0-4]. Associations between network aspects were tested using ordinal regression analyses, adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Of 5,128 participants (mean age 63; 54% male), 94% regularly washed hands with water and soap, 55% used only paper (not cloth) handkerchiefs/tissues; 19% touched their face as little as possible; 39% kept distance from people with respiratory infectious disease symptoms; median score of behaviors was 2. Mean network size was 11 (46% family; 27% friends); six network members were contacted exclusively in-person and two exclusively via phone/internet. Participants received informational, emotional, and practical support from four, six, and two network members, respectively. Independently associated with more preventive behaviors were: 'strong relationships', i.e., large share of friends and aspects related to so called 'weak relationships', a larger share of distant living network members, higher number of members with whom there was exclusively phone/internet contact, and more network members providing informational support. Club membership and a larger share of same-aged network members were inversely associated. CONCLUSION: Friends ('strong' relationships) may play an important role in the adoption of infection-preventive behaviors. So may 'weak relationships', e.g. geographically more distant network members, who may provide informational support as via non-physical modes of contact. Further steps are to explore employment of these types of relationships when designing infectious diseases control programs aiming to promote infection-preventive behavior in middle aged-and older individuals.","Steijvers, Lisanne C J; Brinkhues, Stephanie; Hoebe, Christian J P A; van Tilburg, Theo G; Claessen, Vivian; Bouwmeester-Vincken, Noortje; Hamers, Femke; Vranken, Petra; Dukers-Muijrers, Nicole H T M",PLoS One,717,30

New vaccines are a potential way forward to reduce transmission rates and subsequent infection. In Brazil, vaccines are being distributed via the public sector though in the future, they will be available in the private market. Information about consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical vaccine against SARS CoV-2 can help future price setting discussions. METHODS: : A cross-sectional study was conducted with consumers in the five regions of Brazil regarding the WTP for a hypothetical vaccine against SARS CoV-2 with a 50% efficacy. RESULTS: : A total of 1402 individuals over 18 years of age who declared not having COVID-19 at the time of the survey were interviewed. The acceptability for this hypothetical vaccine was 80.7%. In addition, the amount of WTP by Brazilian consumers for a hypothetical SARS CoV-2 vaccine was estimated at US$ 22.18(120.00 BRL). CONCLUSION: : This study can contribute to decision-making to inform potential pricing for a hypothetical SARS CoV-2 vaccine.","Godói, Isabella Piassi Dias; Sarmento, Túlio Tadeu Rocha; Reis, Edna Afonso; Gargano, Ludmila Peres; Godman, Brian; Acurcio, Francisco de Assis; Alvares-Teodoro, Juliana; Guerra Júnior, Augusto Afonso; Ruas, Cristina Mariano",Expert rev. pharmacoecon. outcomes res,717,1

It has been hypothesized that online (distance) students possess stronger intrinsic motivation than traditional (in-classroom) students. The random sample consisted of 386 students. Participants comprised 189 male and 197 female students; 194 of them were traditional students, and 192 of them were online students. The cross-sectional research design was used in this study. A 21 item Academic Motivation Scale (SAMS-21) was used to measure three types of extrinsic motivation (intrinsic motivation to know, to accomplish things, and to experience stimulation), three types of extrinsic motivation (external, introjected, and identified regulation) and amotivation in university students. The findings indicated that students' intrinsic motivation scores were higher in online students than in students who attend traditional face-to-face classes. The results did not reveal significant differences between male and female students in terms of academic motivation. This study made a novel contribution to the literature, because the present study has compared academic motivation between university students of traditional and online education in a new context. i.e. before COVID-19 pandemic and during it.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to determine the transmission, severity, complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pregnancy. This review showed the influence of COVID-19 disease on the neonatal neurogenesis. Owing to no specific vaccines or medicines that were reported for the treatment of COVID-19 disease, this review suggested some control strategies like treatments (medicinal plants, antiviral therapy, cellular therapy, and immunotherapy), nutrition uptake, prevention, and recommendations. DISCUSSION: This overview showed in severely states that SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early stage of pregnancy might increase the risk of stress, panic, and anxiety. This disorder can disturb the maternal immune system, and thus causing a neurodevelopmental disturbance. This hypothesis may be depending on the severity and intensity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. However, vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from dams to their fetuses is absent until now. CONCLUSION: During this global pandemic disease, maintaining safety during pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and breastfeeding may play a vital role in a healthy life for the offspring. Thus, international and national corporations should be continuing for perinatal management, particularly during the next pandemic or disaster time.","Rg, Ahmed",,717,16

Thus, any attempt at a quantitative time-geographic analysis must consider the actual velocity with respect to space. In a trip, individuals tend to pass through structurally varying spaces, such as linear traffic networks and planar walking surfaces, which are not suitable for use in a single GIS spatial data model (i.e., network, raster) that is only applicable to a single spatial structure (i.e., point, line, polygon). In this study, a velocity model is developed for a traffic network and walking surface-constrained travel environment through the divide-and-conquer principle. The construction of this model can be divided into three basic steps: the spatial layering of the dual-constrained travel environment; independent modelling of each layer using different spatial data models; and generation of layer-based time-geographic framework by merging models of each layer. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model for studying the space-time accessibility of a moving object over a study area with varying spatial structures. Finally, an example is given to analyse the effectiveness of the proposed model.","Yin, Zhangcai; Jin, Zhanghaonan; Ying, Shen; Li, Sanjuan; Liu, Qingquan",J Geogr Syst,717,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA over a period of 27 days. The presence, extent, and severity of PTD were documented. Two observers scored the pattern and extent of lung parenchymal disease including potential fibrotic features, as well as lymph node enlargement and pleural effusions. Consensus was achieved via a third observer. Interobserver agreement was assessed using kappa statistics. Student's t-test, chi-squared, and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to compare imaging features between PTD and non-PTD sub-groups. RESULTS: During the study period, 100 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent CTPA imaging. Ninety-three studies were analysed, excluding indeterminate CTPA examinations. Overall incidence of PTD was 41/93 (44%) with 28/93 patients showing small vessel PTD (30%). D-dimer was elevated in 90/93 (96.8%) cases. A high Wells' score did not differentiate between PTD and non-PTD groups (p=0.801). The interobserver agreement was fair (kappa=0.659) for parenchymal patterns and excellent (kappa=0.816) for severity. Thirty-four of the 93 cases (36.6%) had lymph node enlargement; 29/34 (85.3%) showed no additional source of infection. Sixteen of the 93 (17.2%) cases had potential fibrotic features. CONCLUSION: There is a high incidence of PTD in COVID-19 patients undergoing CTPA and lack of a risk stratification tool. The present data indicates a higher suspicion of PTD is needed in severe COVID-19 patients. The concomitant presence of possible fibrotic features on CT indicates the need for follow-up.","Fang, C; Garzillo, G; Batohi, B; Teo, J T H; Berovic, M; Sidhu, P S; Robbie, H",Clin Radiol,717,27

After finding the first positive cases, the question arose whether the virus had entered Hungary and caused infections before this date. Before March 4, 2020, except for the two above-mentioned samples, none of the 224 swab samples received specifically for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. AIM: The National Reference Laboratory for Respiratory Viruses of the National Public Health Center aimed to carry out a retrospective study of the swab and other samples taken for testing respiratory virus infections between January 1, and April 19, 2020 sent by sentinel physicians within the influenza surveillance for diagnostic purposes. METHOD: For the study, we used swab samples taken weekly by sentinel physicians of the influenza surveillance service, and other samples received for diagnostic purposes. Tests were performed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: All the 465 swab samples sent by sentinel physicians were found to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Also, of the 551 samples collected for diagnostic reasons of other respiratory viruses, no SARS-CoV-2 positive was found among those taken before March 4. CONCLUSION: Based on our data, it is very likely that prior to the first cases diagnosed on March 4, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 did not cause clinically symptomatic infections in Hungary.

The infection, and death numbers reported by World Health Organization (WHO) about this epidemic forecasts an increasing threats to the lives of people and the economics of countries. The greatest challenge that most governments are currently suffering from is the lack of a precise mechanism to detect unknown infected cases and predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus. In response to mitigate this challenge, this study proposes a novel innovative approach for mitigating big challenges of (COVID-19) coronavirus propagation and contagion. This study propose a blockchain-based framework which investigate the possibility of utilizing peer-to peer, time stamping, and decentralized storage advantages of blockchain to build a new system for verifying and detecting the unknown infected cases of COVID-19 virus. Moreover, the proposed framework will enable the citizens to predict the infection risk of COVID-19 virus within conglomerates of people or within public places through a novel design of P2P-Mobile Application. The proposed approach is forecasted to produce an effective system able to support governments, health authorities, and citizens to take critical decision regarding the infection detection, infection prediction, and infection avoidance. The framework is currently being developed and implemented as a new system consists of four components, Infection Verifier Subsystem, Blockchain platform, P2P-Mobile Application, and Mass-Surveillance System.

However, within an African population, it is not clear how the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic may be particularly important for formulating public health policies and their consequent implementation. As a first step, it is important to validate a psychometrically sound instrument to assess the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic using an African population. This study presents a preliminary validation of the fear of the COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using a sub-Saharan African population from Nigeria. Methods Three hundred and ninety-eight people responded from a total of 1000 invitees. The participants were requested to fill a web-based (Google forms) FCV-19S questionnaire. The responses, together with their socio-demographic data, were analysed using descriptive statistics and a confirmatory factor analysis. Results The age of the participants ranged between 21 and 30 years (mean 25.84 years). The study participants comprised 220 males (56.6%) and 169 females (43.4%). The factor loadings of all seven items of the FCV-19S questionnaire reached statistical significance and, therefore, were retained. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the two-factor structure of the FCV-19S questionnaire was a better fit for the Nigerian subpopulation under consideration. Cronbach's alphas for both subscales were acceptable. Conclusions The FCV-19S is a valid, suitable, and effective tool for the African population. Additionally, the implications of its use for public health practice in Africa are essential.","Chia, Terkuma Oyeniran Oluwatosin I.; Iorfa, Steven Kator",Journal of Taibah University Medical Sciences,717,26

Postnatal mental disorders are common but frequently undiagnosed, being a risk period to develop anxiety and depression symptoms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of confinement as depressive and anxiety symptoms in pregnant women (PrW) and puerperal women (PuW) mental health, as well as obstetric and perinatal outcomes during this period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The self-administered survey consists of a total of 28 questions, the first 16 providing contextual information and the following ones corresponding to the GHQ-12 that has been evaluated in a binomial form. A logistic regression model has been used to assess whether the contextual variables acted as a protective or risk factor and its fitting has been represented by a receiver operating curve. RESULTS: Of the 754 PrW interviewed, 58.22% were screened positive. Confinement time for these was 54.93 ± 9.75 days. The risk factors that were identified after the refinement have been to have a worse general state of health, to be sadder and to be more nervous. Among the protectors have been found to have a higher Apgar 10 score and induction of labor. The area under the adjusted regression adjustment curve was 0.8056. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms with strict confinement measures. PrW and PuW must be considered a risk group to develop mental health disorders during disruption circumstances. Using a mental health screening tool could help to identify a group of patients with more risk and to carry out a careful monitoring to allow adequate management.","de Arriba-García, María; Diaz-Martinez, Alba; Monfort-Ortiz, Rogelio; Roca-Prats, Alba; Monfort-Beltrán, Sara; Ivañez-Muñoz, María; Alberola-Rubio, José; Perales-Marín, Alfredo",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,717,20

Understanding the clinical and SARS-CoV-2 dynamic changes of mild and ordinary patients of COVID-19, so as to provide basis for the prevention and control of COVID-19.On February 1st, 2020, 16 SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive patients diagnosed in the same site in Beijing. The patients symptoms, signs, medication, and SARS-CoV-2 results were recorded.Of the 16 patients, 12 were female. Although they were infected at the same time in the same workplace, their clinical processes were very different and can be roughly divided into three different types: persistent sputum positive, persistent stool positive and persistent both positive. In 7 patients with mild clinical manifestations, the median days of SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative conversion in sputum samples were significantly later than those with obvious lung injury (27 days [range: 18 to 36]; 17 days, [range 6 to 25], P = .021). The negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool was significant later than in sputum.There were various clinical manifestations after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even if they were infected by the same source of infection in the same place. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in stool samples was longer than that in respiratory tract.","Zhang, Chi; Mu, Jing; Zhang, Daitao; Li, Jiawen; Wang, He; Jin, Yunv; Han, Yan; Li, Haiyang; Zhang, Chunxiao; Yu, Peng; Guo, Rui; Dou, Xiangfeng; Chu, Yanhui; Wu, Zhao; Dong, Xiaoqin; Wang, Guiqiang; Zhao, Hong",Medicine (Baltimore),717,6

Untreated wastewater samples were collected from the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF), located in southeast Michigan, between August 6, 2020 and December 14, 2020. The WRRF receives wastewater from its service area via three main interceptors: the Detroit River Interceptor (DRI), the North Interceptor-East Arm (NIEA), and the Oakwood-Northwest-Wayne County Interceptor (ONWI). A total of 144 untreated wastewater samples were collected (45, 48, and 51 for ONWI, NIEA, and DRI, respectively) at the point of intake into the WRRF. Virus-selective sampling was conducted, and viruses were isolated from wastewater using electropositive NanoCeram column filters. For each sample, an average of 33 L of wastewater was passed through NanoCeram electropositive cartridge filters at an average rate of 11 L/min. Viruses were eluted and concentrated, and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations were quantified with RT-qPCR. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 98% of the samples, and measured concentrations were in the range of 4.45×104 to 5.30×106 genomic copies/L.

Consequently, visuality and social media platforms like Twitter have come to play a vital role in disseminating prevention messages widely. Yet to date, only little is known about what characterizes visual risk communication during the Covid-19 pandemic. To address this gap in the literature, this study's objective was to determine how visual risk communication was used on Twitter to promote the World Health Organisations (WHO) recommended preventative behaviours and how this communication changed over time. METHODS: We sourced Twitter's 500 most retweeted Covid-19 messages for each month from January-October 2020 using Crowdbreaks. For inclusion, tweets had to have visuals, be in English, come from verified accounts, and contain one of the keywords 'covid19', 'coronavirus', 'corona', or 'covid'. Following a retrospective approach, we then performed a qualitative content analysis of the 616 tweets meeting inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Our results show communication dynamics changed over the course of the pandemic. At the start, most retweeted preventative messages came from the media and health and government institutions, but overall, personal accounts with many followers (51.3%) predominated, and their tweets had the highest spread (10.0%, i.e., retweet count divided by followers). Messages used mostly photographs and images were found to be rich with information. 78.1% of Tweets contained 1-2 preventative messages, whereby 'stay home' and 'wear a mask' frequented most. Although more tweets used health loss framing, health gain messages spread more. CONCLUSION: Our findings can inform the didactics of future crisis communication. The results underscore the value of engaging individuals, particularly influencers, as advocates to spread health risk messages and promote solidarity. Further, our findings on the visual characteristic of the most retweeted tweets highlight factors that health and government organisations should consider when creating visual health messages for Twitter. However, that more tweets used the emotive medium of photographs often combined with health loss framing raises concerns about persuasive tactics. More research is needed to understand the implications of framing and its impact on public perceptions and behaviours.","Sleigh, Joanna; Amann, Julia; Schneider, Manuel; Vayena, Effy",BMC Public Health,717,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 9 different institutions. The primary endpoint was to assess the prevalence of adapted patient care during the pandemic for elderly cancer patients. The secondary endpoint was to assess the incidence of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19. All patients were older than 65years of age. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 332 outpatients' case files between 9th of March and 30th of April 2020. The median age was 75years (range: 65-101) and 53% were male. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of the outpatients received modified patient care, defined as postponement or cancellation of surgery, irradiation scheme adapted, systemic treatment or the use of telemedicine. Among patients with localized cancer, 60% had a change in management strategy due to the pandemic. Changes in management strategy were made for 53% of patients at the metastatic stage. GCSF was used , in 83% of patients, increasing considerably in the context of the pandemic. Sixty-nine percent of physicians used telemedicine. In the final analysis, only one patient was hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. No deaths due to COVID-19 were reported in elderly cancer patients during this time period. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to assess modification of patient care in elderly cancer outpatients during an epidemic. With this unprecedented crisis, our objective is to protect our patients from infection via protective barrier measures and social distancing, but also to guarantee the continuity of cancer care without overexposing this fragile population. Physicians were able to adapt their practice and used new forms of management, like telemedicine.","Helissey, Carole; Ghebriou, Djamel; Cessot, Anatole; Boudin, Laurys; Prieux, Caroline; Romeo, Emilie; Schernberg, Anotine; Grellier, Noémie; Joly, Charlotte; Bauduceau, Olivier; Thibault, Constance; Mamou, Elodie; Raynal, Gauthier; Serey Eiffel, Sophie; Le Floch, Hervé; Ricard, Damien; Brureau, Laurent",Bull Cancer,717,9

To measure the mental health components of psychological distress and subjective well-being, two studies were conducted on different samples: Study 1 during the beginning of curfew in Serbia (N = 678) and Study 2 during the ending phase (N = 398). The results of Study 1 showed that elite athletes as well as those with high level of physical activity experienced the lowest distress. Furthermore, effects of the changes in the training routine on distress among physically active individuals depended on the level of sports participation with elite athletes who reduced trainings showing lower anxiety compared to recreational athletes who reduced trainings as well or kept the same training routine. Thus, we could conclude that in the early stage of the pandemic, elite athletes showed better mental health and adaptability to the crisis situation. Results of Study 2 showed that although all the participants had decreased well-being during the curfew, compared to the period before the pandemic and the curfew, there were no differences in well-being between elite and recreational athletes, who had higher well-being compared to non-athletes. However, this effect held both before and during the curfew showing that physically active individuals did not additionally benefit from this decrease compared to the non-active. Furthermore, athletes who became physically inactive showed lower well-being compared to those who kept the same training routine. Thus, in the later stage of the pandemic, prolonged physical inactivity had negative effects on mental health.","Sokic, J.; Popov, S.; Dinic, B. M.; Rastovic, J.",Frontiers in Psychology,717,30

SGs participate in various biological functions including response to apoptosis, inflammation, immune modulation, and signalling pathways; moreover, SGs are involved in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, viral infection, aging, cancers and many other diseases. Emerging evidence has shown that small molecules can affect SG dynamics, including assembly, disassembly, maintenance and clearance. Thus, targeting SGs is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human diseases and the promotion of health. The established methods for detecting SGs provided ready tools for large-scale screening of agents that alter the dynamics of SGs. Here, we describe the effects of small molecules on SG assembly, disassembly, and their roles in the disease. Moreover, we provide perspective for the possible application of small molecules targeting SGs in the treatment of human diseases.","Wang, Fei; Li, Juan; Fan, Shengjie; Jin, Zhigang; Huang, Cheng",Pharmacol Res,717,20

However, in many applications, relevant labeled source datasets may not be available, and collecting source labels can be as expensive as labeling the target data itself. In this paper, we investigate Multi-source Few-shot Domain Adaptation (MFDA): a new domain adaptation scenario with limited multi-source labels and unlabeled target data. As we show, existing methods often fail to learn discriminative features for both source and target domains in the MFDA setting. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, termed Multi-Source Few-shot Adaptation Network (MSFAN), which can be trained end-to-end in a non-adversarial manner. MSFAN operates by first using a type of prototypical, multi-domain, self-supervised learning to learn features that are not only domain-invariant but also class-discriminative. Second, MSFAN uses a small, labeled support set to enforce feature consistency and domain invariance across domains. Finally, prototypes from multiple sources are leveraged to learn better classifiers. Compared with state-of-the-art MDA methods, MSFAN improves the mean classification accuracy over different domain pairs on MFDA by 20.2%, 9.4%, and 16.2% on Office, Office-Home, and DomainNet, respectively.","Yue, Xiangyu; Zheng, Zangwei; Reed, Colorado; Das, Hari Prasanna; Keutzer, Kurt; Vincentelli, Alberto Sangiovanni",,717,14

There are a number of studies in individual raptor species but those data have not been systematically evaluated to understand raptor-wide lead exposure and effects at a pan-European scale. To critically assess the extent of this problem, we performed a systematic review compiling all published data on lead in raptors (1983-2019) and, through a meta-analysis, determined if there was evidence for differences in exposure across feeding traits, geographical regions, between hunting and non-hunting periods, and changes over time. We also reviewed the impact of lead on raptors and the likely main source of exposure. We examined 114 studies that were unevenly distributed in terms of time of publication and the countries in which studies were performed. Peer-reviewed articles reported data for 39 raptor species but very few species were widely monitored across Europe. Obligate (vultures) and facultative scavengers (golden eagle, common buzzard and white-tailed sea eagle) accumulated the highest lead concentrations in tissues and generally were the species most at risk of lead poisoning. We found no evidence of a spatial or decadal trend in lead residues, but we demonstrated that high lead blood levels relate to hunting season. Exposure at levels associated with both subclinical and lethal effects is common and lead from rifle bullets and shot is often the likely source of exposure. Overall, our review illustrates the high incidence and ubiquity of lead contamination in raptors in Europe. However, we did not find studies that related exposure to quantitative impacts on European raptor populations nor detailed studies on the impact of mitigation measures. Such information is urgently needed and requires a more harmonised approach to quantifying lead contamination and effects in raptors across Europe.","Monclús, Laura; Shore, Richard F; Krone, Oliver",Sci Total Environ,717,2

Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.","Tzur Bitan, Dana; Grossman-Giron, Ariella; Bloch, Yuval; Mayer, Yael; Shiffman, Noga; Mendlovic, Shlomo",Psychiatry Res,717,16

Cd9 and Cd81 are highly expressed in breast cancer cells; however, their expression in healthy mammary glands is unclear. In this study, we performed quantitative real-time PCR to analyze the expression levels of Cd9 and Cd81. Histological techniques were employed to identify Cd9- and Cd81-expressing cells in rat mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation. It was observed that Cd9 and Cd81 were expressed in the mammary glands, and their expression levels correlated with mammary gland development. To identify cells expressing Cd9 and Cd81 in the mammary glands, we performed double immunohistochemical staining for CD9 and CD81, prolactin receptor long form, estrogen receptor alpha, or Ki67. The results showed that CD9 and CD81 were co-expressed in proliferating mammary epithelial cells. Next, we attempted to isolate CD9-positive epithelial cells from the mammary gland using pluriBead cell-separation technology based on antibody-mediated binding of cells to beads of different sizes, followed by isolation using sieves with different mesh sizes. We successfully isolated CD9-positive epithelial cells with 96.8% purity. In addition, we observed that small-interfering RNAs against Cd9 and Cd81 inhibited estrogen-induced proliferation of CD9-positive mammary epithelial cells. Our current findings may provide novel insights into the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation as well as in pathological processes associated with breast cancer.","Horiguchi, Kotaro; Yoshida, Saishu; Tsukada, Takehiro; Nakakura, Takashi; Fujiwara, Ken; Hasegawa, Rumi; Takigami, Shu; Ohsako, Shunji",J. reprod. dev,717,33

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 31-year-old African American woman with a history of asthma, sleep apnea, obesity (body mass index of 40), and bilateral keratoconus was noted to have acute corneal endothelial graft rejection 3 months after uncomplicated penetrating keratoplasty of the left eye. The patient developed dysgeusia and subjective fever on the same day as ocular discomfort, and she was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 with only these 2 classic symptoms of the viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is known to cause conjunctivitis and has demonstrated transmissibility through ocular secretions. Acute immune and inflammatory dysregulations have been seen in cases of COVID-19 through various mechanisms. COVID-19 infection may potentially compromise ocular immune privilege contributing to acute corneal graft rejection.","Jin, Sierra X; Juthani, Viral V",Cornea,717,21

It is well known that according to DIN 5031-7, both UV-A and UV-B radiation from sunlight have clear influence on the mechanical and visual properties of plastic parts, but the influence of intensive artificial UV-C is not so widely investigated. As the UV-C is in the shorter end of the UV radiation wavelength spectrum and is completely absorbed by the ozone layer and atmosphere, it is not possible to see the influence of it in everyday life. But in the equipment where the artificial UV-C radiation wavelength is used as a disinfectant, and probably in the open space, the influence of UV-C could be remarkable. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the food industry to avoid contamination in the food packing process. The global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has amplified this interest and has forced authors to run a set of tests with printed plastic parts. This paper analyses the outcome of those tests including two different printing directions and two different surface paints. The study shows that there is considerable influence of UV-C radiation on mechanical and aesthetic properties of 3D SLS printed PA12 parts. However, the influence can be diminished by use of appropriate paints.","Tähemaa, T.; Sarkans, M.; Sarand, I.; Pohlak, M.; Niidas, A.; Saarna, M.",IOP Conference Series.

To apply the technology, either the quarantine authorities should provide the location history COVID-19 patients, or all people should provide their own location history. This inevitably makes people either the patient location history or personal location history of the public, leading to the privacy protection issue of information release for the public good against privacy exposure risks. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing system without exposing the location information between the user and the quarantine authorities with COVID-19 patient location history. METHODS: We propose a new protocol called PRivacy Oriented Technique for Epidemic Contact Tracing (PROTECT) that securely shares the location information of patients with users by using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) homomorphic encryption scheme, along with a new secure proximity computation method for it. RESULTS: We have developed a mobile application for the end-user and a web service for the quarantine authorities by applying the proposed method and have verified their effectiveness. Proposed application and web service compute the existence of intersections between the encrypted location history of COVID-19 patients released by the quarantine authorities and the user location history saved on the local device. We also show that the developed contact tracing application can identify whether the user is in contact with patients within a reasonable time on smartphones. CONCLUSIONS: The developed method that shares the location information encrypted with homomorphic encryption is a new method for contact tracing without exposing the location information of the COVID-19 patients and the users. Homomorphic encryption is difficult to apply to practical issues despite its high security value. This study, however, has designed a system applicable to a reasonable size using the BFV scheme, and developed it to an operable format. The developed application and web service can help contact tracing for not only COVID-19, but also other various epidemics.","An, Yongdae; Lee, Seungmyung; Jung, Seungwoo; Park, Howard; Song, Yongsoo; Ko, Taehoon",J. med. internet res,717,24

The Janus kinases (JAKs) play a significant part in cellular biological process, inflammation, and immunity. The roles of JAKs in STAD are still not systematically described. Methods: A series of bioinformatics tools were used to clarify the role of JAKs in STAD. Results: JAK3/TYK2 levels were significantly increased in STAD during subgroup analyses based on gender, tumor grade, cancer stages, and nodal metastasis status. STAD patients with high levels of JAK3/TYK2 had poor overall survival, postprogression survival, and first progression. Immune infiltration revealed a significant correlation between JAK3/TYK2 expression and the abundance of immune cells as well as immune biomarker expression in STAD. JAK3/TYK2 was associated with the adaptive immune response, chemokine signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Conclusions: JAK3 and TYK2 serve as prognostic biomarkers and are associated with immune infiltration in STAD.","Meng, Lingkai; Ding, Ling; Yu, Yue; Li, Wang",Biomed Res Int,717,16

Spike (S) glycoprotein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus is pivotal in understanding the virus anatomy, since it initiates the early contact with the ACE2 receptor in the human cell. The subunit S1 in chain A of S-protein has four structural domains: the receptor binding domain (RBD), the n-terminal domain (NTD) and two subdomains (SD1, SD2). We report details of the intra- and inter-molecular binding mechanism of RBD using density functional theory, including electronic structure, interatomic bonding and partial charge distribution. We identify five strong hydrogen bonds and analyze their roles in binding. This provides a pathway to a quantum-chemical understanding of the interaction between the S-protein and the ACE2 receptor with insights into the function of conserved features in the ACE2 receptor binding domain that could inform vaccine and drug development.","Adhikari, Puja; Li, Neng; Shin, Matthew; Steinmetz, Nicole F; Twarock, Reidun; Podgornik, Rudolf; Ching, Wai-Yim",Phys Chem Chem Phys,717,20

Case-based cadaveric MRI visualization and extended reality (XR) technology enhances learning experiences in medicine. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a virtual, multi-departmental workflow utilizing MRI, XR technology, and a ?patient? group, represented by the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) Willed Body Program, supplements case-based learning and promotes student exploration and engagement equally in cross-cultural cohorts represented by American and Turkish medical students. Virtual case-based learning activities were developed and presented to American medical students at JABSOM and Turkish medical students, selected based on education and English proficiency, via Zoom. Subject, medical history, and physical exam data were presented to students who were then divided into breakout rooms where hypotheses regarding cadaveric, neurological findings were generated. Students then reviewed radiology and pathology reports and accessed relevant 3D segmented, photogrammetric and illustrative models. An optional survey was completed to evaluate student opinion based on a 5-point Likert scale. Comparisons between groups were performed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. Data was reported as mean, median (min-max), and percentile. Significant differences (two-tailed P) less than 0.05 were significant. Results revealed significant differences between American (n=40) and Turkish (n=16) student opinion. The Turkish scale was significantly higher when asked if MRI scans of cadavers were useful as online learning tools (p =0.002), if MRI scans of cadavers provided an understanding of relevant anatomy (p&lt;0.001), if 3D models provided a better understanding of anatomical relationships (p&lt;0.001), whether students would like more interactive sessions using MRI scans (p&lt;0.001), and if students would use similar resources in the future (p&lt;0.001). The American scale was higher when asked if students were able to communicate effectively with their breakout groups (p=0.037). The learning activity was positively received by both cohorts as shown by no average score less than a 4 out of 5 for each question. The American scales may have been lower due to having previous experience with similar activities, whereas the learning activity was novel and exciting to Turkish students. Differences in communicating effectively in breakout rooms can be explained by the fact that American students were broken into longitudinal dissection groups, whereas Turkish students were randomly assigned. Based on these results, case-based learning, utilizing MRI and XR technology, enhances the learning experience of medical students and can be expanded to cross-cultural student populations.","Nakamatsu, Nicole Torigoe Trevor Mikami Brandi Thompson Jesse Rettenmeier Christoph Lozanoff Beth Kaya Brock Smith Alice Lee U.

Therefore, the objective of this review was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of IgG and IgM based point-of-care (POC) lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLIA), fluorescence enzyme-linked immunoassay (FIA) and ELISA systems that detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens. METHOD: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Medline complete and MedRxiv. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 were eligible. Study selection and data-extraction were performed by two authors independently. QUADAS-2 checklist tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. The bivariate model and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve model were performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the serological tests. Subgroup meta-analysis was performed to explore the heterogeneity. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 17), IgM (n = 16) and IgG-IgM (n = 24) based LFIA tests were 0.5856, 0.4637 and 0.6886, respectively compared to rRT-PCR method. The pooled sensitivity for IgG (n = 9) and IgM (n = 10) based CLIA tests were 0.9311 and 0.8516, respectively compared to rRT-PCR. The pooled sensitivity the IgG (n = 10), IgM (n = 11) and IgG-IgM (n = 5) based ELISA tests were 0.8292, 0.8388 and 0.8531 respectively compared to rRT-PCR. All tests displayed high specificities ranging from 0.9693 to 0.9991. Amongst the evaluated tests, IgG based CLIA expressed the highest sensitivity signifying its accurate detection of the largest proportion of infections identified by rRT-PCR. ELISA and CLIA tests performed better in terms of sensitivity compared to LFIA. IgG based tests performed better compared to IgM except for the ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: We report that IgG-IgM based ELISA tests have the best overall diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type independently. Given the poor performances of the current LFIA devices, there is a need for more research on the development of highly sensitivity and specific POC LFIA that are adequate for most individual patient applications and attractive for large sero-prevalence studies.

In addition, the second aim of the study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers' quality of life (QOL) and their fear of COVID-19. METHODS: The utilization of children health and rehabilitation services during the pandemic, the general health and physical status of the children during the pandemic, and the children and caregivers' history of COVID-19 infections were questioned. Furthermore, the caregivers' level of fear of COVID-19 and their QOL were examined. RESULTS: One hundred twenty caregivers were contacted by phone, and 94 (78.33%) caregivers agreed to participate in the study. Sixty-three of 94 children (67.1%) did not attend their routine control check-up during the pandemic. Twelve children (12.8%) discontinued their physical therapy sessions during the pandemic.

This study aims to forecast the extent to which waiting times could increase as a result of these measures, and estimate the level of effort required to restore performance to pre COVID-19 levels. A time-driven simulation is configured and calibrated based upon conditions in England as of February 2020. As a worst case scenario, where restrictions on elective care extend to twelve months and elective treatment rates are halved, results suggest performance could drop to levels not seen since 2007 and the size of the waiting list could double.

The electronic design of these charge transfer molecular machines is crucial to build a complex supramolecular architecture for the light energy conversion. Here, we present an ab initio simulation of the whole decay pathways of a recently proposed artificial molecular reaction center. A complete structural and energetic characterization has been carried out with methods based on density functional theory, its time-dependent version, and a broken-symmetry approach. On the basis of our findings we provide a revision of the pathway only indirectly postulated from an experimental point of view, along with unprecedented and significant insights on the electronic and nuclear structure of intramolecular charge-separated states, which are fundamental for the application of this molecular assembly in photoelectrochemical cells.

The case severity and fatality of COVID-19 are associated with excessive inflammation, namely, a cytokine storm. Metformin, a widely used drug to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus and metabolic syndrome, has immunomodulatory activity that reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines using macrophages and causes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Metformin also inhibits the cytokine production of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. Importantly, treatment with metformin alleviates various lung injuries in preclinical animal models. In addition, a recent proteomic study revealed that metformin has the potential to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, retrospective clinical studies have revealed that metformin treatment reduces the mortality of T2D with COVID-19. Therefore, metformin has the potential to be repurposed to treat patients with COVID-19 at risk of developing severe illness. This review summarizes the immune pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and addresses the effects of metformin on inhibiting cytokine storms and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its side effects.","Chen, Xianyang; Guo, Huifang; Qiu, Li; Zhang, Chengdong; Deng, Qiang; Leng, Qibin",Front Immunol,717,10

On occasion, hosts recruited retroviral genes to mediate their own biological functions, a process formally known as co-option or exaptation. Much remains unknown about the extent of retroviral gene co-option in vertebrates, although more than ten retroviral gene co-option events have been documented. Here, we use a phylogenomic approach to analyze more than 700 vertebrate genomes to uncover retroviral gene co-option taking place during the evolution of vertebrates. We identify a total of 177 independent retroviral gene co-option events in vertebrates, a majority of which have not been reported previously. Among these retroviral gene co-option events, 93 and 84 involve gag and env genes, respectively. More than 78.0% (138 out of 177) of retroviral gene co-option occurred within mammals. The gag and env co-option events share a generally similar temporal pattern with less frequent retroviral gene co-option identified in the deep branches, suggesting that retroviral gene co-option might have not been maintained for very long time periods. Moreover, we find co-opted retroviral genes are subject to different selection pressure, implying potentially diverse cellular functionality. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of co-opted retroviral genes during the evolution of vertebrates, and has implications in understanding the ancient evolution of vertebrate-retrovirus interaction.","Wang, Jianhua; Han, Guan-Zhu",Mol. biol. evol,717,29

However, Bluetooth attenuation is not a reliable measure of distance, and infection risk is not a binary function of distance, nor duration, nor timing. We model uncertainty in the shape and orientation of an exhaled virus-containing plume and in inhalation parameters, and measure uncertainty in distance as a function of Bluetooth attenuation. We calculate expected dose by combining this with estimated infectiousness based on timing relative to symptom onset. We calibrate an exponential dose-response curve based on infection probabilities of household contacts. The probability of current or future infectiousness, conditioned on how long postexposure an exposed individual has been symptom-free, decreases during quarantine, with shape determined by incubation periods, proportion of asymptomatic cases, and asymptomatic shedding durations. It can be adjusted for negative test results using Bayes' theorem. We capture a 10-fold range of risk using six infectiousness values, 11-fold range using three Bluetooth attenuation bins, â¼sixfold range from exposure duration given the 30 minute duration cap imposed by the Google/Apple v1.1, and â¼11-fold between the beginning and end of 14 day quarantine.

However, the emergence of viral variants that are more transmissible and, in some cases, escape from neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns. Here, we evaluated recombinant protein spike antigens derived from wild type SARS-CoV-2 and from variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 for their immunogenicity and protective effect in vivo against challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model. All proteins induced high neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses but also induced high cross-neutralizing antibody responses. The decline in neutralizing titers between variants was moderate, with B.1.1.7 vaccinated animals having a maximum fold reduction of 4.8 against B.1.351 virus. P.1 induced the most cross-reactive antibody responses but was also the least immunogenic in terms of homologous neutralization titers. However, all antigens protected from challenge with wild type SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model. Author SummaryThe emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 has led to an urgency to study whether vaccines will lead to cross-protection against these variants. Here, we demonstrate that vaccination with spike proteins of various variants leads to cross-neutralizing responses, as well as protection in a mouse model against wild type SARS-CoV-2.","Amanat, Fatima; Strohmeier, Shirin; Meade, Philip; Mühlemann, Barbara; Smith, Derek J.; Coughlan, Lynda; Krammer, Florian",,717,1

Understanding the analytical performance metrics of this protocol will improve how the data is used and interpreted. Different concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 control material were used to establish the limit of detection (LoD) of the ARTIC protocol. Results demonstrated the LoD was a minimum of 25-50 virus particles per mL. The sensitivity of ARTIC was comparable to the published sensitivities of commercial diagnostics assays and could therefore be used to confirm diagnostic testing results. A set of over 3,600 clinical samples from three UK regions were then evaluated to compare the protocols performance to clinical diagnostic assays (Roche Lightcycler 480 II, AusDiagnostics, Roche Cobas, Hologic Panther, Corman RdRp, Roche Flow, ABI QuantStudio 5, Seegene Nimbus, Qiagen Rotorgene, Abbott M2000, Thermo TaqPath, Xpert). We developed a Python tool, RonaLDO, to perform this validation (available under the GNU GPL3 open-source licence from https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/ronaldo).

R-VATS was initially developed to overcome the drawbacks of VATS by offering surgeons more flexibility and three-dimensional optics during thoracoscopic surgery. The effectiveness of R-VATS lobectomy regarding oncological outcomes, morbidity, mortality, and postoperative quality of life (QoL) has been shown in an increasing number of studies. More recently, these results have also been corroborated for sublobar resections, more specifically for segmentectomy. However, no well-powered, multicentre randomized trials have been performed to demonstrate the superiority of R-VATS compared with open surgery or conventional types of VATS (total VATS, uniportal VATS, etc.). The majority of the evidence currently available is based on non-randomized studies, and many studies report conflicting results when comparing R-VATS and conventional VATS. Moreover, there is a lack of data regarding the cost and the cost-efficiency of robotic surgery compared with VATS and open surgery. Current evidence suggests that R-VATS costs are higher than VATS and that a deficit can only be prevented when up to 150-300 thoracic surgery procedures are performed annually. Finally, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery showed better ergonomics and reduced musculoskeletal disorders compared with non-robotic laparoscopic surgery.","Berzenji, Lawek; Yogeswaran, Krishan; Van Schil, Paul; Lauwers, Patrick; Hendriks, Jeroen M H",Curr Treat Options Oncol,717,5

As WOC nurses, we were tasked with formulating procedures for protecting the facial skin integrity of healthcare workers (HCWs) using personal protective devices when caring for patients with suspected or active COVID-19, while avoiding contamination when the masks are donned or doffed. This quality improvement project describes how we approached this project within the limited time frame available as we cared for patients with established and suspected COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: This project focused on HCW use of N95 respirator masks and dressings currently available in our facility. The 4 WOC nurses acted as quality improvement project directors and as participants. The setting for our project was our facility's simulation laboratory. APPROACH: We evaluated 6 topical products (an alcohol-free liquid acrylate, thin film dressing, thin hydrocolloid dressing, hydrocolloid blister care cushion, thin foam transfer dressing, and thick foam dressing) applied to skin in contact with 3 N95 respirators; all are available on our facility's formulary and all are in widespread clinical use. After the product was applied to the face and nose, the N95 respirator was donned and evaluated for fit. Participants then wore the devices for 10 hours and doffed the mask using established facility procedures. In order to evaluate for potential contamination including possible aerosolization, we applied a commercially available fluorescent lotion to simulate the presence of infectious particles. Contamination was assessed using an ultraviolet light for all dressings except for the alcohol-free liquid acrylate. We also evaluated cutaneous responses (skin integrity, irritation, comfort) during this period. OUTCOMES: We found that contamination of the simulated pathogen did not occur with removal of any of the protective products. No skin irritation was noted with any of the tested products after a 10-hour wear time underneath the N95 respirator masks, but mild discomfort was experienced with 3 of the dressings (thin film dressing and both hydrocolloid dressings). CONCLUSION: Based on these experiences, we recommend application of an alcohol-free liquid acrylate film to prevent facial skin injury associated with friction from the extended use of an N95 respirator mask. We further recommend performing a fit test and user-performed seal check with the use of any topical dressing and especially those that add cushion. For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend use of protective dressings to maintain skin integrity and protection from coronavirus infection as HCWs continue to provide care to all of patients under their care.","Pacis, Michelle; Azor-Ocampo, Annielyn; Burnett, Emily; Tanasapphaisal, Chutiwan; Coleman, Bernice",J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs,717,26

We measured the period from the date of illness onset to the date of COVID-19 confirmation. RESULTS: We analysed data from 59 cases (median age, 30 years). The estimated median period between the date of symptom onset and the date of COVID-19 confirmation was 4 days (95% confidence interval, 1-12). CONCLUSIONS: There was a delay in COVID-19 confirmation from the date of illness onset among the cases linked to the Shincheonji religious group. This delay likely contributed to the occurrence of many cases of COVID-19 in the group.","Kim, Hyung-Ju; Hwang, Hyun-Seong; Choi, Yong-Hyuk; Song, Hye-Yeon; Park, Ji-Seong; Yun, Chae-Young; Ryu, Sukhyun",J Prev Med Public Health,717,20

The causative agent is a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is similar to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Adult infection with respiratory symptoms was considered in the beginning of the pandemic. Now, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 infects children and other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors as the main receptor expressed in various organs such as the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Studies on children and the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 do not completely explain the natural course of infection in children, and precisely how the GI tract is involved is not understood. The present article highlights the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings in children with COVID-19. According to the evidence, SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder in children and may present different clinical symptoms from adults. Common clinical manifestations of pediatric COVID-19 include cough, fever, sore throat, malaise, fatigue, and GI symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Furthermore, liver and pancreatic enzymes may be elevated during the pediatric COVID-19 course. Asymptomatic children carriers are potential sources of infection for adults, especially elderly ones. Diagnosis, treatment, and isolation of children are the most effective ways to control the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rohani, Pejman; Ahmadi Badi, Sara; Moshiri, Arfa; Siadat, Seyed Davar",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,717,19

Broad-spectrum antivirals are currently being administered to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). China's prevention and treatment guidelines suggest the use of an anti-influenza drug, arbidol, for the clinical treatment of COVID-19. Reports indicate that arbidol could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Monotherapy with arbidol is superior to lopinavir-ritonavir or favipiravir for treating COVID-19. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, arbidol acts by interfering with viral binding to host cells. However, the detailed mechanism by which arbidol induces the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Here, we present atomistic insights into the mechanism underlying membrane fusion inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by arbidol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation-based analyses demonstrate that arbidol binds and stabilizes at the receptor-binding domain (RBD)/ACE2 interface with a high affinity. It forms stronger intermolecular interactions with the RBD than ACE2. Analyses of the detailed decomposition of energy components and binding affinities revealed a substantial increase in the affinity between the RBD and ACE2 in the arbidol-bound RBD/ACE2 complex, suggesting that arbidol generates favorable interactions between them. Based on our MD simulation results, we propose that the binding of arbidol induces structural rigidity in the viral glycoprotein, thus restricting the conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion and virus entry. Furthermore, key residues of the RBD and ACE2 that interact with arbidol were identified, opening the door for developing therapeutic strategies and higher-efficacy arbidol derivatives or lead drug candidates.","Padhi, Aditya K; Seal, Aniruddha; Khan, Javed Masood; Ahamed, Maqusood; Tripathi, Timir",Eur J Pharmacol,717,1

In the context of the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, involvement of DC-SIGN has been linked to severe cases of COVID-19. Inhibition of the interaction between DC-SIGN and viral glycoproteins has the potential to generate broad spectrum antiviral agents. Here, we demonstrate that mannose-functionalized poly-l-lysine glycoconjugates efficiently inhibit the attachment of viral glycoproteins to DC-SIGN-presenting cells with picomolar affinity. Treatment of these cells leads to prolonged receptor internalization and inhibition of virus binding for up to 6â h. Furthermore, the polymers are fully bio-compatible and readily cleared by target cells.

Classroom measurements conducted from December 2017 to September 2018 were used to estimate risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using a modified Wells-Riley equation under a steady-state conditions and varying exposure scenarios (infectious student versus teacher, susceptible student versus teacher, with and without masks). We then used multivariable linear regression with GEE to identify school and classroom factors that impact transmission risk. Overall, 101 classrooms in 19 schools were assessed, 86 during the heating season, 69 during cooling season, and 54 during both. The mean probability of transmission was generally low but varied by scenario (range: 0.0015-0.81). Transmission rates were higher during the heating season (beta=0.108, p=0.010), in schools in higher income neighborhoods (>80K versus 20K-40K beta=0.196, p<0.001) and newer buildings (<50 years beta=0.237, p=<0.001; 50-99 years beta=0.230, p=0.013 versus 100+ years) and lower in schools with mechanical ventilation (beta=0.141, p=0.057). Surprisingly, schools located in older buildings and lower-income neighborhoods had lower transmission probabilities, likely due to the greater outdoor airflow associated with an older, non-renovated buildings that allow air to leak in (i.e. drafty buildings). Despite the generally low risk of school-based transmission found in this study, with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence rising in New York City this risk will increase and additional mitigation steps should be implemented in schools now.","Pavilonis, Brian; Ierardi, A Michael; Levine, Leon; Mirer, Franklin; Kelvin, Elizabeth A",Environ Res,717,1

METHODS: This retrospective study included 733 asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 subjects, who were submitted to the RT-qPCR test. The objective was to assess the efficacy of an expanded triage of subjects undergoing the RT-qPCR test for SARS-COV-2 to identify the largest possible number of COVID-19 cases in a hospital setting in Ecuador. SARS-CoV-2 Firstly, the sensitivity and specificity as well as the predictive values of an expanded triage method were calculated. In addition, the Kappa coefficient was also determined to assess the concordance between laboratory test results and the expanded triage. RESULTS: Of a total of 733 sputum samples; 229 were RT-qPCR-positive (31.2%) and mortality rate reached 1.2%. Overall sensitivity and specificity were 86.0% (95% confidence interval: 81.0-90.0%) and 37.0% (95% confidence interval: 32.0-41.0%) respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 52.0% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.73.

When the disease progression is long such as for HIV, individuals often experience switches among different states. We derive an epidemic model in which infected individuals have a discrete set of states of infectivity and can switch among different states. The model also incorporates a general incidence form in which new infections are distributed among different disease states. We discuss the importance of the transmission-transfer network for infectious diseases. Under the assumption that the tranmission-transfer network is strongly connected, we establish that the basic reproduction number R 0 is a sharp threshold parameter: if R 0 &#8804; 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease always dies out; if R 0 > 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is unstable, the system is uniformly persistent and initial outbreaks lead to persistent disease infection. For a restricted class of incidence functions, we prove that there is a unique endemic equilibrium and it is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 > 1 . Furthermore, we discuss the impact of different state structures on R 0 , on the distribution of the disease states at the unique endemic equilibrium, and on disease control and preventions.

It is an incredibly useful approach, but like all data-driven approaches, it raises privacy-related serious ethical and legal concerns when data is about peoples' information. Is it possible to accurately analyze data for outliers while protecting the privacy of people whose data we analyze? In this dissertation, we explicate methods to answer this question for the most practically relevant case, where outliers are defined in a data-dependent way and current privacy methods such as differential privacy fail to achieve practically meaningful utility.To define what it means to protect privacy in outlier analysis, we conceptualize sensitive privacy - it not only admits efficient algorithmic constructions but is also amenable to analysis. We introduce novel constructions to develop sensitively private mechanisms to accurately identify outliers, and to compile low-accuracy differentially private mechanisms into high-accuracy sensitively private mechanisms. Furthermore, to address the lack of a principled approach to private outlier analysis, we provide a framework to help a data analyst identify the right problem-specification and a practical solution for her application.Finally, we develop mechanisms - which guarantee privacy and practically meaningful utility - to identify (beta,r)-anomalies as well as covid-19 hotspots (an outlying event). An extensive empirical evaluation of these private mechanisms over a range of real-world datasets and use cases overwhelmingly supports the effectiveness of our approach.

METHODS: In vitro human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte model showed that miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-208b, and miR-499 are released from cells into culture medium in a time- and dose-dependent manner on doxorubicin exposure. Left ventricular (LV) myocardial deformation and circulating heart-associated miRs and plasma hs-cTnT during and after completion of chemotherapy were determined in 40 children with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia. RESULTS: Significant reduction of LV global longitudinal strain and strain rates were found within 1 week after completion of anthracycline therapy in the induction phase of treatment (all p < 0.05). Hs-cTnT level peaked and miR-1 increased significantly at this time point. Log-transformed hs-cTnT correlated negatively with LV global systolic longitudinal strain (r = -0.38, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that area under the curve for changes in plasma hs-cTnT from baseline and plasma miR-1 levels in detecting a reduction in &#8805;20% of global longitudinal strain were respectively 0.62 (95% CI 0.38-0.87) and 0.62 (95% CI 0.40-0.84). CONCLUSION: Plasma hs-cTnT and circulating miR-1 may be useful markers of myocardial damage during chemotherapy in children with leukaemias. IMPACT: Heart-associated miRNAs including miR-1, miR-133a, miR-208a, miR-208b,and miR-499 were increased in the culture medium upon exposure of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin.Only miR-1 increased significantly during anthracycline-based therapy in paediatric leukaemic patients.In paediatric leukaemic patients, plasma hs-cTnT and circulating level of miR-1 showed the most significant increase within 1 week after completion of anthracycline therapy in the induction treatment phase.The study provides the first evidence of progressive increase in circulating miR-1 and plasma hs-cTnT levels during the course of anthracycline-based therapy in children with leukaemias, with hs-cTnT level also associated with changes in LV myocardial deformation.","Cheung, Yiu-Fai; Li, Vivian Wing-Yi; Lai, Clare Tik-Man; Shin, Vivian Yvonne; Keung, Wendy; Cheuk, Daniel Ka-Leung; Kwong, Ava; Li, Ronald Adolphus; Chan, Godfrey Chi-Fung",Pediatr. res,717,33

These preparations may become toxic to human health and environment when misused. These chemicals have known toxic and hazardous impact on environment when released by evaporation. In early five months of 2020, American Association of Poison Control Center reported 9504 alcoholic hand sanitizer exposure cases in children under the age of 12 years and recognized that even a small amount of alcohol can cause alcohol poisoning in children that is responsible for confusion, vomiting and drowsiness, and in severe cases, respiratory arrest and death. Furthermore, frequent usage of said hand sanitizers has reported increased chance of antimicrobial resistance and chance of other viral diseases. Current review is designed with main objective to highlight the toxic and serious health risks to human health and environment by frequent using hand hygiene products with alcohols based formulations.","Mahmood, Adeel; Eqan, Maryam; Pervez, Saher; Alghamdi, Huda Ahmed; Tabinda, Amtul Bari; Yasar, Abdullah; Brindhadevi, Kathirvel; Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan",Sci Total Environ,717,23

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 13 children with SARS-CoV-2 infection who hospitalized in a Changsha hospital. RESULTS: All 13 children had the disease onset due to family aggregation. Of the 13 children, 2 had no symptoms, and the other 11 children had the clinical manifestations of fever, cough, pharyngeal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, convulsions, or vomiting. As for clinical typing, 7 had mild type, 5 had common type, and 1 had severe type. The median duration of fever was 2 days in 6 children. All 13 children had normal levels of peripheral blood lymphocyte counts, immunoglobulins, CD4, CD8, and interleukin-6. The median time to clearance of SARS-CoV-2 was 13 days in the nasopharyngeal swabs of the 13 children. Three children presented false negatives for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable in stools for 12 days after the nasopharyngeal swab test yielded a negative result. Abnormal CT findings were observed in 6 children. All 13 children were cured and discharged and they were normal at 2 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-family contact is the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and there is also a possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Mild and common types are the major clinical types in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cytokine storm is not observed. Children with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have a good short-term prognosis, and follow-up is needed to observe their long-term prognosis. Multiple nucleic acid tests should be performed for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and their close contacts by multiple site sampling.","Tan, Xin; Huang, Juan; Zhao, Fen; Zhou, Yan; Li, Jie-Qiong; Wang, Xiang-Yun",Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,717,20

The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak and determined it a global pandemic. The current pandemic has infected nearly 300 million people and killed over 3 million. The current COVID-19 pandemic is smashing every public health barrier, guardrail, and safety measure in underdeveloped and the most developed countries alike, with peaks and troughs across time. Greatly impacted are those regions experiencing conflict and war. Morbidity and mortality increase logarithmically for those communities at risk and that lack the ability to promote basic preventative measures. States around the globe struggle to unify responses, make gains on preparedness levels, identify and symptomatically treat positive cases, and labs across the globe frantically rollout various vaccines and effective surveillance and therapeutic mechanisms. The incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 may continue to increase globally as no unified disaster response is manifested and disinformation spreads. During this failure in response, virus variants are erupting at a dizzying pace. Ungoverned spaces where nonstate actors predominate and active war zones may become the next epicenter for COVID-19 fatality rates. As the incidence rates continue to rise, hospitals in North America and Europe exceed surge capacity, and immunity post infection struggles to be adequately described. The global threat in previously high-quality, robust infrastructure health-care systems in the most developed economies are failing the challenge posed by COVID-19; how will less-developed economies and those health-care infrastructures that are destroyed by war and conflict fare until adequate vaccine penetrance in these communities or adequate treatment are established? Ukraine and other states in the Black Sea Region are under threat and are exposed to armed Russian aggression against territorial sovereignty daily. Ukraine, where Russia has been waging war since 2014, faces this specific dual threat: disaster response to violence and a deadly infectious disease. To best serve biosurveillance, aid in pandemic disaster response, and bolster health security in Europe, across the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) and Black Sea regions, increased NATO integration, across Ukraine's disaster response structures within the Ministries of Health, Defense, and Interior must be reinforced and expanded to mitigate the COVID-19 disaster.","Quinn V, John M; Dhabalia, Trisha Jigar; Roslycky, Lada L; Wilson V, James M; Hansen, Jan-Cedric; Hulchiy, Olesya; Golubovskaya, Olga; Buriachyk, Mykola; Vadim, Kondratiuk; Zauralskyy, Rostyslav; Vyrva, Oleg; Stepanskyi, Dmytro; Ivanovitch, Pokhil Sergiy; Mironenko, Alla; Shportko, Volodymyr; McElligott, John E",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,717,1

The epidemic COVID-19 catalyzed the expansion of online healthcare services. In recent years, internet hospitals were developed rapidly. As the largest online medical entrance in China, Ping An Good Doctor was a national, widely used application providing online healthcare services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to give a comprehensive description of the characteristics of the online consultations and inquisitions in Ping An Good Doctor. The analyses tried to answer: (1) what are the characteristics of consultations in the Ping An Good Doctor in terms of departments and disease profiles? (2) who would use the online health services most frequently? (3) how is the user experience for the online consultations of the Ping An Good Doctor? METHODS: A total of 35.3 million consultations and inquisitions in one year were analyzed with respect to the distributions of departments and diseases, the users' portrait, and the consulting behaviors. RESULTS: The geographical distribution of the usage of Ping An Good Doctor showed Shandong (18.4%), Yunnan (15.6%), Shaanxi (7.2%), and Guangdong (5.5%) were the lead provinces, which accounted for 46.6% of the total consultations and inquisitions. In terms of department distribution, we found gynecology and obstetrics (19.2%), dermatology (17.0%), and pediatrics (14.4%) were the top 3 popular departments in Ping An Good Doctor. The disease distribution analysis showed expect for the non-disease specific consultations, acute upper respiratory infection (4.1%), pregnancy (2.8%), and dermatitis (2.4%) were the most frequently consulted diseases. In terms of user portrait, females (60.4%) aged between 19 and 35 were most likely to consult online in general. The users' behavior analyses showed the peak hours for online consultations occurred at 10:00, 15:00, and 21:00 of the day. As for the user experience, 93% of users gave full marks after the consultations. And for some disease-related health problems, such as acute upper respiratory infection (AURI), dermatitis, and eczema, the feedback scores were above the average. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of internet hospitals, such as Ping An Good Doctor, illustrated the great demand for the online healthcare services that can break the geographical limitations. Our analyses showed the non-disease specific questions and moderate health problems were much more frequently consulted than the severe clinical conditions. This indicated that the internet hospitals played the role of family doctors, which helped to relieve the stress of offline hospitals and facilitated people's life. Besides, the good user experience, especially for disease-related inquisitions, suggested that online health services can solve health problems. With the support from the government and the acceptance by the public, online healthcare services would develop at a fast pace and greatly benefit people's daily life.","Jiang, Xuehan; Xie, Hong; Tang, Rui; Du, Yanmei; Li, Tao; Gao, Jinsheng; Xu, Xiuping; Jiang, Siqi; Zhao, Tingting; Zhao, Wei; Sun, Xingzhi; Hu, Gang; Wu, Dejun; Xie, Guotong",J. med. internet res,717,24

Patients with hypertension are routinely and according to standards treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) II. ACE inhibitors or ARB II are included in fixed combinations of antihypertensive drugs recommended for patients with uncomplicated hypertension, as well as when combined with various comorbidities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were suggestions about the potential for a negative effect of drugs of these classes on the course and outcomes of a new coronavirus infection. There was a need for a quick response from the most reputable medical organizations to the question of the use of ACE inhibitors and ARB II during the COVID-19 pandemic. The expert position was soon published despite the lack of evidence from randomized clinical trials. Was there any reason for concern about the treatment of ACE inhibitors and ARB II for COVID-19? What are the relationships between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and COVID-19? Is there any new data from clinical trials that can confirm or deny the previously presented position of professional societies regarding the use of RAAS blockers in COVID-19? What is the role of the difference in the mechanism of action of an ACE inhibitor and ARB II in COVID-19? Is it possible that RAAS blockers will be helpful in treating COVID-19?

Using an agent-based model, we explore one of the technology-based strategies proposed, a contact-tracing smartphone app. The model simulates the spread of COVID-19 in a population of agents on an urban scale. Agents are heterogeneous in their characteristics and are linked in a multi-layered network representing the social structure-including households, friendships, employment and schools. We explore the interplay of various adoption rates of the contact-tracing app, different levels of testing capacity, and behavioural factors to assess the impact on the epidemic. Results suggest that a contact tracing app can contribute substantially to reducing infection rates in the population when accompanied by a sufficient testing capacity or when the testing policy prioritises symptomatic cases. As user rate increases, prevalence of infection decreases. With that, when symptomatic cases are not prioritised for testing, a high rate of app users can generate an extensive increase in the demand for testing, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app counterproductive. This points to the crucial role of an efficient testing policy and the necessity to upscale testing capacity.","Almagor, Jonatan; Picascia, Stefano",Sci Rep,717,21

Given the limited knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy, management guidelines are fundamental. Our aim was to examine the obstetrics guidelines released from December 2019 to April 2020 to compare their recommendations and to assess how useful they could be to maternal health workers. We reviewed 11 guidelines on obstetrics management, assessing four domains: (1) timeliness: the time between the declaration of pandemics by WHO and a guideline release and update; (2) accessibility: the readiness to access a guideline by searching it on a common browser; (3) completeness: the amount of foundational topics covered; and (4) consistency: the agreement among different guidelines. In terms of timeliness, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) was the first organization to release their recommendation. Only four guidelines were accessible with one click, while only 6/11 guidelines covered more than 80% of the 30 foundational topics we identified. For consistency, the study highlights the existence of 10 points of conflict among the recommendations. The present research revealed a lack of uniformity and consistency, resulting in potentially challenging decisions for healthcare providers.","Benski, Caroline; Di Filippo, Daria; Taraschi, Gianmarco; Reich, Michael R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),717,2

Unfortunately, access to RNA extraction reagents can represent a bottleneck for quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)-based methodologies, stemming from both extraordinary supply-chain stresses and the global reach of the virus into resource-limited settings. To provide flexible diagnostic options for such environments, we report here an ""unextracted modification"" for qRT-PCR using the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) widely utilized primers/probe sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (N1/N2/N3 targeting viral nucleocapsid and RP-control targeting human RNase P). This approach replaces RNA extraction/purification with a heat-inactivation step of viral transport media (VTM), followed by direct inoculation-with or without VTM spin concentration-into PCR master mixes. Using derivatives of care from our clinical workflow, we compared traditional and unextracted CDC methodologies. Although some decrease in analytic sensitivity was evident (by higher Ct values) without extraction, in particular for the N2 primer/probe-set, we observed high categorical positive agreement between extracted and unextracted results for N1 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-39/41), N3 (unconcentrated VTM-38/40; concentrated VTM-41/41), and RP (unconcentrated and concentrated VTM-81/81). The negative categorical agreement for N1/N2/N3 was likewise high. Overall, these results suggest that laboratories could adapt and validate unextracted qRT-PCR protocols as a contingency to overcome supply limitations, with minimal impact on categorical results.","Adams, Nicholas M; Leelawong, Mindy; Benton, Alison; Quinn, Criziel; Haselton, Frederick R; Schmitz, Jonathan E",J Med Virol,717,16

Methods: The present study was carried out on patients with combined cataract and pterygium excision (combined group) and pterygium surgery first and cataract surgery after one month (sequential group). Parameters such as mean keratometry (K) values, axial length, IOL power, and corneal astigmatism were compared pre and postoperatively in the combined and sequential groups. Results: 70 eyes of 70 patients were included in the present study. The mean age of the participants in the combined group was 70.46±10.12, whereas that in the sequential group was 68.68±11.22 (p=0.243). The mean horizontal length of the pterygium in the combined group was 2.64±0.17 mm and 2.57±0.17 mm in the sequential group. The mean postoperative K values (p=0.03) and IOL power (p=0.04) in the combined group were significantly higher than the preoperative values. The estimated postoperative refractive error in the combined group was -0.50±1.00 D and 0.25±0.5 D in the sequential group (p=0.04). On the other hand, the postoperative refraction in the sequential group was predictable. Corneal visibility was diminished on the nasal side in almost all the patients in the combined group as compared to the sequential group. Conclusion: The postoperative refraction errors were positively correlated with the length of pterygium in the combined group. The unpredictability of these errors recommends sequential surgery in cases with concurrent pterygium and cataract.","Joshi, Rajesh Subhash; Pendke, Sudhir Sudhakar; Marewar, Shobha",Rom J Ophthalmol,717,15

Therefore, the present article aimed at collecting experiences and recommendations of frontline clinical experts on critical aspects of dental treatment provision during pandemic. MATERIAL & METHODS: From a total of 32 European countries, one leading academic expert in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery or Oral Surgery per country was asked to participate in an anonymous online 10-item survey on COVID-19 covering the topics of safety of dental settings, personal protective equipment (PPE), and patient-related measures to reduce transmission risk. Data collection took place from April 12th to May 22nd, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 27 experts from different European countries completed the survey. The transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 in dental settings for aerosol-generating procedures was considered high by all experts except two. For aerosol-free and aerosol-generating procedures, more than 80% of the experts recommended face protection and caps for every single treatment. For aerosol-generating procedures, additional measures (FFP2/FFP3 masks and gowns) were suggested by the vast majority of the experts. To reduce transmission risk, all experts recommended limiting aerosol-generating procedures and reducing the number of patients in waiting areas as well as hand hygiene for the patients. CONCLUSION: The limitation of aerosol-generating procedures along with the usage of adequate personal protection equipment was considered to be crucial to protect dental healthcare providers and patients, thus reducing the transmission risk of COVID-19.","Becker, Kathrin; Brunello, Giulia; Gurzawska-Comis, Katarzyna; Becker, Jürgen; Sivolella, Stefano; Schwarz, Frank; Klinge, Björn",Clin Oral Implants Res,717,30

Recent progress with antioxidant enzyme inhibitors shows promise, but mortality rates are high. We modified the dosage and administration of an antioxidant enzyme inhibitor regimen to reduce mortality while inducing a chronic wound environment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To chemically induce a chronic wound environment, we applied modified doses of catalase (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; intraperitoneal 0.5 g/kg) and glutathione peroxidase (mercaptosuccinic acid; topical 300 mg/kg) inhibitors to the dorsal wounds of 11-week-old db/db mice. A cohort of these mice was treated with a collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold. Both groups were compared with Diabetic control mice. RESULTS: This study successfully induced a chronic wound in 11-week-old db/db mice, with no animal deaths. The antioxidant enzyme treated groups showed delayed wound contraction and significantly higher levels of inflammatory tissue, collagen deposition, cellular proliferation and leukocyte infiltration than the Diabetic control group. Angiogenesis was significantly higher in the antioxidant enzyme treated groups, but the vessels were immature and friable. Scaffold engraftment was poor but appeared to promote blood vessel maturation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the two in vivo groups treated with the antioxidant enzyme inhibitors appeared to be arrested in the inflammatory stage of wound healing, while the Diabetic control group progressed to the maturation phase and ultimately remodeling. This model may be instrumental for the development of new wound therapeutics.","Panayi, Adriana C; Endo, Yori; Karvar, Mehran; Sensharma, Prerana; Haug, Valentin; Fu, Siqi; Mi, Bobin; An, Yang; Orgill, Dennis P",,717,21

Vascular endothelial dysfunction has been suggested as a common feature of high-risk patients prone to severe COVID-19, and measurement of vascular endothelial function may be recommended for predicting severe conditions in high-risk patients with COVID-19. However, fragmented vascular endothelial glycocalyx (VEGLX) is elevated in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that it may be useful as a prognostic indicator. Although the relationship between VEGLX and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections has not been well studied, some investigations into COVID-19 have clarified the relationship between VEGLX and the mechanism that leads to severe conditions. Clarifying the usefulness of VEGLX assessment as a predictive indicator of the development of severe complications is important as a strategy for confronting pandemics caused by new viruses with a high affinity for the vascular endothelium that may recur in the future.","Yamaoka-Tojo, Minako",Int. j. mol. sci.

DESIGN: Rapid clinical ethnography of patient-provider encounters during an initial pandemic 'surge' conducted by a team of clinician-researchers using a structured protocol for qualitative data collection and analysis. SETTING: Level 1 trauma centre at Harborview Hospital in Seattle Washington in April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Frontline clinical providers serving as participant observers during performance of their clinical duties recorded observations and summaries of conversations with other providers and patients. RESULTS: We identified four different kinds of impacts: procedural, provider, patient and overall. Each impact highlighted two or more levels of a socioecological model of services delivery: (1) the epidemiology of COVID-19, (2) outer setting, (3) inner or organisational setting and (4) individual patient and provider. Despite significant changes in procedures that included COVID-19 screening of all admitted patients, social distancing and use of personal protective equipment, as well as changes in patient and provider behaviour, the overall impact of the pandemic on the emergency department and acute care service delivery was minimal. This is attributed to having a smaller surge than expected, a quick response by the healthcare system to anticipated demands for service delivery and protection of patients and providers, adequate supplies and high provider morale. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited to one setting in one healthcare system in one community, the findings offer some important lessons for healthcare systems that have yet to be impacted as well as systems that have been more severely impacted. Each of the socioecological framework levels was found to impact service delivery to patients, and variations at each of these levels account for variations in that quality of care globally.","Palinkas, Lawrence A; Whiteside, Lauren; Nehra, Deepika; Engstrom, Allison; Taylor, Mark; Moloney, Kathleen; Zatzick, Douglas F",BMJ Open,717,20

Because of high exposure, HCWs are at an increased risk of contracting the disease. AIMS: This study aims to assess the level of precautionary measures, both at home and the workplace, amongst medical doctors who were on duty during the national lockdown in Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 23 and May 1, 2020, utilising a self-administered web-based questionnaire to examine a sample of medical doctors (n = 270) working at different healthcare institutions in Jordan. Likert scale was used to code the data and generate means and percentages. RESULTS: The most practiced on-duty precautionary measures were cleaning hands with water and disinfectant for more than 20 seconds (47.4%), followed by proper hygiene before and during meals (38.9%). The most practiced off-duty measures were taking off clothes before entering the residential place (65.9%) and prohibiting visitors (58.1%). Overall, the mean work protection percentage score was 73.8% (range: 28%-100%), while the mean home safety percentage score was 71.3% (range: 25%-100%). Work protection score was positively correlated with the home safety score. Female doctors were found to be more precautious at home than males. Doctors with chronic illness(es) were found to be less precautious than their healthier counterparts. Participants who isolated themselves expressed the highest level of home safety practice. Doctors who reported to smoke were found more precautious at home and doctors who preferred to work during lockdowns were more precautious at the workplace. CONCLUSION: The level of precautionary behaviour of medical doctors in Jordan was not optimal. More attention and efforts are needed to enhance the adherence of doctors to precautionary guidance.

In order to predict the effect of the local epidemic on hospital capacity in England, we used a variety of data streams to inform the construction and parameterisation of a hospital progression model, which was coupled to a model of the generalised epidemic. We named this model EpiBeds. Data from a partially complete patient-pathway line-list was used to provide initial estimates of the mean duration that individuals spend in the different hospital compartments. We then fitted EpiBeds using complete data on hospital occupancy and hospital deaths, enabling estimation of the proportion of individuals that follow different clinical pathways, and the reproduction number of the generalised epidemic. The construction of EpiBeds makes it straightforward to adapt to different patient pathways and settings beyond England. As part of the UK response to the pandemic, EpiBeds has provided weekly forecasts to the NHS for hospital bed occupancy and admissions in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.","Overton, Christopher E.; Pellis, Lorenzo; Stage, Helena B.; Scarabel, Francesca; Burton, Joshua; Fraser, Christophe; Hall, Ian; House, Thomas A.; Jewell, Chris; Nurtay, Anel; Pagani, Filippo; Lythgoe, Katrina A.",,717,16

We use a unique panel survey of a representative sample households in Addis Ababa to study both food security and food consumption during the pandemic. In contrast to some other countries in the region, Ethiopia never went into a full lockdown severely restricting movement. Despite subjective income measures suggesting a large proportion of households have been exposed to job loss or reduced incomes, we find that relative to a survey conducted in August and September of 2019, food consumption and household dietary diversity are largely unchanged or slightly increased by August 2020. We find some changes in the composition of food consumption, but they are not related to shocks found in previous phone surveys conducted with the same households. The results therefore suggest the types of subjective questions about income typically being asked in COVID-19 phone surveys may not appropriately reflect the magnitude of such shocks. They also imply, at least indirectly, that in the aggregate food value chains have been resilient to the shock associated with the pandemic.","Hirvonen, Kalle; de Brauw, Alan; Abate, Gashaw T",American journal of agricultural economics,717,1

BACKGROUND: Survivorship of critical illness has been identified as a challenge for the 21st Century. Whilst the use of the term 'survivorship' is now common in critical care, it has been borrowed from the cancer literature where the discourse on what survivorship means in a cancer context is ongoing and remains largely descriptive. In the absence of a theoretical understanding, the term 'survivorship' is often used in critical illness in a generic way, limiting our understanding of what survivorship is. The current COVID-19 pandemic adds to an urgency of understanding what intensive care unit (ICU) survivorship might mean, given the emerging long-term consequences of this patient cohort. We set out to explore how survivorship after critical illness is being conceptualised and what the implications might be for clinical practice and research. DESIGN: Integrated systematic literature review. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. PRISMA guidelines were followed and a PRISMA checklist for reporting systematic reviews completed. RESULTS: The three main themes around which the reviewed studies were organised are: (a) healthcare system; (b) ICU survivors' families; and (c) ICU survivor's identity. These three themes feed into an overarching core theme of 'ICU Survivorship Experiences'. These themes map our current knowledge of what happens when a patient survives a critical illness and where we are in understanding ICU survivorship. CONCLUSION: We mapped in this systematic review the different pieces of the jigsaw that emerge following critical illness to understand and see the bigger picture of what happens after patients survive critical illness. It is evident that existing research has mapped these connections, but what we have not managed to do yet is defining what survivorship is theoretically. We offer a preliminary definition of survivorship as a process but are aware that this definition needs to be developed further with patients and families.","Kean, Susanne; Donaghy, Eddie; Bancroft, Angus; Clegg, Gareth; Rodgers, Sheila",J. clin. nurs,717,5

The objective of this paper is to evaluate at the ecological level if a large area (Red Zone) of the Veneto Region, where residents were exposed for decades to drinking water contaminated by PFAS, showed higher mortality for COVID-19 than the rest of the region. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian ecological regression model with spatially and not spatially structured random components on COVID-19 mortality at the municipality level (period between 21 February and 15 April 2020). The model included education score, background all-cause mortality (for the years 2015-2019), and an indicator for the Red Zone. The two random components are intended to adjust for potential hidden confounders. RESULTS: The COVID-19 crude mortality rate ratio for the Red Zone was 1.55 (90% Confidence Interval 1.25; 1.92).

However, these changes hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnoses. We constructed a machine learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis that was based and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5333 patients with various bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected the operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and a specificity of 97.9%. The cross-validated AUC was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID-19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were: MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. t-SNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with a severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of a bacterial than a viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis.

MEASURES: This project compared outcomes between hospice reauthorization visits conducted via telehealth and in person. After each visit, providers, patients, and caregivers completed telehealth acceptance surveys, and providers recorded reauthorization recommendations. INTERVENTION: Providers conducted 88 concurrent in-person and telehealth visits between June and November 2019. OUTCOMES: No statistically significant differences in reauthorization recommendations were found between telehealth and in-person visits. Satisfaction with telehealth was high; 88% of patients/caregivers and 78% of providers found telehealth services as effective as in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS/LESSONS LEARNED: Results indicate that telehealth can successfully support clinical decision making for hospice reauthorization. These findings show telehealth to be reliable and acceptable for certain types of hospice care even before COVID-19, which emphasizes its importance both during and after the current public health emergency.","Moore, Susan L; Portz, Jennifer D; Santodomingo, Melodie; Elsbernd, Kira; McHale, Michael; Massone, John",J Pain Symptom Manage,717,10

Furthermore, peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine production assays and whole blood flow cytometry were performed. Results confirm a hyperinflammatory innate immune state, while highlighting hepatocyte growth factor and stem cell factor as potential biomarkers for disease severity. Clustering analysis reveals no specific inflammatory endotypes in COVID-19 patients. Functional assays reveal abrogated adaptive cytokine production (interferon-gamma, interleukin-17 and interleukin-22) and prominent T cell exhaustion in critically ill patients, whereas innate immune responses were intact or hyperresponsive.

In the model, nodes correspond to locations or communities that are connected by links indicating travel and commuting between different locations. While this proposed modelling framework can be applied on all levels of spatial granularity and different countries, we consider Ireland as a case study. The network comprises 3440 electoral divisions (EDs) of the Republic of Ireland and 890 superoutput areas (SOAs) for Northern Ireland, which corresponds to local administrative units below the NUTS 3 regions. The local dynamics within each node follows a phenomenological SIRX compartmental model including classes of Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered and Quarantined (X) inspired from Science 368, 742 (2020). For better comparison to empirical data, we extended that model by a class of Deaths. We consider various scenarios including the 5-phase roadmap for Ireland. In addition, as proof of concept, we investigate the effect of dynamic interventions that aim to keep the number of infected below a given threshold. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting containment measures on a national scale, which could also be implemented at a regional (county) or local (ED/SOA) level. We find that - in principle - dynamic interventions are capable to limit the impact of future waves of outbreaks, but on the downside, in the absence of a vaccine, such a strategy can last several years until herd immunity is reached.","Humphries, Rory; Spillane, Mary; Mulchrone, Kieran; Wieczorek, Sebastian; O039,; Riordain, Micheal; Hövel, Philipp",,717,16

However, the effects of sleep quality during hospitalization for COVID-19 remain unclear. This retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted to investigate the effects of sleep quality on recovery from lymphopenia and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the West District of Wuhan Union Hospital between January 25 and March 15, 2020. The Richards-Campbell sleep questionnaire (RCSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess sleep quality. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected from electronic medical records and compared between the good-sleep group and poor-sleep group. In all, 135 patients (60 in good-sleep group and 75 in poor-sleep group) were included in this study. There were no significant between-group differences regarding demographic and baseline characteristics, as well as laboratory parameters upon admission and in-hospital treatment. Compared with patients in the good-sleep group, patients in the poor-sleep group had lower absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (day 14: median, 1.10 vs 1.32, P = 0.0055; day 21: median, 1.18 vs 1.48, P = 0.0034) and its reduced recovery rate (day 14: median, 56.91 vs 69.40, P = 0.0255; day 21: median, 61.40 vs 111.47, P = 0.0003), as well as increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; day 14: median, 3.17 vs 2.44, P = 0.0284; day 21: median, 2.73 vs 2.23, P = 0.0092) and its associated deterioration rate (day 14: median, -39.65 vs -61.09, P = 0.0155; day 21: median, -51.40% vs -75.43, P = 0.0003). Nine [12.0%] patients in the poor-sleep group required ICU care (P = 0.0151); meanwhile, none of the patients in good-sleep group required ICU care. Patients in the poor-sleep group had increased duration of hospital stay (33.0 [23.0-47.0] days vs 25.0 [20.5-36.5] days, P = 0.0116) compared to those in the good-sleep group. An increased incidence of hospital-acquired infection (seven [9.3%] vs one [1.7%]) was observed in the poor-sleep group compared to the good-sleep group; however, this difference was not significant (P = 0.1316). In conclusion, poor sleep quality during hospitalization in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia is associated with a slow recovery from lymphopenia and an increased need for ICU care.","Zhang, Jiancheng; Xu, Dan; Xie, Bing; Zhang, Yujing; Huang, Haiyan; Liu, Hongmei; Chen, Huaqi; Sun, Yongbo; Shang, You; Hashimoto, Kenji; Yuan, Shiying",Brain Behav Immun,717,23

The main features of our model are that we focus on wealth growth and disregard exchange, and that the rate of return on wealth is increasing with wealth. The linear case with wealth-independent return rate has been well studied, leading to a log-normal wealth distribution in the long time limit which is essentially independent of initial conditions. We find through theoretical analysis and simulations that the non-linearity in our model leads to more realistic power-law tails, and can explain an apparent two-tailed structure in the empirical wealth distribution of the UK and other countries. Other realistic features of our model include an increase in inequality over time, and a stronger dependence on initial conditions compared to linear models.","Forbes, Samuel; Grosskinsky, Stefan",,717,12

Methods: This was a retrospective study with a study period from January 1, 2020 to April 14, 2020. We included the patients transported by ambulance for acute diseases and traffic accidents in Osaka City. The main outcome of this study was the difficulty in hospital acceptance. We calculated the rate of difficulty of hospital acceptance for each month for acute diseases and traffic accidents. Results: Between January 1 to April 14, 2020, 36,981 patients were transported to hospitals by ambulance for acute diseases and 3096 patients for traffic accidents. There was no difference in the proportion of the difficulty in hospital acceptance due to traffic accidents between 2019 and 2020, but there was an increase in the proportion of the difficulty in hospital acceptance due to acute disease after the 13th week (March 25-March 31) of 2020 compared to that of 2019.

I served for 28 years as Head of the Psychosomatic and Psychotherapeutic unit as part of the Division for General Pediatrics, which was imbedded in the Department for Pediatrics. In these years I learned to focus on the triangle between doctor, parents, and child: To observe and recognize the verbal and non-verbal expressions of the children, the parents, and also his own is one of the doctor's key tasks. Within this process of acting and treating, practising medicine should become part of a commonly lived experience. This requires sensitivity as well as self-criticism and respect for the families, who entrust themselves to us. We have been able to implement this with children who suffer from eating disorders or tube dependency. As a continuation of the long-standing activity at the Medical University of Graz the spin-off firm Notube.com is presented, which offers treatment for children from 0 to 8 years of age suffering from eating disorders of all kinds. The experience of psychosomatic understanding and treatment acquired at the clinic can thus-even after retirement-continue to benefit hundreds of families.

Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training the model in a single organization, which is most common weakness due to the privacy and security of raw data communication. To solve this challenging task, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning framework that provides collaborative data training solutions by coordinating multiple hospitals to train and share encrypted federated models without leakage of data privacy. The blockchain ledger technology provides the decentralization of federated learning model without any central server. The proposed homomorphic encryption scheme encrypts and decrypts the gradients of model to preserve the privacy. More precisely, the proposed framework: i) train the local model by a novel capsule network to segmentation and classify COVID-19 images, ii) then use the homomorphic encryption scheme to secure the local model that encrypts and decrypts the gradients, and finally the model is shared over a decentralized platform through proposed blockchain-based federated learning algorithm. The integration of blockchain and federated learning leads to a new paradigm for medical image data sharing in the decentralized network.

Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is supposed to be associated with an increased infection risk which could trigger an adrenal crisis. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 symptoms and complications in AI patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a retrospective case-control study. All patients were on active follow-up and lived in Lombardy, one of the most affected areas. PATIENTS: We enrolled 279 patients with primary and secondary AI and 112 controls (patients with benign pituitary lesions without hormonal alterations). All AI patients had been previously trained to modify their replacement therapy on stress doses. INTERVENTION: By administering a standardized questionnaire by phone, we collected data on COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and consequences. RESULTS: In February-April 2020, the prevalence of symptomatic patients (complaining at least one symptom of viral infection) was similar between the two groups (24% in AI and 22.3% in controls, p 0.79). Highly suggestive COVID-19 symptoms (at least two including fever and/or cough) also occurred equally in AI and controls (12.5% in both groups). No patient required hospitalization and no adrenal crisis was reported. Few nasopharyngeal swabs were performed (n=12) as indicated by sanitary regulations, limiting conclusions on the exact infection rate (two positive results in AI and none in controls, p 0.52).

AIM: In this paper, we describe a joint call for action to use and leverage evidence-based health informatics as the foundation for the COVID-19 response and public health interventions. Tangible examples are provided for how the working groups and special interest groups of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) are helping to build an evidence-based response to this crisis. METHODS: Leaders of working and special interest groups of the IMIA, a total of 26 groups, were contacted via e-mail to provide a summary of the scientific-based efforts taken to combat COVID-19 pandemic and participate in the discussion toward the creation of this manuscript. A total of 13 groups participated in this manuscript. RESULTS: Various efforts were exerted by members of IMIA including (1) developing evidence-based guidelines for the design and deployment of digital health solutions during COVID-19; (2) surveying clinical informaticians internationally about key digital solutions deployed to combat COVID-19 and the challenges faced when implementing and using them; and (3) offering necessary resources for clinicians about the use of digital tools in clinical practice, education, and research during COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Rigor and evidence need to be taken into consideration when designing, implementing, and using digital tools to combat COVID-19 to avoid delays and unforeseen negative consequences. It is paramount to employ a multidisciplinary approach for the development and implementation of digital health tools that have been rapidly deployed in response to the pandemic bearing in mind human factors, ethics, data privacy, and the diversity of context at the local, national, and international levels. The training and capacity building of front-line workers is crucial and must be linked to a clear strategy for evaluation of ongoing experiences.","Fernandez-Luque, Luis; Kushniruk, Andre W; Georgiou, Andrew; Basu, Arindam; Petersen, Carolyn; Ronquillo, Charlene; Paton, Chris; Nøhr, Christian; Kuziemsky, Craig E; Alhuwail, Dari; Skiba, Diane; Huesing, Elaine; Gabarron, Elia; Borycki, Elizabeth M; Magrabi, Farah; Denecke, Kerstin; Peute, Linda W P; Topaz, Max; Al-Shorbaji, Najeeb; Lacroix, Paulette; Marcilly, Romaric; Cornet, Ronald; Gogia, Shashi B; Kobayashi, Shinji; Iyengar, Sriram; Deserno, Thomas M; Mettler, Tobias; Vimarlund, Vivian; Zhu, Xinxin",Methods inf. med,717,24

Although men's leadership has been studied extensively, women were largely overlooked in leadership theory and research until the late 1990s. In the context of the global pandemic, the threat to equity in women's work has enormously intensified, resulting in women leaving or considering leaving the workforce at rates that greatly exceed men. Modest gains in women achieving top leadership positions are at risk of being erased, as women face intense increased pressure at work and home. Persistent barriers and inequities in women's advancement to senior leadership are now in the spotlight during these unprecedented times, heightening the urgency to examine the current state and future direction of women's leadership. There is no better time to invest in diversity, equity and inclusion in leadership by turning attention to theory, research, and individual and organizational practices to drive women's advancement and success. This contribution to the 50th anniversary special issue addresses emerging leadership theories, women's leadership aspirations, and importantly, barriers to women's advancement to senior leadership. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Schultheiss, D.

The harsh realities of personal fears and severe challenges to our mental health evoked by both the United States presidency of Donald Trump and the coronavirus pandemic are described initially. Then, a number of self-care practices that are consistent with the basic values of humanistic psychology and that we can undertake to help us meet these harsh realities are illustrated. Next, the author describes his own personal engagement and self-care in the world of progressive politics and humanistic psychology in the context of the Resisting Trump movement. The article concludes with the author suggesting that perhaps it may be worthwhile for politically like-minded others to also consider finding ways of merging their progressive politics with humanistic psychology in order to enhance their self-care through these turbulent times in the Trump/Coronavirus era.","Benjamin, Elliot",J.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective, single-center, SZ-NSTEMI trial (ChiCTR1900022366) is underway to investigate the relationship of TMAO with the severity and prognosis of coronary atherosclerosis in newly diagnosed NSTEMI patients who will undergo coronary angiography with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). The primary endpoint of the study will be assessed the association of TMAO with coronary atherosclerotic severity quantify by the number of diseased coronary arteries and SYNTAX score after the coronary angiography. The secondary endpoints will be identified the TMAO as a prognostic biomarker for the short (1 month) and long-term (12 months) major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) rate including myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, stroke, heart failure, all-cause rehospitalization, and all-cause mortality after the pPCI. The blood samples will be collected from each patient before the procedure to measure the TMAO by isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography. In conclusion, SZ-NSTEMI will be the first cohort that will be investigated the association of TMAO with the severity and prognosis of coronary atherosclerotic burden in NSTEMI patients, aiming to identify TMAO as a predictor and a prognostic biomarker.","Bin Waleed, Khalid; Lu, Yongkang; Liu, Qiang; Zeng, Fanfang; Tu, Hong; Wei, Yi; Xu, Shuai; Zhang, Zhiling; Rongfeng, Yang; Fan, Ailing; Altaf, Afrasyab; Chang, Junlei; Wang, Lili",Medicine (Baltimore),717,24

Major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA)-overexpressing NCI-H446 cell line was constructed, and the mRNA expression levels of 11 genes associated with chemotherapy sensitivity were determined. The results demonstrated that MICA was positively and significantly associated with PFS. Furthermore, MICA expression was 1.6 times higher in patients with prolonged PFS compared with the rapid chemoresistance group. ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) mRNA expression was associated with chemotherapy resistance and significantly downregulated in the cell line overexpressing MICA. Moreover, following addition of nicardipine (an ABCG2 inhibitor), chemotherapeutic sensitivity increased in the MICA-overexpressing cell line. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that MICA may enhance the chemosensitivity of patients with extensive small cell lung cancer by downregulating ABCG2.","Wu, Yufeng; Tang, Hong; Si, Ruirui; Xia, Suhua; Wang, Ruilin; Wang, Qiming",Oncol Lett,717,16

To analyze this relationship, we used secondary data from public organizations on the SDG panorama by city and conducted a moderated regression analysis. The sample was composed of 649 cities with a population exceeding 50 thousand inhabitants. The results show that the higher were the indicators used to measure SDGs, the lower was the number of cases and deaths from the disease. We have also proved that cities’ population density and their distance from the pandemic epicenter moderate this relationship, since a higher level of these moderation variables increases the impact of a lower level of SDGs 3 and 6 coverage in society on the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19. Thus, the efficient and effective investment to reach SDGs 3 and 6 is directly associated with cities’ ability to successfully deal with infectious diseases and the resulting number of deaths. As for its contribution, this research innovates by establishing a model for analyzing the impact of compliance with SDGs on cities’ performance in their fight against COVID-19, which may also suit other nations. © 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

This study aimed to evaluate the bactericidal effect of UVL-C irradiation against cariogenic oral bacteria (Streptococcus mutans) in single layers and colonies grown on solid surfaces. METHODS: Two different experiments were performed. In the first experiment, a single layer of Streptococcus mutans bacteria on agar plates was exposed to UVL-C irradiation at energies from 0 to 21 mWs/cm2. The second experiment was conducted to inhibit viability of bacterial colonies on solid surfaces. The samples were derived from saliva from a patient where bacteria were grown on plastic strips and then exposed to UVL-C. The highest energy was 1050 mWs/cm2. RESULTS: Exposure to 21 mWs/cm2 was bactericidal in single layers of Streptococcus mutans. The result for bacterial colonies on solid surfaces indicated only a bacteriostatic effect, even at energies of 1050 mWs/cm2. CONCLUSIONS: Ultraviolet light C exhibits bactericidal effects on single layers of Streptococcus mutans but has a limited effect on bacterial colonies in a biofilm.

This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients at a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared between severe and non-severe patients. Immune response phenotyping based on the late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratified patients into different disease severities and outcomes. Results: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those with low IgG levels (51.8 vs. 32.3%; p = 0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlophenotype were 72.3, 48.5, 33.3, and 15.6%, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlohad higher inflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlophenotype (p &lt; 0.05). Recovery rates for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlophenotype were 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p = 0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhiand NLRhiIgGlophenotypes. Conclusions: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on the late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.","Zhang, Bicheng; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Zhu, Chengliang; Song, Yuxiao; Feng, Fan; Qiu, Yanru; Feng, Jia; Jia, Qingzhu; Song, Qibin; Zhu, Bo; Wang, Jun",Front.

METHODS: We examined the associations of haloperidol use with intubation or death and time to discharge home among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. In the primary analyses, we compared these two outcomes between patients receiving and not receiving haloperidol using univariate Cox regression models in matched analytic samples based on patient characteristics and other psychotropic medications. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score analyses with inverse probability weighting and multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: Of 15,121 adult inpatients with a positive COVID-19 PT-PCR test, 39 patients (0.03%) received haloperidol within the first 48 hours of admission. Over a mean follow-up of 13.8 days (SD = 17.9), 2,024 patients (13.4%) had a primary end-point event and 10,179 patients (77.6%) were discharged home at the time of study end on May 1st. The primary endpoint occurred in 9 patients (23.1%) who received haloperidol and 2,015 patients (13.4%) who did not. The secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 16 patients (61.5%) who received haloperidol and 9,907 patients (85.8%) who did not. There were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.62, p = 0.531) and secondary (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.74 to 2.28, p = 0.355) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Findings from this multicenter observational study suggest that haloperidol use prescribed at a mean dose of 4.5 mg per day (SD = 5.2) for a mean duration of 8.4 days (SD = 7.2) may not be associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to discharge home, among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19.","Hoertel, Nicolas; Sánchez-Rico, Marina; Vernet, Raphaël; Jannot, Anne-Sophie; Neuraz, Antoine; Blanco, Carlos; Lemogne, Cédric; Airagnes, Guillaume; Paris, Nicolas; Daniel, Christel; Gramfort, Alexandre; Lemaitre, Guillaume; Bernaux, Mélodie; Bellamine, Ali; Beeker, Nathanaël; Limosin, Frédéric",PLoS One,717,30

This paper aims to synthesize and review all the literature regarding the topic in a systematic manner to eliminate the bias and provide an overall insight, while incorporating some statistical analysis to provide an interval estimate of these studies. This paper addressed the effect of the positive and negative impacts reported in the literature in two categories of AVs: partial automation and full automation. The positive impacts represented in AVs' possibility to reduce GHG emission can be attributed to some factors, including eco-driving, eco traffic signal, platooning, and less hunting for parking. The increase in vehicle mile travel (VMT) due to (i) modal shift to AVs by captive passengers, including elderly and disabled people and (ii) easier travel compared to other modes will contribute to raising the GHG emissions. The result shows that eco-driving and platooning have the most significant contribution to reducing GHG emissions by 35%. On the other side, easier travel and faster travel significantly contribute to the increase of GHG emissions by 41.24%. Study findings reveal that the positive emission changes may not be realized at a lower AV penetration rate, where the maximum emission reduction might take place within 60-80% of AV penetration into the network.","Massar, Moneim; Reza, Imran; Rahman, Syed Masiur; Abdullah, Sheikh Muhammad Habib; Jamal, Arshad; Al-Ismail, Fahad Saleh",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),717,29

The cost in terms of human lives lost is devastating on account of the high contagiousness and mortality rate of the virus. Millions of people have been infected, frequently requiring continuous assistance and monitoring. Smart healthcare technologies and Artificial Intelligence algorithms constitute promising solutions useful not only for the monitoring of patient care but also in order to support the early diagnosis, prevention and evaluation of Covid-19 in a faster and more accurate way. On the other hand, the necessity to realise reliable and precise smart healthcare solutions, able to acquire and process voice signals by means of appropriate Internet of Things devices in real-time, requires the identification of algorithms able to discriminate accurately between pathological and healthy subjects. In this paper, we explore and compare the performance of the main machine learning techniques in terms of their ability to correctly detect Covid-19 disorders through voice analysis. Several studies report, in fact, significant effects of this virus on voice production due to the considerable impairment of the respiratory apparatus. Vocal folds oscillations that are more asynchronous, asymmetrical and restricted are observed during phonation in Covid-19 patients. Voice sounds selected by the Coswara database, an available crowd-sourced database, have been e analysed and processed to evaluate the capacity of the main ML techniques to distinguish between healthy and pathological voices. All the analyses have been evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and Receiver Operating Characteristic area.

Since then, many countries have joined efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. A central task for governments is the rapid and effective identification of COVID-19 positive patients. While many molecular tests currently exist, not all hospitals have immediate access to these. However, CT scans, which are readily available at most hospitals, offer an additional method to diagnose COVID-19. As a result, hospitals lacking molecular tests can benefit from it as a way of mitigating said shortage. Furthermore, radiologists have come to achieve accuracy levels over 80% on identifying COVID-19 cases by CT scan image analysis. This paper adds to the existing literature a model based on ensemble methods and 2-stage transfer learning to detect COVID-19 cases based on CT scan images, relying on a simple architecture, yet complex enough model definition, to attain a competitive performance. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 86.70%, an F1 score of 85.86% and an AUC of 90.82%, proving capable of assisting radiologists with COVID-19 diagnosis.

METHODS: This study respectively enrolled a cohort of surgical patients who underwent surgery in 2018 (group I), 2019 (group II), and 2020 (group III) and a cohort of follow-up patients who had follow-up in 2017 (group A), 2018 (group B), and 2019 (group C) in 13 children hospitals. RESULTS: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 era, there was a significant decrease in total surgical volume and a change in case mix in terms of an increase in the proportion of emergency operations. Decrease in migration scale index was correlated to the decrease in both surgical volume (r = 0.64, P = .02) and outpatient visit volume (r = 0.61, P = .03). There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who had follow-up through the internet or phone in group C (26.4% vs 9.6% in group B and 8.9% in group A; P < .0001). There was no statistical difference in death or rehospitalization among the 3 follow-up groups (P = .49). There was higher parents' anxiety score (P < .0001) and more use of telemedicine (P = .004) in group C compared with groups A and B. CONCLUSIONS: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a considerable decrease in total surgical volume and a change of case mix, which seems to be related to the strict traffic ban. Follow-up through the online medical service appears to be an effective alternative to the conventional method.","Shi, Guocheng; Huang, Jihong; Pi, Mingan; Chen, Xinxin; Li, Xiaofeng; Ding, Yiqun; Zhang, Hao",J. thorac. cardiovasc. sur,717,20

Manual cleaning and disinfection measures do not always achieve sufficient removal of surface contamination. This increases the importance of automated solutions in the context of final disinfection of rooms in the hospital setting. Ozone is a highly effective disinfectant which, combined with high humidity, is an effective agent against respiratory viruses. Current devices allow continuous nebulization for high room humidity as well as ozone production without any consumables. AIM: In the following study, the effectiveness of a fully automatic room decontamination system based on ozone was tested against bacteriophage &#934;6 (phi 6) and bovine coronavirus L9, as surrogate viruses for the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: For this purpose, various surfaces (ceramic tile, stainless steel surface and furniture board) were soiled with the surrogate viruses and placed at two different levels in a gas-tight test room. After using the automatic decontamination device according to the manufacturer's instructions, the surrogate viruses were recovered from the surfaces and examined by quantitative cultures. Then, reduction factors were calculated. FINDINGS: The ozone-based room decontamination device achieved virucidal efficacy (reduction factor >4 log10) against both surrogate organisms regardless of the different surfaces and positions confirming a high activity under the used conditions. CONCLUSION: Ozone is highly active against SARS-CoV-2 surrogate organisms. Further investigations are necessary for a safe application and efficacy in practice as well as integration into routine processes.","Franke, G; Knobling, B; Brill, F H; Becker, B; Klupp, E M; Belmar Campos, C; Pfefferle, S; Lütgehetmann, M; Knobloch, J K",J Hosp Infect,717,3

According to Professor Vana Papaevangelou, Professor of Paediatrics at the University of Athens School of Medicine, children comprise only 2-6% of COVID-19 cases, worldwide, and they are not considered as super-spreaders of this infection. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through droplets, fomites, aerosol and fecal-oral route, while there is no strong evidence as yet, supporting transplacental transmission. Professor Papaevangelou highlights the epidemiological differences between seasonal influenza and COVID-19 and accepts that school closure had no direct impact since children are not the main transmitters of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, social distancing clearly limited the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, while quarantine seemed necessary during the first wave of this pandemic. She refers to antivirals, as well as other therapeutic agents able to diminish the immune response producing multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which is associated with increased mortality, and she notes that these agents were rarely used in children with COVID-19, while in most cases supportive treatment sufficed.

Given that the 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays an indispensable role in viral polyprotein processing, its successful inhibition halts viral replication and thus constrains virus spread. Therefore, developing an effective SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitor to treat COVID-19 is imperative. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method was used to assess the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro using intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptide substrates corresponding to the cleavage sequence of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Molecular modeling with GEMDOCK was used to simulate the molecular interactions between drugs and the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. This study revealed that the V(max) of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was about 2-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Interestingly, the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is slightly more efficient than that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Meanwhile, natural compounds PGG and EGCG showed remarkable inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro than against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. In molecular docking, PGG and EGCG strongly interacted with the substrate binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, forming hydrogen bonds with multiple residues, including the catalytic residues C145 and H41. The activities of PGG and EGCG against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro demonstrate their inhibition of viral protease activity and highlight their therapeutic potentials for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chiou, Wei-Chung; Chen, Jui-Chieh; Yun-Ti Chen; Yang, Jinn-Moon; Hwang, Lih-Hwa; Lyu, Yi-Shuan; Yang, Hsin-Yi; Huang, Cheng",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,717,20

Currently, no specific prophylactic and therapeutic treatment is available. No evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that a treatment may ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 exists with the only exception of preliminary evidence from remdesivir trials. Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB. Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses. These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation. Both retrospective analyses of data in electronic health records, as well as proof of concept studies in humans and large RCTs are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of iron chelating agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of COVID-19, probably as an adjunctive treatment.","Dalamaga, Maria; Karampela, Irene; Mantzoros, Christos S.",Metabolism,717,16

A significant correlation has been identified between the deficiency in vitamin D and the risk of developing ARDS. It has been suggested that if we can reduce or modify ARDS in COVID-19 patients, we may significantly reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and associated mortality rates. The increased mortality of dark-skinned people, who have a reduced UV absorption capacity, may be consistent with diminished vitamin D status. The factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, such as old age, ethnicity, obesity, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes, are all found to be linked with vitamin D deficiency. Based on this review and as a precautionary measure, it is suggested that the adoption of appropriate and safe solar exposure and vitamin D enriched foods and supplements should be considered to reduce the possible severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Safe sun exposure is deemed beneficial globally, specifically in low and middle-income countries, as there is no cost involved. It is also noted that improved solar exposure and vitamin D levels can reduce the impact of other diseases as well, thus assisting in maintaining general human well-being.","Abraham, Joji; Dowling, Kim; Florentine, Singarayer",Int J Environ Res Public Health,717,16

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, PMC PubMed Central, MEDLINE, WHO COVID-19 Database, Embase, Web-of-Science, COCHRANE LIBRARY, Emcare and Academic Search Premier (until June 30th2020). Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool the risk ratio and risk difference of individual studies. Risk of bias was appraised using the MINORS checklist. RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 743 unique titles of which 10 studies (all on tocilizumab) comprising 1358 patients were included. Nine out of ten studies were considered to be of high quality. Meta-analysis showed that the tocilizumab group had lower mortality than the control group.
