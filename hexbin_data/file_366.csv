2659,Emotional crisis in a naturalistic context: characterizing outpatient profiles and treatment effectiveness,2017-04-07,"BACKGROUND: Crisis happens daily yet its understanding is often limited, even in the field of psychiatry. Indeed, a challenge is to assess the potential for change of patients so as to offer appropriate therapeutic interventions and enhance treatment program efficacy. This naturalistic study aimed to identify the socio-demographical characteristics and clinical profiles at admission of patients referred to a specialized Crisis Intervention Center (CIC) and to examine the effectiveness of the intervention. METHOD: The sample was composed of 352 adult outpatients recruited among the referrals to the CIC. Assessment completed at admission and at discharge examined psychiatric symptoms, defense mechanisms, recovery styles and global functioning. The crisis intervention consisted in a psychodynamically oriented multimodal approach associated with medication. RESULTS: Regarding the clinical profiles at intake, patients were middle-aged (M = 38.56, SD = 10.91), with a higher proportion of women (62.22%). They were addressed to the CIC because they had attempted to commit suicide or had suicidal ideation or presented depressed mood related to interpersonal difficulties. No statistical differences were found between patients dropping out (n = 215) and those attending the crisis intervention (n = 137). Crisis intervention demonstrated a beneficial effect (p < 0.01) on almost all variables, with Effect Sizes (ES) ranging from small to large (0.12 < ES < 0.75; median = 0.49). However, the Reliable Change Index indicated that most of the issues fall into the undetermined category (range 41.46 to 96.35%; median = 66.20%). CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the profile of patients referred to the CIC and shows that more than half of the patients dropped out from the crisis intervention before completion. Our findings suggest that people presenting an emotional crisis benefit from crisis intervention. However, given methodological constraints, these results need to be considered with caution. Moreover, the clinical significance of the improvements is not confirmed. Thus, the effectiveness of crisis intervention in naturalistic context is not fully determined and should be more rigorously studied in future research.

4163,Global scientific trends on aflatoxin research during 1998–2017: a bibliometric and visualized study,2019-11-21,"BACKGROUND: Aflatoxins are fungal metabolites associated with contaminated food products. Intake of aflatoxin-contaminated food results in serious health hazards and even death. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the global scientific output of research of aflatoxin by using bibliometric techniques. METHODS: This bibliometric study was conducted using Scopus database and classified the retrieved publications were classified from different aspects, including the countries/region of focus, journals, authors, institutes, citations, and content analysis to discover any hot and emerging topics. In addition, the bibliometric analysis of the international collaborative network and hot research topics were generated by VOSviewer© software version 1.6.10. The publication period was restricted in the search for two decades (1998–2017). RESULTS: The search engine of the Scopus database found 9845 documents published in the field of aflatoxin. The USA is the top publishing source in the world (22.85%), followed by China (11.85%), India (9.32%), and Italy (5.25%). In earlier years, researchers focused on terms related to the topics of “sources and biosynthesis of aflatoxin”, “health effects by aflatoxin”, and “detoxification and treatment of aflatoxin”. However, in recent years, researchers pay more attention to the topic of detection and quantification of aflatoxin. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of research in global aflatoxin has substantially increased over the past two decades. The evaluation of the historical status and development trend in aflatoxin scientific research can guide future research, and ultimately provide the basis for improving management procedures for governmental decisions, healthcare, industries, and educational institutions.","Zyoud, Sa’ed H.",J Occup Med Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6873441/,366

13645,mGlu5 receptor availability in youth at risk for addictions: effects of vulnerability traits and cannabis use,2020-05-15,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has received extensive attention for its neuroprotective effect on the brain. This system comprises endocannabinoids, endocannabinoid receptors, and the corresponding ligands and proteins. The molecular players involved in their regulation and metabolism are potential therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric diseases including anxiety, depression and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The inhibitors of two endocannabinoid hydrolases, i.e., fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), have the capacity to increase the level of endocannabinoids indirectly, causing fewer side effects than those associated with direct supplementation of cannabinoids. Their antidepressant and anxiolytic mechanisms are considered to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and regulate synaptic and neural plasticity. In terms of AD/PD, treatment with FAAH/MAGL inhibitors leads to reduction in amyloid β-protein deposition and inhibition of the death of dopamine neurons, which are commonly accepted to underlie the pathogenesis of AD and PD, respectively. Inflammation as the cause of depression/anxiety and PD/AD is also the target of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors. In this review, we summarize the application and involvement of FAAH/MAGL inhibitors in related neurological diseases. Focus on the latest research progress using FAAH/MAGL inhibitors is expected to facilitate the development of novel approaches with therapeutic potential.","Ren, Si-yu; Wang, Zhen-zhen; Zhang, Yi; Chen, Nai-hong",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608191/,366

Using a classic coin-flip experiment, we first confirm that a substantial majority of Mechanical Turk workers both shirk and lie when reporting the number of heads flipped. We then demonstrate that lying can be reduced by first asking each worker to swear voluntarily on his or her honor to tell the truth in subsequent economic decisions. Even in this online, purely anonymous environment, the oath significantly reduced the percent of subjects telling “big” lies (by roughly 27%), but did not affect shirking. We also explore whether a truth-telling oath can be used as a screening device if implemented after decisions have been made. Conditional on flipping response, MTurk shirkers and workers who lied were significantly less likely to agree to an ex-post honesty oath. Our results suggest oaths may help elicit more truthful behavior, even in online crowd-sourced environments.","Jacquemet, Nicolas; James, Alexander G.; Luchini, Stéphane; Murphy, James J.; Shogren, Jason F.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7810327/,366

15954,Consultant-led triage of paediatric hospital referrals: a service evaluation,2021-02-22,"OBJECTIVES: Few children undergoing heart surgery are recruited to clinical trials and little is known about the views and attitudes of parents towards trials. This study explored parents’ perspectives on decision-making about their child’s participation in a clinical trial during their elective cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. SETTING: Single-centre substudy of a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial to investigate the effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning in children undergoing cardiac surgery. PARTICIPANTS: Parents of children approached to participate in the trial, both consenters and decliners. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone following discharge, digitally audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Of 46 patients approached for the trial, 24 consenting and 2 declining parents agreed to participate in an interview (21 mothers, 5 fathers). Parental decision-making about research was influenced by (1) potential risks or additional procedures; (2) personal benefit and altruism for the ‘cardiac community’; (3) information, preparation, timing and approach; and (4) trust in the clinical team and collaboration with researchers. All of these were placed within the context of their understanding of the trial and knowledge of research. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of children undergoing cardiac surgery attach value to clinical research and are supportive of clinical trials when there is no or minimal perceived additional risk. These findings enhance our understanding of the factors that influence parents’ decision-making and should be used to inform the design and conduct of future paediatric surgical trials.

17657,Use of cognitive event-related potentials in the management of psychiatric disorders: Towards an individual follow-up and multi-component clinical approach,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: Improving maternal health has been a primary goal of international health agencies for many years, with the aim of reducing maternal and child deaths and improving access to antenatal care (ANC) services, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Health interventions with these aims have received more attention from a clinical effectiveness perspective than for cost impact and economic efficiency. METHODS: We collected data on resource use and costs as part of a large, multi-country study assessing the use of routine antenatal screening ultrasound (US) with the aim of considering the implications for economic efficiency. We assessed typical antenatal outpatient and hospital-based (facility) care for pregnant women, in general, with selective complication-related data collection in women participating in a large maternal health registry and clinical trial in five LMICs. We estimated average costs from a facility/health system perspective for outpatient and inpatient services. We converted all country-level currency cost estimates to 2015 United States dollars (USD). We compared average costs across countries for ANC visits, deliveries, higher-risk pregnancies, and complications, and conducted sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Our study included sites in five countries representing different regions. Overall, the relative cost of individual ANC and delivery-related healthcare use was consistent among countries, generally corresponding to country-specific income levels. ANC outpatient visit cost estimates per patient among countries ranged from 15 to 30 USD, based on average counts for visits with and without US. Estimates for antenatal screening US visits were more costly than non-US visits. Costs associated with higher-risk pregnancies were influenced by rates of hospital delivery by cesarean section (mean per person delivery cost estimate range: 25–65 USD). CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial differences among countries in infrastructures and health system capacity, there were similarities in resource allocation, delivery location, and country-level challenges. Overall, there was no clear suggestion that adding antenatal screening US would result in either major cost savings or major cost increases. However, antenatal screening US would have higher training and maintenance costs. Given the lack of clinical effectiveness evidence and greater resource constraints of LMICs, it is unlikely that introducing antenatal screening US would be economically efficient in these settings--on the demand side (i.e., patients) or supply side (i.e., healthcare providers).

20699,Recommendations for the Use of the Veggie Meter® for Spectroscopy-Based Skin Carotenoid Measurements in the Research Setting,2021-07-29,"BACKGROUND: Medicines that are based on known molecules and are further developed to address healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvement for patients, healthcare professionals and/or payers are called value-added medicines (VAMs). The evaluation process of VAMs is heterogeneous across countries, and it has been primarily designed for originator pharmaceuticals with confirmatory evidence collected alongside pivotal clinical trials. There is a mismatch between evidence requirements by public decision-makers and evidence generated by manufacturers of VAMs. Our objective was to develop a core evaluation framework for VAMs. METHODS: Potential benefits offered by VAMs were collected through a systematic literature review and allocated to separate domains in an iterative process. The draft list of domains and their applicability were validated during two consecutive virtual workshops by health policy experts representing countries with different economic statuses, geographical and decision-making contexts. RESULTS: Based on 158 extracted studies, the final consensus on the evaluation framework resulted in 11 value domains in 5 main clusters, including unmet medical needs, health gain (measured by health care professionals), patient-reported outcomes, burden on households, and burden on the health care system. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework could reduce the heterogeneity in value assessment processes across countries and create incentives for manufacturers to invest in incremental innovation. However, some domains may not be equally relevant or accepted in all countries, therefore the core framework needs thorough adaptation in specific jurisdictions.

22148,COVID-19 and consent,2021-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest are life-threatening emergencies with high mortality rates. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (e-CPR) provide viable options for life sustaining measures when medical therapy fails. The purpose of this study is to determine the utilization and outcomes of VA ECMO and eCPR in patients that require emergent cardiac support at a single academic center. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of prospectively collected data was performed at an academic institution from January 1st, 2018 to June 30th, 2020. All consecutive patients who required VA ECMO were evaluated based on whether they underwent traditional VA ECMO or eCPR. The study variables include demographic data, duration on ECMO, length of stay, complications, and survival to discharge. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were placed on VA ECMO for cardiac support with 44.4% (40) of these patients undergoing eCPR secondary to cardiac arrest and emergent placement on ECMO. A majority of the patients were male (n = 64, 71.1%) and the mean age was 58.8 ± 15.8 years. 44.4% of patients were transferred from outside hospitals for a higher level of care and 37.8% of patients required another primary therapy such as an Impella or IABP. The most common complication experienced by patients was bleeding (n = 41, 45.6%), which occurred less often in eCPR (n = 29, 58% vs. n = 12, 30%). Other complications included infections (n = 11, 12.2%), limb ischemia (n = 13, 14.4%), acute kidney injury (n = 17, 18.9%), and cerebral vascular accident (n = 4, 4.4%). The length of stay was longer for patients on VA ECMO (32.1 ± 40.7 days vs. 17.7 ± 18.2 days). Mean time on ECMO was 8.1 ± 8.3 days. Survival to discharge was higher in VA ECMO patients (n = 23, 46% vs. n = 8, 20%). CONCLUSION: VA ECMO provided an effective rescue therapy in patients in acute cardiogenic shock with a survival greater than the expected ELSO guidelines of 40%. While the survival of eCPR was lower than expected, this may reflect the severity of patient’s condition and emphasizes the importance of careful patient selection and planning.","Vakil, Deep; Soto, Cassandra; D’Costa, Zoee; Volk, Lindsay; Kandasamy, Sivaveera; Iyer, Deepa; Ikegami, Hirohisa; Russo, Mark J.; Lee, Leonard Y.; Lemaire, Anthony",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502086/,366

Each step of the way, policymakers in China have strived to ensure that HIV-related policies were pragmatic, tailored to the Chinese context, aligned with international best practices, and based upon the best available information at the time. Although there have been a great many policy actions since HIV was first discovered on the mainland, a few key policies were foundational, had a major impact on the epidemic, and marked an important shift China’s HIV response, for example, the Blood Donation Law (1998), the first Five-Year Action Plan for the Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS (2001), and the “Four Frees and One Care” policy (2003). These and other key policies are highlighted here.

Besides conventional bronchoscopic biopsies, tiny CT-guided biopsies are also frequent. On the flip side, treating physicians require more and more information not only in terms of a definitive entity but also what therapy they are likely to respond. This puts immense pressure on the pathologists to be highly judicious in performing IHC markers to leave enough tissue for mutational analysis like EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and PD-L1. Among non-neoplastic lesions, ‘interstitial lung diseases’ are among the most demanding and challenging with subtle and overlapping features requiring quick revision of the subject. Pleural biopsies are also at times challenging. Mediastinal pathology is markedly diverse, and almost any kind of pathology may be seen in this region.

Contemporary reforms—consolidation, fiscal institutions, and shared services—when conducted competently may arrest some of the decline in financial sustainability. However, contemporary reforms will do nothing to redress disillusionment with what is supposed to be the system of government closest to the people. In this book I have proposed, instead, a raft of radical reforms based around our Comprehensive Theory of Local Government that seeks to correct the extant imbalance between human dignity and the common good, as well as directly combat rational ignorance. At the core of my ideas is a belief that citizens are competent to make important decisions regarding their own government and lives. Indeed, my own experience working with struggling communities suggests to me that the average citizen, when appropriately informed, is much better at making decisions than their ‘political leaders’. If we truly believe this and act on the courage of our convictions, then the reforms that I have outlined will mitigate the problems of local government. If however, we continue to both deny the competency and dignity of our citizens then we can indeed expect local government be ‘overwhelmed and crushed by almost infinite tasks and duties’ (Pius XI 1931, paragraph 78).

37593,"Prevalence and associated factors to rotavirus infection in children less than 5 years in Enugu State, Nigeria",2020-08-06,"ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVES: Thoracic trauma (TT) is the third most common cause of death after abdominal injury and head trauma in polytrauma patients. Its management is still a very challenging task. The purpose of this study was to analyse the risk factors affecting the outcome in a high-volume trauma centre and the efficacy of a specialised trauma team in level 1 trauma centres. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2012, data of all patients admitted to the accident and emergency (A&E) department were prospectively collected at the German Trauma Registry (GTR) and thereafter retrospectively analysed. Patients with chest trauma, an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 18 and an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) > 2 in more than one body region were included. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included patients presenting with thoracic trauma between January 2003 and December 2007. The results of this group were compared with the results of another group (group II) in a later 5-year period (Jan. 2008–Dec. 2012). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were 630 patients (56%) with thoracic trauma. A total of 540 patients (48%) had associated extrathoracic injuries. Group I consisted of 285 patients (197 male, mean age 46 years). Group II consisted of 345 patients (251 male, mean age 49 years). Overall 90-day mortality was 17% (n = 48) in group I vs. 9% (n = 31) in group II (p = 0.024). Complication rates were higher in group I (p = 0.019). Higher Injury Severity Scores (ISSs) and higher Abbreviated Injury Acale (AIS) scores in the thoracic region yielded a higher rate of mortality (p < 0.0001). Young patients (< 40 years) were frequently exposed to severe thoracic injury but showed lower mortality rates (p = 0.014). Patients with severe lung contusions (n = 94) (15%) had higher morbidity and mortality (p < 0.001). Twenty-three (8%) patients underwent emergency thoracotomy in group I vs. 14 patients (4%) in group II (p = 0.041). Organ replacement procedures were needed in 18% of patients in group I vs. 31% of patients in group II (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of severe lung contusion, a higher ISS and AIS(thoracic) score and advanced age are independent risk factors that are directly related to a higher mortality rate. Management of blunt chest trauma with corrective chest tube insertion, optimal pain control and chest physiotherapy results in good outcomes in the majority of patients. Optimal management with better survival rates is achievable in specialised centres with multidisciplinary teamwork and the presence of thoracic surgical experience.","Beshay, Morris; Mertzlufft, Fritz; Kottkamp, Hans Werner; Reymond, Marc; Schmid, Ralph Alexander; Branscheid, Detlev; Vordemvenne, Thomas",World J Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7393329/,366

41198,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19: Evidence from Six Large Cities,2020-10-24,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy has been recognized as an important barrier to timely vaccinations around the world, including in sub-Saharan Africa. In Tanzania, 1 in 4 children is not fully vaccinated. The objective of this mixed methods study was to describe and contextualize parental concerns towards vaccines in Tanzania. METHODS: Between 2016 and 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional survey (n = 134) and four focus group discussions (FGDs, n = 38) with mothers of children under 2 years of age residing in Mtwara region in Southern Tanzania. The survey and FGDs assessed vaccination knowledge and concerns and barriers to timely vaccinations. Vaccination information was obtained from government-issued vaccination cards. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional survey, 72% of mothers reported missed or delayed receipt of vaccines for their child. Although vaccine coverage was high, timeliness of vaccinations was lower and varied by vaccine. Rural mothers reported more vaccine-related concerns compared to urban mothers; literacy and access to information were identified as key drivers of the difference. Mothers participating in FGDs indicated high perceived risk of vaccine-preventable illnesses, but expressed concerns related to poor geographic accessibility, unreliability of services, and missed opportunities for vaccinations resulting from provider efforts to minimize vaccine wastage. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our cross-sectional survey indicate the presence of vaccination delays and maternal concerns related to childhood vaccines in Tanzania. In FGDs, mothers raised issues related to convenience more often than issues related to vaccine confidence or complacency. Further research is necessary to understand how these issues may contribute to the emergence and persistence of vaccine hesitancy and to identify effective mitigation strategies.","Vasudevan, Lavanya; Baumgartner, Joy Noel; Moses, Sara; Ngadaya, Esther; Mfinanga, Sayoki Godfrey; Ostermann, Jan",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7573867/,366

45653,Simultaneous hospital/primary care real time simulation during COVID-19 alert(),2021-02-11,"Coronavirus (Covid) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome infectious disease, spreads primarily between human beings during close contact, most often through the coughing, sneezing, and speaking small droplets. A retrospective surveillance research is conducted in India during 30th January–21st March 2020 to gain insight into Covid’s epidemiology and spatial distribution. Voronoi statistics is used to draw attention of the affected states from a series of polygons. Spatial patterns of disease clustering are analyzed using global spatial autocorrelation techniques. Local spatial autocorrelation has also been observed using statistical methods from Getis-Ord G(i)(*). The findings showed that disease clusters existed in the area of research. Most of the clusters are concentrated in the central and western states of India, while the north-eastern countries are still predominantly low-rate of clusters. This simulation technique helps public health professionals to identify risk areas for disease and take decisions in real time to control this viral disease.","Bhunia, Gouri Sankar; Roy, Santanu; Shit, Pravat Kumar",Spat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864803/,366

The article analyses displacement in India from the coronavirus outbreak of 2019 and claims that the group of internal migrants who were unable to return to their homes and stranded in various parts of the country because of the national lockdown exhibits the characteristics of disaster-driven IDPs, and should, therefore, be treated so. This analysis reveals three main aspects leading up to a practical recommendation: the inconsistencies in the current Indian legal response can be attributed to the group’s non-recognition as internally displaced; the acknowledgment of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 as the appropriate national law to extend such protection; with the recommendation to explicitly integrate such persons as internally displaced under the Disaster Management Act. The article’s wider contribution is towards developing the corpus of protection to persons displaced by disasters under disaster management laws of countries.","Rao, Malavika",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928663/,366

However, software development organizations have high levels of difficulty to implement best practices that address continuous improvement. This paper presents a path to follow to facilitate the work of continuous improvement in a software development organization and that seeks to implement best practices in the software requirements management process. The path is drawn from an analysis of software process improvement models and standards related to software development best practices, under a multimodel environment. The path is structured with a set of techniques, tools, activities, and outputs associated with identified best practices, to facilitate the implementation of improvements in the software requirements management process. Besides, the established path is proposed as an alternative to facilitate the process improvement using a multimodel environment, this way allows establishing balance and instances of collaboration among best practices independent of the model or standard to be implemented.","Gasca-Hurtado, Gloria Piedad; Muñoz, Mirna",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974962/,366
50877,82 Person-Centred Emergency Care Outcome Measurement For Older People Living with Frailty,2021-03-16,"In the spring of 2020, the COVID‐19 pandemic and related shutdowns had huge effects on unemployment. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, we describe the financial profiles of US families whose workers were most vulnerable to coronavirus‐related earnings losses in the spring of 2020, based on whether a particular worker was deemed “essential” and whether a worker's job could be conducted remotely. We use descriptive analytic techniques to examine how families' baseline financial situations would allow them to weather COVID‐shutdown‐related earnings losses. We find that families with non‐teleworkable workers who were most vulnerable to layoff also had both demographic and financial profiles that are associated with greater vulnerability to income shocks: non‐teleworkable families were more likely to be people of color and single wage‐earners, and also to have less savings. The median non‐teleworkable family, whether in non‐essential or essential occupations, held only 3 weeks of income in savings, underscoring the importance of policy measures to blunt the financial effects of the COVID crisis.","Helppie‐McFall, Brooke; Hsu, Joanne W.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7995037/,366

Three aspects of transparent communication are investigated, namely information substantiality, accountability and participation. Results of an online survey of American citizens show that during the early stage of COVID‐19, information substantiality by state governments and health institutes (e.g., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) increases publics' trust, which positively influences their perceived risks, behavioural control and subjective norms. The participation of health institutes, rather than state governments, significantly increases public trust, whereas accountability has no effects. Individuals' perceptions and attitudes towards social distancing predict their social distancing behaviour during the outbreak.

51933,P84 Optimising hand trauma care at a Major Trauma Centre (MTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) pandemic has provoked the global healthcare industry by potentially affecting more than 20 14 million people across the globe, causing lasting damage to the lungs, notably pneumonia, ARDS (acute respiratory distress 15 syndrome), and sepsis with the rapid spread of infection. To aid the functioning of the lungs and to maintain the blood oxygen 16 saturation (SpO(2)) in coronavirus patients, ventilator assistance is required. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The main purpose of this article is to outline the need 17 for the introduction of a non-invasive negative pressure ventilator (NINPV) as a promising alternative to positive pressure 18 ventilator (PPV) by elucidating the cons of non-invasive ventilators in clinical conditions like ARDS. Another motive is to 19 profoundly diminish the rate of infection spread by the employment of oxygen helmets, instead of endotracheal intubation in 20 invasive positive pressure ventilator (IPPV) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilator (NIPPV) like face masks and high-flow 21 nasal cannula (HFNC). RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The integration of oxygen helmet with NPV would result in a number of notable facets including the 22 degree of comfort delivered to patients who are exposed to various ventilator-induced lung injuries (VILI) in the forms of 23 atelectasis, barotrauma, etc. Likewise, preventing the aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) diminishes the rate of nosocomial 24 infections and providing a better environment to both the patients and the healthcare professionals.","Chandrasekaran, Kathiresan; Monikandan Shaji, Aadharsha",Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060160/,366

The major hosts for CoVs are birds and mammals. Although most CoVs inhabit their specific natural hosts, some may occasionally cross the host barrier to infect livestock and even people, causing a variety of diseases. Since the beginning of the new century, increasing attention has been given to research on CoVs due to the emergence of highly pathogenic and genetically diverse CoVs that have caused several epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. CoVs belong to the Coronaviridae family of the Nidovirales order. Recently, advanced techniques for viral detection and viral genome analyses have enabled characterization of many new nidoviruses than ever and have greatly expanded the Nidovirales order with new classification and nomenclature. Here, we first provide an overview of the latest research progress in the classification of the Nidovirales order and then introduce the host range, genetic variation, genomic pattern and pathogenic features of epidemic CoVs and other epidemic viruses. This information will promote understanding of the phylogenetic relationship and infectious transmission of various pathogenic nidoviruses, including epidemic CoVs, which will benefit virological research and viral disease control.","Zhou, Zhijian; Qiu, Ye; Ge, Xingyi",Animal Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8062217/,366

Previous studies remain controversial regarding whether metformin is associated with reduced risk for COVID-19 diabetic patients. Thus, this meta-analysis is performed. Method: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed and Web of Science was conducted to identify all relevant studies published prior to October 2020 according to the established inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis was reported in conformity to the Preferred Reporting Project declared by the Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). The quality assessment was performed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the association between metformin use and mortality for COVID-19 patients. A random-effect or fixed-effect model was used based on heterogeneity significance. Subgroup analysis was performed based on in-hospital-use or home-use, and different sample sizes. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias detection were also performed. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan software (version 5.3; Cochrane library) and STATA 12.0 statistical software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX), and all P values were two-tailed, the test level was 0.05. Result: 97 articles were obtained from the database search, and 5 articles obtained from other sources. 8 articles involving 11,169 participants were included. Most studies were considered moderate quality. A statistically significant association between metformin use and decreased mortality of COVID-19 patients was found (OR 0.53, 95%CI: 0.34, 0.83, P=0.005, I(2)=77%). In the subgroup analyses, home-use of metformin was also associated with a reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.54, 95%CI: 0.35, 0.84, P=0.006, I(2)=66%), and one study reporting in-hospital use did not find reduced mortality among COVID-19 patients taking metformin (OR 1.65, 95%CI: 0.71, 3.86, P=0.247). For sample size >1,000, no statistically significant reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.84, 95%CI: 0.57, 1.26, P=0.41, I(2)=73%) was found, however, for sample ≤1,000, a statistically significant reduced risk of mortality (OR 0.29, 95%CI: 0.19, 0.44 P<0.00001, I(2)=0%) was found. Sensitivity analysis by change fixed-effect models to random-effect models and by omitting each study at a time confirmed the relative stability of the result. Begg’s test (z=0.37, P=0.711) and Egger’s test (t=-1.98, P=0.096) did not detect a significant risk of publication bias. Conclusion: The current meta-analysis demonstrates that metformin use is associated with decreased mortality for COVID-19 diabetic patients. However, only one study investigating the in-hospital use of metformin. More high-quality original studies are needed to further explore the association between metformin use and mortality risk of COVID-19.","Sun, Chenyu; Cheng, Ce; Kim, Keun Young; Ahmed, Mubashir Ayaz; Manem, Reveena",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135439/,366
53314,141 The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Disproportionate Impact on Pregnant Surgical Trainees?,2021-05-04,"Background: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) classically occurs in the lymph nodes and only in about 5% of cases occurs in extra-nodal sites. Primary thyroid lymphomas, most of which are non-Hodgkin lymphomas, comprise less than 5% of all thyroid malignancies. Only a few cases of HL of the thyroid have been reported in the literature, and in most of these cases, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was unreliable for diagnosis. We present a case of classical Hodgkin lymphoma of the thyroid that was falsely negative from both FNAB and core needle biopsy specimens and was diagnosed after surgery. Clinical Case: A 51-year-old female was seen for a rapidly enlarging neck mass associated with progressive dyspnea and dysphagia. Despite being a telemedicine visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, significant enlargement and deformity of the neck were startling. The patient was clinically and biochemically euthyroid with a TSH of 2.49 mIU/L (0.5-5.0 mIU/L) and normal FT4. She denied a personal or family history of thyroid disease and neck irradiation. Thyroid ultrasound revealed a 5.3 cm hypoechoic, wider than tall nodule with smooth margins in the left lobe, and a 1.9 cm hypoechoic and taller than wide nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid. A CT scan of the neck also revealed a 1.2 cm lymph node in the left lateral aspect of the thyroid. FNAB of the nodules showed Hurthle cells in a background of crushed lymphocytes with occasional large atypical lymphoid cells. Flow cytometry performed on a repeat FNAB specimen revealed no evidence of lymphoma. A repeat CT scan of the neck performed 2 weeks later due to worsening symptoms demonstrated middle mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a large 8x4.7x4.7 cm mass contiguous with the thyroid with a 3.8 cm cystic collection within. The patient was scheduled for an oncology consultation due to the high likelihood of lymphoma but was admitted to another institution with symptoms. She underwent a thyroid core biopsy and flow cytometry, which again failed to reveal her diagnosis. She then underwent left partial thyroidectomy, and pathology demonstrated infiltrates of small lymphocytes with histiocytes, interspersed with clusters of large, irregular, multilobate cells consistent with Reed-Sternberg cells. She was diagnosed with nodular sclerosing variant of classical HL. Chemotherapy was instituted with rapid improvement in symptoms. Clinical Lesson: Primary HL of the thyroid is extremely rare and most often presents as a rapidly enlarging neck mass with or without compressive symptoms. Diagnosis with FNAB is challenging and can be misinterpreted as lymphocytic thyroiditis. In our patient, flow cytometry was performed twice and was falsely negative. The treatment of HL differs entirely from that of other primary thyroid cancers and thyroiditis. Hence, in patients presenting with classic symptoms, a high index of suspicion is needed to make an accurate and prompt diagnosis of HL.","Chandran, Chandriya; Prater, Janna; Mayrin, Jane Valerie; Young, Nancy A; Lytle, Andrew; Bhattacharyya, Siddharth",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135562/,366
53325,266 Mini C-Arm Use in The Emergency Department for Fracture Management During The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Study in A Tertiary Paediatric Referral Centre,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims The digital healthcare revolution provides the opportunity for clinicians and researchers to collect useful data on a frequent and remote basis. Work ability is impacted by many rheumatic diseases, including the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), however, methods to assess the real-time impacts are limited. This study aims to explore the impact of IIM flares and symptoms upon employment using frequently collected data via a smartphone-based app. Methods The Myositis Physical Activity Device Study recruited a UK-based adult IIM cohort who completed weekly employment and flare questions via a specially designed smartphone-based app throughout a 91 day period in 2019/20. Employment-related questions were assessed every week (see Table 1 for details). Flares were reported via a weekly question. Employment variables were compared between flare and non-flare weeks using descriptive statistics. The relationship between flares and work productivity was assessed using multi-level mixed effects logistic regression modelling, adjusted for age and sex. Results Data on 13 (69% female) employed participants was analysed. A median of 5 flares were reported per patient during the three month period (IQR 3, 9). Summary employment results are displayed in Table 1. Participants reported greater impact of IIM upon employment, lower productivity and fewer hours worked during a flare week, compared to a non-flare week. There was a significant association between flares and detrimental impact upon work productivity (odds ratio [OR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03, 1.12, p < 0.01). Flares were also significantly associated with an increased number of work hours missed due to IIM (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01, 1.08, p = 0.02) Conclusion Our study has demonstrated that IIM flares are significantly associated with detrimental impact upon employment ability. On average, patients lost 15 hours of work a week during a flare compared to less than 2 hours outside a flare. The economic and personal impact of flares highlights the need for research in this area, with the aim of allowing early identification and instigation of treatment and possible need for supported work. Smartphone based remote monitoring of flares and other pertinent variables could enhance digital consultations, which may become more common in the post COVID-19 setting. Disclosure J.C.

Limited evidence exists on the effectiveness of removable soft casts in adults with DRFs. We assessed patient reported functional outcomes and experiences of adults with DRFs managed non-operatively in a removable soft cast during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed adults with DRFs, treated with a removable soft cast for 6 weeks between 9(th) April 2020 and 18(th) May 2020. Functional scores - Disabilities of the Arms, Shoulders and Hands (DASH) and a 7-question Patient Reported Experience Questionnaire (PREQ) were conducted at 6 weeks, along with a record of complications. A DASH score of < 25 was deemed a satisfactory functional score. RESULTS: 34 patients formed our cohort, with a 65% (22patients) completion rate, mean age of 69years. 82% had a DASH score < 25 and 18% had a DASH score > 25 at 6 weeks. 86% reported satisfactory comfort in the PREQ with 14% reporting discomfort.

Physical restrictions have highlighted the potential use of remote online platforms to deliver teaching. We aimed to create and deliver a free educational series for Junior Doctors, delivered by Orthopaedic Registrars and Consultants through an interactive online platform. METHOD: Teaching material, learning aims, and advertisement tools including mailing lists were developed. Advertisement was arranged on national scale via the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) and the British Orthopaedic Trainees Association (BOTA). Six sessions were delivered via the ‘Blackboard Collaborate’ platform. RESULTS: Six sessions were held over six weeks with 546 total attendees, averaging 92 per session. Foundation Doctors and Medical Students accounted for 39.7% and 54.0% of attendees respectively. Attendees were primarily from the UK (90.1%). Average attendee rating for ‘enjoyment of session’ and ‘relevance to education’ was 9.11/10 and 8.66/10 respectively. Of those surveyed, 100% of attendees reported they would recommend this series to a colleague. DISCUSSION: This lecture series was created in response to the restrictions on physical meetings and reduced teaching opportunities during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Budding fascism endeavors to transform India—founded as a secular state—into a Hindu nation in which there is little place for the ‘other.’ And in the USA, truculent exceptionalism readily acknowledges that coexistence with China is no longer possible in the long run.

In this study, we have attempted to explore the possibility of applying the ecological theory of individualism/collectivism in the context of social media. We, thus, examined provincial variations in the uniqueness of nicknames among more than 13 million Sina Weibo users. Initially, the nickname uniqueness indicator was set at the provincial level. It was found that the uniqueness of nicknames was the highest in provinces with temperate climates, for example Guangdong, and the lowest in provinces with demanding climate, such as Ningxia. Regression analysis results partially supported that inhabitants in provinces with temperate climate were more likely to use unique nicknames on social media compared to those from harsh climate.

54193,A - 01 Baseline Executive Functioning and Mood in Older Adults before a Remote Physical Exercise Training Program,2021-05-21,"OBJECTIVES: Food insecure individuals are at greater risk for nutrient insufficiency and subsequent increases in chronic disease risk. The Great Recession of 2007–2010 resulted in unprecedented increases in the proportion of US households that were food insecure. To date, little has been done to explore the impact of economic recession on dietary intake the population level. The goals of the present study were to assess changes in dietary behaviors and nutrient intake in a nationally representative sample of US residents in the years surrounding the Great Recession. METHODS: The present study includes data from 38,070 adults across five cycles of the NHANES (2005–2014) to explore the impact of economic downturn and recovery on dietary intake. Dietary data was collected using 24 hour-recall. Household food security status was provided in the NHANES dataset. For the purposes of the present analysis, the 2005–2006 cycle were considered “Pre-recession”, data from the 2007–2010 cycles were considered “Recession period”, and data from the 2011–2014 cycle were considered “Recession recovery period”. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate differences in mean usual intake of foods and nutrients in the years surrounding the Great Recession. Models were stratified by household food security status, and adjusted for energy, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, poverty: income ratio, and BMI. RESULTS: Unsurprisingly, the impact of economic downturn was found to disproportionately impact individuals living in food insecure households. During the Recession period, individuals living in food insecure households had lower intakes of protein, and dark green vegetables (P < 0.03), and significantly higher intakes of total sugars (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that the diets of individuals in food insecure households are disproportionately impacted by economic downturn. These findings have implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Using historical data to understand and anticipate potential nutrient needs and areas of concern may better help public health nutritionists serve communities faced with food insecurity.

A review of the literature revealed that studies reporting differences between the influence of supervisors and coworker justice and support on work engagement among police officers are grossly insufficient. This study hypothesized that organizational support and organizational justice would positively predict work engagement among police officers. It was also hypothesized that, among police officers, supervisor support is more strongly related to work engagement than coworker support and that supervisor justice is more strongly linked to work engagement than coworker justice. Participants were 170 police officers who worked in police departments in northern Poland. A regression analysis showed that supervisor support and supervisor justice had a positive effect on police officers’ work engagement, whereby organizational support coupled with organizational justice accounted for 26% of the variability of work engagement.

56914,Protocol for expansion of an existing national monthly survey of smoking behaviour and alcohol use in England to Scotland and Wales: The Smoking and Alcohol Toolkit Study,2021-03-29,"BACKGROUND: Since 2015, the German Prevention Act has obligated social security agencies to support prevention and health promotion in the university setting, particularly for students, through measures and structural development in terms of content and funding. The German Network for Health Promoting Universities took part in these processes and assessed the situation on the basis of 5 years of experience. The strategy paper based on this with the recommendations for action is presented in excerpts. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the article is to present the complex structures and developments in the context of the German Prevention Act and to show the requirements that have not yet been implemented at the interface between universities. The focus is on the implementation of the recommendations for action at the level of the federal states and the targeted addressing of the responsible actors, including universities and student unions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The recommendations for action of the “Health Promotion Strategy 2019–2022 for Universities” (as of January 2020) are updated from official statistics (university statistics, financial results of the statutory health insurance) and a literature and internet-based inventory. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the implementation of the German Prevention Act shows a number of previously unrealized requirements for the university settings. This includes the lack of cooperation between the social security agencies and the implementation of the jointly agreed fields of action (e.g., health literacy) for students.

Hence, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the association between MC and weight status according to age and gender across childhood and early adolescence in a large sample of Italian elementary and middle school students. A number of 1961 Italian school students (1,026 boys, 935 girls) was stratified in three consecutive age groups (6–7, 8–10, and 11–13 years) and four weight status categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese) according to Cole's body mass index (BMI) cut-off points for children. MC performance was assessed measuring motor quotient (MQ) with the Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder (KTK). Results showed significantly lower MQ levels in children in overweight (OW) and with obesity (OB) in both sexes for all age groups than peers in normal weight (NW), except in 6–7-year-old boys. Girls in OW and with OB had similar MQ levels across all age groups, while younger boys in OW and with OB showed higher MQ levels than older ones (p < 0.05). The 6–7-year-old boys showed better MQ levels than girls peers in NW, OW, and with OB, while 8–10-year-old boys in underweight (UW), NW, and OW; and 11–13-year-old boys only in NW (p < 0.05). No interaction effect was found between age, gender, and weight status on MQ levels. These outcomes showed the negative impact of higher weight status on MC performance according to age and gender, pointing out the importance of planning targeted motor programs that consider these variables to improve MC performance.","Battaglia, Giuseppe; Giustino, Valerio; Tabacchi, Garden; Lanza, Massimo; Schena, Federico; Biino, Valentina; Giuriato, Matteo; Gallotta, Maria Chiara; Guidetti, Laura; Baldari, Carlo; Gennaro, Antonino; Palma, Antonio; Bellafiore, Marianna",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8461257/,366

METHODS: A retrospective cohort was formed from patients who have previously been followed with a diagnosis of BD. Patients of this cohort were retrospectively evaluated for a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome – coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) polymerized chain reaction (PCR) test result. In PCR positive patients, demographics, comorbid diseases, active medical treatment for BD and information regarding hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, mortality were collected from medical records. PCR positive patients were reached via phone numbers and Behçet’s Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) scores for pre and post-COVID-19 BD symptoms were calculated. RESULTS: Out of a total 648 BD patients, 59 were detected to have a positive SARS-CoV 2 PCR test. 88.1% of these patients were under colchicine treatment and 28.8% of patients were under azathioprine treatment. 3 of the 59 patients (5.0%) were found to be hospitalized, none of them was admitted to the intensive care unit or died. An increasing trend in the frequency of comorbid diseases and older age was observed in hospitalized patients. 32.2% of BD patients suffered from exacerbation of at least one symptom related to BD when evaluated with BDCAF, arthralgia/arthritis being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: We observed no intensive care unit admission or mortality with COVID-19 in our BD patient cohort. A substantial number of patients suffered from exacerbation of BD symptoms.","Polat, Bünyamin; Erden, Abdulsamet; Güven, Serdar Can; Armağan, Berkan; Karakaş, Özlem; Özdemir, Bahar; Apaydın, Hakan; Usul, Eren; Ateş, İhsan; Küçükşahin, Orhan; Omma, Ahmet",Mod Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499890/,366

A pandemic is still present as of May 2020. In addition to causing pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 may induce a direct damage to the heart, causing myocarditis, with significant impairment of cardiac contractility, and/or pericarditis. Elderly patients and those with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, are at increased risk of heart complications from COVID-19. In this review, we focused on the correlation between COVID-19 infection and the high sensitivity troponin T and I, and their significance in the development of myocarditis. Data emerging from the studies so far conducted indicate that a high value of high-sensitivity troponin represents a negative prognostic indicator when associated with heart damage on an infectious-inflammatory basis (i.e. myopericarditis). We should identify a safe and clear diagnostic algorithm, possibly combining patient clinical history, troponin levels and cardiac ultrasound findings that could help us in the prediction of myopericarditis.","Piccioni, A; Brigida, M; Loria, V; Zanza, C; Longhitano, Y; Zaccaria, R; Racco, S; Gasbarrini, A; Ojetti, V; Franceschi, F; Candelli, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202010_23254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090441/,366

Here, European seabass acclimatized at 3, 6, 12, and 30 PSU were subjected to 20 days of an ambient extreme winter cold event (8 °C), and monitored for growth and physiological performance. Growth performance decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU compared to 6 and 12 PSU. During cold stress exposure, serum Na+, Cl-, and K+ concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in fish exposed at 30 PSU. Serum cortisol, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were increased significantly (p < 0.05) in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU. In contrast, opposite trends were observed for serum protein, lactate, and triglycerides content during cold exposure. Transaminase activities [glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl-transaminase (γGGT)] were significantly higher in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU on days 10 and 20. The abundance of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance (CFTR) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU during cold shock exposure. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) expression was significantly lower in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU. Whereas, on day 20, Na+/K+ ATPase α1 and Na+/K+/Cl- cotransporter-1 (NKCC1) were significantly upregulated in fish exposed at 30 PSU, followed by 12, 6, and 3 PSU.

Robotic surgeries have never been applied for pancreas transplantation in obese recipients though robotic kidney transplantation did and already proved its value in reducing wound-related complications in obese recipients. PATIENT CONCERNS & DIAGNOSES We performed the first robotic pancreas after kidney transplantation for a 34-year-old Hispanic type 1 diabetic male with class III obesity (BMI = 41 kg/m). INTERVENTIONS The pancreas graft was procured and benched in the standard fashion. Methylene blue was used to detect any vascular leaks. The operation was completed via two 12-mm ports (camera, laparoscopic bed-side assistance), two 8-mm ports for robotic arms, and a 7-cm epigastric incision for hand port. The portal vein and arterial Y-graft of the pancreas were anastomosed to the recipient's left external iliac vein and artery, respectively. Duodenum-bladder drainage was performed with a circular stapler. OUTCOMES Duration of warm and cold ischemia was: 45 minutes and 7 hours, respectively. The patient was discharged uneventfully without wound-related complications. Excellent metabolic control was achieved with hemoglobin A1c lowering from 9% before transplantation to 4.4% on day 120. The patient remained in nondiabetic status in 1-year follow-up.

I explore this process by reviewing a previously published model of how disruptive selection from competing functional demands defines an intermediate performance optimum for morphological systems that cannot simultaneously be optimized for all of the functional roles they must play. Because of the inherent tradeoffs in such a system, its optimal morphology in any particular environmental context will usually be intermediate between the performance peaks of the competing functions. The proportional contribution of each functional demand can be estimated by maximum likelihood from empirically observed morphologies, including complex ones measured with multivariate geometric morphometrics, using this model. The resulting tradeoff weight can be mapped onto a phylogenetic tree to study how the performance optimum has shifted across a functional landscape circumscribed by the function-specific performance peaks. This model of tradeoff evolution is sharply different from one in which a multipeak OU model is applied to a set of morphologies and a phylogenetic tree to estimate how many separate performance optima exist. The multi-peak OU approach assumes that each branch is pushed toward one of two or more performance peaks that exist simultaneously and are separated by valleys of poor performance, whereas the model discussed here assumes that each branch tracks a single optimal performance peak that wanders through morphospace as the balance of functional demands shifts. That the movements of this net performance peak emerge from changing frequencies of selection events from opposing functional demands is illustrated using a series of computational simulations. These simulations show how functional tradeoffs can carry evolution across putative performance valleys: even though intermediate morphologies may not perform optimally for any one function, they may represent the optimal solution in any environment in which an organism experiences competing functional demands.","Polly, P David",Integrative and comparative biology,https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icaa092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32592482/,366

There are circumstances when CMR would be indicated shortly following PCI, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The purpose of this study is to demonstrate CMR safety shortly following stent PCI in AMI patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of safety data in AMI patients with recently placed coronary artery stents enrolled in a multi-center phase II trial for gadoversetamide. Patients underwent 1.5 T CMR within 16 days of PCI. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) and ECGs were taken pre-CMR, 1, 2, and 24 h post-CMR. Any major adverse cardiac event (MACE) or other serious adverse events in the first 24 h after MRI were recorded. There were 258 stents in 211 AMI patients. The mean delay to CMR following PCI was 6.5 ± 4 days, with 62 patients (29 %) receiving CMR within 3 days and 132 patients (63 %) within 1 week. Patients showed no significant vital sign changes following CMR. Ten patients (4.7 %) showed mild, transient ECG changes. Within the 24-h follow-up group, 4 patients (1.9 %) had moderate to severe events, including chest pain (1) and elevated cardiac enzymes (1), resolving in 24 h; heart failure (1) and ischemic stroke (1). There were no deaths. This study demonstrates fewer MACE in AMI patients undergoing 1.5 T CMR within 16 days of stent placement in comparison to post-stent event rate reported in the literature.

66744,Forging Forward Together: Transforming Scientific Practice to Accelerate Scientific Progress.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Transsphenoidal tumor resection can lead to internal carotid artery (ICA) injury. Vascular disruption is often treated with emergent vessel deconstruction, incurring complications in a subset of patients with poor collateral circulation and resulting in minor and major ischemic strokes. METHODS We attempted a novel approach combining a covered stent graft (Jostent) and two flow diverter stents [Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs)] to treat active extravasation from a disrupted right ICA that was the result of a transsphenoidal surgery complication. This disruption occurred during clival tumor surgery and required immediate sphenoidal sinus packing. Emergent angiography revealed continued petrous carotid artery extravasation, warranting emergent vessel repair or deconstruction for treatment. To preserve the vessel, we utilized a covered Jostent. Due to tortuosity and lack of optimal wall apposition, there was reduced, yet persistent extravasation from an endoleak after Jostent deployment that failed to resolve despite multiple angioplasties. Therefore, we used PEDs to divert the flow. RESULTS Flow diversion relieved the extravasation. The patient remained neurologically intact post-procedure. CONCLUSIONS This case demonstrates successful combined use of a covered stent and flow diverters to treat acute vascular injury resulting from transsphenoidal surgery. However, concerns remain, including the requirement of dual antiplatelet agents increasing postoperative bleeding risks, stent-related thromboembolic events, and delayed in-stent restenosis rates.","Shakir, Hakeem J; Garson, Alex D; Sorkin, Grant C; Mokin, Maxim; Eller, Jorge L; Dumont, Travis M; Popat, Saurin R; Leonardo, Jody; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.133638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25024881/,366

Forensic and clinical neurology, even when aided by current technologies, are still dependent on cognitive interpretations, and therefore prone to bias. This article discusses 4 common biases that can lead the clinician astray. They are confirmation bias (selective gathering of and neglect of contradictory evidence); base rate bias (ignoring or misusing prevailing base rate data); hindsight bias (oversimplification of past causation); and good old days bias (the tendency for patients to misremember and exaggerate their preinjury functioning).

Gene expression can be used to determine abscopal effects at the molecular level. Synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy utilizing high-intensity X rays collimated into planar microbeams is a promising cancer treatment due to its reported ability to ablate tumors with less damage to normal tissues compared to conventional broadbeam radiation therapy techniques. The low scatter of synchrotron radiation enables microbeams to be delivered to tissue effectively, and is also advantageous for out-of-field studies because there is minimal interference from scatter. Mouse legs were irradiated at a dose rate of 49 Gy/s and skin samples in the out-of-field areas were collected. The out-of-field skin showed an increase in Tnf expression and a decrease in Mdm2 expression, genes associated with inflammation and DNA damage. These expression effects from microbeam exposure were similar to those found with broadbeam exposure. In immune-deficient Ccl2 knockout mice, we identified a different gene expression profile which showed an early increase in Mdm2, Tgfb1, Tnf and Ccl22 expression in out-of-field skin that was not observed in the immune-proficient mice. Our results suggest that the innate immune system is involved in out-of-field tissue responses and alterations in the immune response may not eliminate abscopal effects, but could change them.","Forrester, Helen B; Lobachevsky, Pavel N; Stevenson, Andrew W; Hall, Christopher J; Martin, Olga A; Sprung, Carl N",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rade-19-00014.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991732/,366
67372,Letter to the Editor.,2021-02-17,"INTRODUCTION In 2008, we initiated the first Guyanese comprehensive kidney replacement program, comprising hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), vascular access procedures, and living-donor kidney transplantation. The government of Guyana, US-based philanthropists, US-based physicians, and Guyanese caregivers teamed up to form a public-private partnership. This pilot program was free of cost to the patients. METHODS From July 2010 to the time of writing, we placed 17 patients with end-stage kidney disease on PD, which was used as a bridge to living-donor kidney transplantation. During the same period, we placed 12 primary arteriovenous fistulae. RESULTS The 17 patients who received a PD catheter had a mean age of 43.6 years and a mean follow-up of 5.3 months. In that group, 2 deaths occurred (from multi-organ failure) within 2 weeks of catheter placement, and 2 patients were switched to HD because of inadequate clearance. Technical issues were noted in 2 patients, and 3 patients developed peritonitis (treated with intravenous antibiotics). An exit-site abscess in 1 patient was drained under local anesthesia. The peritonitis rate was 0.36 episodes per patient-year. Of the 17 patients who received PD, 4 underwent living-donor kidney transplantation. CONCLUSIONS In Guyana, PD is a safe and cost-effective option; it may be equally suitable for similar developing countries. In Guyana, PD was used as a bridge to living-donor kidney transplantation. We have been able to sustain this program since 2008 by making incremental gains and nurturing the ongoing public-private partnership.","Altieri, Maria; Jindal, Tarun R; Patel, Mayur; Oliver, David K; Falta, Edward M; Elster, Eric A; Doyle, Alden; Guy, Stephen R; Womble, Arthur L; Jindal, Rahul M",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.3747/pdi.2012.00001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23478372/,366

We analyzed the effect of 3D technology on operative performance during laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) for gastric cancer and assessed its advantages over two-dimensional (2D) laparoscopy. METHODS This study included 30 consecutive surgeries of LTG with esophagojejunostomy by the overlap method performed (3D group, n = 15, 2D group, n = 15). The surgical outcomes were compared between the 3D and 2D groups. Further, we compared the performance time, the frequency of bleeding requiring hemostasis, and the frequency of remaking the surgical view by the assistant's forceps in each laparoscopic scene between the 3D and 2D groups. RESULTS All surgeries were completed without any complications. The total time of pure laparoscopic scenes was shorter in the 3D than 2D group (154.2 vs. 182.7 min, P = 0.026), and total blood loss was almost the same (10 vs. 20 g, P = 0.195). The operative time during lymphadenectomy in scenes 6 and 7 were significantly shorter in the 3D than the 2D group (scene 6, 13.5 vs. 17.5 min, P = 0.003, and scene 7, 12.4 vs. 18.4, P = 0.025) and esophagojejunostomy (30.3 vs. 39.4 min, P = 0.008). The frequency of tissue exposure by the assistant was significantly less in the 3D group than the 2D group in scenes 6 and 7 (scene 6, n = 3.0 vs. 4.0, P = 0.006, and scene 7, n = 3.0 vs. 4.0, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS 3D display is useful due to improvement of surgical skill during difficult situations such as lymphadenectomy around the celiac artery, which requires handling in the tangential view, and reconstruction using the suturing technique in a narrow space.","Kanaji, Shingo; Suzuki, Satoshi; Harada, Hitoshi; Nishi, Masayasu; Yamamoto, Masashi; Matsuda, Takeru; Oshikiri, Taro; Nakamura, Tetsu; Fujino, Yasuhiro; Tominaga, Masahiro; Kakeji, Yoshihiro",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-017-1574-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28314905/,366

Image analysis includes artificial intelligence (AI) and targeted or hypothesis-driven algorithms. In the overall pathology field, citations related to these topics have increased in recent years. Renal pathology is one anatomic pathology subspecialty that has utilized WSIs and image analysis algorithms; and it can be argued that renal transplant pathology could be particularly suited for WSI and image analysis, since renal transplant pathology is frequently classified using the semiquantitative Banff Classification of Renal Allograft Pathology. Hypothesis-driven/targeted algorithms have been used in the past for the assessment of a variety of features in the kidney (e.g., interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and inflammation); and in recent years, research has particularly increased in the area of AI/machine learning for the identification of glomeruli, for histologic segmentation, and other applications. Deep learning is the form of machine learning most often used for such AI approaches to the ""big data"" of pathology WSIs, and deep learning methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs)/convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized.

68684,Rare tumor - insulinoma mimicking dissociative disorder.,2020,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, and invariably fatal, condition that is believed to arise in genetically susceptible individuals as a consequence of an aberrant wound-healing response following repetitive alveolar injury. The exact triggers, which initiate the fibrotic process, remain unknown. Infectious agents, including both viruses and bacteria, have the capacity to cause alveolar-epithelial cell injury and apoptosis. Relatively few studies have examined the role of infection in IPF. Those that have, point to viruses playing a key role as cofactors in the initiation and progression of IPF. There is also some evidence to suggest that viral infection may be responsible for a proportion of acute exacerbations of IPF. The role played by bacteria in the pathogenesis of IPF is less clear cut. Studies from other respiratory diseases suggest that alterations in the lung microbiome are associated with disease and that these changes influence disease behaviour. Emerging molecular microbiological techniques are making the study of microbial communities in the lung easier. It is hoped that by combining such techniques with the careful longitudinal phenotyping of patients with IPF, it will be possible to elucidate the role played by bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease. If infection plays a causal role in IPF then it is possible that therapeutic strategies, utilising currently available antiviral or antibiotic drugs, may be effective in modifying the course of this devastating condition.","Molyneaux, Philip L; Maher, Toby M",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/09059180.00000713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23997064/,366

Little data are available on the natural history of this aneurysm subtype and the impact of the use of flow-diverting stents on the long-term clinical and imaging follow-up. In this article, we present our experience with the treatment of fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms by flow diverting stents. We aim to stimulate a discussion of the best management paradigm for this challenging aneurysm subtype. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified 6 patients with fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms who had been treated with flow-diverting stents between October 2009 and March 2012 in our center. The available data were re-evaluated. The modified Rankin Scale score was assessed before intervention, during the stay in hospital, and at discharge. RESULTS Six patients were identified (all male; age range, 49-71 years; median age, 60 years). Handling of material was successful in all cases. No primary periprocedural complications occurred. The mean follow-up was 13 months (15 days to 29 months). During follow-up, 3 of 6 patients had recurrent cerebral infarctions, but no patient experienced SAH. Two patients presented with acute thrombotic stent occlusion. The modified Rankin Scale score was not higher than 3 in any of the cases before intervention, whereas the best mRS score at the last follow-up was 5. Four of 6 patients died during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms with flow-diverting devices is feasible from a technical point of view; however, changes in hemodynamics with secondary thrombosis are not predictable. We currently do not intend to treat fusiform vertebrobasilar giant aneurysms with flow-diverting devices until we have further understanding of the pathophysiology, natural history, and hemodynamic effects of flow diversion.","Ertl, L; Holtmannspötter, M; Patzig, M; Brückmann, H; Fesl, G",AJNR.

In the carrier test, the dropping and wiping techniques were performed toward viruses on carriers. In the suspension test, SAHW-62 could decrease the viral titer of both AIV and IBV by more than 1000 times within 30 sec. With the dropping technique, IBV on carriers showed high resistance to SAHW, while AIV on plastic carrier was inactivated to an effective level (≧3 log virus reduction) within 1 min. With the wiping technique, SAHW-62 could inactivate both AIV and IBV on wiped plastic carriers to an effective level within 30 sec. However, SAHW-220 could not inactivate IBV in the wiping rayon sheet to an effective level. In the direct spray test, sprayed SAHW-300 within 10 min, and SAHW-540 within 20 min, inactivated AIV and IBV on the rayon sheets to undetectable level, respectively. Our study indicates that the usage of wipes with SAHW could remove viruses from plastic carriers, while viruses remained in the wipes. Besides, a small volume of sprayed SAHW was effective against the viruses on the rayon sheets for daily cleaning in the application area. The findings we obtained concerning IBV might basically be applicable in relation to SARS-CoV-2, given the resemblance between the two viruses.","Miyaoka, Yu; Kabir, Humayun; Hasan, Amirul; Yamaguchi, Makiko; Shoham, Dany; Murakami, Harumi; Takehara, Kazuaki",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705798/,366
70998,The Short Anxiety Screening Test in Greek: translation and validation.,2010,"OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to describe time intervals between pessary maintenance visits in racially diverse women receiving care in a U.S. epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We secondarily aimed to determine whether time interval between pessary changes is associated with adverse outcomes and to identify factors associated with adverse pessary outcomes. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of women undergoing pessary care after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Time between the most recent visit before the pandemic and first visit after the pandemic began was recorded. Pessary care data were collected from the latter visit, including vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, and erosion. Patient-reported symptoms and demographics were also recorded. The relationship between time interval between pessary visits and adverse outcomes as well as between adverse outcomes and demographic data was assessed. RESULTS We identified 104 women undergoing pessary care, of which 35.6% were Hispanic and 32.7% were Black and 26.2% ± 10.5% lived in poverty. The median time to in-person visit was 4.5 months (interquartile range, 3.7-5.3 months). Seven women (8.7%) had vaginal bleeding, 15 (14.6%) had vaginal discharge, and 7 (6.8%) had erosions. There was no significant association between time interval between pessary visits and adverse outcomes or between adverse outcomes and patient characteristics (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Longer duration of time between pessary maintenance visits is not associated with increased adverse outcomes in this group of racially diverse women. Extended intervals between pessary visits can be considered to minimize risk and maintain patient safety during challenging circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Halani, Priyanka Kadam; Gelman, Eden; Duchein, Yvette; Roselli, Nicole; Leegant, Ava",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/spv.0000000000001085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171881/,366
73769,Does Surgical Approach in Pelvic Floor Repair Impact Sexual Function in Women?,2019,"The comprehensive research programme of the Vogt-Vogt (V-V) school, which was active during the period 1900-1970, included detailed cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic analyses of the human cerebral cortex, with the aim to integrate the data obtained into a map, showing a parcellation of the human cerebral cortex into fundamental structural and potentially functional units. The cytoarchitectonic V-V analyses yielded two maps of the human cerebral cortex, the famous map of Brodmann (Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Grosshirnrinde in ihren Prinzipien dargestellt auf Grund des Zellenbaues. Barth, Leipzig, 1909), Brodmann (in: Bruns P (ed) Neue deutsche Chirurgie, Enke, Stuttgart, 1914), and the less known, but more detailed map of Sarkisov et al. (Cytoarchitecture of the human cortex cerebri. Medgiz, Moscow, 1949). Sarkisov et al. used in their cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the cortex the same numbering scheme as Brodmann. They confirmed the presence of most of the areas delineated by the latter, but they subdivided several of these areas into two or more separate areas or subareas. Within the realm of the myeloarchitectonic V-V analyses, numerous meticulous studies of the cortex of individual cerebral lobes were carried out, but these were not united into a single map. Consequently, the envisioned integration of cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic data mentioned above was never realized. Some years ago, we (Nieuwenhuys et al. in Brain Struct Funct 220:2551-2573, 2015a, Nieuwenhuys et al. in Brain Struct Funct 220:3753-3755, 2015b) reanalyzed the V-V myeloarchitectonic data, and succeeded in constructing a complete myeloarchitectonic map of the human neocortex from these data. Because the data provided by the V-V school were derived from many different brains, a standard brain had to be introduced as a template to which all data available could be transferred. As such the MNI305 template was selected. Having made available now the cytoarchitectonic maps of Brodmann and Sarkisov et al. and the recently prepared myeloarchitectonic map, an attempt is made here to realize at last the original aim of the V-V school, viz. the preparation of a single, combined (cyto + myelo) architectonic map of the human cortex. To this end, the following three steps have been made. First, Brodmann's (BR) map, and the map of Sarkisov et al. (SA) were harmoniously transferred to the same template brain as the one used during the construction of our myeloarchitectonic map. Second, the standardized BR and our myeloarchitectonic (NI) map were compared, and the data contained within these maps were integrated into a single standardized combined BR-NI map (Fig. 11). The standardized SA and NI maps were subjected to the same procedure (Fig. 12). Finally, the standardized combined BR-NI and SA-NI maps were united into a single combined BR-SA-NI map (Fig. 13). This map renders it possible to make direct comparisons between the results of the architectonic studies of the V-V school and current parcellations of the human neocortex.","Nieuwenhuys, Rudolf; Broere, Cees A J",Brain structure & function,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-020-02150-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141295/,366

To date, however, such reports have been limited to case reports or small case series. We sought to determine the prevalence of pro-thrombotic states among a large cohort of both MMD and MMS patients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all adult patients who were diagnosed with MMD or MMS from our institution. In addition to basic demographic and clinical data, the presence of certain pro-thrombotic conditions was noted. The presence of such conditions was determined based on review of clinical diagnoses and laboratory reports. The length of follow-up and the presence of interval ischemic events were obtained. RESULTS Out of a total of 180 patients diagnosed with MMD or MMS, 33 were found to have a concomitant pro-thrombotic condition (18.3%). Of 147 patients with MMD, 23 were found to have a pro-thrombotic condition (15.6%). There were 10 out of 33 total patients (30.3%) in the MMS cohort that had a concomitant pro-thrombotic condition. There were no differences in specific pro-thrombotic conditions between MMD and MMS cohorts. There were no differences in future ischemic events between moyamoya patients with pro-thrombotic tendencies compared to those without (13.3% versus 23.7%, respectively, P = 0.32), and this was also true for patients who underwent revascularization procedures (22.6% versus 29.4%, P = 0.76). There was also no difference in prevalence of revascularization graft occlusion between moyamoya patients with pro-thrombotic tendencies and those without at follow-up (1.2% versus 5.9%, P = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS It is likely that both MMD and MMS are associated with or predispose to pro-thrombotic conditions in adult patients, although the clinical and surgical significance is uncertain. Further study is needed in order to further elucidate and characterize this potential association.","Larson, Anthony; Rinaldo, Lorenzo; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Klaas, James P",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04420-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32462312/,366

The best understood asthma inflammatory pathways involve signals characterized by peripheral eosinophilia and elevated immunoglobulin E levels (called T2-high or allergic asthma), though other asthma phenotypes exist (eg, T2-low or non-allergic asthma, eosinophilic or neutrophilic-predominant). Common triggers that lead to poor asthma control and exacerbations include respiratory viruses, aeroallergens, house dust, molds, and other organic and inorganic substances. Increasingly recognized non-allergen triggers include tobacco smoke, small particulate matter (eg, PM2.5), and volatile organic compounds. The interaction between respiratory viruses and non-allergen asthma triggers is not well understood, though it is likely a connection exists which may lead to asthma development and/or exacerbations. In this paper we describe common respiratory viruses and non-allergen triggers associated with asthma. In addition, we aim to show the possible interactions, and potential synergy, between viruses and non-allergen triggers. Finally, we introduce a new clinical approach that collects exhaled breath condensates to identify metabolomics associated with viruses and non-allergen triggers that may promote the early management of asthma symptoms.","Chau-Etchepare, Florence; Hoerger, Joshua L; Kuhn, Brooks T; Zeki, Amir A; Haczku, Angela; Louie, Samuel; Kenyon, Nicholas J; Davis, Cristina E; Schivo, Michael",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2019-001000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31352362/,366

As convalescent plasma (CP) therapy has been used with success in several viral infections before, it has become a treatment of choice. Medical literature is reviewed for the randomized controlled studies using convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. AREAS COVERED More than one type of neutralizing antibody against a specific microorganism may be found in both CP and hyperimmune globulins. To give a standard titer of a specific neutralizing antibody to a patient, a reliable antibody titration assay should be developed. It is challenging to test the efficacy of the CP and HIG therapies with double-blind studies. There is a difficulty in the standardization of the CP and HIG study groups, as patients use various additional therapies. Different amounts and titer of CP and HIG and different titer of CP are used in patients. This review discusses the current knowledge on the CP and HIG therapies used in patients suffering from COVID-19 disease. EXPERT OPINION The mechanisms of the cellular and humoral antiviral immune response to COVID-19 seem to have diverse characteristics. The antibody produced after COVID-19 disease and vaccination is short-lived. Thus, CP should be an alternative especially in patients with lymphopenia and primary/secondary antibody deficiency.

Risk communication in disasters aims to prevent and mitigate harm from disasters, prepare the population before a disaster, disseminate information during disasters and aid subsequent recovery. The aim of this systematic review is to identify, appraise and synthesise the findings of studies of the effects of risk communication interventions during four stages of the disaster cycle. METHODS We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts, Web of Science and grey literature sources for randomised trials, cluster randomised trials, controlled and uncontrolled before and after studies, interrupted time series studies and qualitative studies of any method of disaster risk communication to at-risk populations. Outcome criteria were disaster-related knowledge and behaviour, and health outcomes. RESULTS Searches yielded 5,224 unique articles, of which 100 were judged to be potentially relevant. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, and two additional studies were identified from other searching. The studies evaluated interventions in all four stages of the disaster cycle, included a variety of man-made, natural and infectious disease disasters, and were conducted in many disparate settings. Only one randomised trial and one cluster randomised trial were identified, with less robust designs used in the other studies. Several studies reported improvements in disaster-related knowledge and behaviour. DISCUSSION We identified and appraised intervention studies of disaster risk communication and present an overview of the contemporary literature. Most studies used non-randomised designs that make interpretation challenging. We do not make specific recommendations for practice but highlight the need for high-quality randomised trials and appropriately-analysed cluster randomised trials in the field of disaster risk communication where these can be conducted within an appropriate research ethics framework.","Bradley, Declan T; McFarland, Marie; Clarke, Mike",PLoS currents,https://doi.org/10.1371/currents.dis.349062e0db1048bb9fc3a3fa67d8a4f8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25642365/,366

We hypothesized comparable symptom reporting and correlations in each group.Methods: A total of 564 youth ages 8-18 years were assessed regarding post-concussive symptoms. A subset of youth (n = 360) were compared on correlations between post-concussive and depressive symptoms. Non-parametric statistics were used for most analyses.Results: Youth with concussion reported a comparable number of post-concussive and depressive symptoms as youth with another medical condition without concussion. However, those with concussion reported greater post-concussive symptom severity (but small effect sizes). Relationships between post-concussive and depressive symptoms were comparable for both groups, but for those who sustained a concussion, the correlation was significantly stronger for females than males.Conclusions: This study further demonstrates that post-concussive symptoms are nonspecific and provide little functional utility. Post-concussive and depressive symptoms are strongly correlated, particularly in females with concussion. Psychiatric comorbidities and other medical diagnoses should be assessed pre-injury because both affect interpretation of post-concussive symptom reports.","Pulsipher, Dalin T; Rettig, Eman K; Krapf, Erica M; Stanford, Lisa D",Brain injury,https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2021.1942550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184599/,366
83401,New Challenges in Addiction Medicine: COVID-19 Infection in Patients With Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders-The Perfect Storm.,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND Rehospitalization of children born prematurely (referred to as preterm children) caused by severe respiratory infections is common. Most studies have focused on respiratory syncytial virus infection. We designed a study to determine the virological and clinical characteristics of severe respiratory infections of children born early (<32 weeks) and moderate preterm (32 to 36 weeks), and compared them with full term (FT; ≥37 weeks) children who were subsequently admitted with respiratory illness. METHODS A 7-year observational prospective study was conducted on preterm and FT children, less than 14 years old hospitalized with respiratory infection. The presence of 16 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates was sought. Clinical and virological characteristics of subjects were compared among term and preterm children. RESULTS We studied 411 respiratory hospital admissions of 262 preterm children who were compared with 2057 respiratory hospital admissions of term children. In 78.6% of preterm episodes, at least 1 respiratory virus was identified. The most frequent viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (29%), rhinovirus (25%) and human bocavirus (13%). Human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus were significantly more frequent in preterm than in term children (P < 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively). Early preterm (EPT) infants admitted with bronchiolitis presented more hypoxia (P = 0.08), longer hospital stay (P = 0.05), more infiltrate on chest radiograph (P = 0.02) and more antibiotic treatment (P = 0.02) than moderate preterm (MPT) infants. Moreover, MPT needed more intensive care unit admission than FT infants (P < 0.001). Regarding wheezing episodes, EPT patients showed significantly more infiltrate/atelectasis (P < 0.001), longer oxygen therapy (P = 0.039) and longer hospital stay (P = 0.07) than MPT children, although similar percentage of intensive care unit admission was seen in both groups. MPT-wheezy children needed longer hospital stay than FT (P = 0.05). Previous bronchiolitis and EPT were independent factors associated with multiple wheezing admissions. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate that besides respiratory syncytial virus, other viruses mainly rhinovirus and human bocavirus are important pathogens in severe respiratory infections in preterm children. Human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus seem also to play a significant role in this group of children. There is increased medical resource utilization, not only among EPT but also in MPT hospitalized children with respiratory infections as many of them require more medical support than FT children.","García-Garcia, Maria Luz; González-Carrasco, Ersilia; Quevedo, Sergio; Muñoz, Cristina; Sánchez-Escudero, Veronica; Pozo, Francisco; Casas, Inmaculada; Calvo, Cristina",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000000718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25923427/,366

The present guide represents an update of the previous documents published by the authors in 2005 and 2011 on drug-induced ototoxicity and vestibulotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS The authors performed a comprehensive analysis of audio-vestibular side effects of commercially available drugs based on the British National Formulary, a pharmaceutical reference book that contains a wide range of useful information and advice on prescription and pharmacology. RESULTS Commercially available drugs and their active principles have been classified based on their audio-vestibular side effects, as reported by the pharmaceutical companies and/or health agencies. Drugs have been categorized based on the field of application, the therapeutic indication and the pharmacological properties. CONCLUSIONS General practitioners, otolaryngology, neurology and audiology specialists should be aware of possible audio-vestibular side effects of drugs, such as hearing loss, tinnitus, dizziness and vertigo. The present guide represents a practical tool to rapidly identify potential audio-vestibular side effects of drugs as reported by the pharmaceutical companies and/or health agencies.","Altissimi, G; Colizza, A; Cianfrone, G; de Vincentiis, M; Greco, A; Taurone, S; Musacchio, A; Ciofalo, A; Turchetta, R; Angeletti, D; Ralli, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767320/,366
84224,Burnout of Healthcare Workers in Acute Care Geriatric Facilities During the COVID-19 Crisis: An Online-Based Study.,2020-10-02,"The dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an ""all hands on deck"" approach to finding new therapies to improve outcomes in this disease. In addition to causing significant respiratory pathology, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (like infection with other respiratory viruses) directly or indirectly results in abnormal vasculature which may contribute to hypoxemia. These vascular effects cause significant morbidity and may contribute to mortality from the disease. Given that abnormal vasculature and poor oxygenation are also hallmarks of solid tumors, lessons from the treatment of cancer may help identify drugs that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Although the mechanisms that result in vascular abnormalities in COVID-19 are not fully understood, it is possible that there is dysregulation of many of the same angiogenic and thrombotic pathways seen in cancer patients. Many anti-cancer therapeutics, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), result in vascular normalization in addition to their direct effects on tumor cells. Therefore, these therapies, which have been extensively explored in clinical trials of cancer patients, may have beneficial effects on the vasculature of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, these drugs may have additional effects on the disease course, as some ADT may impact viral entry, and ICBs may accelerate T-cell mediated viral clearance. These insights from the treatment of cancer may be leveraged to abrogate the vascular pathologies found in COVID-19 and other forms of hypoxemic respiratory failure.","Munn, Lance L; Stylianopoulos, Triantafyllos; Jain, Natalie K; Hardin, C Corey; Khandekar, Melin J; Jain, Rakesh K",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-20-4750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33648989/,366

84763,Covid-19 - Implications for the Health Care System.,2020-07-22,"Donepezil is one of the cholinesterase inhibitors that are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacokinetic analysis has shown that donepezil is primarily eliminated by renal excretion rather than biliary excretion in humans. Therefore, patients with impaired renal function are at high risk of toxicity caused by accumulation of this drug. It is also well known that dialysis patients have very often cholinergic disorders. On the other hand, with the increasing number of long-term chronic dialysis patients, the prevalence of cognitive disorders is increasing in elderly dialysis patients. Because of the above-mentioned special risks of these patients, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, are avoided to be prescribed for them. We studied 5 cases of chronic hemodialysis outpatients (3 men [70, 72, and 86 years old] and 2 women [65 and 71 years old]) who were diagnosed as having moderate AD. We administered donepezil at 2.5 mg/day orally to the patients. After 1 month's treatment, their behavioral symptoms were improved, without them having any adverse events. We enhanced the dose to 5 mg/day without the patients experiencing any episodes of drug toxicity. After 3 months of treatment with the higher dose, their cognitive and executive functions were slightly improved and their behavioral disorders were remarkably milder, without them experiencing any episodes of drug toxicity. The patients' condition remained stable for 6 months after the initial administration of the drug. All of them were followed for the 10 following years, showing a mild cognitive decline per year for the first 5 years and more severe decline for the remaining years of the follow-up. Our cases indicate that donepezil treatment under prudent use may be well tolerated and have a beneficial impact on chronic hemodialysis patients with AD.","Yiannopoulou, Konstantina G; Anastasiou, Aikaterini I; Kyrozis, Andreas; Anastasiou, Ioannis P",Case reports in nephrology and dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000502682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616673/,366
85196,Should emergency medical service stuff use respirators with filtered valve in COVID-19 pandemic?,2020,"Due to the continued persistence of waterborne viral-associated infections, the presence of enteric viruses is a concern. Notwithstanding the health implications, viral diversity and abundance is an indicator of water quality declination in the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of viruses (bacteriophage and enteric viruses) in a highly polluted, anthropogenic-influenced river system over a 6-month period at five sampling points. Cytopathic-based tissue culture assays revealed that the isolated viruses were infectious when tested on Hep-G2, HEK293 and Vero cells. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the majority of the viruses were bacteriophages, a number of presumptive enteric virus families were visualized, some of which include Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Polyomaviridae and Reoviridae. Finally, primer specific nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR)/reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coupled with BLAST analysis identified human adenovirus, polyomavirus and hepatitis A and C virus genomes in river water samples. Taken together, the complexity of both bacteriophage and enteric virus populations in the river has potential health implications. Finally, a systematic integrated risk assessment and management plan to identify and minimize sources of faecal contamination is the most effective way of ensuring water safety and should be established in all future guidelines.","Marie, Veronna; Lin, Johnson",Journal of water and health,https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2017.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29215360/,366

Currently, SLNB requires blue dyes and/or radiopharmaceuticals; both of which have significant shortcomings. This study sought to evaluate the feasibility of SLNB with the use of real-time, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as an alternative technique for tumors arising in the conjunctiva. STUDY DESIGN Prospective feasibility study in a porcine model. METHODS Twelve experiments were performed on six non-tumor-bearing Yorkshire swine. An ultrasound contrast agent, Sonazoid (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway), (99m) technetium ((99m) Tc), and methylene blue (MB) (Covidien, Mansfield, MA) were injected in the ocular conjunctiva. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were localized with CEUS and findings were compared to that of MB and (99m) Tc. Fisher exact test was used. RESULTS Contrast-enhanced SLNs were identified within an average of 6.2 minutes from time of injection of Sonazoid. A total of 17 SLNs were identified by at least one of the three techniques. Correlation between Sonazoid and (99m) Tc was 94.1% (16/17 SLNs). Correlation between (99m) Tc and MB was 88.2% (15/17). One SLN that was positive for (99m) Tc but negative for Sonazoid and was considered to be a false positive (1/17); findings were similar for MB (1/17). Differences between the three techniques were not significant (P = .886). CONCLUSIONS CEUS-guided injection of conjunctiva for SLNB is technically feasible and correlates well with standard detection techniques. This technique shows promise for rapid, real-time, intraoperative imaging for SLNB, using a widely available imaging modality and avoiding the need for radiopharmaceuticals.

However, this technique requires a specialized multichannel port for introducing laparoscope and instruments. We present our preliminary experience of using a homemade transumbilical single-port access for performing LESS. METHOD An Alexis wound retractor was placed through the umbilical incision, and a pair of sterile surgical gloves was then snapped onto it. Standard laparoscopic trocars were inserted through the gloves after the upper half parts of the gloves were truncated. Using this port and Roticulator articulating instruments, we performed 14 urologic LESS procedures on porcine laboratory and cadaveric cases, and we performed 10 transabdominal pre-peritoneal inguinal hernia repairs (TAPP), and 5 laparoscopic varicocelectomies on human cases, respectively. All procedures were performed with instruments inserted through this port without the need for any extraumbilical incisions or conversion to standard laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS All LESS procedures were successfully completed without any complications. The time to achieve the transumbilical port ready for subsequent LESS was short (range, 4-8 (median, 6) minutes). The total operative time was between 60 and 190 minutes. No port-related complications were noted, and the cosmetic results were excellent. CONCLUSIONS This homemade transumbilical port offers a safe, reliable, flexible, and cost-effective access for LESS procedures. This technique may be an alternative for current specialized port systems.","Tai, Huai-Ching; Lin, Chia-Da; Wu, Chia-Chang; Tsai, Yao-Chou; Yang, Stephen Shei-Dei",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0620-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19609606/,366

METHODS In June 2020, we conducted an online survey of parents and guardians of public school children in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. In a child-level analysis, we used linear regression to assess which demographic factors, health-related concerns, and parent/guardian views were associated with plans for in-person school attendance. In a respondent-level analysis, we used linear regression to assess factors associated with the number of risk mitigation measures supported. RESULTS Among 2,202 children in the child-level analysis, in-person school attendance was planned for 71.0%. Such plans were less likely among children of Black respondents (-14.1 percentage points, 95% CI: -25.7, -2.6) and Asian respondents (-16.8, 95% CI: -31.3, -2.2), and among children with perceived high-risk health conditions (-9.7, 95% CI: -15.8, -3.6). Among 1,126 respondents in the respondent-level analysis, the mean number of measures supported was 8.0 (SD 4.4). Several factors were associated with support, but the magnitude of associations was generally modest. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, families of children with health conditions or who are of Black or Asian race/ethnicity may be less likely to opt for in-person learning. For these families, addressing barriers to remote education is critical. As schools plan for the 2020-2021 school year and beyond, they should respond to the desire among parents and guardians to implement substantial numbers of risk mitigation measures.","Chua, Kao-Ping; DeJonckheere, Melissa; Reeves, Sarah L; Tribble, Alison C; Prosser, Lisa A",Academic pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2020.11.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249257/,366

There are concerns that transition may lead to a reduction in care quality and increases in emergency care. This review explores evidence for differences in health or social care use post- versus pre-transition to adult services. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and Social Science Citation Index were searched. Studies published in English since 1990 including individuals with any life-limiting condition post- and pre-transition and reporting a health or social care use outcome were included. Data were extracted and quality assessed by one reviewer with 30% checked by an independent reviewer. RESULTS Nineteen papers (18 studies) met the inclusion criteria. There was evidence for both increases and decreases (post- versus pre-transition) in outpatient attendance, inpatient admissions, inpatient bed days and health service costs; for increases in Emergency Department visits and for decreases in individuals receiving physiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS Evidence for changes in healthcare use post- versus pre-transition is mixed and conflicting, although there is evidence for an increase in Emergency Department visits and a reduction in access to physiotherapy. More high-quality research is needed to better link changes in care to the transition. IMPACT Evidence for changes in healthcare use associated with transition to adult services is conflicting. Emergency Department visits increase and access to physiotherapy decreases at transition.

The effects of antiseptic incorporation on the stability, release of sericin, and short-term and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial activity of the sericin dressing against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated. We showed that the incorporation of each antiseptic did not have significant effect on the internal morphology (pore size ~ 73-105 μm), elasticity (Young's modulus ~ 200-500 kPa), and the sericin release behavior of the sericin-based dressing. The release of sericin from the dressing was prolonged over 120 h and thereafter. Comparing among three antiseptics, 0.05% chlorhexidine incorporated in the sericin dressing showed the highest immediate and long-term (6 months) antimicrobial effect (largest inhibition zone) against most bacteria either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. The in vivo safety test following ISO10993 standard (Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 6: Tests for local effects after implantation) confirmed that the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine did not irritate to tissue, comparing with the commercial material used generally in clinic (Allevyn®, Smith & Nephew). We suggested the sericin dressing incorporating 0.05% chlorhexidine for the treatment of infected chronic wound.

METHODS Two hundred and eleven patients who had received RFA as first-line treatment for HCC were retrospectively analyzed. They had undergone gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI before treatment, and parameters including tumour size; margins; signal intensities on T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted images, and hepatobiliary phase images (HBPI); intratumoral fat or tumoral capsules; and peritumoural hypointensity in the HBPI were used to develop a prediction model for LTP after treatment. This model to discriminate low-risk from high-risk LTP groups was constructed based on Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Our analyses produced the following model: 'risk score = 0.617 × tumour size + 0.965 × tumour margin + 0.867 × peritumoural hypointensity on HBPI'. This was able to predict which patients were at high risk for LTP after RFA (p < 0.001). Patients in the low-risk group had a significantly better 5-year LTP-free survival rate compared to the high-risk group (89.6 % vs. 65.1 %; hazard ratio, 3.60; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION A predictive model based on MRI before RFA could robustly identify HCC patients at high risk for LTP after treatment. KEY POINTS • Tumour size, margin, and peritumoural hypointensity on HBPI were risk factors for LTP. • The risk score model can predict which patients are at high risk for LTP. • This prediction model could be helpful for risk stratification of HCC patients.","Kang, Tae Wook; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lee, Jisun; Song, Kyoung Doo; Lee, Min Woo; Kim, Young-Sun; Lim, Hyo Keun; Jang, Kyung Mi; Kim, Seong Hyun; Gwak, Geum-Youn; Jung, Sin-Ho",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-015-4190-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26747262/,366

Similarly, the presence of a neutrophil toxic grade higher than 3 was associated with SIRS (RR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.03-2.82; P = .034) and death (RR = 2.34; 95% CI: 1.22-4.50, P = .007). The information gained from the blood smear review could not be captured by looking at only the WBC or neutrophil count. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE The microscopic review of blood smears from critically ill horses to detect band cells or neutrophil toxic change is valuable and could help in assessing disease severity and prognosis in adult equine emergency admissions.","Lambert, J L; Fernandez, N J; Roy, M-F",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.13968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214343/,366
91727,Withdrawal.,2017,"Here, we demonstrate that loss of DRAK2 signaling significantly promotes the acceptance of allogeneic engraftment in two separate transplant models without promoting generalized immunosuppression. Drak2-/- T cells failed to reject allogeneic tumors, and were defective in rejecting Balb/C allogeneic skin grafts on C57BL6/J recipients. A significant fraction of alloreactive Drak2-/- T cells underwent apoptosis following activation, whereas enforced expression of Bcl-xL in Drak2-/- T cells restored allograft rejection. Formation of allogeneic memory was also greatly hampered in T cells lacking the Drak2 gene. Adoptive transfer of memory T cells from Drak2-/- mice failed to promote the rejection of allogeneic tumors, and such cells led to significantly delayed rejection of skin allografts in the Balb/C->C57BL/6J model. Costimulatory blockade by in vivo administration of Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) synergized with the DRAK2 deficiency and led to long-term allogeneic skin graft acceptance. Overall, these results demonstrate that DRAK2 plays an important role in primary and memory T cell responsiveness to allografts. Because previous studies have demonstrated that a loss of DRAK2 does not negatively impact antiviral immunity, the studies here underscore the potential utility of pharmacological blockade of DRAK2 to achieve transplant maintenance without the imposition of generalized immunosuppression.","Weist, B M; Hernandez, J B; Walsh, C M",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-6143.2012.04056.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22494341/,366

The effects of different extract concentrations on the film properties were determined by measuring physicochemical, mechanical and antioxidant properties of the films. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated that strong interactions between the polyphenols present in the MBE and sepiolite were involved in the films. The results suggested that incorporation of Sep-MBE hybrids into the films improved elongation at break, tensile strength, water vapor and UV barrier properties compared to the control film. The antioxidant activity of the films was significantly improved and raised with increasing content of MBE. The release kinetics results of MBE polyphenols from the active films into alcoholic food simulant indicated that the addition of Sep-MBE hybrids to alginate film is able to slow the release of MBE polyphenols. This study revealed the benefits of incorporation of Sep-MBE hybrids into the alginate films and their potential application as active packaging films or coating material.","Cheikh, Dorsaf; Martín-Sampedro, Raquel; Majdoub, Hatem; Darder, Margarita",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069820/,366

Electrochemical deposition of nanowires was accomplished using a protocol for the preparation of copper oxide. Freestanding nanowires were observed after removal of the template by either simple dissolution of the poly(4-fluorostyrene) or by treatment with UV irradiation. The annealing time, the electric field strength used to align the block copolymer films, and the template removal method are shown to influence the freestanding nanowire arrays.

However, the same method of loading of drugs in the bone cement cannot simultaneously achieve an effective antibacterial response and long-term treatment outcomes for osteoporosis based on a patient's clinical needs. In the present study, gentamicin sulfate (GS)/alendronate (ALN)-dual-loaded gelatin modified PMMA bone cement (GAPBC) was fabricated to provide rapid and continuous antibiotic release and long-term anti-osteoporotic therapy. Specifically, the gelatin microspheres were loaded with the drugs using separate methodologies, namely, ALN was loaded during fabrication of the gelatin microspheres after which GS was absorbed onto the gelatin from solution. The results demonstrate that sequential release of the GS and ALN was achieved, GS release playing a major role over the first 24 hours and ALN release dominant after 3 weeks of immersion in PBS, resulting from the graded distribution within the gelatin microspheres, and the final drug release ratio of GS (73.6%) and ALN (68.5%) from the modified bone cement was significantly higher than from PMMA bone cement. Therefore, GAPBC represents a potential drug carrier for future clinical applications.","Chen, Lei; Tang, Yufei; Zhao, Kang; Zha, Xiang; Wei, Min; Tan, Quanchang; Wu, Zixiang",Journal of materials chemistry.

94866,Do burnout and work engagement predict depressive symptoms and life satisfaction? A three-wave seven-year prospective study.,2012,"Rice (Oryza sativa L.) ssp. indica is the most cultivated species in the South of Brazil. However, these plants face low temperature stress from September to November, which is the period of early sowing, affecting plant development during the initial stages of growth, and reducing rice productivity. This study aimed to characterize the root response to low temperature stress during the early vegetative stage of two rice genotypes contrasting in their cold tolerance (CT, cold-tolerant; and CS, cold-sensitive). Root dry weight and length, as well as the number of root hairs, were higher in CT than CS when exposed to cold treatment. Histochemical analyses indicated that roots of CS genotype present higher levels of lipid peroxidation and H2O2 accumulation, along with lower levels of plasma membrane integrity than CT under low temperature stress. RNAseq analyses revealed that the contrasting genotypes present completely different molecular responses to cold stress. The number of over-represented functional categories was lower in CT than CS under cold condition, suggesting that CS genotype is more impacted by low temperature stress than CT. Several genes might contribute to rice cold tolerance, including the ones related with cell wall remodeling, cytoskeleton and growth, signaling, antioxidant system, lipid metabolism, and stress response. On the other hand, high expression of the genes SRC2 (defense), root architecture associated 1 (growth), ACC oxidase, ethylene-responsive transcription factor, and cytokinin-O-glucosyltransferase 2 (hormone-related) seems to be related with cold sensibility. Since these two genotypes have a similar genetic background (sister lines), the differentially expressed genes found here can be considered candidate genes for cold tolerance and could be used in future biotechnological approaches aiming to increase rice tolerance to low temperature.","Rativa, Angie Geraldine Sierra; Junior, Artur Teixeira de Araújo; Friedrich, Daniele da Silva; Gastmann, Rodrigo; Lamb, Thainá Inês; Silva, Alexsander Dos Santos; Adamski, Janete Mariza; Fett, Janette Palma; Ricachenevsky, Felipe Klein; Sperotto, Raul Antonio",Journal of plant physiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2020.153307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142180/,366

Due to the distinct but non-regular annual 35S pattern in precipitation, related data evaluation requires consideration of a35S input function that is based on representative rain samples. While minor rain events can easily be sampled quantitatively and hence representatively, a long-lasting rain event may get documented by a sample that represents only a certain sequence of the event, thus potentially resulting in a35S activity concentration that might not be representative. With the aim to examine the magnitude of temporal variations of the 35S activity concentration in rain during long-lasting rain events, we present and discuss two related exemplary 35S time series. Furthermore, we evaluate the applicability of the parameters total sulfate and electrical conductivity (EC), both detected in rainwater as easily attainable 35S proxies. The results of the study show (i) that the 35S activity concentration may vary substantially during long-lasting rain events due to atmospheric migration processes and aerosol washout and (ii) that neither sulfate nor EC are suitable as 35S proxies due to the different origin of 35S on the one hand and sulfate/EC on the other. Hence, for the determination of a35S activity concentration that is representative for a long-lasting rain event 35S analyses of an adequate number of sub-samples cannot be avoided.","Schubert, M; Weise, S M; Knöller, K",Journal of environmental radioactivity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2021.106669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118616/,366

98983,Bridging the divide between physicians and administrators during COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"The Frith-Happé Animations Test, depicting interactions between triangles, is widely used to measure theory of mind (ToM) ability in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This test began with recording, transcribing, and subjectively scoring participants' verbal descriptions, which consistently found ToM-specific difficulties in ASD. More recently in 2011, White et al. created a more objective version of this ToM test using multiple-choice questions. However, there has been surprisingly little uptake of this test, hence it is currently unclear if White et al.'s findings replicate. Further, the lack of an online version of the test may be hampering its use in large-scale studies and outside of research settings. Addressing these issues, we report the development of a web-based version of the Frith-Happé Animations Test for autistic and neurotypical adults. An online version of the test was developed in a large general population sample (study 1; N = 285) and online data were compared with those collected in a lab-based setting (study 2; N = 339). The new online test was then administered to adults with a clinical diagnosis of ASD and matched neurotypical controls (study 3; N = 231). Results demonstrated that the test could successfully be administered online to autistic adults, who showed ToM difficulties compared to neurotypical adults, replicating White et al.'s findings. Overall, we have developed a quicker, more objective, and web-based version of the Frith-Happé Animations Test that will be useful for social cognition research within and beyond the field of autism, with potential utility for clinical settings. LAY SUMMARY: Many autistic people find it hard to understand what other people are thinking. There are many tests for this 'mentalising' ability, but they often take a long time to complete and cannot be used outside of research settings. In 2011, scientists used short silent animations of moving shapes to create a fast way to measure mentalising ability. We developed this into an online test to use in research and clinics to measure mentalising ability in autism.","Livingston, Lucy A; Shah, Punit; White, Sarah J; Happé, Francesca",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245112/,366

However, outliers in this theoretical disposition make empirical proof of the fuel subsidy-carbon intensity apt and primitive. Despite established fuel subsidy abolishment gains for climate and economic welfare, the relevance, magnitude and policy implications remain dimly. This paper employs the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) estimation procedure to gauge the contemporaneous influence of fuel subsidy for carbon intensity in Nigeria. Findings revealed that fuel subsidy removal inversely relates to Nigeria's carbon emission in the short run and long run. The study recommends a complementary policy option that ensures additional financial savings to the government should be invested in public sector growth that can cushion the effect of relative income loss to the citizenry. The Nigerian government should ensure measures are kept in place to discourage overconsumption of alternative energy (for example coal) that could also threaten the green economy paradox.","Adekunle, Ibrahim Ayoade; Oseni, Isiaq Olasunkanmi",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12384-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423202/,366

METHODS In total, 150 patients (112 men; mean age 66.3 ± 10.0 years) with arterial occlusive disease underwent endovascular therapy via a transbrachial access. Periprocedure data (sheath size, dose area product, fluoroscopy time, and procedure duration) were analyzed. Postprocedure complications of the puncture sites were categorized as minor (local hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, embolization, dissection, minor bleeding) and major (thrombotic occlusion, hematoma requiring surgery, major bleeding, nerve injury). RESULTS The minor and major complication rates were 14.0% (n = 21) and 2.7% (n = 4). The most frequent major complication was thrombotic occlusion of the brachial artery requiring surgical treatment (3/150, 2%). There was only one temporary palsy of the median nerve and no stroke. Local hematoma (15, 10%), pseudoaneurysm (3, 2%), or a combination of both (3, 2%) dominated the minor complications. The average dose area product and fluoroscopy time were 12,752.1 ± 9524.5 cGy*cm(2) and 24.3 ± 18.4 minutes, respectively, though procedure duration was acceptable (121.8 ± 48.9 minutes). CONCLUSION Complication rates of the transbrachial access for endovascular treatment of peripheral or visceral artery occlusive disease are tolerably low, making it a safe and an important alternative to the transfemoral access in selected cases, though the radiation exposure is rather high.","Treitl, Karla Maria; König, Cosima; Reiser, Maximilian F; Treitl, Marcus",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1526602814564363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25775682/,366

Although alcohol use has increased in response to the pandemic, no known studies have identified transdiagnostic risk factors for greater drinking in response to COVID-related distress. Individuals with more difficulty with emotion regulation may drink more during the pandemic to manage pandemic-related distress. The current study tested whether difficulty with emotion regulation was related to greater estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC) during a typical week in the past month and if this was due to COVID-related distress and drinking to cope with the pandemic. The sample consisted of 347 past-month drinking undergraduates in Louisiana, a state with some of the U.S. highest rates of COVID-19 infections and related deaths. Difficulty with engaging in goal-directed behaviors was related to greater past-month eBAC and this relation was mediated by the sequential effects of COVID-related worry and drinking to cope with the pandemic. Results indicate that individuals with difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviors are especially vulnerable to greater eBAC during the COVID-19 pandemic which may be due in part to their vulnerability to more COVID-related worry which may lead to more drinking to cope with the pandemic.","Buckner, Julia D; Lewis, Elizabeth M; Abarno, Cristina N; Morris, Paige E; Glover, Nina I; Zvolensky, Michael J",Cognitive behaviour therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2020.1861084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33522892/,366

Despite this, it is still not widely practised, which could be due to a shallow learning curve. We have evaluated the surgical outcome in a training programme at an institution with an established VATS lobectomy programme. We present the surgical data and outcome of the first 50 intended VATS lobectomies performed by a consultant in training as the primary surgeon. METHODS Data were obtained from a prospectively registered surgical database consisting of 262 consecutively intended VATS lobectomies. A single consultant performed 212 intended VATS lobectomies. His first 50 intended VATS lobectomies were excluded, as they were considered to be his learning curve, leaving 162 intended VATS lobectomies, of which 12 were converted to open lobectomy, performed from January 2005 to April 2008. Fifty intended VATS lobectomies were performed by a consultant in a training programme for VATS lobectomies, of which three were converted to open lobectomy from April 2007 to April 2008. The training consultant was experienced in open thoracic surgery and had performed more than 200 minor VATS procedures prior to the training programme. The surgical data and outcome between the 47 VATS lobectomies were compared with the 150 VATS lobectomies performed by the experienced consultant using statistical analysis. RESULTS There were significantly better results for the training consultant regarding prolonged air leak, chest tube duration and length of stay, which probably reflects the careful selection of the patients favouring the training consultant. The operation time was significant longer for the consultant in training (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS With careful selection of patients, VATS lobectomy can be taught safely in a surgical institution experienced in VATS lobectomies. Using statistical analysis, the surgical outcome for the training consultant was acceptable in comparison to the outcome of the experienced consultant. The consultant in training did spend more time in the operating theatre (p<0.0001) and we recommend taking that into account when planning future training programmes in VATS lobectomy.","Petersen, René Horsleben; Hansen, Henrik Jessen",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcts.2009.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19818641/,366

Quantitative real-time PCR assays are extremely sensitive and have the advantages over standard PCR assays that they do not require post-reaction processing to visualise PCR products and can quantify the amount of DNA present in a sample. This study describes a quantitative real-time PCR assay for the detection of BFDV DNA, using primers designed to amplify a conserved 81 bp fragment of ORFV1 and SYTO9, a fluorescent intercalating dye. A synthetic oligonucleotide was used to make standard curves for the quantitation of viral load in blood and feather preparations. The assay was very sensitive, with a detection limit of 50 copies/microL. The assay was developed using DNA extracts from the feathers of 10 different species of birds which had tested BFDV-positive previously and was validated with blood and feather samples from corellas vaccinated with an experimental BFDV vaccine, then challenged with live virus. Viral DNA was detected consistently in the blood of all control (non-vaccinated) birds and in some vaccinated birds. Contamination of the environment with feather dander from BFDV-infected birds meant that feather preparations used for the haemagglutination assay were unreliable for the detection and quantitation of viral excretion. Nonetheless, the assay should prove to be a useful and sensitive test for the detection of viral DNA in a range of samples.","Shearer, Patrick L; Sharp, Margaret; Bonne, Nicolai; Clark, Phillip; Raidal, Shane R",Journal of virological methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2009.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19442852/,366

Moreover, PSD is associated with functional recovery and quality of life (QOL) in stroke survivors. Screening for PSD is recommended. There are, however, differences in the literature on the impact of early screening on functional outcomes. In this systematic review, we synthesise the currently available literature regarding the associations between timing and setting of PSD screening and mortality, QOL and functional outcomes in stroke survivors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically search electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL from inception to August 2021. Four reviewers will screen the title and abstract and full-text level records identified in the search in a blinded fashion to determine the study eligibility. Any selection disagreements between the reviewers will be resolved by the study investigator. Data extraction of eligible studies will be conducted by two reviewers using a predefined template. We will complete the quality assessment of included articles independently by two reviewers using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Eventual discrepancies will be resolved by the principal investigator. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Due to the nature of the study design, ethical approval is not required. The systematic review and meta-analysis findings will be published and disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal. Our results will also be disseminated through posters and presentations at appropriate scientific conferences.

111710,"COVID-19 outbreak and its monetary implications for dental practices, hospitals and healthcare workers.",2020-04-03,"BACKGROUND Garden-based interventions show promise for improving not only child nutrition, but other indicators of child health. Yet, existing systematic reviews of garden-based interventions often focus on one particular health outcome or setting, creating a need to holistically summarize review-level evidence on the role of garden-based interventions in early childhood. To fill this gap, we performed an umbrella review of garden-based interventions to examine their role in early childhood health promotion for children ages 6 years and younger, examining effective components of garden-based interventions and critically evaluating existing evidence. METHODS We searched the following databases: PubMed, PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, OVID-Agricola, and CAB Direct, limiting to reviews published from 1990 to August 2019. Of the 9457 references identified, we included a total of 16 unique reviews for analysis. RESULTS Across reviews, garden based-interventions were most effective at improving nutrition-related outcomes for children, including nutritional status and fruit and vegetable consumption. Few reviews examined child health outcomes of garden-based interventions that were not nutrition related, such as physical activity, or academic performance. Across settings, there was the most evidence in support of garden-based interventions conducted in home gardens, compared to evidence from early care and education or community settings. We were unable to report on most effective components of garden-based interventions due to limitations of included reviews. CONCLUSIONS Existing evidence is difficult to interpret due to methodological limitations at both the review and primary study level. Therefore, the lack of evidence for certain child health outcomes should not necessarily be interpreted as an absence of an effect of garden-based interventions for specific outcomes, but as a product of these limitations. Given the breadth of evidence for garden-based interventions to improve a number of dimensions of health with older children and adult populations, we highlight areas of future research to address evidence gaps identified in this umbrella review. Further research on the role of garden-based interventions, including their impact on non-nutrition early childhood health outcomes and how effectiveness differs by setting type is necessary to fully understand their role in early childhood health promotion.

111903,Fitness training programs for hypertensive patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-02-08,"PURPOSE To describe a technique to approach chronic total occlusions (CTOs) of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) after failed antegrade recanalization as an alternative to a conventional transpopliteal approach. METHODS A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 50 patients (37 men; mean age 71 years) who underwent retrograde recanalization via a distal SFA access after failed antegrade recanalization of SFA CTOs that were not beyond the adductor canal. Antegrade recanalization failed due to flush SFA occlusion, occluded stents, wire perforation, and re-entry failure. Retrograde SFA access required introduction of a 7- to 15-cm, 21-G needle distal to the occlusion. A 0.018-inch guidewire was inserted through the needle followed by a 4- or 6-F, 10-cm sheath or dedicated support catheter only. All retrograde SFA punctures were performed with the patient in the supine position. Once retrograde passage of the occlusion was successful, oftentimes requiring a ""double-balloon"" technique to disrupt the dissection membrane with abutting balloons delivered from both access sites, balloon angioplasty and/or stenting could be performed from either direction. RESULTS Retrograde puncture of the distal SFA was successful in all cases. Retrograde recanalization involved insertion of a 6-F sheath in 3 (6%) cases, a 4-F sheath in 32 (64%), and a sheathless approach in 15 (30%). The ""double-balloon"" technique was necessary to achieve guidewire passage in 12 cases. Recanalization was successful in 48 (96%) cases. Hemostasis time at the distal puncture site was 9.2 minutes (range 3-30). Perioperative complications included 4 pseudoaneurysms (2 groins, 2 distal), 1 peripheral embolization, and 1 small arteriovenous fistula at the distal puncture site. CONCLUSION For failure of antegrade recanalization of SFA occlusions, the retrograde SFA puncture distal to the adductor canal with the patient remaining supine is a safe and successful technique that represents a convenient alternative to the conventional transpopliteal approach.","Schmidt, Andrej; Bausback, Yvonne; Piorkowski, Michael; Werner, Martin; Bräunlich, Sven; Ulrich, Matthias; Varcoe, Ramon; Friedenberger, Josef; Schuster, Johannes; Botsios, Spiridon; Scheinert, Dierk",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/11-3645.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22313197/,366

It has a social dimension and is shaped by various social factors. DATA We employ original data from a large survey (N = 20,632) conducted in China from April 21 to 23, 2020, which provide us with a rare opportunity to investigate COVID-19-induced worry among ordinary Chinese citizens. RESULTS We find individuals' socioeconomic status, family characteristics, sense of community, and perceived strictness of lockdown measures all have significant influences on worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status such as better education, better income, and more prestigious occupations have richer resources in coping with COVID-19 and are thus less worried. Second, the high human-to-human transmissibility of COVID-19 and increased family obligations during the pandemic imply that larger family size can be a worry-inducing burden. Individuals living with larger families are more worried. Third, a greater sense of community lowers worry as it buffers against the stressor and may enhance individuals' faith in the community's efficacy in containing the virus. Last, stringent lockdown measures may actually have positive psychological effects. They provide real and perceived protection and increase individuals' perceived distance from the disease, thereby reducing public worry.","Zhou, Min; Guo, Wei",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33878665/,366

Endovascular embolization is commonly used as an adjunct prior to surgical resection because it is believed to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding. Embolization has been associated with other complications including visual deficits, vessel perforation, and catheter adhesion. Catheter adhesion in which retained segments are contained within the embolization cast are not necessarily cause for concern, but retention of larger portions may confer an increased risk of thrombus formation. Such cases warrant the removal of the retained segments or the patient may suffer serious complications including death related to cerebrovascular events. In this case report, we describe a unique case of catheter adhesion in which the extension of the feeding catheter and the length of the introducer was left in its entirety down to the entry portion at the level of the groin and later retrieved in its entirety by craniotomy.","Shazadeh Safavi, Pejma; Desai, Sohum; Branch, Daniel; Ortega-Barnett, Juan R",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.1164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28507836/,366

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of biologically active compounds in the marine sponge on the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase protein (RdRp) using the in-silico method. A total of 51 marine compounds were checked for their possible interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp using Maestro interface for molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, and MM/GBSA method to estimate compounds binding affinities. Among the 51 compounds screened in this study, two (mycalamide A, and nakinadine B) exhibited the lowest docking energy and best interaction. Among these compounds, mycalamide A was identified as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp that showed the best and stable interaction during molecular dynamic simulation, with residues (Asp760 and Asp761) found in the catalytic domain of RdRp. The analysis through MM/GBSA for molecular dynamic simulation results revealed binding energy -59.7 ± 7.18 for Mycalamide A and -56 ± 10.55 for Nakinadine B.

We examined the fungi inhabiting standing leaf litter of Schizachyrium scoparium and Schizachyrium tenerum in a Longleaf Pine savanna ecosystem and estimated their contribution to litter decomposition. We identified fungal phylotypes associated with leaf litter and quantified leaf C mass loss, fungal biomass production, and microbial respiration during decomposition. These data were used to construct budgets estimating C flow into and through fungi. Significant losses in S. scoparium (55%) and S. tenerum (67%) leaf C mass were observed during standing decomposition along with concomitant increases in fungal biomass, which reached a maximum of 36 and 33 mgC/g detrital C, respectively. Cumulative fungal production during decomposition totaled 99 ± 6 mgC/g initial detrital C in S. scoparium and 73 ± 5 mgC/g initial detrital C in S. tenerum, indicating that 18 and 11% of the litter C was converted into fungal biomass, respectively. Corresponding estimates of cumulative fungal respiration totaled 106 ± 7 and 174 ± 11 mgC/g initial detrital C in S. scoparium and S. tenerum, respectively. Next generation sequencing identified several fungal phylotypes, with the majority of sequences belonging to the Ascomycota (Dothideomycetes) and Basidiomycota (Agaricomycetes). Fungal phylotypes were similar between litter species and changed over time, showing a successional pattern. These findings extend our understanding of fungal processes to standing litter in terrestrial ecosystems, and highlight the quantitative importance of fungi in C cycling processes.","Lodato, Matthew B; Boyette, Jerrid S; Smilo, Rachel A; Jackson, Colin R; Halvorson, Halvor M; Kuehn, Kevin A",Oecologia,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04838-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423104/,366
114981,"A Virtual Coaching Workshop for a Nurse-Led Community-Based Palliative Care Team in Liberia, West Africa, to Promote Staff Well-Being During COVID-19.",2021-04-30,"Peptide triazole thiols (PTTs) have been found previously to bind to HIV-1 Env spike gp120 and cause irreversible virus inactivation by shedding gp120 and lytically releasing luminal capsid protein p24. Since the virions remain visually intact, lysis appears to occur via limited membrane destabilization. To better understand the PTT-triggered membrane transformation involved, we investigated the role of envelope cholesterol on p24 release by measuring the effect of cholesterol depletion using methyl beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD). An unexpected bell-shaped response of PTT-induced lysis to [MβCD] was observed, involving lysis enhancement at low [MβCD] vs loss of function at high [MβCD]. The impact of cholesterol depletion on PTT-induced lysis was reversed by adding exogenous cholesterol and other sterols that support membrane rafts, while sterols that do not support rafts induced only limited reversal. Cholesterol depletion appears to cause a reduced energy barrier to lysis as judged by decreased temperature dependence with MβCD. Enhancement/replenishment responses to [MβCD] also were observed for HIV-1 infectivity, consistent with a similar energy barrier effect in the membrane transformation of virus cell fusion. Overall, the results argue that cholesterol in the HIV-1 envelope is important for balancing virus stability and membrane transformation, and that partial depletion, while increasing infectivity, also makes the virus more fragile. The results also reinforce the argument that the lytic inactivation and infectivity processes are mechanistically related and that membrane transformations occurring during lysis can provide an experimental window to investigate membrane and protein factors important for HIV-1 cell entry.","Kalyana Sundaram, Ramalingam Venkat; Li, Huiyuan; Bailey, Lauren; Rashad, Adel A; Aneja, Rachna; Weiss, Karl; Huynh, James; Bastian, Arangaserry Rosemary; Papazoglou, Elisabeth; Abrams, Cameron; Wrenn, Steven; Chaiken, Irwin",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26713837/,366

BACKGROUND Public health guidance for those aged 70 or older was predominantly to undertake stringent social distancing within their household. Little is known about older people's experience of these measures. This paper explores changes experienced by those over the age of 70 during the first two weeks of household isolation, social distancing and shielding in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, and their early perceptions and plans to support them through the pandemic. METHODS An inductive phenomenological study. University staff posted the study invitation flyer on social media, such as WhatsApp neighbourhood groups, the NextDoor App and twitter. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 19 participants and repeated at two week intervals for 10 weeks, further data collection is still in progress. This paper presents the findings from the baseline interviews, which showed older peoples' early responses. The COREQ (COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research) Checklist was adhered to in the reporting of this study. RESULTS Three themes emerged from older people's early experiences of social distancing: protective measures; current and future plans; and acceptance of a good life, but still a life to live. CONCLUSION People over 70 adapted to household isolation, social distancing and shielding, by using social media and neighbourhood resources. Nurses and other professionals can develop holistic care for older people by listening to their experiences of what works for them, helping them link to local and distant supports. Understanding the holistic life view of older people, including death anxiety, is an important element of care planning; to help older people access the protective resources they need to reduce the serious risks associated with coronavirus.","Brooke, Joanne; Clark, Maria",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891063/,366
116478,Participation during a Pandemic: Forging New Pathways.,2021-01-28,"Landfill leachate contains high concentrations of complex organic matter (OM) that can severely impact the ecological environment. If landfill leachate is to be treated using a combined ""biological + advanced treatment"" process, the molecular information of OM must be investigated to optimize the operation parameters of the combined process and maximize the removal of organic pollutants. This study applied ultra-high resolution mass spectroscopy to investigate the degradation and transformation characteristics of refractory OM in mature landfill leachate at the molecular level (m/z = 150-800) during biological treatment (i.e., semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter, SAARB) and subsequent chemical oxidation (i.e., the Fenton process and ozonation). After SAARB treatment, the polycyclic aromatics (aromatic index, AI > 0.66) and polyphenol (0.66 ≥ AI > 0.50) contents increased, and the highly unsaturated phenolic compounds (AI ≤ 0.50 and H/C < 1.5), which have a high bioavailability, were mostly removed. Compared with raw leachate, SAARB effluent (i.e., SAARB leachate) contained fewer organics with short carbon chains, more organics with long carbon chains, an elevated condensation degree for organics and, thus, a considerably reduced biodegradability. Although both the Fenton and ozonation processes could remove many of the polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols, ozone produced considerable amounts of aliphatic compounds with high bioavailability. Compared to ozonation, the Fenton process utilized the hydroxyl radical to non-selectively react with OM and produced better mineralization results.","Chen, Weiming; He, Chen; Gu, Zhepei; Wang, Fan; Li, Qibin",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887006/,366

Since the elevated CO2 environment predicted for the near future will reduce nitrate utilization by C3 species, ammonium is attracting great interest. However, abundant ammonium nutrition impairs growth, i.e., ammonium toxicity, the primary cause of which remains to be determined. Here, we show that ammonium assimilation by GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE 2 (GLN2) localized in the plastid rather than ammonium accumulation is a primary cause for toxicity, which challenges the textbook knowledge. With exposure to toxic levels of ammonium, the shoot GLN2 reaction produced an abundance of protons within cells, thereby elevating shoot acidity and stimulating expression of acidic stress-responsive genes. Application of an alkaline ammonia solution to the ammonium medium efficiently alleviated the ammonium toxicity with a concomitant reduction in shoot acidity.

In this study, we used optogenetic tools to investigate the impact of striatal neuronal activity on the neurogenesis and functional recovery after cerebral ischemia. We transfected striatal neurons with channelrhodopsin-2 or halorhodopsin from Natronomonas so that they can be excited by 473 nm laser or inhibited by 594 nm laser, respectively. Neural inhibition but not excitation at 4-7 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in reduced atrophy volume (6.8 ± 0.7 vs 8.5 ± 1.2 mm3, p < 0.05) and better performance represented by longer sustaining time on rotarod (99.3 ± 9 vs 80.1 ± 11 s, p < 0.01) and faster moving speed (7.7 ± 2 vs 5.7 ± 1.1 cm/s, p < 0.05) in open field tests. Furthermore, neural inhibition increased the number of nestin+, BrdU+/doublecortin+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells ( p < 0.001) in the subventricular zone and peri-focal region, and the expression level of axon guidance factor Netrin-1 (0.39 ± 0.16 vs 0.16 ± 0.02, p < 0.05) in the peri-focal region.

Gross and microscopic diagnoses were compared and classified as concordant, discordant, histology needed (i.e. indeterminate or unremarkable gross findings), or autolysed. Revisions made to the cause of death following histopathology were categorised as: altered direct cause of death, altered indirect cause of death, concordant with supportive information, irrelevant, or inconclusive. The study was limited to brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen. RESULTS Histopathology had been requested in 141 cases (27%), which were further analysed.

P. aeruginosa infection is notable for the appearance of a humoral response to some known antigens, such as flagellin C, elastase, alkaline protease, and others.

Here, we report a comprehensive study of all 262 outer membrane and exported P. aeruginosa PAO1 proteins by a modified protein microarray methodology called the nucleic acid-programmable protein array. From this study, it was possible to identify 12 proteins that trigger an adaptive immune response in cystic fibrosis and acutely infected patients, providing valuable information about which bacterial proteins are actually recognized by the immune system in vivo during the natural course of infection. The differential detections of these proteins in patients and controls proved to be statistically significant (P<0.01). The study provides a list of potential candidates for the improvement of serological diagnostics and the development of vaccines.","Montor, Wagner R; Huang, Jin; Hu, Yanhui; Hainsworth, Eugenie; Lynch, Susan; Kronish, Jeannine-Weiner; Ordonez, Claudia L; Logvinenko, Tanya; Lory, Stephen; LaBaer, Joshua",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00698-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19737893/,366

Building on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (H-EDRM) framework to strengthen preparedness, response, and recovery from health emergencies in the communities and emergency-prone settings, such as MGs. The Jeddah tool is derived from the H-EDRM framework as an all-hazard MG risk assessment tool, which provides a benchmark for monitoring progress made in capacity strengthening over a given period for recurrent MGs. Additionally, it introduces a reputational risk assessment domain to complement vulnerability and capacity assessment matrixes. This paper describes the key elements of the Jeddah tool to improve the understanding of health risk assessment at MGs in the overarching contexts of health emergencies and disaster risk reduction, in line with international goals.","Bieh, Kingsley L; Khan, Anas; El-Ganainy, Ahmed; Alotaibi, Badriah; Ghallab, Sujoud; Abdulmalek, Nour; Mukhtar, Nomai; Jokhdar, Hani",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33632362/,366
123319,"[Psychological factors of sleep and daytime complaints during the COVID-19 Lockdown: the role of anxiety, well-being, autonomy, and coping].",2021,"UNLABELLED The innate immune response is the first line of defense against viruses, and type I interferon (IFN) is a critical component of this response. Similar to other viruses, the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has evolved under evolutionary pressure to evade and counteract the IFN response to enable its survival. Previously, we reported that IBV induces a delayed activation of the IFN response. In the present work, we describe the resistance of IBV to IFN and the potential role of accessory proteins herein. We show that IBV is fairly resistant to the antiviral state induced by IFN and identify that viral accessory protein 3a is involved in resistance to IFN, as its absence renders IBV less resistant to IFN treatment. In addition to this, we found that independently of its accessory proteins, IBV inhibits IFN-mediated phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1. In summary, we show that IBV uses multiple strategies to counteract the IFN response. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we show that infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is resistant to IFN treatment and identify a role for accessory protein 3a in the resistance against the type I IFN response. We also demonstrate that, in a time-dependent manner, IBV effectively interferes with IFN signaling and that its accessory proteins are dispensable for this activity. This study demonstrates that the gammacoronavirus IBV, similar to its mammalian counterparts, has evolved multiple strategies to efficiently counteract the IFN response of its avian host, and it identifies accessory protein 3a as multifaceted antagonist of the avian IFN system.","Kint, Joeri; Dickhout, Annemiek; Kutter, Jasmin; Maier, Helena J; Britton, Paul; Koumans, Joseph; Pijlman, Gorben P; Fros, Jelke J; Wiegertjes, Geert F; Forlenza, Maria",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01057-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26401035/,366

METHOD The Recovery-oriented Acute INpatient (RAIN) scale was based on prior literature and current Veterans Health Administration (VHA) policy and resources and further revised based on data collection from 34 VHA acute inpatient units. RESULTS A final scale of 23, behaviorally anchored items demonstrated a four-factor structure including the following factors: inpatient treatment planning, outpatient treatment planning, group programming, and milieu. While several items require additional revision to address psychometric concerns, the scale demonstrated adequate model fit and was consistent with prior literature on recovery-oriented inpatient care. Conclusions and Implementations for Practice: The RAIN scale represents an important tool for future implementation and empirical study of recovery-oriented inpatient care.

OBJECTIVE We identify the 10 most important manuscripts for clinical practice in consultation-liaison psychiatry from 2020 using the new Importance and Quality (IQ) instrument for assessing scientific literature. METHODS The Subcommittee published annotated abstracts for 97 articles on the Academy website in 2020. Reviewers then rated all articles on clinical importance to practice and quality of scholarship using the IQ instrument. We describe the 10 articles with the highest aggregate scores and analyze the reliability of IQ instrument. RESULTS Twenty-four raters identified the top 10 scoring articles of 2020. These papers provide practical guidance on key areas of consultation-liaison psychiatry including management of COVID-19, lithium treatment for complex patients, medical risks among patients with severe mental illness, and substance use disorders in medical settings. The assessment instrument demonstrated good to excellent interrater reliability. CONCLUSION These articles offer valuable guidance for consultation-liaison psychiatrists regardless of their practice area.

We aimed to test the correspondence between DP(AW) and transpulmonary driving pressure (DP(TP))-the quotient of V(T) and lung compliance (C(L)), in response to intra-abdominal hypertension and changes in positive end-expiratory pressure during different models of lung pathology. DESIGN Well-controlled experimental setting that allowed reversible modification of chest wall compliance (C(CW)) in a variety of models of lung pathology. SETTING Large animal laboratory of a university-affiliated hospital. SUBJECTS Ten deeply anesthetized swine. INTERVENTIONS Application of intra-abdominal pressures of 0 and 20 cm H2O at positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 and 10 cm H2O, under volume-controlled mechanical ventilation in the settings of normal lungs (baseline), unilateral whole-lung atelectasis, and unilateral and bilateral lung injuries caused by saline lavage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Pulmonary mechanics including esophageal pressure and calculations of DP(AW), DP(TP), C(RS), C(L), and C(CW). When compared with normal intra-abdominal pressures, intra-abdominal hypertension increased DP(AW), during both ""normal lung conditions"" (p < 0.0001) and ""unilateral atelectasis"" (p = 0.0026). In contrast, DP(TP) remained virtually unaffected by changes in positive end-expiratory pressure or intra-abdominal pressures in both conditions. During unilateral lung injury, both DPA(W) and DP(TP) were increased by the presence of intra-abdominal hypertension (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0222, respectively). During bilateral lung injury, intra-abdominal hypertension increased both DP(AW) (at positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 cm H2O, p < 0.0001; and at positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O, p = 0.0091) and DP(TP) (at positive end-expiratory pressure of 1 cm H2O, p = 0.0510; and at positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm H2O, p = 0.0335). CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that DP(AW) is influenced by reductions in chest wall compliance and by underlying lung properties. As with other measures of pulmonary mechanics that are based on unmodified P(AW), caution is advised in attempting to attribute hazard or safety to any specific absolute value of DP(AW).","Cortes-Puentes, Gustavo A; Keenan, Joseph C; Adams, Alexander B; Parker, Emily D; Dries, David J; Marini, John J",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186478/,366

The aim of this retrospective study is to report oncologic outcome and toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) in PCa patients affected by pelvic nodal oligorecurrence. METHODS 41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients. Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered using tomotherapy. 83% of the patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with ENRT. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. RESULTS The median at follow-up was 33.6 months. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) were 89%, 92%, and 53%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all survival end-points were correlated with the number of positive pelvic lymph nodes at oligorecurrence (≤ 3 vs > 3). Biochemical-PFS was correlated with PSA (p = 0.034) and PSA doubling time (p = 0.004) at oligorecurrence. At multivariate analysis, no independent variable was statistically significant. No patient experienced grade ≥ 2 late toxicity after radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS The number of metastatic lymph nodes and PSA doubling time seems to be important prognostic factors in the pelvic oligorecurrent setting. Salvage radiotherapy combined with short-course ADT might be a valid treatment strategy.","Ingrosso, G; Mariucci, C; Tenti, M V; Bini, V; Alì, E; Saldi, S; Palumbo, I; Bellavita, R; Aristei, C",Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12094-020-02364-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418156/,366
126230,Selecting candidates for veno-venous ECMO during COVID-19 pandemic: the importance of an ECMO team.,2021-03-24,"One of the most important and earliest measures of burn healing is wound reepithelialization. Reepithelialization is a vital determinant of wound infection and scarring. Reepithelialization is generally based on gross visual assessment; however, histological assessment remains the criterion standard. We hypothesized that there would be poor agreement (r < .4) between gross visual and histological assessments of burn reepithelialization in a porcine model. The study design was prospective observational using three anesthetized female pigs (20-25 kg). Forty-eight 2.5- × 2.5-cm burns were created on the flanks of pig's using an aluminum bar (150 g) preheated to 80°C for 20 seconds. Burns were treated with an occlusive or antimicrobial dressing and photographed at day 10 for determination of gross percentage reepithelialization in a 1-cm diameter circle in the center of the burn by two experienced clinicians masked to each other's measurements. A 10-mm full-thickness punch biopsy was taken from the center of the burns and evaluated by a board-certified dermatopathologist masked to clinical assessments. One clinician and the dermatopathologist repeated the assessments 1 month apart. The outcome was percentage wound reepithelialization at 10 days. The criterion standard was the histological assessment. Intraobserver and interobserver agreements were calculated with Pearson's correlation coefficients. A coefficient less than .4 was considered poor. Sixteen burns were created on each of three animals. Six wounds were excluded because of the presence of a thick eschar covering the burn, making the gross determination of reepithelialization impossible. Intraobserver agreement for histological reepithelialization was 0.96 (P < .001). Intraobserver agreement for gross visual assessment of reepithelialization was 0.75 (P < .001). Interobserver agreement for gross visual assessment of reepithelialization was 0.60 (P < .001). The agreement between gross visual and histological assessment of burn reepithelialization was -0.25. Although there was a good interobserver agreement for gross visual assessments, there was a poor agreement between gross visual and histological assessments of burn reepithelialization. Care should be used when determining burn reepithelialization based on gross visual assessments alone.","Singer, Adam J; Hirth, Douglas; McClain, Steve A; Clark, Richard A F",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0b013e3182331de2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983645/,366
126401,"Could COVID-19 become a policy tipping point? a Q&A with Kavita K. Patel, MD, MS.",2020-10-01,"INTRODUCTION There is a large body of literature that shows that the AirTraq device achieves equal or superior rates of successful intubation in all classes of user. A recent prospective human trial of the device questioned the first pass success rate and whether effective training could occur outside the Operating Room (OR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the first pass success rate for intubation with the AirTraq (AT) device utilizing only mannequin training in an air ambulance setting from Aug. 1 2009 to Aug. 1 2012 and compare it to direct laryngoscopy (DL). HYPOTHESIS We hypothesize that the AirTraq device will be as effective overall as direct laryngoscopy, and that this requires no OR training to achieve. METHODS A retrospective chart review of 161 intubations by air ambulance flight nurses from Aug. 1, 2009 to Aug. 1, 2012 was conducted. Data regarding date of service, devices used, number of attempts, rescue device use, and complications was gathered and analyzed. The generalized estimating equation and the chi-squared test were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS 161 intubations were reviewed. 135 met inclusion criteria. Overall first pass success rate for AT was 82% (68/83) and DL was 74% (35/47). Overall first use success rate for AT was 79% (71/90) and DL was 70% (43/61). The overall success rate of intubation for any patient in which either AT or DL was attempted is 96% (130/135). CONCLUSION AirTraq was shown to be as effective as direct laryngoscopy. All air crew training for the AirTraq device was performed on mannequins. The successof the device compared to DL shows that mannequin training is sufficient to implement the AirTraq device for pre-hospital intubation.","Selde, William; English, Kyle; Heffelfinger, Matthew; Eichel, Jan; Ekblad, Glenn",Air medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amj.2014.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25441532/,366

Only about 10 cases have been reported in the English-language literature to date. In this report, we present a rare case of a giant EIC with infection arising within the deep breast parenchyma. Unlike a typical EIC of the breast, the EIC in the present case was a cystic and solid lesion containing a large amount of liquid within the cyst and popcorn-like calcification in the wall. In this report, we describe the contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM), ultrasonography, and computed tomography findings and provide a reference for the diagnosis of EICs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the CESM findings of an EIC. Our case illustrates that CESM has excellent performance similar to that of magnetic resonance imaging and is much more effective than conventional digital mammography. Additionally, our case indicates that precise correlation of CESM with ultrasonography findings contributes to the diagnosis of EICs.

METHODS A 3-year prospective descriptive study was conducted among Cambodian children admitted to 2 provincial hospitals for acute lower respiratory tract infection. Molecular detection for 18 viral pathogens using multiplex polymerase chain reaction/reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions was performed. RESULTS We enrolled 1006 children less than 5 years of age of whom 423 (42%), 428 (42%) and 155 (16%) had pneumonia, bronchiolitis and unclassified lower respiratory tract infections, respectively. Of the 551 (55%) with documented viral infection, a single virus was detected in 491 (89%), including rhinovirus (n = 169; 34%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 167; 34%), parainfluenza virus (n = 40; 8%), human metapneumovirus (n = 39; 8%), influenza virus (n = 31; 6%), bocavirus (n = 16; 3%), adenovirus (n = 15; 3%), coronavirus (n = 9; 2%) and enterovirus (n = 5; 1%).

Previously we demonstrated that doxycycline improved cardio-renal function through matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 inhibition in an acute swine model of neonatal hypoxia-reoxygenation. The prolonged cardio-renal protective effects of doxycycline in neonates still remained unknown. We therefore hypothesized that the protective effects of doxycycline persisted in surviving subjects. Methods: Newborn piglets were instrumented and subjected to 1 h of hypoxia followed by reoxygenation with 21-25% oxygen and observed for 4 days. Intravenous doxycycline (30 mg/kg) or normal saline (1 mL, saline-control group) was given at 5 min of reoxygenation (n = 8/group) in a randomized, blinded fashion. Sham-operated piglets (n = 5) received no hypoxia-reoxygenation. At 96 h after reoxygenation, the left ventricular function was assessed by Millar® catheter. Renal injury was investigated by measuring plasma creatinine, urinary N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase activity, renal tissue lactate and MMP-2 activity. Results: Both hypoxia-reoxygenation groups had similar hypoxic stress with severe lactate acidosis, and hemodynamic recovery. Doxycycline-treated piglets had higher urine output with lower urine N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase, plasma creatinine, and renal MMP-2 activity (vs. saline-controls; all p < 0.05). These markers were all negatively correlated with urine output. Conclusions: In newborn piglets surviving hypoxia-reoxygenation, we observed a weak but significant and persistent attenuation of renal injury and improved recovery with the post-resuscitation administration of doxycycline.","Lee, Tze-Fun; Lu, Min; Pasquin, Matteo P; Schmölzer, Georg M; Cheung, Po-Yin",Frontiers in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2019.00075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30968002/,366

However, the current evidence is heterogeneous and needs further reviewing to direct future studies. We aimed to systematically review whether HIE severity is associated with HRV. METHODS This systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analyses (PRISMA). We included studies comparing neonates with severe or moderate HIE with neonates with mild or no HIE with respect to different HRV measures within 7 days of birth. Article selection and quality assessment was independently performed by two reviewers. Risk of bias and strength of evidence was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS We screened 1187 studies. From these, four observational studies with 248 neonates were included. For all HRV measures, the strength of evidence was very low. Neonates with severe or moderate HIE showed a reduction in most HRV measures compared to neonates with mild or no HIE with a greater reduction in those with severe HIE. CONCLUSIONS Moderate and severe HIE was associated with a reduction in most HRV measures. Accordingly, HRV is a potential biomarker for HIE severity during the first week of life. However, the uncertainty calls for more studies.","Andersen, Mads; Andelius, Ted C K; Pedersen, Mette V; Kyng, Kasper J; Henriksen, Tine B",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-019-1603-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31324176/,366

The Satter House Trial of Reduced Sodium Meals (SOTRUE) was an individual-level, double-blind, randomized controlled pilot study of adults living in a congregate living facility subsidized by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Adults over age 60 years ate 3 isocaloric meals with two snacks daily for 14 days. The meal plans differed in sodium density (<0.95 vs. >2 mg/kcal), but were equivalent in potassium and macronutrients. Seated systolic BP (SBP) was the primary outcome, while urine sodium-creatinine ratio was used to measure compliance. Twenty participants were randomized (95% women; 95% white; mean age 78 ± 8 years), beginning in 7 October 2019. Retention was 100% with the last participant ending 4 November 2019. Mean baseline SBP changed from 121 to 116 mmHg with the typical sodium diet (-5 mmHg; 95% CI: -18, 8) and from 123 to 112 mmHg with the low sodium diet (-11 mmHg; 95% CI: -15.2, -7.7).

The 2009 H1N1 virus spread initially to the United States and Canada, with subsequent rapid global dissemination, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare ""a public health emergency of international concern"" in April 2009, and upgrading the viral threat to pandemic status in June 2009. Despite initial fears, the severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic overall did not differ significantly from that of seasonal influenza. However, the demographics of those at risk of severe illness did differ (affecting children and young adults, rather than the very young and the very old). The 2009 H1N1 pandemic led to rapid implementation of health care initiatives, including the provision of critical care services, to limit the effect of the influenza outbreak on the community. This review focuses on the critical care response to the H1N1 pandemic and examines whether the implementation of critical care services as planned a priori matched the reality of the clinical workload and the patient burden that transpired during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.","Westall, Glen P; Paraskeva, Miranda",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1283280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21858745/,366

We provide a theoretical framework to the severe immunopathology of COVID-19 in patients with metabolic diseases. We finally discuss the idea of exercise as a potential adjuvant against COVID-19 and emphasize how even interrupting prolonged periods of sitting with short time breaks of very light activity could be a feasible strategy to limit the deleterious effects of the outbreak.","Methnani, Jabeur; Amor, Dorra; Yousfi, Nariman; Bouslama, Ali; Omezzine, Asma; Bouhlel, Ezdine",The Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0022-4707.20.11898-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305550/,366
133475,Exergaming for people with major neurocognitive disorder: a qualitative study.,2020-09-23,"Abnormal protein aggregations are essential pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Eliminating while inhibiting the regeneration of these protein aggregates is considered an effective treatment strategy. Herein, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool is employed to inhibit the regeneration of disease-related proteins, while chemical drugs are applied to eliminate the proteins that are produced. To efficiently deliver CRISPR-chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano-biohybrid complexes (F-TBIO) are constructed by one-step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF-TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF-TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid-β, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg-AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg-AD mice are still significantly improved. During the therapeutic process, CF-TBIO with a high relaxation rate provides accurate imaging signals in the complex brain physiological environment. The finding shows that CF-TBIO has great potential to serve as a CRISPR-chem drug-delivery platform for neurodegenerative diseases therapy.","Shen, Jie; Lu, Zhiguo; Wang, Jianze; Hao, Qiulian; Ji, Weihong; Wu, Yanyue; Peng, Huan; Zhao, Ruichen; Yang, Jun; Li, Yan; Shi, Zhuyan; Zhang, Xin",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202101993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046943/,366

134819,COVID-19 control in the United States: the case for masking.,2021-07-01,"OBJECT Flow diverters are increasingly used for treatment of intracranial aneurysms. In most series, the Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) was used for the treatment of large, giant, complex, and fusiform aneurysms. Little is known about the use of the PED in small aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the PED in small aneurysms (≤ 7 mm). METHODS A total of 100 consecutive patients were treated with the PED at the authors' institution between May 2011 and September 2013. Data on procedural safety and efficacy were retrospectively collected. RESULTS The mean aneurysm size was 5.2 ± 1.5 mm. Seven patients (7%) had sustained a subarachnoid hemorrhage. All except 5 aneurysms (95%) arose from the anterior circulation. The number of PEDs used was 1.2 per aneurysm. Symptomatic procedure-related complications occurred in 3 patients (3%): 1 distal parenchymal hemorrhage that was managed conservatively and 2 ischemic events. At the latest follow-up (mean 6.3 months), 54 (72%) aneurysms were completely occluded (100%), 10 (13%) were nearly completely occluded (≥ 90%), and 11 (15%) were incompletely occluded (< 90%). Six aneurysms (8%) required further treatment. Increasing aneurysm size (OR 3.8, 95% CI 0.99-14; p = 0.05) predicted retreatment. All patients achieved a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale Score 0-2) at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In this study, treatment of small aneurysms with the PED was associated with low complication rates and high aneurysm occlusion rates. These findings suggest that the PED is a safe and effective alternative to conventional endovascular techniques for small aneurysms. Randomized trials with long-term follow-up are necessary to determine the optimal treatment that leads to the highest rate of obliteration and the best clinical outcomes.","Chalouhi, Nohra; Zanaty, Mario; Whiting, Alex; Yang, Steven; Tjoumakaris, Stavropoula; Hasan, David; Starke, Robert M; Hann, Shannon; Hammer, Christine; Kung, David; Rosenwasser, Robert; Jabbour, Pascal",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.12.jns14411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25635478/,366

First, we placed two or three trocars through the same infra-umbilical skin incision. Then, we either elevated the tumor with a mini-loop retractor or retracted the gastric wall near the tumor with a laparoscopic grasper. Finally, we resected the tumor using an endoscopic linear stapler. Single-incision laparoscopic gastric resection was successfully completed in all three patients without the need for any extraumbilical skin incisions or conversion to conventional laparoscopic procedures. There was no morbidity. The mean operating time and blood loss were 86 min and 4 ml, respectively, and the mean tumor size and surgical margin were 34 mm and 8 mm, respectively. Histopathologically, two tumors were diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumors and one as a carcinoid tumor. Thus, single-incision laparoscopic gastric resection for submucosal tumors is safe and feasible when performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons using conventional laparoscopic instruments.","Sasaki, Akira; Koeda, Keisuke; Nakajima, Jun; Obuchi, Toru; Baba, Shigeaki; Wakabayashi, Go",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-009-4204-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21191706/,366

Thus, we aimed to investigate pleural drainage effectiveness by focusing on preprocedure patient status. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 22 patients with pleural effusion. Gas exchange, ventilator settings, vital signs, inflammatory response, and nutrition status were examined preprocedure and 24 h and 1 week postprocedure. Data were analyzed using the non-parametric test and discriminant analysis with receiver operating characteristic curves. Results The partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) to fraction of inspiratory oxygen (FIO2) (P/F) ratio at 24 h was higher postdrainage than predrainage (250 ± 87 versus 196 ± 84, P < 0.05); however, no significant difference between the P/F ratio predrainage and 1 week postdrainage was noted. Patients were classified into effective and ineffective groups according to a 110% increase in the P/F ratio 1 week postdrainage compared with predrainage. The predrainage P/F ratio was lower in the effective group than in the ineffective group (165 ± 91 versus 217 ± 74, P < 0.05). Discriminant analysis showed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.72; the cut-off value of the predrainage P/F ratio (divided into effective and ineffective groups) was 174. Conclusions Pleural drainage could be effective in patients who have lower preprocedure P/F ratios.","Sakurai, Masako; Morinaga, Kentaro; Shimoyama, Keiichiro; Mishima, Shiro; Oda, Jun",Acute medicine & surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742663/,366

This study aims to explore the factors influencing OMS utilization (OMSU) for patients in micro-, meso-, and macrosystems based on socioecological theory (SET) and from the perspective of the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model. We selected 1065 participants through multistage stratified cluster random sampling in Jiangsu, China. In microsystems, information and behavioral skills were positively associated with intention (β = 0.84; β = 3.21) and actual utilization (OR = 1.69; OR = 1.69). Education level (β = 0.83) and personal motivation (β = 1.68) were positively related to intention. Chronic diseases (OR = 2.03) had a positive relationship with actual use. In mesosystems, recommendations from people around the patients (β = 1.14; OR = 1.99), provision of OMS in the nearest primary medical facility (β = 0.98; OR = 3.60), and provision of instructional information by medical institutions (β = 1.01; OR = 1.65) were related to OMSU. The average monthly household income (β = 0.54) was related to intention. Patients who had information about the OMSU experiences of people around them (OR = 1.73) correlated with actual utilization. In macrosystems, the social medical insurance type (OR = 0.66) was associated with OMSU. This study supports the applicability of the SET and IMB model to interpret patients' OMSU.","Zhang, Chi; Peng, Xue-Qing; Jiang, Yong-Zhi; Liu, Rui; Qi, Zi-Xin; Zhou, Meng; Zhao, Shi-Qi; Ge, Jin-Jin; You, Hua; Li, Zhi-Guang",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14609; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983658/,366

In this study, the efficacy and safety of fentanyl citrate patches was evaluated in opioid-naïve patients suffering from cancer pain. METHODS An open-label uncontrolled study was conducted in opioid-naïve patients with cancer pain unable to be controlled by non-opioid analgesics. Fentanyl citrate patches starting at a low dose (0.5 mg/patch, corresponding to 6.25 μg/h fentanyl delivered) were applied once/day for up to 14 days. The analgesic effect was assessed every day from the visual analogue scale pain score and the number of doses of rescue medication. When improvement of the analgesic effect was ""significant"" or ""moderate"" at a certain dose for three consecutive days, the patient was classified as a ""responder"" and was considered to have ""completed"" the study. RESULTS A fentanyl citrate patch was administered to 208 of 209 enrolled patients. In the full-analysis set, 87.0% of the patients were ""responders"" (95% confidence interval 81.7-91.3%). In 148 patients, the optimum dose was low (0.5 mg in 99, and 1 mg in 49), with patients finishing the study on days 4-8. Following dose escalation to 4 mg, respiratory depression occurred in one patient; however, this was considered a mild adverse event. CONCLUSION A low-dose fentanyl citrate patch was effective in the management of cancer pain in opioid-naïve patients and was well tolerated.

Monopolar electrosurgery compared with other energy sources is associated with unique characteristics and inherent risks and complications caused by inadvertent direct or capacitive coupling or insulation failure of instruments. These dangers become particularly important with the reemergence of single-port laparoscopy, which requires close proximity and crossing of multiple intraabdominal instruments outside the surgeon's field of view. STUDY OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of monopolar electrosurgery on various tissues/organs during simulated single-port laparoscopic surgery in vitro and in vivo. DESIGN Simulation in a dry laboratory with fresh sheep liver, pig bowel and bowel in an anesthetized dog (Canadian Classification II-3). SETTING University-affiliated teaching hospital and animal facilities. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS We used Valleylab Force 2 and FX electrosurgical generators at clinically used power outputs of 40 to 60 watts, and both high- and low-voltage (coagulation and cut) waveforms and commercially-available single-port devices. The effect on tissue was recorded by pictures and video camera and graded visually and histologically with hematoxylin and eosin stains. During activation of any standard monopolar laparoscopic instrument (scissors, coagulating electrode, etc), capacitive coupled currents resulting in visible tissue burn (blanching) caused by other adjacent cold instrument (graspers, etc) including metallic suction-irrigation cannulas and the laparoscope itself were noted. Histopathologic study confirmed transmural thermal damage extending to the mucosa of small bowel, even in the presence of mild serosa blanching. With prolonged activation of the electrosurgical generator, the capacitive coupled corona discharge burned the insulation and caused rapid insulation breakdown of the electrode instrument resulting in direct coupling (sparking, arcing) to adjacent cold instruments and more severe burning to the contacted tissue/organ. CONCLUSIONS During single-port laparoscopy and use of monopolar radiofrequency, the proximity and crossing of multiple instruments generate capacitive or direct coupled currents, which may cause visceral burns.","Abu-Rafea, Basim; Vilos, George A; Al-Obeed, Omar; AlSheikh, Abdulmalik; Vilos, Angelos G; Al-Mandeel, Hazem",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2011.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21925969/,366

Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that the phenomenology of depression may differ during childhood and adolescence. However, participants in these studies may not reflect depressed young people referred to routine clinical services. The aim of this paper was to describe referrals for depression to a UK routine public healthcare service for children and adolescents with mental health difficulties. METHOD This paper describes a consecutive series of adolescents (N = 100, aged 12-17 years), referred for depression to a routine public healthcare child and adolescent mental health service, in the south of England. Young people and their caregivers completed a structured diagnostic interview and self-report measures of anxiety and depression. RESULTS Fewer than half of young people referred for depression met diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. The key symptoms reported by those with depression were low mood or irritability, cognitive disturbances, sleep disturbances and negative self-perceptions. Suicidal ideation was common and was considerably higher than reported in other studies. Caregiver and young person's accounts of adolescent symptoms of depression and anxiety were uncorrelated. Caregivers also reported fewer symptoms of depression in their child than adolescents themselves. CONCLUSIONS These data have direct relevance to the design and delivery of public mental health services for children and adolescents. However, we do not know how representative this sample is of other clinical populations in the UK or in other countries.

We aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to address these uncertainties, and inform efforts to prevent and treat heart failure. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Protocols statement was used as a template for this protocol. A systematic search of Medline, Embase and Global Health from database inception to present will be conducted to identify prospective studies reporting on the associations between major measures of body composition (body mass index, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, total body fat, visceral adiposity tissue and lean mass) and risk of heart failure. Article screening and selection will be performed by two reviewers independently, and disagreements will be adjudicated by consensus or by a third reviewer. Data from eligible articles will be extracted, and article quality will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Relative risks (and 95% CIs) will be pooled in a fixed effect meta-analysis, if there is no prohibitive heterogeneity of studies as assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic and I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses will be by age, sex, ethnicity and heart failure subtypes. Publication bias in the meta-analysis will be assessed using Egger's test and funnel plots.

Our objective was thus to quantify the differences in the minor radius of the coagulation zone computed by including and ignoring the cooling phase. We built models of RF tumor ablation with 2 needle-like electrodes: a dry electrode (5 mm long and 17G in diameter) with a constant temperature protocol (70°C) and a cooled electrode (30 mm long and 17G in diameter) with a protocol of impedance control. We observed that the computed coagulation zone dimensions were always underestimated when the cooling phase was ignored. The mean values of the differences computed along the electrode axis were always lower than 0.15 mm for the dry electrode and 1.5 mm for the cooled electrode, which implied a value lower than 5% of the minor radius of the coagulation zone (which was 3 mm for the dry electrode and 30 mm for the cooled electrode).

The pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial, and accordingly, our main objective was to review possible components of this form of acute kidney injury. DATA SOURCES Literature review. DATA SYNTHESIS Our principal observation was that the various components of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury appear to be relatively similar to the classical forms. Temporality of injury is an important factor but is not specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury. Several insults hit the kidney at different moments in the course of disease, some occurring prior to hospital admission, whereas others take place at various stages during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury cannot be approached in a ""one-size-fits-all"" manner. The numerous mechanisms involved do not occur simultaneously, leading to a multiple hit model that may contribute to the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury. A personalized approach to each patient with acute kidney injury based on the timing and severity of disease is necessary in order to provide appropriate treatment.

In this study, based on the thiolysis reaction of 7-nitro-2, 1, 3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) ether, the commonly used chromatographic modifier 4-chloro-7-nitro-2,1,3- benzoxadiazole (NBDCl) and four probes (NBDOMe, NBDOEt, NBDOTFE and NBDOCMR) synthesized from NBDCl were tested as alternatives for fast quantification of H2S by LC-MS/MS. The reaction product between NBD ethers/NBDCl and H2S showed special pink color visible to the naked eye and was easy to synthesize and separate in lab; it also showed good retention on common chromatographic columns and high instrument response; therefore it is a good determinand. After establishment of LC-MS/MS methods for all the related compounds, the reaction conditions were optimized for all the probes with H2S. Then the stability, selectivity, reaction rate, sensitivity and quantitative linear relationship between the reaction product and H2S concentration were studied for each probe. Finally, NBDOEt was selected for LC-MS/MS detection of H2S. In comparision with the MBB method, the established NBDOEt method showed matched sensitivity and linearity, better selectivity, and higher repeatability; and had the advantages of easy operation, simple reaction condition, and cheap raw materials. The method was successfully validated and applied to determination of Na2S content in Na2S∙9H2O bulk drug and injection. In conclusion, NBDOEt is a promising option for quantification of H2S in abiotic matrix.","Lan, Li-Ai; Wu, Sheng-Yuan; Meng, Xiang-Guo; Jiang, Jing-Jing; Zheng, Ming-Yue; Fan, Guo-Rong",Journal of chromatography.

Furthermore, those amounts exceeded their respective shale values. The pollution evaluation indices indicated a moderate level of contamination by Cs, Pb, Th, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, and lanthanides but excluding lanthanum (La) and lutetium (Lu). The pollution load index revealed pollution at two brickfields. Multivariate statistics reported that coal combustion in the brick kilns is the primary source of lanthanides, actinides, Y, Zr, and Hf in the soil, while other elements derived mostly from natural sources. A portion originated from coal combustion in brick kilns and agricultural activities. Changes in metal (oid)s concentrations were non-linear with the distance between the kilns and sampling points. Consequently, further studies are required and should consider meteorological factors and severity of human impact in the study area.","Kumar, Sazal; Zhao, Meixia; Zhang, Haiyang; Rahman, Md Aminur; Luo, Chuanxiu; Rahman, Mohammad Mahmudur",Chemosphere,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127882; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818846/,366

On the other hand, the contagion and the public health measures taken to curb it have disrupted economies whilst creating additional spending pressures as well. This constrains the policy options available for LMICs to ensure an adequate and sustainable financing for the health sector's COVID-19 response whilst maintaining routine supply of essential health services. Despite this, as demonstrated by India, many LMICs are undertaking many reform efforts to address both the health and economic hardships caused by the pandemic.

149208,"Time to take care: fighting HIV with health promotion in Edinburgh, 1983-1996.",2021-06-01,"UNLABELLED Inflammasomes are cytosolic multimolecular protein complexes that stimulate the activation of caspase-1 and the release of mature forms of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18. We previously demonstrated that the influenza A virus M2 protein stimulates IL-1β secretion following activation of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus inhibits caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. However, the precise mechanism by which NS1 inhibits IL-1β secretion remains unknown. Here, we showed that J774A.1 macrophages stably expressing the NS1 protein inhibited IL-1β secretion after infection with recombinant influenza virus lacking the NS1 gene. Coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that the NS1 protein interacts with NLRP3. Importantly, the NS1 protein inhibited the NLRP3/ASC-induced single-speck formation required for full activation of inflammasomes. The NS1 protein of other influenza virus strains, including a recent pandemic strain, also inhibited inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion. The NS1 RNA-binding domain (basic residues 38 and 41) and TRIM25-binding domain (acidic residues 96 and 97) were required for suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion. These results shed light on a mechanism by which the NS1 protein of influenza virus suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion. IMPORTANCE Innate immune sensing of influenza virus via pattern recognition receptors not only plays a key role in generating type I interferons but also triggers inflammatory responses. We previously demonstrated that the influenza A virus M2 protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 following the activation of caspase-1. Although the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza virus inhibits IL-1β secretion, the precise mechanism by which it achieves this remains to be defined. Here, we demonstrate that the NS1 protein interacts with NLRP3 to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation. J774A.1 macrophages stably expressing the NS1 protein suppressed NLRP3-mediated IL-1β secretion. The NS1 RNA-binding domain (basic residues 38 and 41) and TRIM25-binding domain (acidic residues 96 and 97) are important for suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β secretion. These results will facilitate the development of new anti-inflammatory drugs.","Moriyama, Miyu; Chen, I-Yin; Kawaguchi, Atsushi; Koshiba, Takumi; Nagata, Kyosuke; Takeyama, Haruko; Hasegawa, Hideki; Ichinohe, Takeshi",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00120-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26865721/,366

Unprecedented levels of stress contribute to physician burnout, leaves of absence and early retirement. Although recommendations have been made, we continue to struggle with addressing stress. One challenge is a lack of a shared definition for what we mean by 'stress', which is a complex and idiosyncratic phenomenon that may be examined from a myriad of angles. As such, research on stress has traditionally taken a reductionist approach, parsing out one aspect to investigate, such as stress physiology. In the medical domain, we have traditionally underappreciated other dimensions of stress, including emotion and the role of the environmental and sociocultural context in which providers are embedded. Taking a complementary, holistic approach to stress and focusing on the composite, subjective individual experience may provide a deeper understanding of the phenomenon and help to illuminate paths towards wellness. In this review article, we first examine contributions from unidimensional approaches to stress, and then outline a complementary, integrated approach. We describe how complex phenomena have been tackled in other domains and discuss how holistic theory and the humanities may help in studying and addressing physician stress, with the ultimate goal of improving physician well-being and consequently patient care.","McQueen, Sydney Amelia; Hammond Mobilio, Melanie; Moulton, Carol-Anne",Medical humanities,https://doi.org/10.1136/medhum-2020-012100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417324/,366

150776,Clinician Experiences Delivering Dementia Caregiver Support Services During COVID-19.,2021-01-09,"INTRODUCTION Long regarded as ""America's Past Time"", over 8.6 million children partake in organized and recreational baseball. Although improved equipment has reduced contemporary injury rates, nearly half of pediatric baseball injuries requiring hospitalization are due to craniofacial trauma. Sideline personnel at the youth levels, often without advanced medical training, frequently act as first-responders in instances of acute craniofacial injury. METHODS An IRB-approved survey was distributed nationally to target field personnel working at youth, high school, collegiate, and professional baseball levels. Survey items included: comfort in assessing subtypes of acute craniofacial trauma (loss of consciousness (LOC), skull injury, orbital injury, nasal injury, and dental injury) via Likert scale, years of medical training, presence of an emergency action plan (EAP), and access to higher level care from emergency medical services (EMS) or a nearby hospital. RESULTS When comparing the amateur and professional cohorts, the respondents from professional teams were significantly more confident in assessing LOC (P = 0.001), skull injury (P < 0.001), orbital injury (P < 0.001), nasal injury (P < 0.001), and dental injury (P < 0.001). The professional teams had significantly more years of first aid training (P < 0.0001) and were significantly more likely to have an EAP (P < 0.0001). Professional teams also had a significantly higher average of reported craniofacial incidents (P = 0.0279). CONCLUSION The authors identified a significant disparity in comfort level between amateur and professional baseball field personnel for identifying and managing acute craniofacial trauma. Based on these findings, the authors were able to develop a rudimentary tool for on-field personnel to effectively assess and manage craniofacial injuries.","Sprau, Annelise C; Slavin, Benjamin R; Pierrot, Randall G; Weber, Lee E; Figueroa, Javier M; Jagid, Jonathan R; Thaller, Seth R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086303/,366
151118,Temporal transition of racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes in 3108 counties of the United States: Three phases from January to December 2020.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND A small, but significant, number of patients undergoing bariatric surgery refuse blood transfusion for religious or other personal reasons. Jehovah's Witnesses number more than 1 million members in the United States alone. The reported rates of hemorrhage vary from .5% to 4% after bariatric surgery, with transfusion required in one half of these cases. Pharmacologic prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism could further increase the perioperative bleeding risk. Our objective was to report the perioperative outcomes of bariatric surgery who refuse blood transfusion at a bariatric center of excellence, private practice in the United States. METHODS A retrospective review of all patients who refused blood transfusion when undergoing bariatric surgery during a 10-year period was conducted. Patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database by the bloodless surgery program at Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital. Data were collected on demographics, co-morbidities, laboratory values, medication use, blood loss, and 30-day complications. RESULTS Thirty-five bloodless surgery patients underwent bariatric surgery from 2000 to 2009. Of these 35 patients, 21 underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and 14 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Before 2006, only pneumatic compression devices were applied for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (n = 6). Subsequently, combination venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was performed with fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg for RYGB or enoxaparin 40 mg for LAGB (n = 29). One RYGB patient developed postoperative hemorrhage requiring reoperation. No venous thromboembolisms or deaths occurred. CONCLUSION Bariatric surgery can be performed in patients who refuse blood transfusion with acceptable postoperative morbidity. Larger studies are necessary to confirm the safety of this approach and to examine the effect of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in this patient group.","Kitahama, Seiichi; Smith, Mark D; Rosencrantz, David R; Patterson, Emma J",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2012.02.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608056/,366

Methods: A convenience sample of young adults ages 21-28 (n = 29) were recruited online May-July 2020 to participate in semi-structured interviews about nicotine use behaviors specific to cigarillos and e-cigarettes. Audio-recorded interviews were 60-90 min long and were conducted remotely. Participants were asked opinions and behavioral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use. Verbatim transcripts and field notes from each interview were coded by a trained researcher using a codebook developed using inductive and deductive approaches. Thematic analysis was used to examine product access, use frequency, stress and use triggers. Results: Most current users reported tobacco use stayed the same or increased since the pandemic and attributed this to being home more with greater time/boredom. COVID-19 impacted purchasing behaviors such as purchasing products in greater quantities, through the Internet, or at a different store due to perceived cleanliness. Few reported using tobacco products less frequently and not smoking in public due to the perception of risks associated with smoking and COVID-19, plus having to take off their mask to smoke. Lack of social use modified shared product use, flavors selected, and setting of use. Financial impacts included increased product costs and job loss. Few mentioned wanting to quit due to the pandemic.

Therefore, knowledge of the compatibility of occlusion balloon catheters with liquid embolic materials is important in various interventional procedures. OBJECTIVE To determine the compatibility of occlusion balloon catheters with commonly used embolic materials in vitro. METHODS We used three types of occlusion balloon catheters (Scepter C, Microvention, Tustin, California, USA; Hyperform, Covidien, Irvine, California, USA; and Ascent, Codman Neurovascular, Raynham, Massachusetts, USA) to test their tolerances to Lipiodol, n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA; Histoacryl; B Braun, Melsungen, Germany), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with Onyx. The balloon was inflated just as it is in an endovascular procedure, then put on a Petri dish to observe its morphological change after one drop of liquid embolic material was added using a 1 mL syringe. The presence of rupture and the time to rupture were evaluated by constant video monitoring. Additionally, we observed morphological changes of the balloon catheter surface after contact with embolic materials with a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS Lipiodol or a 33% NBCA-Lipiodol mixture dropping onto the three types of balloon catheter resulted in ruptures of all three. All three types of balloon catheter were tolerant to NBCA and to DMSO followed by Onyx. CONCLUSIONS Glue embolization should not be performed with all three kinds of balloon catheter on the market, but DMSO and Onyx are compatible with those balloon catheters.","Park, Soonchan; Hwang, Seon Moon; Lim, Ok Kyun; Hwang, Changmo; Lee, Deok Hee",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25165384/,366

METHODS AND RESULTS OSICAT was a randomised, multicentre, open-label French study in 937 patients hospitalised for acute HF ≤12 months before inclusion. Patients were randomised to telemonitoring (daily body-weight measurement, daily recording of HF symptoms, and personalised education) (n = 482) or to SC (n = 455). Mean ± standard deviation number of events for the primary outcome was 1.30 ± 1.85 for telemonitoring and 1.46 ± 1.98 for SC (rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.77-1.23; P = 0.80). In NYHA class III or IV HF, median time to all-cause death or first unplanned hospitalisation was 82 days in the telemonitoring group and 67 days in the SC group (P = 0.03). After adjustment for known predictive factors, telemonitoring was associated with a 21% relative risk reduction in first unplanned hospitalisation for HF (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.99; P = 0.044); the relative risk reduction was 29% in patients with NYHA class III or IV HF (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95; P = 0.02), 38% in socially isolated patients (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98; P = 0.043), and 37% in patients who were ≥ 70% adherent to body-weight measurement (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.88; P = 0.006). CONCLUSION Telemonitoring did not result in a significantly lower rate of all-cause deaths or unplanned hospitalisations in HF patients. The pre-specified subgroup results suggest the telemonitoring approach improves clinical outcomes in selected populations but need further confirmation. This article is protected by copyright.

The DISE procedure was performed on 48 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or snoring patients. The parameters simultaneously recorded on a single monitor are (1) the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol (through the target controlled infusion (TCI) pump monitor), (2) the endoscopic upper airway view, (3) the polygraphic pattern, and (4) the level of sedation (through the bispectral index (BIS) value). In parallel to the BIS recording, the middle latency auditory evoked potential (MLAEP) was also recorded and provided. Recorded videos from the 5VsEs machine were re-evaluated six months later by the same clinician and a second clinician to evaluate the concordance of the therapeutic indications between the two. After the six-month period, the same operator confirmed all their clinical decisions for 45 out of 48 videos. Three videos were no longer evaluable for technical reasons, so were excluded from further analysis. The comparison between the two operators showed a complete adherence in 98% of cases. The 5VsEs machine provides a multiparametric evaluation setting, defined as an ""all in one glance"" strategy, which allows a faster and more effective interpretation of all the simultaneous parameters during the DISE procedure, improving the diagnostic accuracy, and providing a more accurate post-analysis, as well as legal and research advantages.","Arigliani, Michele; Toraldo, Domenico M; Montevecchi, Filippo; Conte, Luana; Galasso, Lorenzo; De Rosa, Filippo; Lattante, Caterina; Ciavolino, Enrico; Arigliani, Caterina; Palumbo, Antonio; De Benedetto, Michele; Vicini, Claudio",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32549340/,366

We aimed to investigate the change profiles of dermatologic diseases in the first and second months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey by comparing with the corresponding period of the previous year. The total number and diagnosis of patients, who attended a tertiary care hospital for the dermatology outpatient clinic between 1 April 2020 and 31 May 2020, were included in this study. These data were compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. The percentage of the patients with scabies, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, pityriasis rosea, urticaria, and alopecia areata were statistically significantly increased a month after the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the percentage of patients with scabies, alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, acne vulgaris, and xerosis cutis were statistically significantly increased 2 months after the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic (P < 0.05). An increase in the number of certain diseases such as urticaria and pityriasis rosea may indicate the risk of asymptomatic COVID-19 carriage in these patients.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ambulatory utilization of DOACs and to compare the effectiveness and safety of DOACs versus warfarin in patients with AF and BHVs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a large integrated health care delivery system in California. Patients with BHVs and AF treated with warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban between September 12, 2011 and June 18, 2020 were identified. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted comparative effectiveness and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin were determined. Use of DOACs gradually increased since 2011, with a significant upward in trend after a stay-at-home order related to COVID-19. Among 2672 adults with BHVs and AF who met the inclusion criteria, 439 were exposed to a DOAC and 2233 were exposed to warfarin. For the primary effectiveness outcome of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and transient ischemic attack, no significant association was observed between use of DOACs compared with warfarin (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96-1.48, p=0.11). Use of DOACs was associated with lower risk of the primary safety outcome of intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other bleed (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85, p <0.001). Results were consistent across multiple subgroups in the sensitivity analyses. These findings support the use of DOACs for AF in patients with BHVs.","Duan, Lewei; Doctor, Jason N; Adams, John L; Romley, John A; Nguyen, Leigh-Anh; An, Jaejin; Lee, Ming-Sum",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2021.01.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529622/,366
156773,COVID-19 and clinic workflow optimization using lean six sigma.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Schools are an integral part of the community; however, congregate settings facilitate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, presenting a challenge to school administrators to provide a safe, in-school environment for students and staff. METHODS We adapted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVIDTracer Advanced tool to model the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a school of 596 individuals. We estimate possible reductions in cases and hospitalizations among this population using a scenario-based analysis that accounts for (a) the risk of importation of infection from the community; (b) adherence to key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended mitigation strategies: mask wearing, cleaning and disinfection, hand hygiene, and social distancing; and (c) the effectiveness of contact tracing interventions at limiting onward transmission. RESULTS Low impact and effectiveness of mitigation strategies (net effectiveness: 27%) result in approximately 40% of exposed staff and students becoming COVID-19 cases. When the net effectiveness of mitigation strategies was 69% or greater, in-school transmission was mostly prevented, yet importation of cases from the surrounding community could result in nearly 20% of the school's population becoming infected within 180 days. The combined effects of mitigation strategies and contact tracing were able to prevent most onward transmission. Hospitalizations were low among children and adults (<0.5% of the school population) across all scenarios examined. CONCLUSIONS Based on our model, layering mitigation strategies and contact tracing can limit the number of cases that may occur from transmission in schools. Schools in communities with substantial levels of community spread will need to be more vigilant to ensure adherence of mitigation strategies to minimize transmission. Our results show that for school administrators, teachers, and parents to provide the safest environment, it is important to utilize multiple mitigation strategies and contract tracing that reduce SARS CoV-2 transmission by at least 69%. This will require training, reinforcement, and vigilance to ensure that the highest level of adherence is maintained over the entire school term.","Miller, Gabrielle F; Greening, Bradford; Rice, Ketra L; Arifkhanova, Aziza; Meltzer, Martin I; Coronado, Fátima",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938487/,366
158152,Grief and Mourning during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Portugal.,2020-07-13,"OBJECTIVES Minimally conscious state (MCS) is a disorder of consciousness in which minimal but definite behavioral evidence of self-awareness or environmental awareness is demonstrated. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of various targets has been used to promote recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness with varying results. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of DBS in MCS following traumatic brain injury (TBI). MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature review was carried out using a number of electronic bibliographic data bases to identify relevant studies. We included all studies describing applications of DBS on patients in MCS following TBI. RESULTS Eight studies were identified, including a total of ten patients, aged 15-58 years. The time from injury to stimulation ranged from 3 to 252 months, with the duration of follow-up post-DBS ranging from 10 to 120 months. Seven patients improved their postsurgical outcome score measures (three patients with the coma recovery scale, one with the near coma scale, and three with the Glasgow outcome score). A descriptive favorable outcome was reported in one patient. Two patients were reported not to have shown any improvements following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence is based on a small population of heterogeneous patients. The time from injury to stimulation was significantly variable and problematic, as spontaneous recovery can occur within the first year of injury. Although seven patients showed promising results in validated outcome measures, evidence supporting the use of DBS in MCS patients following TBI is lacking. There is need for controlled and randomized studies.","Rezaei Haddad, Ali; Lythe, Vanessa; Green, Alexander L",Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ner.12944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30865342/,366

However, the severity of MHV-1-induced pulmonary disease varies among mouse strains, and it has been suggested that differences in the host immune response might account for this variation. It has also been suggested that immunopathology may represent an important clinical feature of SARS. Little is known about the host immune response to MHV-1 and how it might contribute to some of the pathological changes detected in infected mice. In this study we show that an intact type I interferon system and the adaptive immune responses are required for controlling MHV-1 replication and preventing morbidity and mortality in resistant C57BL/6J mice after infection. The NK cell response also helps minimize the severity of illness following MHV-1 infection of C57BL/6J mice. In A/J and C3H/HeJ mice, which are highly susceptible to MHV-1-induced disease, we demonstrate that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to morbidity during primary infection, and memory responses can enhance morbidity and mortality during subsequent reexposure to MHV-1. However, morbidity in A/J and C3H/HeJ mice can be minimized by treating them with immune serum prior to MHV-1 infection. Overall, our findings highlight the role of the host immune response in contributing to the pathogenesis of coronavirus-induced respiratory disease.","Khanolkar, Aaruni; Hartwig, Stacey M; Haag, Brayton A; Meyerholz, David K; Epping, Lecia L; Haring, Jodie S; Varga, Steven M; Harty, John T",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00355-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19570864/,366

The solubilization of γ-T3 was tested in a dynamic in vitro lipolysis model followed by in vitro cellular uptake study for the lipolysis products. In addition, in vitro uptake studies using Caco2 cells were conducted at different concentrations of γ-T3 prepared as SEDDS, Tocovid, or mixed micelles. γ-T3 incorporated in SEDDS or Tocovid was orally administered to rats at different doses and absolute oral bioavailability from both formulations were determined. The dynamic in vitro lipolysis experiment showed about two fold increase in the solubilization of γ-T3 prepared as SEDDS compared to Tocovid, which correlated with higher cellular uptake in the subsequent uptake studies. In vitro cellular uptake and in vivo oral bioavailability studies have shown a twofold increase in the cellular uptake and oral bioavailability of γ-T3 incorporated in SEDDS compared to Tocovid as a result of improvement in its solubility and passive uptake as confirmed by in vitro studies. In conclusion, incorporation of γ-T3 in SEDDS formulation enhanced γ-T3 solubilization and passive permeability, thus its cellular uptake and oral bioavailability when compared to Tocovid.","Alqahtani, Saeed; Alayoubi, Alaadin; Nazzal, Sami; Sylvester, Paul W; Kaddoumi, Amal",Lipids,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11745-014-3923-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24934591/,366

163100,"Policies, Laws and Schemes Supporting Foster Care and Adoption in South Asia",2021,"Implicit motor recalibration allows us to flexibly move in novel and changing environments. Conventionally, implicit recalibration is thought to be driven by errors in predicting the sensory outcome of movement (i.e., sensory prediction errors). However, recent studies have shown that implicit recalibration is also influenced by errors in achieving the movement goal (i.e., task errors). Exactly how sensory prediction errors and task errors interact to drive implicit recalibration and, in particular, whether task errors alone might be sufficient to drive implicit recalibration remain unknown. To test this, we induced task errors in the absence of sensory prediction errors by displacing the target mid-movement. We found that task errors alone failed to induce implicit recalibration. In additional experiments, we simultaneously varied the size of sensory prediction errors and task errors. We found that implicit recalibration driven by sensory prediction errors could be continuously modulated by task errors, revealing an unappreciated dependency between these two sources of error. Moreover, implicit recalibration was attenuated when the target was simply flickered in its original location, even though this manipulation did not affect task error – an effect likely attributed to attention being directed away from the feedback cursor. Taken as a whole, the results were accounted for by a computational model in which sensory prediction errors and task errors, modulated by attention, interact to determine the extent of implicit recalibration. Author’s summary What information does the brain use to maintain precise calibration of the sensorimotor system? Using a reaching task paired with computational modeling, we find that movements are implicitly recalibrated by errors in predicting both the sensory outcome of movement (i.e., sensory prediction errors) as well as errors in achieving the movement goal (i.e., task errors). Even though task errors alone do not elicit implicit recalibration, they nonetheless modulate implicit recalibration when sensory prediction error is present. The results elucidate an unappreciated interaction between these two sources of error in driving implicit recalibration.","Tsay, Jonathan S.; Haith, Adrian M.; Ivry, Richard B.; Kim, Hyosub E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.20.449180,366

However, cell retention, viability, and engraftment at the injection site has generally been poor, driving the need for improved approaches. Here, we developed a technique to shrink-wrap micropatterned islands of corneal endothelial cells in a basement membrane-like layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) that enables the cells to maintain their cell-cell junctions and cytoskeletal structure while in suspension. These μMonolayers exhibited the ability to rapidly engraft into intact, high-density corneal endothelial monolayers in both in vitro and in vivo model systems. Importantly, the engrafted μMonolayers increased local cell density, something that the clinical-standard single cells in suspension failed to do. These results show that shrink-wrapping cells in ECM dramatically improves engraftment and provides a potential alternative to cornea transplant when low endothelial cell density is the cause of corneal blindness.

The critical step in fighting COVID-19 is the capability to identify the infected patients during initial stages and situate them under extraordinary care. Detecting COVID-19 disease from radiography and radiology images is one of the effective way to detect the infected patients. Inspired by the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19, we study the application of machine learning and convolutional neural network models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of chest X-rays from the publicly available ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset. This paper aims to provide the following contributions. Firstly, the dataset is preprocessed and segregated as healthy, COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia. Secondly, the dataset is processed to form the initial trained layers of base model and is fitted with several convolutional neural network models like VGG, ResNet, Xception and DenseNet to extract the high-level general features. Thirdly, the base model of several convolutional neural network models are added to the custom layers developed with transfer learning deep learning approach to analyze the performance of prediction of COVID-19 patients. Fourth, the performance of the convolutional neural network models along with transfer learning is analyzed with the metrics like model loss, precision, accuracy, recall and F-Score. The project is implemented with Python in Spyder under anaconda navigator.

The mobility of our society is responsible for many negative environmental impacts, both on our planet and on human health. This paper aims to assess one aspect of a negative externality of transport related to air pollution from particulate matter up to 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) and its impact on human health, using the example of the key Czech Republic highway D1. The assessment method precisely follows the geographical routing of this motorway through varying elevations in which different buffer zones are identified to assess PM10 concentration changes according to distance from the road in the 2007–2016 period. The resulting relation between PM10 and highway proximity is then discussed in an econometric analysis of the entire road transport network of the Czech Republic. In the final step, we assess the size and demographic structure of the population affected by the highway PM10 pollution problem, and we compare several methods to assess economically related morbidity. The results show falling levels of PM10 pollution, not only with increasing distance but also in intertemporal comparison, with concentrations lower by 2μg.m3 in the 2012–2016 period than in 2007–2011 despite increasing road traffic on the highway.

Swift detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is paramount for the containment of cases, prevention of sustained contagion; and most importantly, for the reduction of mortality. Objective: To evaluate the performance and validity of the COVISTIXTM rapid antigen test, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an unselected population and compare it to PanbioTM rapid antigen test and RT-PCR. Design: This is comparative effectiveness study; samples were collected at two point-of-care facilities in Mexico City between May and August 2021. Participants: Recruited individuals were probable COVID-19 cases, either symptomatic or asymptomatic persons that were at risk of infection due to close contact to SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. Diagnostic intervention: RT-PCR was used as gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, study subjects were tested in parallel either with the COVISTIXTM or with PanbioTM rapid antigen test. Main outcome: Diagnostic performance of the COVISTIXTM assay is adequate in all commers since its accuracy parameters were not affected in samples collected after 7 days of symptom onset, and it detected almost 65% of samples with a Ct-value between 30 and 34. Results: For the population tested with COVISTIXTM (n=783), specificity and sensitivity of the was 96.0% (CI95% 94.0-98.0) and 81% (CI95% 76.0-85.0), as for the PanbioTM (n=2202) population, was 99.0% (CI95%: 0.99-1.00) and 62% (CI%: 58.0-64.0%), respectively.

167895,Infection control practices in orthodontics during COVID-19,2021,"This paper provides some new insights into the dual function of expressive speech acts discussed in pragmatic theory as either expressions of genuine emotions or conventionalised acts of courtesy. Drawing on the framework of interpersonal pragmatics, it analyses signs displayed on the doors of closed businesses in Athens and London during the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic. These closure signs are characterised by a heavy use of relational features, including four expressive speech acts, namely greetings, apologies, thanks and wishes, which form the focus of the analysis. The relational work performed by these speech acts reflects the social changes brought about by the pandemic as well as the business owners’ attempts to retain their customers. The expressive speech acts featured on the signs are evaluated against the norms set out by the genre of closure signs. The comparative angle of the study, on the other hand, links the discussion to norms related to the display of emotions and to the use of conventionalised formulae in the two countries under study, thus revealing culture-specific perspectives on the dual function of expressive speech acts.","Ogiermann, Eva Bella Spyridoula",Journal of Pragmatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2021.07.020,366
168539,The development of competency frameworks in healthcare professions: a scoping review.,2019-08-01,"Introduction:Recently there has been a renewal of therapeutic tools for the treatment of lymphoid neoplasms to increase the antitumor efficacy and reduce the toxicity generated by conventional chemotherapies, which adds to the intrinsic immunological dysfunction of the disease itself. To date, few data are published about infection risk of these new drugs, and the need for infectious prophylaxis is unknown. The aim of the study is to analyze the infectious complications in patients with LPD treated with monoclonal antibodies (obinutuzumab, ofatumumab, brentuximab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab), BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, acalabrutinib) and PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib). Methods: Multicenter retrospective study in patients with LPD treated with targeted therapies (single agents or combination) in 18 Hematology centers in Spain, from the time of their commercial availability to March 2020. Patients in clinical trials were excluded as well as patients with active infections at the beginning of treatment. Results:During the study period, 380 patients were included.Baseline characteristics of the entire cohort are shown in Table 1.Median follow-up was 17.3 months (range 0-103), the longest follow-up corresponding to CLL patients (24 months, range 0-98) and the shortest to LBCL (5 months, range 0-25). Median exposure to target drugs was 8 months (range 0-72).Ibrutinib was administered to 219 patients(1 FL, 147 CLL, 27 MCL, 10 DLBCL, 1 TL and 32 WM, 1 HL),Brentuximab to 49(31 HL, 14 TL and 4 DLBCL) andIdelalisibto 35 patients (16 affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia - CLL, 15 FL and 1 DLBCL, 1 WM, 1MCL, 1HL).Obinutuzumabcombinations were used in 10 (6 CLL, 3 FL, 1 MCL) and 5 HL patients (of which 4/5 underwent previous BMT) receivedNivolumab. A total number of 237 infectious events occurred in 148/380 patients (38.9%), 39% of which were grade 3 and 54/148 (36.4%) experienced 2 or more infective episodes: of those 54, 21 (38%) had underwent 3 or more lines of therapy and 28 (51%) had hypogammaglobulinemia. Hospitalization was required in 59.2% events. A bacterial cause of infection was reported in 40% of cases, and viral in 16%, including 11/237 (4,6%) SARS-CoV-2 infection. Invasive fungal infection (IFI) occurred in 3.3% (8/237). Noteworthy, no case of PJP was identified. Lung was the most frequent site of infection in 24% of cases (57/237) while the upper respiratory tract was involved in 17% of events (41/237). Urinary tract infections were diagnosed in 10% (24/237). Other sites involved were skin and soft tissue 7%, gastrointestinal tract 5,4%, bloodstream infections 3% and catheter related infections 2,5%. Considering drugs individually, 86 patients that receivedIbrutinib(39.2 %)experienced a total of 137 infectious episodes: 30% bacterial, 19% viral, 5% fungal and 45% clinical and image-based infections;the 17(34.6%of those who received Brentuximab, experienced a total of 16 infectious episodes: 56% bacterial, 37.5% viral infections and one catheter-related sepsis. Of those who receivedIdelalisib,18 (51.4%)experienced a total of 28 episodes: 42% bacterial, 14% viral and 7% fungal. Four patients treated withObinutuzumabcombinations (40%) experienced one infection during treatment (25% bacterial and 75% viral). Only one patient treated withNivolumabexperienced more than three infections, he was also under corticosteroid treatment. Focusing on IFI (Table 2): 7/8 infections were identified in CLL patients, 6 out 7 being on ibrutinib treatment and 1/7 on Idelalisib.Aspergilluswas the fungus most frequently isolated. The targeted drug was discontinued temporarily in 4 patients and indefinitely in 3. Twenty three (6%) patients died due to infection in our series. Conclusions: 1. We identified 38.7% infections in our LPD patients treated with targeted drugs, with a median drug-exposure time of 8 months (range 0-72), with a non-negligible incidence of bacterial infections. 2. The highest rates of infection were found in patients treated with with Idelalisib and Ibrutinib (51.4% and 39.2% respectively). 3. IFI (3.3%) occurr d with low frequency, mostly in CLL patients during ibrutinib treatment, leading to its temporal discontinuation in most of the cases. 4. No case of PJP was identified in our cohort. 5. An analysis to determine risk factors for infection and the optimal monitoring and prophylaxis for these patients is ongoing.

168685,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on emergency room access in Northern and Central Italy,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic within the United States, much of the responsibility for diagnostic testing and epidemiologic response has relied on the action of county-level departments of public health. Here we describe the integration of genomic surveillance into epidemiologic response within Humboldt County, a rural county in northwest California. Through a collaborative effort, 853 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated, representing ~58% of the 1,449 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases detected in Humboldt County as of March 12, 2021. Phylogenetic analysis of these data was used to develop a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 introductions to the county and to support contact tracing and epidemiologic investigations of all large outbreaks in the county. In the case of an outbreak on a commercial farm, viral genomic data were used to validate reported epidemiologic links and link additional cases within the community who did not report a farm exposure to the outbreak. During a separate outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, genomic surveillance data were used to rule out the putative index case, detect the emergence of an independent Spike:N501Y substitution, and verify that the outbreak had been brought under control. These use cases demonstrate how developing genomic surveillance capacity within local public health departments can support timely and responsive deployment of genomic epidemiology for surveillance and outbreak response based on local needs and priorities.","Stoddard, G.; Black, A.; Ayscue, P.; Lu, D.; Kamm, J.; Bhatt, K.; Chan, L.; Kistler, A.

169769,Transitions to virtual administration of CBT-I: Strengths and barriers,2021,"In the last decade, the new means of communication have determined substantial changes in human behavior and in the way individuals interact with each other. Besides the numerous benefits and opportunities that have arisen throughout the digitalization process, both for individuals as well as for private companies and state institutions, the widespread use of the Internet has generated vulnerabilities and threats. One of the most consistent concerns related to the new means of communication, especially social media platforms, refers to fake news. In recent years, major events including the 2016 presidential election in the US, Brexit, and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic have proven the negative effects of fake news on society. In this paper, we use an eye-tracking experiment to determine the unconscious reactions of consumers regarding the attraction potential of a fake news manner written article about a celebrity couple. The results of the experiment for this magazine's article, with a fake title about the celebrity couple, show that the participants focus their attention on celebrities and fake titles mostly. The picture of the celebrities and the fake title of the article beats the other areas from the article and less on the information in the text. The research proves empirically that consumers are more attentive to celebrity pictures and fake breaking news titles and less to real information in the article.

One question of debate is the relevance of grab versus composite samples when surveying for SARS-CoV-2 at various catchment scales. This study assessed the impact of grab versus composite sampling on the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in catchment basins with flow rates ranging from high-flow (wastewater treatment plant influent), to medium-flow (neighborhood-scale micro-sewershed), to low-flow (city block-scale micro-sewershed) and down to ultra-low flow (building scale). At the high-flow site, grab samples were reasonably comparable to 24-h composite samples with the same non-detect rate (0%) and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations that differed by 32% on the Log10 scale. However, as the flow rates decreased, the percentage of false-negative grab samples increased up to 44% and the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations of grab samples varied by up to 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to their respective composite sample concentrations. At the ultra-low-flow site, increased sampling frequencies down to every 5 min led to composite samples with higher fidelity to the SARS-CoV-2 load. Thus, composite sampling is superior to grab sampling, especially as flow decreases.","George, A. D.; Kaya, D.; Layton, B. A.; Bailey, K.; Kelly, C.; Williamson, K. J.; Radniecki, T.

Synthetic fluorescence tagged sprays with size and speed distributions comparable to human sneezes are observed with high-speed imaging. We show that while some larger droplets follow parabolic trajectories, smaller droplets stay aloft for several seconds and settle slowly with speeds consistent with a buoyant cloud dynamics model. The net deposition distribution is observed to become correspondingly broader as the source height $H$ is increased, ranging from sitting at a table to standing upright. We find that the deposited mucosaliva decays exponentially in front of the source, after peaking at distance $x = 0.71$,m when $H = 0.5$,m, and $x = 0.56$,m when $H=1.5$,m, with standard deviations $approx 0.5$,m.

171838,Telehealth in Australian Cardiology: Insight into Factors Predicting the Use of Telephone Versus Video During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background A single nucleotide change or mutation in the coding region can alter the amino acid sequence of a protein. In consequence, natural or artificial sequence changes in viral RNAs may have various effects not only on protein stability, function and structure but also on viral replication. In the last decade, several tools have been developed to predict the effect of mutations in structural RNA genomes. Some tools employ multiple point mutations and are also taking coding regions into account. However, none of these tools was designed to specifically simulate the effect of mutations on viral long-range interactions. Results Here, we developed SilentMutations (SIM), an easy-to-use tool to analyze the effect of multiple point mutations on the secondary structures of two interacting viral RNAs. The tool can simulate destructive and compensatory mutants of two interacting single-stranded RNAs. This will facilitate a fast and accurate assessment of key regions, possibly involved in functional long-range RNA-RNA interactions and finally help virologists to design appropriate experiments. SIM only needs two interacting single-stranded RNA regions as input. The output is a plain text file containing the most promising mutants and a graphical representation of all interactions. Conclusion We applied our tool on two experimentally validated influenza A virus and hepatitis C virus interactions and we were able to predict potential double mutants for in vitro validation experiments.

This case series describes the cases of two middle-aged men suffering from severe coronavirus disease-19 ARDS presenting to hospital with similar clinical signs who were given similar treatments. Pre infection activity levels of both patients were assessed using Global Physical Activity Questionnaire and length of hospital stay was observed for both patients. Patient with sedentary lifestyle prior to infection had a longer length of hospital stay of 25 days whereas the second patient who had an active lifestyle had a shorter length of hospital stay of 11 days. Based on our observations, we conclude that pre infection physical activity levels positively influences the severity of disease and helps to reduce length of hospital stay.

Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical features and laboratory data of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted from March 20 to September 5, 2020, on all neonates born to mothers with positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 or clinically suspected COVID-19. Neonates enrolled in this study were from five different hospitals affiliated with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All the newborns were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs during the first 24-48 hours of life, and a second-time swabbing was performed as indicated at subsequent visits. All categorical data were manifested as frequency (%), and continuous data were shown as mean ± SD. Results: Forty-four neonates born to 39 infected mothers were evaluated during the study period. Nineteen women had complications during pregnancy, including hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, preterm labor, etc. Besides, 54.5% of the neonates were born preterm. The mean gestational age and birth weight were 35.11 ± 4.01 weeks and 2,567 ± 898 g, respectively. Fifteen (34.1%) neonates were symptomatic at birth, and during the observation, more neonates became symptomatic. Finally, 27/44 (61.3%) neonates became symptomatic, and 17/44 remained asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were respiratory distress (77.7%), followed by fever or hypothermia (18.5%), gastrointestinal problems (14.8%), and neurologic findings (3.7%). Also, the most common clinical feature of eight neonates with positive RT-PCR was respiratory distress, followed by neurologic symptoms, temperature instability, and gastrointestinal disorder, in sequence. Few abnormalities were seen in laboratory findings. Chest X-rays were abnormal in 22.2% of the neonates. Conclusions: The SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy may cause severe maternal and neonatal morbidities. Neonates with positive SARS-CoV-2 may demonstrate a spectrum of clinical features. The most common feature of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 was respiratory distress. © 2021, Author(s).","Mosayebi, Z.; Esmaeilnia, T.; Sabagh, V.

Combining the data from the different scanners is vital for increased statistical power; however, this leads to an increase in variance due to nonbiological factors such as the differences in acquisition protocols and hardware, which can mask signals of interest. We propose a deep learning based training scheme, inspired by domain adaptation techniques, which uses an iterative update approach to aim to create scanner-invariant features while simultaneously maintaining performance on the main task of interest, thus reducing the influence of scanner on network predictions. We demonstrate the framework for regression, classification and segmentation tasks with two different network architectures. We show that not only can the framework harmonise many-site datasets but it can also adapt to many data scenarios, including biased datasets and limited training labels. Finally, we show that the framework can be extended for the removal of other known confounds in addition to scanner. The overall framework is therefore flexible and should be applicable to a wide range of neuroimaging studies. 1.

Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a qualitative approach consisting of the following components: in-depth interviews with employees and stakeholders of quarantine hotels, including frontline staff, government officials and medical staff, field observations and data from one researcher's direct experience in a quarantined hotel. Findings Six themes regarding the experience of operating quarantine hotels emerged from the in-depth interviews and field observations. The findings also showed an interplay between the hotel employees' perspectives, the four components of the CSR pyramid and the benefits and costs to hotels operating as quarantine facilities. Research limitations/implications This study focusses on the particular case of quarantine hotels in South Korea, and therefore caution is required in generalising the findings. Practical implications The findings suggest that strategic partnerships can help to protect local communities whilst alleviating the hotel industry's financial difficulties. They also explore an opportunity for business revitalisation in the midst of a global pandemic. Originality/value This study finds that the voluntary decision of hotels to operate as coronavirus quarantine facilities is aligned with CSR because its ultimate aim is to protect the community from the risk of coronavirus from overseas arrivals.

The organization hosted 50 virtual listening calls (LCs) in the summer of 2020 to understand and to hear their employees’ voices regarding their emotions about issues of racial injustice and to solicit their ideas for creating a more inclusive workplace.Design/methodology/approachThis study used an illustrative, descriptive qualitative design. Using Saldaña’s (2015) structural coding approach, data from 388 employees who voluntarily participated in 50 virtual LCs were analyzed.FindingsA total of eight themes with respective subthemes emerged regarding employees’ range of emotions and six themes emerged regarding employees’ specific suggestions for creating a more diverse and inclusive organization. This research suggests that hosting these open, virtual LCs enabled a space for employees to authentically voice their perspectives, learn from each other and afforded a powerful learning opportunity for organizational leaders to inform their diversity and inclusion practices.Originality/valueThis study represents a unique application of mega-events theory, focuses on pivotal events in the summer of 2020 that have been nationally and globally impactful and demonstrates the power of listening and learning to inform taking action in a health-care organization already constrained with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.","Cumberland, Denise M.; Deckard, Tyra G.; Ellinger, Andrea D.",Journal of Workplace Learning,https://doi.org/10.1108/jwl-12-2020-0194,366
177657,Knowledge and attitude of paramedical staff towards covid-19 vaccine in Babylon city,2021,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has thoroughly and deeply affected the provision of healthcare services worldwide. In order to limit the in-hospital infections and to redistribute the healthcare professionals, cardiac percutaneous intervention in Pediatric and Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) patients were limited to urgent or emergency ones. The aim of this article is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Pediatric and ACHD cath laboratory activity during the so-called 'hard lockdown' in Italy. Eleven out of 12 Italian institutions with a dedicated Invasive Cardiology Unit in Congenital Heart Disease actively participated in the survey. The interventional cardiology activity was reduced by more than 50% in 6 out of 11 centers. Adolescent and ACHD patients suffered the highest rate of reduction. There was an evident discrepancy in the management of the hard lockdown, irrespective of the number of COVID-19 positive cases registered, with a higher reduction in Southern Italy compared with the most affected regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto and Emilia Romagna). Although the pandemic was brilliantly addressed in most cases, we recognize the necessity for planning new, and hopefully homogeneous, strategies in order to be prepared for an upcoming new outbreak.","Castaldi, B.; Sirico, D.; Meliota, G.; Vairo, U.; Luciani, G.

178978,Psychological characteristics of attitudes towards dangers among healthcare professionals working and not working with COVID-19 patients,2021,"Background: The ASCO Registry was created to analyze the impact of COVID-19 (COVID) on treatment (Tx) and outcomes of patients (pts) with cancer. Methods: The Registry includes pts with 1) a confirmed COVID diagnosis (Dx) and 2) clinically evident cancer receiving Tx/supportive care or resected cancer on adjuvant Tx <12 mos since surgery. Practices report data on cancer Dx and Tx at COVID Dx, COVID symptoms, comorbidities, cancer/COVID Tx, and survival. Kaplan-Meier estimation provided 30- and 90- day mortality rate estimates for pts with COVID Dx before or since 6/1/20 within pt subgroups with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data submission cutoff for all practices was 10/24/20, except one that was 11/16/20. Results: This analysis reports on 453 pts with COVID Dx 3/5/20 to 10/22/20 who were on anticancer drug Tx for regional (9%) or metastatic (53%) solid tumors or hematologic cancers (38%) at COVID Dx. 38 practices entered data: health system-owned 51% of pts, privately-owned 25%, academic 24%. 53% of pts have ≥30 days followup or died ≤30 days from COVID Dx. Median age is 64 years;53% of pts are female;28% of pts are asymptomatic at COVID Dx. Multiple myeloma was most frequent cancer (17%). Allcause mortality rates (30 and 90 days) increased with pts' age at COVID Dx [Table]. No mortality difference was seen based on sex, race, or comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, pulmonary disease). Pts with COVID Dx before June 1 had worse survival than pts diagnosed on/after June 1. Pts with B-cell malignancies had higher mortality rates than pts with solid tumors. Conclusions: Severity of COVID illness and mortality were greater for patients with COVID Dx pre-June 1 than on/after June 1. Differences on/after June 1 may be attributed to improvements in COVID management, higher COVID testing rates, and more asymptomatic pts diagnosed. Variations in COVID-19 pt populations over time due to these changes should be considered when analyzing and interpreting pandemic data. Cancer pts with ed age and B-cell cancers are at greatest risk of death but mortality rates for all groups advanced age and B-cell cancers are at greatestrisk of death but mortality rates for all groups(except those admitted to ICU) improved after6/1/2020.","Mileham, K.

179817,Perceived stress level among patients with chronic illness during covid pandemia,2021,"Background From January to May 2021 the alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of SARS-CoV-2 was the most commonly detected variant in the UK, but since then the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first detected in India, has become the predominant variant. The UK COVID-19 vaccination programme started on 8thDecember 2020. Most vaccine effectiveness studies to date have focused on the alpha variant. We therefore aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and the ChAdOx1nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines in preventing infection with respect to the Delta variant in a UK setting. Methods We used anonymised public health record data linked to infection data (PCR) using the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action resource. We then constructed an SIR epidemic model to explain SARS-CoV-2 infection data across the Cheshire and Merseyside region of the UK. Results We determined that the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in reducing susceptibility to infection is 39% (95% credible interval [34,43]) and 64% (95% credible interval [61,67]) for a single dose and a double dose respectively. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the effectiveness is 20% (95% credible interval [10,28]) and 84% (95% credible interval [82,86]) for a single-dose and a double dose respectively. Conclusion Vaccine effectiveness for reducing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection shows noticeable improvement after receiving two doses of either vaccine. Findings also suggest that a full course of the Pfizer-BioNTech provides the optimal protection against infection with the Delta variant. This would advocate for completing the full course programme to maximise individual protection and reduce transmission.","Pattni, K.; Hungerford, D.; Adams, S.; Buchan, I.; Cheyne, C.

179873,"Psychological status of opioid treatment service staff in Tehran, the epicenter of COVID-19 outbreak in Iran: a longitudinal cohort study",2021,"Background: Recent reports indicate that vaccination is effective in reducing symptomatic infection with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 (DV) but is less protective against asymptomatic transmission of DV in outpatients than for earlier variants. Here we report cryptic transmission associated with high DV viral load among vaccinated patients on an inpatient medical-surgical ward. Methods: This observational study included all persons diagnosed with breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections at the VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) from March 11, 2021 to July 31, 2021, including those tested for surveillance, admission, symptoms, and as part of an outbreak investigation in July 2021. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Cepheid). Variants were identified by MassARRAY SARS-CoV-2 Variant Panel (36-plex PCR, Agena BioScience) for most breakthrough cases after June 2021. Results: An inpatient was diagnosed with asymptomatic DV infection on routine pre-discharge testing. Contact tracing detected infection in 6 of 38 patients (15.8%), 1 of 168 staff (0.6%), and 1 of 6 visitors (16.7%). Infection at the time of diagnosis was asymptomatic in 4 proximate, vaccinated patients, 1 vaccinated visitor, and 1 vaccinated employee caring for 1 undiagnosed, infected, vaccinated patient. Patients were unmasked, whereas staff wore surgical masks. PCR cycle threshold (Ct) for breakthrough infections indicated more than 1000-fold higher viral load for DV (Ct:21.7 +/- 4.3; n=15) than for earlier variants (Ct: 31.8 +/-10.9, n=12; p=.003 (t-test)). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate transmission of DV with high viral load between vaccinated inpatients, the continued efficacy of masking and vaccination for protecting healthcare personnel, and the potential need for post-admission surveillance to prevent cryptic DV transmission.","Linsenmeyer, K.; Gupta, K.; Madjarov, R.; Charness, M.

Design/methodology - First of all, this paper explored the prior research, the current status of sales support for SMEs, and the changes in the distribution industry due to COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Moon (2016)'s ABCD strategic model - Agility, Benchmarking, Convergence, and Dedication, the study then derived directions in which official distribution channels should move and the new distribution strategy for Korean SMEs to secure competitive advantage. Findings - First, in terms of 'Agility', in order to upgrade official distribution channels, which are currently at some competitive disadvantages compared to private distribution companies, we must quickly introduce technologies for the 4th industrial revolution, such as AI, Big Data, etc., and establish precise strategies to strengthen the capabilities of SMEs. Second, in terms of `Benchmarking', the use of ""Chamelezones"" has been increasing to enhance the competitiveness of offline stores in line with recent ontact trends. Therefore, official distribution channels should also benchmark such cases, strengthening their competitiveness by utilizing offline spaces more efficiently and effectively. Third, in terms of 'Convergence', in line with the rapidly changing trend of the times, official distribution channels should also promote active partnerships with media commerce, e-commerce and ICT platforms, as well as cooperation with private retailers, and focus on creating synergy effects through them. Finally, from the perspective of 'Dedication', digitalization should be promoted step by step, finding the sector that can accelerate digital among the value chains of official distribution channels, and continuing to discuss how to digitize it realistically. Originality/value - Based on this analysis, we have presented strategies and implications for innovating official distribution channels for SMEs, which will contribute to enhancing the competitive advantage of official distribution channels in the post COVID-19 pandemic era.","Lee, M.

180465,Concerns and difficulties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults with cancer in Mexico,2021,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces many challenges: two-thirds of the world's extreme poor population;a shrinking economy because of commodity price declines and the COVID-19 pandemic;widespread energy poverty;and climate variability that is disrupting agrarian livelihoods and stirring conflict over natural resources. Climate change threatens to exacerbate these through further disruption of the physical environment, and a transition away from the fossil fuels on which many of the region's economies depend. Through their nationally determined contributions (NDC) to the Paris Agreement, all SSA countries committed to the increased utilisation of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES) to tackle the twin challenges of energy poverty—which limits economic development—and climate change. There is a dearth of analysis on the nature of sustainable energy transition(s) necessary to deliver these NDCs, especially given the limited financial and technical resources of SSA. Using Nigeria as a case study, this study seeks to address this gap by determining the power system transitions required to deliver NDCs alongside universal energy access in SSA by 2050;their financial and policy implications;and the barriers and opportunities that they present to sustainable development efforts. We find that Nigeria can deliver its NDCs with no added cost implications, thereby debunking the prevalent view that climate change mitigation is too costly to pursue in SSA. Furthermore, we find that the higher availability and dispatchability of fossil fuel generation makes it critical for the rapid scale-up of energy supply;thus, entirely leapfrogging carbon-intensive development will prove costly to SSA. Finally, owing to the limited cost reductions that IRES have experienced in SSA, delivering NDCs through the deployment of decentralised IRES systems proves more expensive than using conventional generation. The distributed nature of IRES however means that they can democratise energy investment and job creation, thus facilitating the equitable sharing of economic resources which is crucial to conflict prevention in the fragile socio-political landscapes that pervade the region.","Daggash, Habiba Ahut Niall Mac Dowell",Energy &amp; Environmental Science,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1ee00746g,366

Again, the public perceptions regarding such pandemics can be investigated through sentiment analysis of social media data. Thus the objective of this study is to analyze public perceptions through sentiment analysis regarding black fungus during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. To attain the objective, first, a Support Vector Machine model, with an average AUC of 82.75%, was developed to classify user sentiments in terms of anger, fear, joy, and sad. Next, this Support Vector Machine is used to supervise the class labels of the public tweets (n = 6477) related to COVID-19 and black fungus. As outcome, this study found that public perceptions belong to sad (n = 2370, 36.59 %), followed by joy ( n = 2095, 32.34%), fear ( n = 1914, 29.55 %) and anger ( n = 98, 1.51%) towards black fungus during COVID-19 pandemic. This study also investigated public perceptions of some critical concerns (e.g., education, lockdown, hospital, oxygen, quarantine, and vaccine) and it was found that public perceptions of these issues varied. For example, for the most part, people exhibited fear in social media about education, hospital, vaccine while some people expressed joy about education, hospital, vaccine, and oxygen.","Islam, M.

184298,Search for rapid and less expensive COVID-19 tests for lower middle-income countries-antigen based immunoassays remains a neglected tool.,2020,"American mortality rates have diverged in recent years between those with and without a four-year college degree, and there are many reasons to expect the education-mortality gradient to have steepened during the pandemic. Those without a BA are more likely to work in frontline occupations, to rely on public transportation, and to live in crowded quarters, all of which are associated with an increase in infection risk, a risk that was zero prior to the pandemic. We use publicly available data from the National Center for Health Statistics on deaths by age, sex, education and race/ethnicity to assess the protective effect of a BA in 2020 compared to 2019. While the BA was strongly protective during 2020, the ratio of mortality rates between those with and without a degree was little changed relative to pre-pandemic years. Among 60 groups (gender by race/ethnicity by age) that are available in the data, the relative risk reduction associated with a BA fell for more than half the groups between 2019 and 2020, and increased by more than 5 percentage points for only five groups. Our main finding is not that the BA was protective against death in 2020, which has long been the case, but that the protective effect was little different than in 2019 and earlier years, in spite of the change in the pattern of risk by occupation and income. The virus maintained the mortality-education gradient that existed pre-pandemic, at least through the end of 2020. Our results suggest that changes in the risk of infection were less important in structuring mortality than changes in the risk of death conditional on infection.","Case, A.; Deaton, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.20.21260875v1?rss=1,366
184744,Vinegar: medicinal uses and antiglycemic effect.,2006,"Background: Anxiety and depression are most common psychiatric disorders in chronic inflammatory rheumatic condition as well as axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) (1). The prevalence of depression has been reported as 11-64% depending on the criteria used. Also self-reported depression and anxiety were found to be associated with disease activity and function in axSpA (1,2). It is observed that mental health is affected among healthy subjects during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this condition has not been systematically reviewed in axSpA patients. Objectives: We aimed to compare frequency of self-reported depression and anxiety before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in patients with axSpA. Methods: Seventy-six axSpA patients who were evaluated for the presence of depression and anxiety by using Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADs) before pandemic were included in this study. All participants were classified according to the ASAS axSpA classification criteria. Patients were contacted by phone to participate and complete the HADS questionnaire. Demographic and disease related characteristics including BASDAI, BASFI and Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) were recorded during interview. The HADs cut off value was taken as >7 in both groups to define the presence of anxiety or depression. Before and during pandemic period anxiety and depression scores were statistically compared. Results: The demographic and disease related characteristics of axSpA patients with and without anxiety/depression were summarized in Table 1. The frequency of anxiety (43.4% vs %43.4;p>0.05) and depression (46.1% vs 44.7%;p>0.05) were found to be similar before and during pandemic period. Patients with anxiety (HADs>7) and depression (HADs>7) had higher BASDAI and BASFI scores and much less PASS positivity (Table 1). Although the frequency of depression was similar between before and during the pandemic period, symptom severity in depression was slightly increased during the pandemic (Figure 1). Current depression and anxiety scores were correlated with disease activity (HADs Depression vs BASDAI r:0.530, p<0.001;HADs Anxiety vs BASDAI r:0.500, p<0.001) and function (HADs-Depression vs BASFI r:0.519, p<0.001;HADs-Anxiety vs BASFI r:0.391, p<0.001). These relationships were also observed in the pre-pandemic period (HADs-Depression vs BASFI r:0.326, p<0.05;HADs-Anxiety vs BASDAI r:0.342, p<0.05). Conclusion: Depression and anxiety symptoms seems to be comparable before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of this period, the presence of both depression and anxiety are associated with disease activity, function and less patient acceptable symptom state.","Erpek, E.; Solmaz, D.; Bayraktar, D.; Duran, G.; Kabadayi, G.; Durak Ediboglu, E.; Otman Akat, E.; Alp, G.; Cinakli, H.; Kurut Aysin, I.; Gucenmez, S.; Bayindir, O.; Ozmen, M.; Akar, S.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1422,366

This review summarizes results from a series of recent papers in the energy-growth nexus field, which have perused a proxy for the sustainable GDP instead of the conventional GDP and discusses the difference in results and policy implications. The energy-growth nexus field itself has generated a bulk of work since the seminal study of Kraft and Kraft (1978), but still the field needs new perspectives in order to generate results with a consensus. The bidirectional causality between energy consumption and sustainable economy provides evidence for the Feedback Hypothesis, a statement that essentially warns that it is too early for sustainability to be feasible without fossil energy consumption, and vice versa. The unidirectional causality reveals, on the one side, that an economy cannot grow without the plentiful consumption of energy (the Growth Hypothesis) and, on the other side, that the growth of the economy fuels energy consumption (the Conservation Hypothesis). Failure to corroborate causality between energy consumption and economic growth is evidence for the Neutrality Hypothesis.","Menegaki, Angeliki N.",Energies,https://doi.org/10.3390/en14165074,366
185945,Recommandations of the Tunisian Association of Surgery for the practice of visceral surgery during COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-06-01,"Generative machine learning (ML) has been postulated to be a major driver in the computational design of antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb). However, efforts to confirm this hypothesis have been hindered by the infeasibility of testing arbitrarily large numbers of antibody sequences for their most critical design parameters: paratope, epitope, affinity, and developability. To address this challenge, we leveraged a lattice-based antibody-antigen binding simulation framework, which incorporates a wide range of physiological antibody binding parameters. The simulation framework enables both the computation of antibody-antigen 3D-structures as well as functions as an oracle for unrestricted prospective evaluation of the antigen specificity of ML-generated antibody sequences. We found that a deep generative model, trained exclusively on antibody sequence (1D) data can be used to design native-like conformational (3D) epitope-specific antibodies, matching or exceeding the training dataset in affinity and developability variety. Furthermore, we show that transfer learning enables the generation of high-affinity antibody sequences from low-N training data. Finally, we validated that the antibody design insight gained from simulated antibody-antigen binding data is applicable to experimental real-world data. Our work establishes a priori feasibility and the theoretical foundation of high-throughput ML-based mAb design. Highlights A large-scale dataset of 70M [3 orders of magnitude larger than the current state of the art] synthetic antibody-antigen complexes, that reflect biological complexity, allows the prospective evaluation of antibody generative deep learning Combination of generative learning, synthetic antibody-antigen binding data, and prospective evaluation shows that deep learning driven antibody design and discovery at an unconstrained level is feasible Transfer learning (low-N learning) coupled to generative learning shows that antibody-binding rules may be transferred across unrelated antibody-antigen complexes Experimental validation of antibody-design conclusions drawn from deep learning on synthetic antibody-antigen binding data Graphical abstract We leverage large synthetic ground-truth data to demonstrate the (A,B) unconstrained deep generative learning-based generation of native-like antibody sequences, (C) the prospective evaluation of conformational (3D) affinity, paratope-epitope pairs, and developability.

The primary aim of this observational study was to assess the effect of new fibrin sealant on the incidence of postoperative complications in a homogeneous group of patients submitted to upper gastrointestinal surgery for cancer. METHODS Two cohorts of 28 and 34 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal for surgery were compared. In the first cohort, the anastomotic site was treated with TachoSil fibrinogen-thrombin-collagen patches and in the second no collagen sponge or any other hemostatic sealant was used. Postoperative complications and outcomes as well as postoperative biochemical parameters were analyzed. RESULTS Postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients (35.3%) and 2 patients (7.1%) in control and collagen sponge group respectively (χ2 = 3.539, p < 0.05), with no anastomotic leakage in the collagen sponge group. A binary logistic regression analysis showed that the nonuse of collagen sponge [odds ratio (OR) = 0.025, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.001-0.457, p = 0.01] was independently associated with postoperative complication occurrence. CONCLUSIONS The addition of fibrinogen-thrombin-collagen sponge patch may reduce postoperative complication rate after upper gastrointestinal surgery for cancer. Further study to delineate the role of TachoSil in gastrointestinal surgery are also needed to demonstrate improved effectiveness and applicability.","Marano, Luigi; Di Martino, Natale",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27191688/,366

Thus, the writing of CME articles should adopt an approach that addresses the needs of the readers by attempting to fill gaps in their knowledge, skills, and ethics about clinical care. As such CME articles should be comprehensive and focused on specific areas. The specific learning outcomes should be well defined. In designing and development of such articles, pedagogic principles are to be borne in mind. In this article we outline a guide to writing a CME article, incorporating both the principles of instructional design and directed selflearning. The ideal CME articles will transit through multimedia-enhanced interactive online learning, with greater use of connectivity through the internet. Synchronous and asynchronous learning is in greater need, as distance and online learning are increasingly popular. Authors of CME articles will need to eventually design CME articles to be interactive, enriched with multimedia to engage their readers. Lesson plans employing instructional design principles should aim to promote both instructions for learning and formative assessment ensuring learning have taken place, and outcomes have been achieved.

Like other coronaviruses, FIPV contains an extremely large positive-strand RNA genome of ca. 30 kb. We describe here the development and use of a reverse genetics strategy for FIPV based on targeted RNA recombination that is analogous to what has been described for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (L. Kuo et al., J. Virol. 74:1393-1406, 2000). In this two-step process, we first constructed by targeted recombination a mutant of FIPV, designated mFIPV, in which the ectodomain of the spike glycoprotein was replaced by that of MHV. This switch allowed for the selection of the recombinant virus in murine cells: mFIPV grows to high titers in these cells but has lost the ability to grow in feline cells. In a second, reverse process, mFIPV was used as the recipient, and the reintroduction of the FIPV spike now allowed for selection of candidate recombinants by their regained ability to grow in feline cells. In this fashion, we reconstructed a wild-type recombinant virus (r-wtFIPV) and generated a directed mutant FIPV in which the initiation codon of the nonstructural gene 7b had been disrupted (FIPV Delta 7b). The r-wtFIPV was indistinguishable from its parental virus FIPV 79-1146 not only for its growth characteristics in tissue culture but also in cats, exhibiting a highly lethal phenotype. FIPV Delta 7b had lost the expression of its 7b gene but grew unimpaired in cell culture, confirming that the 7b glycoprotein is not required in vitro. We establish the second targeted RNA recombination system for coronaviruses and provide a powerful tool for the genetic engineering of the FIPV genome.","Haijema, Bert Jan; Volders, Haukeliene; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12663759/,366
197027,"Impact of covid 19 pandemic on presentation,treatment and outcome of paediatric surgical emergencies.",2020,"Poor calf production and ill thrift in 3-4 mo olds are common limiting problems in raising and maintaining captive muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). Acute onset of a rapidly progressing enteritis and septicemia in neonatal calves (2-7 days of age) caused by Escherichia coli not normally considered pathogenic in domestic animals is a serious problem in many captive muskoxen facilities. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, total protein, albumin, and globulin levels in captive periparturient muskox females and their neonatal calves were compared with levels found in other species in which these parameters have been well described. Results showed that all females in the study had IgG present in their serum (mean = 1,232.14 mg/dl, SD = 178.34 mg/dl, as measured via radial immunodiffusion). Calves were probably born agammaglobulinemic or hypogammaglobulinemic. IgG levels quickly rose in calves after initial colostrum intake to levels similar to those seen in other domestic ruminants. Our results suggest that passive transfer of immunity in muskoxen is similar to what is reported in domestic livestock and that reference ranges from domestic cattle may be used to assist interpretation of serum IgG levels in muskoxen. In addition, the positive relationship between serum protein and globulin levels with serum IgG levels is similar to that reported for Holstein cattle and thus provides a useful indicator of passive transfer in muskoxen.","Rosa, Cheryl; Miller, Debra; Gray, Matthew J; Merrill, Anita; Vann, Tammie; Blake, John",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17469276/,366

METHODS Multicenter case-control study in Covid-19 patients through telephone interview. Case: person in whose house there was more than one Covid-19 positive during the study period. TAS was calculated and univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed. RESULTS TAS calculated was 29.8%. The risk was higher for each increase in one unit in the number of co-inhabitants (OR=3.1); if stays were shared (OR=4.43); if ventilating the temperature worsened (OR=3.8) and if there were dependents at home (OR=3.2). CONCLUSIONS The search for housing vulnerable to Covid-19 accompanied by fast, close measures and interventions on the social determinants of health can reduce the TAS of the disease.","Robles Pellitero, Sandra; Andrés-García, Irene; Martín Del Barco, Óscar Hugo; Santos Plaza, José Ignacio; González Varas, Isabel; Fermoso Álvarez, Gonzalo",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650028/,366

199064,"Safety and Effectiveness of Orthopaedic Medical Staff in Providing Support in Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Investigation from Wuhan, China",2021,"UNLABELLED The recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) as a new viral disease is causing a great concern for health authorities and general population. Very little is known about the infectious agent (a coronavirus) and its etiopathogeny, having no specific treatment yet. Proinflammatory cytokines released by stimulated macrophages in the alveoli could have a prominent role in pathogenesis of SARS. Current treatment of SARS with antiviral agents such as ribavirin and corticosteroids have not achieved very satisfactory results. Corticosteroids exert an antiinflammatory effect and are indicated for the treatment of respiratory distress, but, in the other hand, they exert an immunosuppressor effect on humoral and cellular arms of Immune System. Based on previous reports and on our own experience in HIV, we propose here pentoxifylline (PTX), a drug commonly used in vascular indications, as a possible treatment for SARS due to its interesting properties. PTX would feature a possible antiviral activity along with a well-known cytokine-modulating activity not as immunosuppressant as that of the corticoids, down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines but leaving functional the rest of the immune response. Other effects of PTX are discussed, as bronchodilation. CONCLUSIONS The antiinflammatory, antiviral, immunomodulatory and bronchodilatory effects of PTX, along with its low cost and toxicity, make it a promising drug to be considered for SARS treatment, alone or as an adjuvant therapy in combination with other drugs. The classical antiviral approach as single treatment for viral diseases should be reviewed in this occasion; immunomodulatory therapies could play an important role in SARS therapy.","Bermejo Martin, Jesús Fco; Jimenez, José L; Muńoz-Fernández, Angeles",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12824965/,366

The purified glucosamine-labeled 92,000-molecular-weight protein synthesized in the presence of tunicamycin and the fully glycosylated forms of gAB and gC were tested for their sensitivity to mild alkaline hydrolysis. Purified gAB was resistant to mild alkaline hydrolysis, whereas gC and the 92,000-molecular-weight protein were both sensitive to mild alkaline hydrolysis.

Physicians show considerable variability in describing the signs and symptoms necessary to its diagnosis. Because acute bronchitis most often has a viral cause, symptomatic treatment with protussives, antitussives, or bronchodilators is appropriate. However, studies indicate that many physicians treat bronchitis with antibiotics. These drugs have generally been shown to be ineffective in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Furthermore, antibiotics often have detrimental side effects, and their overuse contributes to the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance. Patient satisfaction with the treatment of acute bronchitis is related to the quality of the physician-patient interaction rather than to prescription of an antibiotic.","Knutson, Doug; Braun, Chad",American family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12046770/,366

People of all age groups were affected by this virus though children showed milder clinical characteristics and initially less number of children was affected by this virus. It is very important to know the difference in clinical patterns between COVID-19 affected children and adults. This cross-sectional prospective study was carried out in Kurmitola General Hospital, Dhaka from April to September 2020 to compare the clinical pattern and laboratory findings between COVID-19 positive children and adults. Total 150 COVID-19 positive patients were enrolled in this study, among them 100 patients were adults (>18 year) mean±SD age (49.9±14.33) and 50 patients were children (Day 1-18 year) mean±SD age (8.7±4.79). The adult group had 66 males and 34 females and the pediatric group had 27 males and 23 females. No significant sex difference was seen between the two groups (0.153). Most of the children were affected by family contact and they showed a mild type of illness but adult patients had contact from different sources. Fever and cough were the main symptoms of both groups but fever was more common in adults (81%) than children (36%), p-value (0.001). In children no severe or critical cases were found. But asymptomatic cases were 8%, mild cases (68%) and moderate cases (24%) in children. In adults no asymptomatic patients were found. Moderate cases were 72%, severe 14% and critical 5% (p value 0.001). Leucopenia, Lymphopenia and raised CRP and increased ferritin were found more in adults than children. Chest X-ray showed 42% of children had pneumonia and 83% adults had pneumonia. There was significant difference between the two groups (p value 0.0001). This study concludes that corona virus affects children like adults but their presentation is not so severe and children show mild clinical symptoms in comparison with adults.","Hasnat, F; Noman, F; Moben, A L; Sarker, A S; Morshed, J; Mutanabbi, M",Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34605482/,366

The causative agent is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the genus Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae. In published reports, the case fatality rate has generally ranged from 10% to 50%. Sporadic cases and outbreaks of the disease have increased during the past decade across the endemic region. CCHF was first diagnosed in Turkey in 2002, but since then more than 1100 cases have been confirmed by IgM serology or RT-PCR, with a fatality rate of just over 5%. Simple methods are available for the in vitro evaluation of antiviral drugs, but because CCHF virus does not cause disease in its reservoir species or in laboratory animals other than suckling mice, methods are lacking for in vivo efficacy testing. Intravenous or oral ribavirin has been used in several countries to treat the disease for more than 20 years. Evidence of its efficacy is limited to observational studies, and placebo-controlled trials may be impossible to perform for ethical reasons. However, careful analysis of properly stratified observational studies can be used to assess the effects of treatment. This article reviews current approaches to the treatment of CCHF, focusing on the use of ribavirin and hematological support, and discusses prospects for future research.","Ergonul, Onder",Antiviral research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18096251/,366

This article builds on previous literature on the propagandistic nature of positive energy and the Chinese feminist movement to consider how positive energy lying under Jiangshanjiao was deconstructed and how femininity was invoked to serve for broader political purposes in a repressive online environment. Drawing on the framework of online connective action and political satire as a networked practice, this research sheds light on the hashtag #JiangshanjiaoDoYouGetYourPeriod#. This research explores how the satirical hashtag was collectively produced in an Internet trolling culture and contributed to building a collective identity through personalized narratives. Through the feminist hashtag, netizens expressed their multilayered grievances against misogyny, state propaganda, and censorship.

WBRS + WB resulted in lower cold carcass weight than WBRS + CF; however, this reduction was not sufficient to alter the carcass commercial yield or loin-eye area. The leg cut of animals fed WBRS + WB showed less value than those animals fed with WBRS + CS. The meat lightness of WBRS was higher that of WBRS + MC, WBRS + WB, and WBRS + CF. The cooking loss for WBRS + WB was less than those animals fed with WBRS + CS. However, meat protein, meat cholesterol, and shear force were similar among treatments (17.69%, 42.46 mg/100 g of meat, and 2.48 kgf/cm2, respectively).

This study aimed to evaluate whether technical analysis (TA) indicators, commonly used in the financial market to spot security price trend reversals, might be proficiently used also to anticipate a possible increase of SARS-Cov-2 spread. METHODS: Analysis was performed on datasets from Italy, Iran, and Brazil. TA indicators tested were: (1) the combined use of a faster (3-d) and a slower (20-d) simple moving averages (SMA), (2) the moving average converge/divergence (MACD), and (3) the divergence in the direction of the number of new daily cases trend and the corresponding MACD histogram. RESULTS: We found that the use of both fast/slow SMAs and MACD provided a reliable signal of trend inversion of SARS-Cov-2 spread. Results were consistent for all the 3 countries considered. The trend reversals signaled by the indicators were always followed by a sustained trend persistence until a new signal of reversal appeared.

A recent strategy to achieve this goal is formation of stable co-amorphous solid dispersions with co-formers of low molecular weight. Here, the amorphization strategy was applied for low-soluble anti-hypertensive valsartan (VAL), an angiotensin II receptor blocker, and nicotinamide, which exhibits lung- and cardio-protective effects. Through interactions with the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system, VAL may be used to treat both hypertension and the current pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using mechanochemical and liquid- and solid-state approaches, solvated co-amorphous solid dispersions of VAL with nicotinamide were obtained. They were characterized by spectroscopic, thermal, and X-ray analyses. The density functional theory, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, and non-covalent interaction index calculations revealed the presence of two types of hydrogen bonds between VAL and NIC (i.e., N-H···O and O-H···O). One of them had a partially covalent character, which caused conformational changes in the flexible VAL molecule, restricting contribution of the tetrazolyl N-H donor and thus limiting the possibility of co-crystal formation. The recognized VAL/NIC1- and VAL/NIC2-type heterodimeric interactions were responsible for the excellent durability of the solid compositions and up to 24-fold better solubility than VAL alone. The synthesized dispersions constitute a new class of dually acting drugs, containing an active pharmaceutical ingredient (VAL) and supporting nutraceutical (nicotinamide).","Turek, Marika; Rózycka-Sokolowska, Ewa; Koprowski, Marek; Marciniak, Bernard; Balczewski, Piotr",Mol Pharm,,366

Because of the public health emergency, chest CT has been widely used for sensitive detection and diagnosis, monitoring the changes of lesions and also for treatment evaluation. The purpose of this study was to investigate radiation dose and image quality of chest CT scans received by COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the oncogenic risk of multiple chest CT examinations. Methods A retrospective review of 33 patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection was performed from January 31, 2020 to February 19, 2020. The date of each CT exam and respective radiation dose for each exam was recorded for all patients. Multiple pulmonary CT scans were obtained during diagnosis and treatment procedure. Scan frequency, total scan times, radiation dose, and image quality were determined. Results Thirty-three patients (15 males and 18 females, age 21–82 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia underwent a total of 143 chest CT scans. The number of CT scans per patient was 4 ± 1, with a range of 2–6. The time interval between two consecutive chest CT scans was 3 ± 1 days. The average effective dose from a single chest CT scan was 1.21 ± 0.10 mSv, with a range of 1.02–1.44 mSv. The average cumulative effective dose per patient was 5.25 ± 1.52 mSv, with a range of 2.24–7.48 mSv. The maximum cumulative effective dose was 7.48 mSv for six CT examinations during COVID-19 treatment. Based on subjective image quality analysis, the visual scoring of CT findings was 11.23 ± 1.35 points out of 15 points. Conclusions The frequency, total number and image quality of chest CT scans should be reviewed carefully to guarantee minimally required CT scans during the COVID-19 management.","Bai, Lu Zhou Jie Shen Cong Cai Shubo Guo Youmin Huang Xunan Jia Guang Niu Gang",Chinese journal of academic radiology,,366

In distinction to energy efficiency, we define sufficiency as behavioral changes to reduce useful energy without significantly reducing utility, for example by adjusting thermostats. By reducing demand, sufficiency measures are a potentially decisive but seldomly considered factor to support the transformation towards a decarbonized energy system. Therefore, this paper addresses the following question: What is the potential of sufficiency measures and what is their impacts on the supply side of a 100% renewable energy system? For this purpose, an extensive literature review is conducted to obtain estimates for the effects of different sufficiency measures on final energy demand in Germany. Afterwards, the impact of these measures on the supply side and system costs is quantified using a bottom-up planning model of a renewable energy system. Results indicate that final energy could be reduced by up to 20.5% and as a result cost reduction between 11.3% to 25.6% are conceivable. The greatest potential for sufficiency measures was identified in the heating sector.","Zozmann, Elmar; Eerma, Mirjam Helena; Manning, Dylan; Okland, Gro Lill; Angel, Citlali Rodriguez del; Seifert, Paul E.; Winkler, Johanna; Blaumann, Alfredo Zamora; Hosseinioun, Seyedsaeed; Goke, Leonard; Kendziorski, Mario; Hirschhausen, Christian von",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00453v3.pdf,366

Urgent prevention and control measures have obstructed patients' access to pain treatment, and many patients with pain have been unable to receive adequate and timely medical services. Many patients with COVID-19 report painful symptoms including headache, muscle pain, and chest pain during the initial phase of the disease. Persistent pain sequela in patients with COVID-19 has a physical or mental impact and may also affect the immune, endocrine, and other systems. However, the management and treatment of neurological symptoms such as pain are often neglected for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Based on the China's early experience in the management of COVID-19 symptoms, the possible negative effects of pre-existing chronic pain in patients with COVID-19 and the challenges of COVID-19 prevention and control bring to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic pain are discussed.

Vaccine is in urgent need to stop the pandemic. Despite great progresses on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development, the efficacy of the vaccines remains to be determined. Deciphering the interactions of the viral epitopes with the elicited neutralizing antibodies in convalescent population inspires the vaccine development. In this study, we devised a peptide array composed of 20-mer overlapped peptides of spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins, and performed a screening with 120 COVID-19 convalescent sera and 24 non-COVID-19 sera. We identified five SARS-CoV-2-specific dominant epitopes that reacted with above 40&percnt; COVID-19 convalescent sera. Of note, two peptides non-specifically interacted with most of the non-COVID-19 sera. Neutralization assay indicated that only five sera completely blocked viral infection at the dilution of 1:200. By using a peptide-compete neutralizing assay, we found that three dominant epitopes partially competed the neutralization activity of several convalescent sera, suggesting antibodies elicited by these epitopes played an important role in neutralizing viral infection. The epitopes we identified in this study may serve as vaccine candidates to elicit neutralizing antibodies in most vaccinated people or specific antigens for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Yi, Zhigang; Ling, Yun; Zhang, Xiaonan; Chen, Jieliang; Hu, Kongying; Wang, Yuyan; Song, Wuhui; Ying, Tianlei; Zhang, Rong; Lu, HongZhou; Yuan, Zhenghong",Emerg Microbes Infect,,366

213266,Exploratory Analysis of Physical Therapy Process of Care and Psychosocial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical Therapists,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 virus which targets the pulmonary vasculature is supposed to induce an intrapulmonary right to left shunt with an increased pulmonary blood flow. Such vascular injury is difficult to observe because it is hidden by the concomitant lung injury. We report here what may be, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of a pure Covid-19 related Acute Vascular Distress Syndrome (AVDS). CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old physician, tested positive for Covid-19, was addressed to the emergency unit for severe dyspnoea and dizziness. Explorations were non informative with only a doubt regarding a sub-segmental pulmonary embolism (no ground-glass lesions or consolidations related to Covid-19 disease). Dyspnoea persisted despite anticoagulation therapy and normal pulmonary function tests. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography was performed which revealed a moderate late right-to-left shunt. CONCLUSIONS: This case report highlights the crucial importance of the vascular component of the viral disease. The intrapulmonary shunt induced by Covid-19 which remains unrecognized because generally hidden by the concomitant lung injury, can persist for a long time. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography is the most appropriate test to propose in case of persistent dyspnoea in Covid-19 patients.","Jounieaux, Vincent; Basille, Damien; Abou-Arab, Osama; Guillaumont, Marie-Pierre; Andrejak, Claire; Mahjoub, Yazine; Rodenstein, Daniel Oscar",BMC Infect Dis,,366
213267,Exploratory Analysis of Physical Therapy Process of Care and Psychosocial Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physical Therapists,2021,"BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection represent a clinical challenge because they encompass a broad neurological spectrum and may occur before the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: In this monocentric retrospective case series, medical records from patients with acute neurological disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from medicine departments of an academic center in Paris area were collected between March 15th and May 15th 2020. Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was ascertained through specific RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs or based on circulating serum IgG antibodies. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with neurological disorders: encephalitis (N=8), encephalopathy (N=6), cerebrovascular events (ischemic strokes N=4 and vein thromboses N=2), other central nervous system (CNS) disorders (N=4), and Guillain-Barré syndrome (N=2). The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was delayed on average 1.6 days after the onset of neurological disorder, especially in case of encephalitis 3.9 days, encephalopathy 1.0 day, and cerebrovascular event 2.7 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that COVID-19 can yield a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. Because neurological presentations of COVID-19 often occur a few days before the diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection, clinicians should take preventive measures such as patient isolation and masks for any new admission to avoid nosocomial infections. Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibody detection in RT-PCR SARS CoV-2 negative suspected cases is useful to confirm a posteriori the diagnosis of atypical COVID-19 presentations.","Cleret de Langavant, L; Petit, A; Nguyen, Q T R; Gendre, T; Abdelhedi, J; Djellaoui, A; Seddik, L; Lim, L; Faugeras, F; Salhi, H; Wahab, A; Fechtenbaum, L; Dormeuil, A; Hosseini, H; Youssov, K; Fénelon, G; Bapst, B; Brugières, P; Tuilier, T; Kalsoum, E; Matignon, M-B; Oniszczuk, J; Gallien, S; Vindrios, W; Melica, G; Scain, A-L; Esser, R; Rostain, L; Guillaud, C; Dubos-Lascu, G; Saada, N; Guillet, H; Khellaf, M; Bardel, B; Ayache, S S; Lefaucheur, J-P; Pawlotsky, J-M; Fourati, S; Bachoud-Lévi, A-C",Rev Neurol (Paris),,366

Key informants were asked about the community's experiences with COVID-19 testing and treatment, responses to CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines, perceptions about the virus, and the pandemic's impact on physical and mental health. Results suggest that COVID-19 has profoundly impacted Brazilian immigrants' mental and physical health. Key informants perceived that community members faced higher risk of COVID-19 infection due to overcrowded living conditions and over-representation in public-facing and informal (e.g., housecleaning) jobs. They reported barriers to COVID-19-related healthcare services including language, immigration status, and fear of deportation. Brazilian cultural norms surrounding hygiene practices, social distancing, and information distribution have shaped the community's pandemic response. The Brazilian community has faced extensive social, economic, and health ramifications due to the pandemic. While not unique to this community, pre-existing concerns about social disadvantage suggest a particular vulnerability of this population to the virus.","Priebe Rocha, Leticia; Rose, Rebecca; Hoch, Annmarie; Soares, Cristiane; Fernandes, Adriana; Galvão, Heloisa; Allen, Jennifer D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366

We applied a novel dimer avoidance multiplexed polymerase chain reaction next-generation sequencing assay to analyze T (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoires. Surprisingly, TCR repertoires were markedly diminished during the early onset of severe disease but recovered during the convalescent stage. Monitoring TCR repertoires could serve as an indicative biomarker to predict disease progression and recovery. Panoramic concurrent assessment of BCR repertoires demonstrated isotype switching and a transient but dramatic early IgA expansion. Dominant B cell clonal expansion with decreased diversity occurred following recovery from infection. Profound changes in T cell homeostasis raise critical questions about the early events in COVID-19 infection and demonstrate that immune repertoire analysis is a promising method for evaluating emergent host immunity to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, with great implications for assessing vaccination and other immunological therapies.","Niu, Xuefeng; Li, Song; Li, Pingchao; Pan, Wenjing; Wang, Qian; Feng, Ying; Mo, Xiaoneng; Yan, Qihong; Ye, Xianmiao; Luo, Jia; Qu, Linbing; Weber, Daniel; Byrne-Steele, Miranda L; Wang, Zhe; Yu, Fengjia; Li, Fang; Myers, Richard M; Lotze, Michael T; Zhong, Nanshan; Han, Jian; Chen, Ling",Front Immunol,,366

CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department with fever, dry cough and sore throat for the last 14 days as well as acute stenocardia and shortage of breath. Sputum testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial computed tomography (CT) showed bipulmonary groundglass opacities and consolidations with peripheral distribution. Hospitalization with supportive therapy (azithromycin) as well as non-invasive oxygenation led to a stabilization of the patient. After 5 days, sputum testing was negative and IgA/IgG antibody titres were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was discharged after 7 days. On the 11th day, the patient realized pronounced dyspnoea after coughing and presented to the emergency department again. CT showed a right-sided tension pneumothorax, which was relieved by a chest drain (Buelau) via mini open thoracotomy. Negative pressure therapy resulted in regression of the pneumothorax and the patient was discharged after 9 days of treatment.

219422,Covid-19 pandemic impact on colonoscopy service and suggestions for managing recovery,2020,"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that created a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, with a global case burden of over 15 million in just seven months. Infected patients develop a wide range of clinical manifestations - typically presenting with fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue. Severely-ill patients may fall victim to acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute heart injuries, neurological manifestations, or complications due to secondary infections. These critically-ill patients are also found to have disrupted coagulation function, predisposing them to consumptive coagulopathies, and both venous and thromboembolic complications. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation products, and fibrinogen, all of which have been associated with greater disease severity. Many cases of pulmonary embolism have been noted, along with deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and systemic arterial embolism. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been completely elucidated, but the virus is known to cause excessive inflammation, endothelial injury, hypoxia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, all of which contribute to thrombosis formation. These patients are also faced with prolonged immobilization while staying in the hospital or intensive care unit. It is important to have a high degree of suspicion for thrombotic complications as patients may rapidly deteriorate in severe cases. Evidence suggests that prophylaxis with anticoagulation may lead to a lower risk of mortality, although it does not eliminate the possibility. The risks and benefits of anticoagulation treatment should be considered in each case. Patients should be regularly evaluated for bleeding risks and thrombotic complications.","Castro, Rebecca; Frishman, William H",Cardiol. rev,,366

Here, the construction of a noninfectious SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon and its application in deciphering viral replication mechanisms and evaluating SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors are presented. The replicon genome is replication competent but does not produce progeny virions. Its replication can be inhibited by RdRp mutations or by known SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds. Using this system, a high-throughput antiviral assay has also been developed. Significant differences in potencies of several SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors in different cell lines were observed, which highlight the challenges of discovering antivirals capable of inhibiting viral replication in vivo and the importance of testing compounds in multiple cell culture models.

Termed by some as the twenty-first century's first pandemic, SARS originated in China and alerted the country to the importance of public health and epidemic response. After SARS, China improved its health infrastructure and reformed its political and legal health governance system. The emergence of COVID-19 from Wuhan in late 2019 put those reforms to the test. This paper analyses China's public health and epidemic response policies from a historical perspective, tracing the evolution of Chinese public health policies after the SARS outbreak in 2003. This paper assesses China's response to COVID-19 and how post-SARS policy reforms, particularly in epidemic response, played out on the ground in Wuhan. What policies worked well? What were the challenges faced? Based on the policy analysis, this paper presents recommendations for how China can improve its epidemic response through strengthened infectious disease surveillance, more transparent political coordination, and expanded public health infrastructure.","Li, Melissa",Glob Public Health,,366

Procalcitonin (PCT) levels have been shown to be significantly increased in COVID-19 patients in comparison with healthy subjects/asymptomatic coronavirus-positive patients. In this report, our aim was to assess the associations of the PCT level with DIC and the severity of COVID-19 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional, retrospective study, 71 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 (21 with DIC and 50 without DIC) were enrolled in the study. The PCT level was obtained from hospital records. RESULTS: The PCT level was significantly higher in the patients with DIC than in those without DIC [1.9 (0.6-14.5) vs. 0.3 (0.2-0.4) (ng/mL), p<0.01]. The PCT level showed a positive and significant correlation with DIC (r=0.382, p=0.001) and was an independent predictor of DIC in patients with severe COVID-19 (OR: 6.685, CI: 1.857-24.063, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the PCT level was increased in severe COVID-19 patients with DIC compared with those without DIC. An increased PCT level might suggest the presence of DIC and may help in predicting COVID-19 severity.","Asoglu, R; Tibilli, H; Afsin, A; Türkmen, S; Barman, H A; Asoglu, E",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,366

Several departments have reported their experiences and protocols to provide insights for others impacted. The goals of this study are to report the load and variety of neurosurgical cases and clinic visits after discontinuing the COVID-19 Battle Plan at an academic tertiary care referral center to provide insights for other departments going through the same transition. METHODS: The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between May 4, 2020, and June 4, 2020 were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group were retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions and clinic visits performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one patients underwent neurosurgical interventions, and seven-hundred one patients were seen in clinic appointments, in the 4-week period following easing back from our COVID-19 ""Battle Plan."" Discontinuing the ""Battle Plan"" resulted in increases in case load to above-average practice after a week but a continued decrease in clinic appointments throughout the 4 weeks compared with average practice. CONCLUSIONS: As policy-shaping crises like pandemics abate, easing back to ""typical"" practice can be completed effectively by appropriately allocating resources. This can be accomplished by anticipating increases in neurosurgical volume, specifically in the functional/epilepsy and brain tumor subspecialties, as well as continued decreases in neurosurgical clinic volume, specifically in elective spine.","Pressman, Elliot; Noureldine, Mohammad Hassan A; Kumar, Jay I; Krafft, Paul R; Mantei, Braden; Greenberg, Mark S; Agazzi, Siviero; van Loveren, Harry; Alikhani, Puya",World neurosurgery (Online),,366

225085,Excess Mortality Estimation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Data from Portugal,2020,"There is currently a respiratory disease outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After rapid development, RNA vaccines and adenoviral vector vaccines were approved within a year, which has demonstrated the strong impact of preventing infectious diseases using gene therapy technology. Furthermore, intensive immunological analysis has been performed to evaluate the efficiency and safety of these vaccines, potentially allowing for rapid progress in vaccine technology. After the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, the novel vaccine technology developed will expand to other vaccines. We have been developing vaccines for chronic diseases, such as hypertension, for >10 years. Regarding the development of vaccines against self-antigens (i.e., angiotensin II), the vaccine should efficiently induce a blocking antibody response against the self-antigen without activating cytotoxic T cells. Therefore, the epitope vaccine approach has been proposed to induce antibody production in response to a combination of a B cell epitope and exogenous T cell epitopes through major histocompatibility complex molecules. When these vaccines are established as therapeutic options for hypertension, their administration regimen, which might be a few times per year, will replace daily medication use. Thus, therapeutic vaccines for hypertension may be a novel option to control the progression of cerebrovascular diseases. Hopefully, the accumulation of immunological findings and vaccine technology advances due to COVID-19 will provide a novel concept for vaccines for chronic diseases.","Nakagami, Hironori; Hayashi, Hiroki; Shimamura, Munehisa; Rakugi, Hiromi; Morishita, Ryuichi",Hypertens. res,,366

In this study, we assessed the use of posterior oropharyngeal saliva as specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an automated point-of-care molecular assay. Archived nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens of 58 COVID-19 patients were tested with the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in either NPS or saliva specimens of all patients. Among them, 84.5% (49/58) tested positive in both NPS and saliva, 10.3% (6/58) tested positive in NPS only, and 5.2% (3/58) tested positive in saliva only. No significant difference in the detection rate was observed between NPS and saliva (McNemar's test p = 0.5078). The detection rate was slightly higher for N2 (NPS 94.8% and Saliva 93.1%) than that of the E gene target (Saliva: 89.7% vs 82.8%) on both specimen types. Significantly earlier median Ct value was observed for NPS comparing to that of saliva on both E (26.8 vs 29.7, p = 0.0002) and N2 gene target (29.3 vs 32.3, p = 0.0002). The median Ct value of E gene target was significantly earlier than that of the N2 gene target for both NPS (26.8 vs 29.3, p < 0.0001) and saliva (29.7 vs 32.3, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, posterior oropharyngeal saliva and NPS were found to have similar detection rates in the point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

As we respond to the SARS-COV2 pandemic with quarantine and social distancing, social isolation and feelings of loneliness are increasing among people of all ages. This presents as an opportune time to recognize the public health impact of these important psychosocial determinants. Loneliness and social isolation are associated with higher incidence of CVD, higher healthcare utilization and worse outcomes even after controlling for conventional risk factors of CVD. In this review, we discuss loneliness and social isolation as determinants of cardiovascular outcomes, the pathophysiology of this association, and its implications in clinical practice. We discuss some of the shortcomings in assessment of loneliness and social isolation while identifying most commonly used rating scales for the same. Finally, we suggest modifications to interventions for loneliness and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Tanya; Padala, Prasad R; Mehta, Jawahar L",Current cardiology reviews (Online),,366

However, there are anecdotal reports of hospitalization from protracted COVID-19 complications despite such confirmed viral clearance, presenting a clinical conundrum. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 222 hospitalized COVID-19 patients to compare those that were readmitted post-viral clearance (hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n = 49) with those that were not re-admitted post-viral clearance (non-hospitalized post-clearance cohort, n = 173) between February and October 2020. In order to differentiate these two cohorts, we used neural network models for the 'augmented curation' of comorbidities and complications with positive sentiment in the Electronic Hosptial Records physician notes. Findings: In the year preceding COVID-19 onset, anemia (n = 13 [26.5%], p-value: 0.007), cardiac arrhythmias (n = 14 [28.6%], p-value: 0.015), and acute kidney injury (n = 7 [14.3%], p-value: 0.030) were significantly enriched in the physician notes of the hospitalized post-clearance cohort.

228293,Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on sleep quality of medical staff in Wuhan,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults are indisputably struck hard by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The main objective of this meta-analysis is to establish the association between delirium and mortality in older adults with COVID-19. METHODS: Systematic literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were performed up until 28 November 2020. The exposure in this study was the diagnosis of delirium using clinically validated criteria. Delirium might be in-hospital, at admission, or both. The main outcome was mortality defined as clinically validated non-survivor/death. The effect estimates were reported as odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: A total of 3,868 patients from 9 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The percentage of patients with delirium was 27% [20%, 34%]. Every 1 mg/L increase in CRP was significantly associated with 1% increased delirium risk (OR 1.01 [1.00. 1.02], p=0.033). Delirium was associated with mortality (OR 2.39 [1.64, 3.49], p<0.001; I2: 82.88%). Subgroup analysis on delirium assessed at admission indicate independent association (OR 2.12 [1.39, 3.25], p<0.001; I2: 82.67%). Pooled adjusted analysis indicated that delirium was independently associated with mortality (aOR 1.50 [1.16, 1.94], p=0.002; I2: 31.02%). Subgroup analysis on delirium assessed at admission indicate independent association (OR 1.40 [1.03, 1.90], p=0.030; I2: 35.19%). Meta-regression indicates that the association between delirium and mortality were not significantly influenced by study-level variations in age, sex [reference: male], hypertension, diabetes, and dementia. CONCLUSION: The presence of delirium is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized older adults with COVID-19.","Pranata, Raymond; Huang, Ian; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Yonas, Emir; Vania, Rachel; Kuswardhani, Raden Ayu Tuty",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,366

228909,"Psychosis spectrum disorders during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: Warning signs of ""stress incubation""",2020,"Coronavirus is the first global crisis of a digital age and the divergence in policy responses reflects the challenge of navigating an unprecedented global situation under conditions of enormous uncertainty. We ask what lessons can be learned from this experience and identify two, both of which push against mainstream interpretations of recent events. First, and contrary to the view that the crisis exposed social media and Big Tech as a source of dangerous misinformation that needs to be regulated more strictly, the paper argues that the less mediated spaces of the Internet—social media and Twitter, in particular—played an essential role in triggering a more effective policy response based around social distancing, lockdown, and containment. Second, and contrary to the view that things will go back to normal once the worst of the crisis has passed, the paper argues that, as a direct result of lockdown, the status quo has been shifted across multiple sectors of the economy. Three examples of this shift are introduced, notably the forced experimentation with digital technologies in education and health, the increased use of remote work in many companies, and a reduction in environmentally harmful behavior and decrease in pollution levels. The long-term effects of this ‘reset’ are impossible to predict, but a quick return to the ‘old normal’ seems unlikely. The paper concludes with the suggestion that this reset has created a unique historical opportunity for the reappraisal of regulatory approaches across multiple domains and exposed the need for regulatory models better aligned to a less mediated, more decentralized world. COVID-19 is a global tragedy, but—given that it has happened—it should be used as a learning experience to re-imagine a better, more socially, and environmentally responsible future.","Fenwick, Mark; McCahery, Joseph A.; Vermeulen, Erik P.

METHODS: New York-Presbyterian Hospital - Weill Cornell Medical Center is an urban, quaternary, academic medical center, a level 1 trauma center, and a regional burn center located in New York City. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created a unique challenge for pediatric emergency medicine. As the crisis heightened for adult patients, pediatric emergency services experienced a significant decline in volume and acuity. RESULTS: We offer guidelines to modify physical space, clinical services, staffing models, and the importance of steady leadership. Pediatric emergency space was converted to adult COVID-19 beds, necessitating the repurposing of nonclinical areas for pediatric patients. Efficient clinical pathways were created in collaboration with medical and surgical subspecialists for expedited emergency care of children. We transitioned staffing models to meet the changing clinical demands of the emergency department by both reallocation of pediatric emergency medicine providers to telemedicine and by expanding their clinical care to adult patients. Concentrated communication and receptiveness by hospital and department leadership were fundamental to address the dynamic state of the pandemic and ensure provider wellness. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of physical space, clinical services, staffing models, and the importance of steady leadership enabled us to maintain outstanding clinical care for pediatric patients while maximizing capacity and service for adult COVID-19 patients in the emergency department.","Fraymovich, Susan; Levine, Deborah A; Platt, Shari L",Pediatr Emerg Care,,366

231559,Palliative care amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: challenges and contributions,2020,"The aim of this paper is to examine the economic policy response to the COVID-19 crisis in Poland. The paper investigates the rationale for the economic policy tools implemented, their costs, and potential consequences for the Polish economy. The analysis concentrates on the initial phase of the crisis (March–April 2020). The study proves that the scope of economic policy adjustments in Poland might be viewed as relatively wide. Monetary policy tools and fiscal packages implemented induce profound consequences for the Polish economy. The total new financing needed by the government for anti-crisis measures results in a significant increase in the public debt ratio, from 44% in 2019 to 51.5% in 2020, and in a state budget deficit of 7.6% of GDP in 2020. Although the projected debt ratio is still below the 55% alert threshold prescribed by the Polish legislation, policy makers should consider risk factors. First, under an extended lockdown scenario financing needs might be larger than initially estimated. Second, if the Polish zloty depreciates due to external pressures, the debt ratio increases even more as 30% of the Polish public debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Financing the fiscal packages is not possible without the support of the central bank (NBP). The scope of the quantitative easing policy required is comparable in relative terms to programmes implemented in the United States after 2009. Therefore, economic agents should expect an unprecedented increase in the NBP balance sheet and money in circulation. This should have an impact on price levels in Poland, at least in the long term. The worst-case scenario is stagflation, characterised by sluggish economic growth and rising inflation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sobanski, K.",Eurasian Studies in Business and Economics,,366

While declines of most air pollutants have been globally evidenced in most cities worldwide, there is few detailed spatial knowledge at local scale. Therefore, we present here a high resolution mapping of the 2018-2020 evolution of human activities and air pollutants in Wuhan. Human activities were assessed by nighttime light radiance. We measured the air quality index (AQI) as the maximum value among air quality sub-indices of SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and particulate matter. We also compared mean monthly pollutant concentration during January-April in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Mapping results show that variations of nighttime light radiance were heterogenous at local scale, showing both rises and declines in the same district. The radiance decreased in eight districts located mostly in the city center, as a result of lower human activity, but the radiance increased in the five surrounding districts, as a consequence of people staying at home. AQI was low during lockdown, averaging at 57, but showed strong daily variations with a slight pollution around February 5 with AQI rising to 126. During this pollution event, particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO levels were positively correlated, suggesting common sources, but were not correlated with ozone; and particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO decreased with relative humidity, suggesting removal by precipitation. Comparison of 2020 data with previous years shows that particulate matter and NO2 were highly reduced, CO was less reduced due to ongoing power industries, SO2 first declined then increased to exceed 2018-19 values due to coal combustion, and ozone levels was more abundant due both to less NOx pollution and the weekend effect.

We described the characteristics of patients in fever clinic, then we extracted and classified questions of patient consultations through the online fever clinic dataset. RESULTS: For the 64 487 patients who attended the online fever clinic, the average age was 30.4 years, and 37 665 (58.4%) were female patients. The current state of patients from online were home without isolation (52 360 [81.2%]), home isolated (11 152 [17.29%]), and outpatient observation (975 [1.51%]). From the 594 patient questions analyzed, confirming diagnosis and seeking medical treatment account for 60.61% and 38.05%, respectively, followed by treating (25.59%), preventing (4.38%), and relieving anxiety (1.68%). DISCUSSION: Online fever clinics can effectively relieve patients' mood of panic, and doctors can guide patients with suspected of COVID-19 to isolate and protect themselves through online fever clinic. Online fever clinics can also help to reduce the pressure of hospital fever clinics and prevent cross infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated the importance of online fever clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak for prevention and control.","Li, Gang; Fan, Guorui; Chen, Yanyan; Deng, Zhaohua",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,366

237267,Under the Microscope: A Look Into the Role of Critical Care Pharmacists During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Rest-activity rhythm (RAR), a manifestation of circadian rhythms, has been associated with morbidity and mortality risk. However, RAR patterns in the general population and specifically the role of demographic characteristics in RAR pattern have not been comprehensively assessed. Therefore, we aimed to describe RAR patterns among non-institutionalized US adults and age, sex, and race/ethnicity variation using accelerometry data from a nationally representative population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. Participants aged &#8805;20 years who were enrolled in the physical activity monitoring examination and had at least four 24-h periods of valid wrist accelerometer data were included in the present analysis. 24-h RAR metrics were generated using both extended cosinor model (amplitude, mesor, acrophase and pseudo-F statistic) and nonparametric methods (interdaily stability [IS] and intradaily variability [IV]). Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between RAR and age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Eight thousand two hundred participants (mean [SE] age, 49.1 [0.5] years) were included, of whom 52.2% were women and 67.3% Whites. Women had higher RAR amplitude and mesor, and also more robust (pseudo-F statistic), more stable (higher IS) and less fragmented (lower IV) RAR (all P trend < 0.001) than men. Compared with younger adults (20-39 years), older adults (&#8805; 60 years) exhibited reduced RAR amplitude and mesor, but more stable and less fragmented RAR, and also reached their peak activity earlier (advanced acrophase) (all P trend < 0.001). Relative to other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the highest amplitude and mesor level, and most stable (highest IS) and least fragmented (lowest IV) RAR pattern (P trend < 0.001). Conversely, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest peak activity level (lowest amplitude) and least stable (lowest IS) RAR pattern (all P trend < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the general adult population, RAR patterns vary significantly according to sex, age and race/ethnicity. These results may reflect demographic-dependent differences in intrinsic circadian rhythms and may have important implications for understanding racial, ethnic, sex and other disparities in morbidity and mortality risk.","Li, Jingen; Somers, Virend K; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Di, Junrui; Covassin, Naima",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,,366

238062,Hand hygiene for healthcare workers: did we need COVID-19 to raise awareness of proper disinfection practice?,2021,"Cryocrystallography is a technique that is used more often than room-temperature data collection in macromolecular crystallography. One of its advantages is the significant reduction in radiation damage, which is especially useful in synchrotron experiments. Another advantage is that cryopreservation provides simple storage of crystals and easy transportation to a synchrotron. However, this technique sometimes results in the undesirable adhesion of frost to mounted crystals. The frost produces noisy diffraction images and reduces the optical visibility of crystals, which is crucial for aligning the crystal position with the incident X-ray position. To resolve these issues, a computer-controlled device has been developed that drizzles liquid nitrogen over a crystal to remove frost. It was confirmed that the device works properly, reduces noise from ice rings in diffraction images and enables the centering of crystals with low visibility owing to frost adhesion.","Nakamura, Yuki; Baba, Seiki; Mizuno, Nobuhiro; Irie, Takaki; Ueno, Go; Hirata, Kunio; Ito, Sho; Hasegawa, Kazuya; Yamamoto, Masaki; Kumasaka, Takashi",Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun,,366

Despite worldwide efforts to contain viral spread, the outbreak has not been stopped yet. Among healthcare personnel, dentists seem to be at elevated risk of exposure to COVID-19. This risk is even more serious in pediatric dentistry, since affected children, frequently, present an asymptomatic, mild or moderate clinical viral infection and, therefore, they may play a major role in community-based COVID-19 transmission. To date, despite no universal guidelines are available for dental procedures in pediatric dentistry during COVID-19 outbreak, routine dental practice should be postponed and only severe dental emergencies must be treated. In the case of a dental emergency, involving a pediatric patient, dentists should be aware of which recommended management protocol can be adopted during the practice to protect patient health, to safeguard their-self and to prevent viral transmission. The aim of this paper is to provide clinical recommendations, presenting a needed tool for dentists to allow a valid and safe how-to-do protocol.

During the time of the pandemic, social vloggers have used social media to actively share their opinions or experiences in quarantine. This paper collected videos from YouTube to track emotional responses in conversational vlogs and their potential associations with events related to the pandemic. In particular, vlogs uploaded from locations in New York City were analyzed given that this was one of the first epicenters of the pandemic in the United States. We observed some common patterns in vloggers' acoustic and linguistic features across the time span of the quarantine, which is indicative of changes in emotional reactivity. Additionally, we investigated fluctuations of acoustic and linguistic patterns in relation to COVID-19 events in the New York area (e.g. the number of daily new cases, number of deaths, and extension of stay-at-home order and state of emergency). Our results indicate that acoustic features, such as zero-crossing-rate, jitter, and shimmer, can be valuable for analyzing emotional reactivity in social media videos. Our findings further indicate that some of the peaks of the acoustic and linguistic indices align with COVID-19 events, such as the peak in the number of deaths and emergency declaration.","Feng, Kexin; Zanwar, Preeti; Behzadan, Amir H.; Chaspari, Theodora",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07504v1.pdf,366

242915,COVID-19 and the risk of homicide-suicide among older adults,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound impact on the health and development of children worldwide. There is limited evidence on the impact of COVID-19 and its related school closures and disease-containment measures on the psychosocial wellbeing of children; little research has been done on the characteristics of vulnerable groups and factors that promote resilience. METHODS: We conducted a large-scale cross-sectional population study of Hong Kong families with children aged 2-12 years. Parents completed an online survey on family demographics, child psychosocial wellbeing, functioning and lifestyle habits, parent-child interactions, and parental stress during school closures due to COVID-19. We used simple and multiple linear regression analyses to explore factors associated with child psychosocial problems and parental stress during the pandemic. RESULTS: The study included 29,202 individual families; of which 12,163 had children aged 2-5 years and 17,029 had children aged 6-12 years. The risk of child psychosocial problems was higher in children with special educational needs, and/or acute or chronic disease, mothers with mental illness, single-parent families, and low-income families. Delayed bedtime and/or inadequate sleep or exercise duration, extended use of electronic devices were associated with significantly higher parental stress and more psychosocial problems among pre-schoolers. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies vulnerable groups of children and highlights the importance of strengthening family coherence, adequate sleep and exercise, and responsible use of electronic devices in promoting psychosocial wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tso, Winnie W Y; Wong, Rosa S; Tung, Keith T S; Rao, Nirmala; Fu, King Wa; Yam, Jason C S; Chua, Gilbert T; Chen, Eric Y H; Lee, Tatia M C; Chan, Sherry K W; Wong, Wilfred H S; Xiong, Xiaoli; Chui, Celine S; Li, Xue; Wong, Kirstie; Leung, Cynthia; Tsang, Sandra K M; Chan, Godfrey C F; Tam, Paul K H; Chan, Ko Ling; Kwan, Mike Y W; Ho, Marco H K; Chow, Chun Bong; Wong, Ian C K; Lp, Patrick",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,,366

Although there are several promising drug candidates in clinical trials, none is available clinically. Thus, the drug repurposing approach may help to overcome the current pandemic. METHODS: The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for cleaving nascent polypeptide chains. Here, FDA-approved antiviral and anti-infection drugs were screened by high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) followed by re-docking with standard-precision (SP) and extra-precision (XP) molecular docking. The most potent drug's binding was further validated by free energy calculations (Prime/MM-GBSA) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. RESULTS: Out of 1397 potential drugs, 157 showed considerable affinity toward Mpro. After HTVS, SP, and XP molecular docking, four high-affinity lead drugs (Iodixanol, Amikacin, Troxerutin, and Rutin) with docking energies -10.629 to -11.776kcal/mol range were identified. Among them, Amikacin exhibited the lowest Prime/MM-GBSA energy (-73.800kcal/mol). It led us to evaluate other aminoglycosides (Neomycin, Paramomycin, Gentamycin, Streptomycin, and Tobramycin) against Mpro. All aminoglycosides were bound to the substrate-binding site of Mpro and interacted with crucial residues. Altogether, Amikacin was found to be the most potent inhibitor of Mpro. MD simulations of the Amikacin-Mpro complex suggested the formation of a complex stabilized by hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions. CONCLUSION: Aminoglycosides may serve as a scaffold to design potent drug molecules against COVID-19. However, further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies is required before using aminoglycosides as an anti-COVID-19 agent.","Ahmed, Mohammad Z; Zia, Qamar; Haque, Anzarul; Alqahtani, Ali S; Almarfadi, Omar M; Banawas, Saeed; Alqahtani, Mohammed S; Ameta, Keshav L; Haque, Shafiul",J Infect Public Health,,366

Here, we propose a new metapopulation epidemiological model as a network composed of equal clusters to predict the course of the epidemic based on the contiguous spreading between the neighbours, the probability of quarantine misbehaviour, and the probability of mobility, which control contacts outside the cluster. We exemplify the model by comparing simulation results with real data on COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia. Fitting the data over the first and second pandemic waves, when the probability of mobility is set by the stringency index, the probability of quarantine misbehaviour is found by a Bayesian optimization yielding a fascinating agreement between the daily COVID-19 deaths and model output and efficiently predicting the timing of pandemic bursts. A sudden increase in the probability of quarantine misbehaviour alongside the sudden increase in the probability of mobility generate the model third wave in good agreement with daily COVID-19 deaths.","Stipic, Dorian; Bradac, Mislav; Lipic, Tomislav; Podobnik, Boris",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,366
245590,Outcomes from COVID-19 across the range of frailty: excess mortality in fitter older people,2020,"Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is a global pandemic. The Covid-19 outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has overloaded healthcare systems that need medication to be rapidly established, at least to minimize the incidence of Covid-19. The co-infection with other microorganisms has drastically affected human health. Due to the utmost necessity to treat the patient infected with Covid-19 earliest, poor diagnosis and misuse of antibiotics may lead the world where no more drugs are available even to treat mild infections. Besides, sanitizers and disinfectants used to help minimize widespread coronavirus infection risk also contribute to an increased risk of antimicrobial resistance. To ease the situation, zinc supplements' potentiality has been explored and found to be an effective element to boost the immune system. Zinc also prevents the entry of the virus by increasing the ciliary beat frequency. Furthermore, the limitations of current antiviral agents such as a narrow range and low bioavailability can be resolved using nanomaterials, which are considered an important therapeutic alternative for the next generation. Thus, the development of new antiviral nanoagents will significantly help tackle many potential challenges and knowledge gaps. This review paper provides profound insight into how Covid-19 and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are interrelated and the possible implications and current strategies to fight the ongoing pandemic.","Goel, Nikky; Ahmad, Razi; Fatima, Huma; Khare, Sunil Kumar",Med Drug Discov,,366

The challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially represent an overwhelmingly stressful event for patients with chronic diseases. Aim of our study was to investigate the levels of resilience in individuals with inflammatory arthritis living in Emilia Romagna, the third hardest-hit Italian region during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this purpose, we developed a survey consisting of four different sections assessing demographic characteristics, the 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires evaluating depression and anxiety. Consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis were recruited over a short time frame immediately after the end of national lockdown and compared with control individuals from the general population. One hundred twenty-two patients and 173 controls were included. Levels of resilience, as measured by RS14 score, were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory arthritis (82.6 ± 14.0 vs 79.0 ± 12.8, p = 0.018). After stratification for gender, the difference in RS14 score was maintained in women (p = 0.045), but not in men (p = 0.252). High resilience, defined as having a RS14 score > 90, was significantly more prevalent in patients than in controls (30% vs 16%, p = 0.009). In arthritis patients, no significant differences in RS14 were observed after stratification for specific diagnosis, age, or disease duration and activity. Our findings suggest that patients with inflammatory arthritis may be more resilient than the general population towards unexpected stressful events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Key Points â¢ Living with inflammatory arthritis may foster resilience. â¢ After COVID-19, patients with inflammatory arthritis were more resilient than the general population.","Ciaffi, Jacopo; Brusi, Veronica; Lisi, Lucia; Mancarella, Luana; D039,; Onghia, Martina; Quaranta, Elisabetta; Bruni, Antonella; Spinella, Amelia; Giuggioli, Dilia; Landini, Maria Paola; Ferri, Clodoveo; Meliconi, Riccardo; Ursini, Francesco",Clin Rheumatol,,366

246780,Reflection: Spirituality during COVID-19,2021,"Importance: A strategy that prioritizes individuals for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination according to their risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality would help minimize deaths during vaccine rollout. Objective: To develop a model that estimates the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related mortality among all enrollees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prognostic study used data from 7â¯635â¯064 individuals enrolled in the VA health care system as of May 21, 2020, to develop and internally validate a logistic regression model (COVIDVax) that predicted SARS-CoV-2-related death (n = 2422) during the observation period (May 21 to November 2, 2020) using baseline characteristics known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2-related mortality, extracted from the VA electronic health records (EHRs). The cohort was split into a training period (May 21 to September 30) and testing period (October 1 to November 2). Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2-related death, defined as death within 30 days of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. VA EHR data streams were imported on a data integration platform to demonstrate that the model could be executed in real-time to produce dashboards with risk scores for all current VA enrollees. Results: Of 7â¯635â¯064 individuals, the mean (SD) age was 66.2 (13.8) years, and most were men (7â¯051â¯912 [92.4%]) and White individuals (4â¯887â¯338 [64.0%]), with 1â¯116â¯435 (14.6%) Black individuals and 399â¯634 (5.2%) Hispanic individuals. From a starting pool of 16 potential predictors, 10 were included in the final COVIDVax model, as follows: sex, age, race, ethnicity, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and Care Assessment Need score. The model exhibited excellent discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.3% (95% CI, 84.6%-86.1%), superior to the AUROC of using age alone to stratify risk (72.6%; 95% CI, 71.6%-73.6%). Assuming vaccination is 90% effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2-related death, using this model to prioritize vaccination was estimated to prevent 63.5% of deaths that would occur by the time 50% of VA enrollees are vaccinated, significantly higher than the estimate for prioritizing vaccination based on age (45.6%) or the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention phases of vaccine allocation (41.1%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prognostic study of all VA enrollees, prioritizing vaccination based on the COVIDVax model was estimated to prevent a large proportion of deaths expected to occur during vaccine rollout before sufficient herd immunity is achieved.","Ioannou, George N; Green, Pamela; Fan, Vincent S; Dominitz, Jason A; O039,; Hare, Ann M; Backus, Lisa I; Locke, Emily; Eastment, McKenna C; Osborne, Thomas F; Ioannou, Nikolas G; Berry, Kristin",JAMA Netw Open,,366
246819,Appointment impact and orthodontic emergency occurrence during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective study,2021,"The aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of suicide thoughts and attempts during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak and examine pandemic-related factors associated with suicide thoughts in the general Norwegian population. A sample of 4527 adults living in Norway were recruited via social media. Data related to suicide thoughts and attempts, alcohol use, pandemic-related concerns, and sociodemographic variables were collected. Associations with suicide thoughts were analyzed with logistic regression analysis. In the sample, 3.6% reported suicide thoughts during the last month, while 0.2% had attempted suicide during the same period. Previous suicide attempts (OR: 11.93, p &lt; 0.001), lower age (OR: 0.69, p &lt; 0.001), daily alcohol use (OR: 3.31, p &lt; 0.001), being in the risk group for COVID-19 complications (OR: 2.15, p &lt; 0.001), and having economic concerns related to the pandemic (OR: 2.28, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with having current suicide thoughts. In addition to known risk factors, the study suggests that aspects specific to COVID-19 may be important for suicidal behaviors during the pandemic.","Bonsaksen, T.; Skogstad, L.; Heir, T.; Ekeberg, O.; Schou-Bredal, I.; Grimholt, T.

247747,Mindfulness and engagement in COVID-19 preventive behavior,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Initially, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was considered primarily a respiratory pathogen. However, with time it has behaved as a virus with the potential to cause multi-system involvement, including neurological manifestations. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT) has increasingly been reported in association with coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we have shed light upon CVT and its possible mechanisms in the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this review, data were collected from PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, until March 30, 2021, using pre-specified searching strategies. The search strategy consisted of a variation of keywords of relevant medical subject headings and keywords, including ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""coronavirus"", and ""cerebral venous sinus thrombosis"". RESULTS: COVID-19 has a causal association with a plethora of neurological, neuropsychiatric and psychological effects. CVT has gained particular importance in this regard. The known hypercoagulable state in SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to be the main mechanism in COVID-19 related CVT. Other plausible mechanisms may include vascular endothelial dysfunction and altered flow dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no specific clinical characteristics, insidious or acute onset headache, seizures, stroke-like, or encephalopathy symptoms in a patient with, or who has suffered COVID-19, should prompt the attending physician to investigate for CVT. The treatment of COVID-19 associated CVT does not differ radically from the therapy of CVT without the infection, i.e. urgent initiation of parenteral unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin followed by conventional or mostly newer oral anticoagulants.","Ghosh, Ritwik; Roy, Dipayan; Mandal, Arpan; Pal, Shyamal Kanti; Chandra Swaika, Bikash; Naga, Dinabandhu; Pandit, Alak; Ray, Biman Kanti; Benito-León, Julián",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,366
248063,Screening for consequences of trauma–an update on the global collaboration on traumatic stress,2020,"Focus groups are often used for qualitative investigations. We adapted a published focus group method for evaluating impact of an organizational intervention for virtual delivery using video conferencing. The method entailed convening small groups of three to five participants for a 2-hour facilitated workshop. We delivered the virtual workshops, adding qualitative evaluation with researchers and participants, to assess the effectiveness of the protocol. We address the questions of how to structure the data collection procedures;whether virtual delivery permits cross participant interactions about a studied intervention;and how easy and comfortable the experience was for participants. Participants were university faculty members who were the focus of an institutional diversity program. The results indicated that the virtually delivered focus group workshop could be successfully implemented with strong fidelity to the original protocol to achieve the workshop goals. The workshops generated rich data about the impacts of the institutional program as well as other events and conditions in the working environment that were relevant to consider along with the observed program outcomes. A well-planned virtual focus group protocol is a valuable tool to engage intervention stakeholders for research and evaluation from a distance. Video conferencing is especially useful during the current COVID-19 pandemic, but also whenever geography separates researchers and evaluators from program stakeholders. Careful planning of privacy measures for a secure online environment and procedures for structured facilitation of group dialogue are critical for success, as in any focus group. This article addresses a gap in the literature on feasibility and methodology for using video conference technology to conduct qualitative data collection with groups.

The previous literature rarely solved this real-time issue, and there is a lack of public research proposing an effective way forward on it. However, the study examines the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on energy consumption and CO2 emission. The design of the study is quantitative, and the data is acquired from different online databases. The model of the study is inferred by using panel unit root test and ARDL test. The robustness of study findings was checked through panel quantile regression. The findings highlighted that the COVID-19 outbreak is negatively significant with energy consumption and CO2 emission. The study suggested revising the energy consumption patterns by developing and implementing the national action plan for energy consumption and environmental protection. The study also contributed in knowledge by suggesting the novel insight into CO2 emission and energy consumption patterns during COVID-19 pandemic and recommended to consider renewable energy transition methods as an opportunity for the society. For a more effective management of energy consumption and environmental pollution, country-specific measures are suggested to be taken, and the national government should support the concerned public departments, ministries and private organizations on it. To the best of our study, this is one of the pioneer studies studying this novel link and suggesting the way forward on recent topicality.","Iqbal, Sajid; Bilal, Ahmad Raza; Nurunnabi, Mohammad; Iqbal, Wasim; Alfakhri, Yazeed; Iqbal, Nadeem",,,366

249566,Evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on sleep habits and quality of life in children,2021,"BACKGROUND: We analyzed the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on neurologic emergencies, depending on the patients' triage score in a setting with relatively few COVID-19 cases and without lack of resources. METHODS: Consecutive patients of a tertiary care center with a dedicated neurologic emergency room (nER) were analyzed. The time period of the first lockdown in Germany (calendar weeks 12-17, 2020) was retrospectively compared to the corresponding period in 2019 regarding the number of patients presenting to the nER, the number of patients with specific triage scores (Heidelberg Neurological Triage Score), the number of patients with stroke, and the quality of stroke care. RESULTS: A total of 4330 patients were included. Fewer patients presented themselves in 2020 compared to 2019 (median [interquartile range] per week: 134 [118-143] vs. 187 [182-192]; p = 0.015). The median numbers of patients per week with triage 1 (emergent) and 4 (non-urgent) were comparable (51 [43-58] vs. 59 [54-62]; p = 0.132, and 10 [4-16] vs. 16 [7-18]; p = 0.310, respectively).The median number of patients per week declined in categories 2 and 3 in 2020 (41 [37-45] vs. 57 [52-61]; p = 0.004, and 28 [23-35] vs. 61 [52-63]; p = 0.002, respectively. No change was observed in the absolute number of strokes (138 in 2019 and 141 in 2020). Quality metrics of stroke revascularization therapies (symptom-to-door time, door-to-needle time or relative number of therapies) and stroke severity remained constant. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period in 2020, the number of patients with emergent symptoms remained constant, while fewer patients with urgent symptoms presented to the nER. This may imply behavioral changes in care-seeking behavior.","Millán, Margit; Nagel, Simon; Gumbinger, Christoph; Busetto, Loraine; Purrucker, Jan C; Hametner, Christian; Ringleb, Peter A; Mundiyanapurath, Sibu",Eur. j. neurol,,366

250431,"Patterns of Sex Work Client Solicitation Settings and Associations with HIV/STI Risk Among a Cohort of Female Sex Workers in Baltimore, Maryland",2021,"In March 2020 schools in Austria temporarily closed and switched to distance learning to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). The resulting situation posed great challenges to teachers, guardians and students (Huber and Helm 2020). Research has shown that perceived competence (Deci and Ryan 2000) affects selfregulated learning (SRL), intrinsic motivation and procrastination, however few studies have considered these variables in context of distance learning among adolescents. This study investigated differences in students who perceived themselves as high vs. low in competence with respect to these constructs. In an online questionnaire, 2652 Austrian secondary school students answered closed questions regarding SRL, intrinsic motivation and procrastination as well as open-ended questions about challenges, successes and need for support in distance. Structural equation modeling was applied for the quantitative analysis which was complemented by thematic analysis for the qualitative questions (Braun and Clarke 2006). Results showed that students who experienced themselves as highly competent use SRL strategies (goal setting and planning, time management, metacognitive strategies) more often and are more intrinsically motivated than students with lower perceived competence. They also procrastinate less. Furthermore, qualitative analysis revealed that although all students face similar challenges (e.g., independent learning, time and task management, learning on the computer, lack of contact with teachers and peers), students who perceived themselves as highly competent seemed to cope better, and have less need for support. Implications for distance learning and future research are discussed.

250721,The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review,2020,"SESSION TITLE: Medical Student/Resident Disorders of the Pleura Posters SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Rep Postr PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Barotrauma as a consequence of high alveolar pressures is well described in invasive mechanically ventilated (IMV) patients with pneumonia or pneumonitis Limited data exists on the incidence of barotrauma in patients with Coronavirus Disease 19 pneumonia (COVID-19) We present a case of barotrauma occurring in a non-intubated patient with COVID-19 receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old male with obesity presented with 2 days of cough and dyspnea Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing confirmed COVID-19 He initially required 5L of oxygen (O2) per minute by nasal cannula Due to worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF) on day 3, the patient was placed on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 90% FiO2 at a flow rate of 30 L/min By day 7, the patient had worsening HRF and increased work of breathing He was transitioned to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 100% FiO2 with continuous pressure set at 12 cm H2O On day 13, he developed tachycardia and desaturation Chest CT found gas dissecting along the axial interstitium resulting in pneumomediastinum, bilateral pneumothoraces, and extensive subcutaneous emphysema The lung parenchyma exhibited coarse ground glass opacities and early evidence of fibrotic changes Chest tubes were placed in each hemithorax with resolution of his pnemothoraces after 5 days His O2 requirements decreased, and he was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital on 10 L/min O2 by facemask on day 25 DISCUSSION: Barotrauma leading to pneumomediastinum and pneumothoraces are a well-documented complication of mechanical ventilation 1 In an effort to mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with mechanical ventilation, many clinicians have shifted toward using NPPV in HRF in COVID-19, however NPPV may not necessarily protect patients against a complication more commonly associated with IMV 2,3 Progressive and cumulative alveolar injury may predispose COVID-19 patients to barotrauma regardless of mode of ventilation 3 CONCLUSIONS: Due to the mortality associated with IMV in COVID-19, many clinicians have shifted toward using NPPV to manage HRF However, patients receiving NPPV may still be subject to complications such as barotrauma Additionally, given our evolving understanding of COVID-19 and the pulmonary parenchymal distortion seen in many patients, a deterioration in respiratory status should prompt clinicians to search for evidence of barotrauma, even in patients receiving NPPV Reference #1: Mentzer SJ, Tsuda A, Loring SH Pleural mechanics and the pathophysiology of air leaks J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2018;155(5):2182-2189 Reference #2: Xu XP, Zhang XC, Hu SL, et al Noninvasive Ventilation in Acute Hypoxemic Nonhypercapnic Respiratory Failure: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Crit Care Med 2017;45(7):e727-e733 Reference #3: Sun R, Liu H, Wang X Mediastinal Emphysema, Giant Bulla, and Pneumothorax Developed during the Course of COVID-19 Pneumonia Korean J Radiol 2020;21(5):541-544 DISCLOSURES: no disclosure on file for Nikhil Barot;No relevant relationships by Michael Kahn, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Nader Kamangar, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Jay Thetford, source=Web Response","Thetford, J.; Kahn, M.; Barot, N.; Kamangar, N.",Chest,,366
251529,Assessment of trends and clinical presentation in the emergency department of patients with renal colic during the COVID-19 pandemic era,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Based on its well-documented anti-inflammatory and restorative properties we propose trials with the natural hormone oxytocin for treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients. METHODS: We searched for, retrieved, and commented on specific literature regarding multiple functions of oxytocin with a special focus on its modulation of inflammatory, immune, and restorative functions. RESULTS: Available data gathered in animals and humans support the anti-inflammatory properties of oxytocin. The multiple anti-inflammatory effects of oxytocin have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in various animal models and also in humans in response to intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Furthermore, oxytocin has been documented to activate several types of protective and restorative mechanisms and to exert positive effects on the immune system. CONCLUSIONS: In addition, to being anti-inflammatory, it may be hypothesised, that oxytocin may be less suppressive on adaptive immune systems, as compared with glucocorticoids. Finally, by its restorative effects coupled with its anti-stress and healing properties, oxytocin may shorten the recovery period of the Covid-19 patients.","Buemann, Benjamin; Marazziti, Donatella; Uvnäs-Moberg, Kerstin",World J Biol Psychiatry,,366

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the question arose as to 25(OH)D status would be related to susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, since several studies pointed out a higher prevalence and severity of the disease in populations with low levels of 25(OH)D. Thus, we investigated the 25(OH)D levels in adults ""Detected"" positive for SARS CoV-2 by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) test, and in negative controls, ""not Detected"", using the Fleury Group's examination database, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of a total of 14.692 people with recent assessments of 25(OH)D and RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, 2.345 were positive and 11.585 were negative for the infection. The groups did not differ in the percentage of men and women, or in the age distribution. There were no differences in the distribution of 25(OH)D between the two groups (p = 0.08); mean 25(OH)D of 28.8 ± 21.4 ng/mL and 29.6 ± 18.1 ng/mL, respectively. In the specific population studied, clinical, environmental, socioeconomic and cultural factors should have greater relevance than 25(OH)D in determining the susceptibility to COVID-19.","Brandão, Cynthia M Álvares; Chiamolera, Maria Izabel; Biscolla, Rosa Paula Mello; Lima, José Viana; De Francischi Ferrer, Cláudia M; Prieto, Wesley Heleno; de Sá Tavares Russo, Pedro; de Sá, José; Dos Santos Lazari, Carolina; Granato, Celso Francisco H; Vieira, José Gilberto H",Arch. endocrinol. metab.

252627,Professional and psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on medical and radiation oncology residents: Results of a national survey,2020,"Many diseases as well as acute conditions can lead to fatigue, which can be either temporary or chronic in nature. Acute fatigue develops frequently after physical exercise or after alcohol hangover, whereas microbial infections such as influenza or COVID-19 and chronic diseases like Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis are often associated with chronic fatigue. Oxidative stress and a resulting disturbance of mitochondrial function are likely to be common denominators for many forms of fatigue, and antioxidant treatments have been shown to be effective in alleviating the symptoms of fatigue. In this study, we review the role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in fatigue and the antioxidant effects of the intake of molecular hydrogen. We propose that molecular hydrogen is well suited for the treatment of temporary and chronic forms of oxidative stress-associated fatigue.","Lucas, Kurt; Rosch, Moritz; Langguth, Peter",Arch Pharm (Weinheim),,366

Rapid development of WBE requires rapid and on-site analytical tools for monitoring of sewage biomarkers to provide immediate decision and intervention. Biosensors have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive and selective tools for the analysis of sewage biomarkers due to their fast response, ease-to-use, low cost and the potential for field-testing. This paper presents biosensors as effective tools for wastewater analysis of potential biomarkers and monitoring of public health via WBE. In particular, we discuss the use of sewage sensors for rapid detection of a range of targets, including rapid monitoring of community-wide illicit drug consumption and pathogens for early warning of infectious diseases outbreaks. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future use of the biosensor technology for WBE to enable rapid on-site monitoring of sewage, which will provide nearly real-time data for public health assessment and effective intervention.","Mao, Kang; Zhang, Hua; Pan, Yuwei; Yang, Zhugen",Water Res,,366

This study compiled a global database merging WHO daily case reports with other publicly available measures from January 21st to May 18th, 2020. We applied spatio-temporal models to identify the influence of biodiversity, temperature, and precipitation and fitted generalized linear mixed models to identify the effects of environmental variables. Additionally, we used count time series to characterize the association between COVID-19 spread and air quality factors. All analyses were adjusted by social demographic, country-income level, and government policy intervention confounders, among 160 countries, globally. Our results reveal a statistically meaningful association between COVID-19 infection and several factors of interest at country and city levels such as the national biodiversity index, air quality, and pollutants elements (PM10, PM2.5, and O3). Particularly, there is a significant relationship of loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality with COVID-19 infection spread and mortality. Our findings provide an empirical foundation for future studies on the relationship between air quality variables, a country's biodiversity, and COVID-19 transmission and mortality. The relationships measured in this study can be valuable when governments plan environmental and health policies, as alternative strategy to respond to new COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent future crises.","Fernández, Daniel; Giné-Vázquez, Iago; Liu, Ivy; Yucel, Recai; Nai Ruscone, Marta; Morena, Marianthi; García, Víctor Gerardo; Haro, Josep Maria; Pan, William; Tyrovolas, Stefanos",Environ Pollut,,366
256022,Concerns of women regarding pregnancy and childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had great effects on health systems worldwide, not only in relation to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases but also affecting patients with other pathologies. METHODS: ECIEN-2020 is an observational study conducted in a tertiary referral hospital in Navarra, Spain. It describes the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures adopted, in pediatric admissions for non-COVID-19 diseases. Admissions during March-June 2020 (first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain) are described and compared with the same quarter in 2019. A sub-analysis was performed delving into epidemiology. Patient characteristics (age, sex, past medical history), disease characteristics (symptoms, duration of symptoms, previous consultation in Primary Care Health Center), and admission characteristics (place and average stay) were analyzed. RESULTS: A 33% reduction in the number of pediatric hospital admissions was observed, decreasing from 529 hospitalizations in 2019 to 353 in 2020 (P < 0.001). This highlights a 48% reduction in patients admitted for pulmonary diseases. There were no significant changes in average hospital-stay, percentage of intensive care unit admissions, or in admissions for other reasons. Percentage of patients admitted among those seen in the emergency department rose from 5.1% in 2019 to 10.9% in 2020, whereas the total number of consultations in the emergency department decreased by 68%. CONCLUSION: The pandemic and the measures adopted due to SARS-CoV-2 have significantly decreased pediatric admissions for non-COVID-19 diseases, especially due to a reduction in the hospitalization for respiratory diseases.","Ramos-Lacuey, Beatriz; Herranz Aguirre, Mercedes; Calderón Gallego, Clara; Ilundain López de Munain, Andrea; Gembero Esarte, Eva; Moreno-Galarraga, Laura",World J Pediatr,,366

As in prior crises, state governments are expected to be primary sites of governing authority, especially when it comes to immediate public-health needs, while it is assumed that the federal government will supply critical counter-cyclical measures to stabilize the economy and make up for major revenue shortfalls in the states. Yet there are reasons to believe that these expectations will not be fulfilled, especially when it comes to the critical juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the federal government has the capacity to engage in counter-cyclical spending to stabilize the economy, existing policy instruments vary in the extent to which they leverage that capacity. This leverage, we argue, depends on how decentralized policy arrangements affect the implementation of both discretionary emergency policies as well as automatic stabilization programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Evidence on the US response to COVID-19 to date suggests the need for major revisions in the architecture of intergovernmental fiscal policy.","Rocco, Philip; Béland, Daniel; Waddan, Alex",Policy Soc.,,366

Una de las estrategias para el manejo es la reconversión de camas y servicios clínicos. OBJETIVOS: presentar experiencia de un equipo ginecológico en el manejo integral de pacientes no gineco-obstétricas con COVID 19, durante el mes de junio de 2020 en un hospital público de la Región Metropolitana. MÉTODOS: Estudio de corte transversal observacional, descriptivo. Se consideró el total de pacientes adultos hombres y mujeres sin patología gineco-obstétrica con COVID 19 ingresados al puerperio del Hospital Santiago Oriente, obteniéndose datos clínicos y demográficos a través del registro interno de la unidad y del sistema de información de red asistencial. RESULTADOS: Ingresaron 82 pacientes, 32 mujeres y 50 hombres, promedio de edad 64. El promedio de días de hospitalización fue 5, con diagnóstico de ingreso principal neumonía viral por COVID-19. Las comorbilidades frecuentes fueron hipertensión arterial sistémica y diabetes mellitus. La complicación más frecuente fue el tromboembolismo pulmonar agudo. Hubo una alta cobertura de entrega de información vía telefónica a familiares. De los 82 ingresos, 54 pacientes egresaron a su domicilio. El resto a otras unidades dentro de la institución, centros de menor complejidad o residencias sanitarias. Una paciente sexo femenino de 75 años fallece a causa de descompensación de patologias de base secundario a neumonia por Staphylococus aereus. En ella, se descarta la infección por COVID 19 dado tres exámenes por reacción de polimerasa en cadena negativos realizado antes y durante su hospitalización. CONCLUSIONES: Esta experiencia constituyó un desafío para todo el equipo de salud gineco-obstétrico, considerando que nos enfrentamos a otro tipo de pacientes y a una patología nueva.

256675,Knowledge of and attitudes toward COVID-19 among parents of child dental patients during the outbreak,2020,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a disorder that involves the activation of alveolar macrophages triggering the innate immune system. The parenchymal lung injury seen in ARDS is a result of many proinflammatory elevations including interleukin-6. There remains no effective standard of care of ARDS, and current treatments at this time currently do not target the immunological mechanisms or pathways involved. Treatments involving this pathway should be further investigated as targeted treatment. We discuss a case of a patient with multiple myeloma who was hospitalized with drug-induced ARDS who had a rapid response to an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody.","Petrillo, Alessandra; Biran, Noa; Sadikot, Sean",Case Rep Crit Care,,366
256677,Knowledge of and attitudes toward COVID-19 among parents of child dental patients during the outbreak,2020,"We simulate the evolution of eccentric binary systems in the frame of the grazing envelope evolution (GEE) channel for the formation of Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb), and find that extra mass removal by jets increases the parameter space for the formation of SNe IIb in this channel. To explore the role of eccentricity and the extra mass removal by jets in the GEE we use the stellar evolutionary code MESA~binary. The initial primary and secondary masses are M1i=15Mo and M2i=2.5Mo, respectively. We examine initial semi-major axes of 600-1000Ro, and eccentricities in the range of e=0-0.9. Both Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) and mass removal by jets, followed by a wind from the SN IIb progenitor, leave a hydrogen mass in the exploding star of M(H,f)=0.05Mo. This is compatible with a SN IIb progenitor. We find that in many cases, with and without the extra mass removal by jets, the system can enter a common envelope evolution (CEE) phase, and then gets out from it. Despite the large uncertainties, extra mass removal by jets substantially increases the likelihood of the system to get out from a CEE. This strengthens earlier conclusions for circular orbits. In some cases RLOF alone, without mass removal by jets, can form SN IIb progenitors. We estimate that the extra mass removal by jets in the GEE channel increases the number of progenitors relative to that by RLOF alone by about a factor of two.","Shishkin, Dmitry; Soker, Noam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14096v1.pdf,366

Recent publications on SARS-CoV-2 have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine in the treatment of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Whether chloroquine can treat SARS-CoV-2 alone and also work as a prophylactic is doubtful. An effective prophylactic medication to prevent viral entry has to contain, at least, either a protease inhibitor or a competitive virus ACE2-binding inhibitor. Using bromhexine at a dosage that selectively inhibits TMPRSS2 and, in so doing, inhibits TMPRSS2-specific viral entry is likely to be effective against SARS-CoV-2. We propose the use of bromhexine as a prophylactic and treatment. We encourage the scientific community to assess bromhexine clinically as a prophylactic and curative treatment. If proven to be effective, this would allow a rapid, accessible, and cost-effective application worldwide.","Depfenhart, Markus; de Villiers, Danielle; Lemperle, Gottfried; Meyer, Markus; Di Somma, Salvatore",Intern Emerg Med,,366
257925,Hand eczema-A growing dermatological concern during the COVID-19 pandemic and possible treatments,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The role of topical anti-infectives in acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis is controversial. Povidone-iodine is an anti-bacterial and anti-viral that is affordable and available over-the-counter and may demonstrate advantages over mupirocin as a sinus irrigation therapy. The objective was to compare povidone-iodine or mupirocin versus saline sinus irrigations for sinusitis exacerbations in post-surgery subjects as well as to assess tolerability of povidone-iodine sinus irrigations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective single-blinded (clinician only) randomized controlled trial. Subjects were post-surgery with acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis and gram-positive bacteria on culture. They received povidone-iodine, mupirocin, or saline sinus irrigations, twice daily for 30â¯days. Outcomes were post-treatment culture negativity (primary) and Sinonasal Outcome Test-20 and Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score change (secondary). RESULTS: Of the 62 subjects analyzed, post-treatment culture negativity rate was higher in the MUP (14/20, 70%) group compared to the PI (9/21, 43%) and SAL (9/19, 47%) groups, although this was not significant (pâ¯=â¯0.29). Povidone-iodine sinus irrigations at the 1% concentration were very well-tolerated, similar to saline irrigations. There were no significant differences in Sinonasal Outcome Test-20 score (povidone-iodine -0.3 [-0.6, 0.05] vs. mupirocin -0.3 [-0.7, 0.05] vs. saline -0.4 [-0.8, 0.05]; pâ¯=â¯0.86) or Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score (povidone-iodine -3.5 [-7, -0.5] vs. mupirocin -2 [-4, 2] vs. saline -3 [-5, 0]; pâ¯=â¯0.45) change. No serious adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have had prior sinus surgery with acute exacerbations of CRS and gram-positive bacteria on culture, mupirocin sinus irrigations achieved a better post-treatment culture ""control"" rate compared to saline and povidone-iodine. In addition, 1% povidone-iodine solution was well-tolerated as a sinus irrigation and may represent a feasible method for temporarily disinfecting the sinonasal cavity of bacteria and viruses such as COVID-19.","Lee, Victoria S; Pottinger, Paul S; Davis, Greg E",Am J Otolaryngol,,366

Mobile technology offers greater convenience, but little is known regarding the efficacy of self-paced, mobile-delivered (mHealth) mindfulness interventions in this population. This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of offering such an intervention for pregnant women with moderate-to-moderately-severe depression symptoms. Methods: We conducted a single-arm trial within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Participants were identified through KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program. Eligible participants included English-speaking pregnant women (<28 weeks of gestation) with moderate-to-moderately-severe depressive symptoms without a regular (<3 times/week) mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to follow a self-paced, 6-week mindfulness meditation program using a mobile app, Headspace&#8482;, 10-20 min/day. Outcome measures included feasibility, acceptability, and patient-reported outcomes (e.g., depression symptoms). Results: Of the 27 women enrolled, 20 (74%) completed the study.

Responses to the semi-structured interviews indicated that women appreciated the convenience of the intervention and the ability to engage without having to attend classes or arrange childcare. We observed significant improvements in pre-postintervention scores for depression symptoms, perceived stress, sleep disturbance, and mindfulness. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for women with moderate-to-moderately-severe antenatal depression symptoms. The preliminary data further suggest that an efficacy trial is warranted.","Kubo, Ai; Aghaee, Sara; Kurtovich, Elaine M; Nkemere, Linda; Quesenberry, Charles P; McGinnis, MegAnn K; Avalos, Lyndsay A",Mindfulness (N Y),,366

259488,Clinical Findings and Prognosis of Hospitalized Elderly Covid-19 Patients,2021,"This paper aims to propose a high-speed and accurate fully-automated method to detect COVID-19 from the patient's chest CT scan images. We introduce a new dataset that contains 48260 CT scan images from 282 normal persons and 15589 images from 95 patients with COVID-19 infections. At the first stage, this system runs our proposed image processing algorithm that analyzes the view of the lung to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them. This action helps to reduce the processing time and false detections. At the next stage, we introduce a novel architecture for improving the classification accuracy of convolutional networks on images containing small important objects. Our architecture applies a new feature pyramid network designed for classification problems to the ResNet50V2 model so the model becomes able to investigate different resolutions of the image and do not lose the data of small objects. As the infections of COVID-19 exist in various scales, especially many of them are tiny, using our method helps to increase the classification performance remarkably. After running these two phases, the system determines the condition of the patient using a selected threshold. We are the first to evaluate our system in two different ways on Xception, ResNet50V2, and our model. In the single image classification stage, our model achieved 98.49% accuracy on more than 7996 test images. At the patient condition identification phase, the system correctly identified almost 234 of 245 patients with high speed.","Rahimzadeh, Mohammad; Attar, Abolfazl; Sakhaei, Seyed Mohammad",Biomed Signal Process Control,,366

The Veneto Oncology Network (Rete Oncologica Veneta) licenced dedicated guidelines to ensure proper care minimising the risk of infection in patients with cancer. Rete Oncologica Veneta covID19 (ROVID) is a regional registry aimed at describing epidemiology and clinical course of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with cancer diagnosis and documented SARS-CoV-2 infection are eligible. Data on cancer diagnosis, comorbidities, anticancer treatments, as well as details on SARS-CoV-2 infection (hospitalisation, treatments, fate of the infection), have been recorded. Logistic regression analysis was applied to calculate the association between clinical/laboratory variables and death from any cause. RESULTS: One hundred seventy patients have been enrolled. The median age at time of the SARS-CoV infection was 70 years (25-92). The most common cancer type was breast cancer (n = 40). The majority of the patients had stage IV disease. Half of the patients had two or more comorbidities. The majority of the patients (78%) presented with COVID-19 symptoms. More than 77% of the patients were hospitalized and 6% were admitted to intensive care units. Overall, 104 patients have documented resolution of the infection. Fifty-seven patients (33%) have died. In 29 cases (17%), the cause of death was directly correlated to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Factors significantly correlated with the risk of death were the following: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS), age, presence of two or more comorbidities, presence of dyspnoea, COVID-19 phenotype &#8805; 3, hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and thrombocytopenia.

To trace the evolution route and probe the transmission dynamics of this virus, we performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform as of 5 March 2020. Among them, four genetic clusters, defined as super-spreaders (SSs), could be identified and were found to be responsible for the major outbreaks that subsequently occurred in various countries. SS1 was widely disseminated in Asia and the US, and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states of Washington and California as well as South Korea, whereas SS4 contributed to the pandemic in Europe. Using the signature mutations of each SS as markers, we further analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after 29 February 2020 and found that 90% of these genomes belonged to SSs, with SS4 being the most dominant. The relative degree of contribution of each SS to the pandemic in different continents was also depicted. Identification of these super-spreaders greatly facilitates development of new strategies to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Yang, Xuemei; Dong, Ning; Chan, Edward Wai-Chi; Chen, Sheng",Emerg Microbes Infect,,366

Among 1,236 patients with COVID-19, 45 (3.6%) were evaluated with contrast-enhanced CT examination. VTE events occurred in 10 patients (22.2%), and the incidence of VTE in mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 was 0%, 11.8%, and 40.0%, respectively. COVID-19 patients with VTE showed a higher body weight (81.6 vs. 64.0 kg, P=0.005) and body mass index (26.9 vs. 23.2 kg/m2, P=0.04), and a higher proportion had a severe status for COVID-19 compared with those without. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients alive at discharge between patients with and without VTE (80.0% vs. 88.6%, P=0.48). Among 8 pulmonary embolism (PE) patients, all were low-risk PE. CONCLUSIONS: Among a relatively small number of patients undergoing contrast-enhanced CT examination in Japanese real-world clinical practice, there were no VTE patients among those with mild COVID-19, but the incidence of VTE seemed to be relatively high among severe COVID-19 patients, although all PE events were low-risk without significant effect on mortality risk.","Yamashita, Yugo; Maruyama, Yuuki; Satokawa, Hirono; Nishimoto, Yuji; Tsujino, Ichizo; Sakashita, Hideki; Nakata, Hiroko; Okuno, Yoshinori; Ogihara, Yoshito; Yachi, Sen; Toya, Naoki; Shingaki, Masami; Ikeda, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Naoto; Aikawa, Shizu; Ikeda, Nobutaka; Hayashi, Hiroya; Ishiguro, Shingo; Iwata, Eriko; Umetsu, Michihisa; Kondo, Akane; Iwai, Takehisa; Kobayashi, Takao; Mo, Makoto; Yamada, Norikazu",Cir. j,,366

A prospective longitudinal study",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made the number of patients gradually increase. Currently, the vaccine of SARS-CoV-2 is being researched and most of the people have to trust their immune system and being healthy as long as they could in the mean times. High antioxidant food is recommended for the people whom currently are reducing their activity from home with good exercise. Therefore, this research was focused on the Indonesian anti-degenerative herbs water extract for an immunomodulatory activity to maintain healthy productivity of lymphocyte cells and to regulate neutrophil cells production, also with antioxidant activity to maintain optimal function of the immune system. METHODS: The antioxidant activity test was conducted with the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method and the immunomodulator ability test was conducted with DDY-strain female mice (Mus musculus) for 28 days in five different groups. RESULTS: The IC50 for gallic acid and mixed herbs extract solutions was 1.89 and 146.91 µg/mL, respectively. The immunomodulatory activity was determined from the result of leukocytes differentiation which could be seen from the lymphocytes and neutrophil t-test results that were significant at p<0.1. CONCLUSIONS: From the results, it can be concluded that anti-degenerative extract has moderate antioxidant activity and an immunomodulator ability to regulate the productivity of lymphocyte and neutrophil cells.","Tristantini, Dewi; Wahidin, Wahidin; Feliana, Ferlita; Widigarka, Marosta; Santoso, Leon Lukhas",J. complement. integr. med,,366
264061,Is anything in life simple? Why we should think about complexity,2021,"Blockchain technology has a great potential for improving efficiency, security and privacy of Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing systems. However, existing solutions relying on a centralized database are susceptible to traditional security problems such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and a single point of failure similar to traditional database systems. In addition, past solutions exposed users to privacy linking attacks and did not tackle performance and scalability challenges. In this paper, we propose a permissioned Blockchain based healthcare data sharing system that integrates Blockchain technology, decentralized file system and threshold signature to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed system is based on Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus algorithm and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). We implemented the proposed system on an enterprise Ethereum Blockchain known as Hyperledger Besu. We evaluated and compared the performance of the proposed system based on various performance metrics such as transaction latency, throughput and failure rate. Experiments were conducted on a variable network size and number of transactions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than existing Blockchain based systems. Moreover, the decentralized file system provides better security than existing traditional centralized database systems while providing the same level of performance.","Shuaib, Khaled Abdella Juhar Sallabi Farag Serhani Mohamed Adel",Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences,,366

264721,What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency medicine residency training: an observational study,2020,"COVID-19 led to a recent high-profile proposal to reintroduce oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the United States (U.S.), initially in clinical trials, but potentially for widespread and repeated use. We explore logistical challenges related to U.S. OPV administration in 2020, review the literature related to nonspecific effects of OPV to induce innate immunity, and model the health and economic implications of the proposal. The costs of reintroducing a single OPV dose to 331 million Americans would exceed $4.4 billion. Giving a dose of bivalent OPV to the entire U.S. population would lead to an expected 40 identifiable cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio, with young Americans at the highest risk. Reintroducing any OPV use in the U.S. poses a risk of restarting transmission of OPV-related viruses and could lead to new infections in immunocompromised individuals with B-cell related primary immunodeficiencies that could lead to later cases of paralysis. Due to the lack of a currently licensed OPV in the U.S., the decision to administer OPV to Americans for nonspecific immunological effects would require purchasing limited global OPV supplies that could impact polio eradication efforts. Health economic modeling suggests no role for reintroducing OPV into the U.S. with respect to responding to COVID-19. Countries that currently use OPV experience fundamentally different risks, costs, and benefits than the U.S. Successful global polio eradication will depend on sufficient OPV supplies, achieving and maintaining high OPV coverage in OPV-using countries, and effective global OPV cessation and containment in all countries, including the U.S.","Thompson, Kimberly M; Kalkowska, Dominika A; Badizadegan, Kamran",Risk anal,,366

We sought to calculate the prevalence of spitting on police officers in use of force incidents, as well as the demographic and situational factors associated with spitting. METHODS: Data on spitting were compiled from more than 10,000 use of force incidents occurring at 81 agencies in eight different states in the US. RESULTS: Spitting occurred in 3.6% of cases. Female and younger subjects and those using drugs and/or alcohol are more likely to spit on officers. Spitting is more likely to occur in incidents of longer duration, when officers use less force relative to subject resistance, when subjects are assaultive or engage in self-harm, and when subjects are hobbled. CONCLUSIONS: Spitting on officers is common and may now constitute a significant work hazard.

Materials and methods: A total of 32 patients (8 males and 24 females; 52.9±7years old) with COVID-19 from 27 January and 26 February 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical and radiological characteristics were analyzed. Results: The median period (25%, 75%) between initial symptoms and the first chest CT, the initial negative RT-PCR, the second CT and the positive RT-PCR were 7(4.25,11.75), 7(5,10.75), 15(11,23) and 14(10,22) days, respectively. Ground glass opacities was the most frequent CT findings at both the first and second CTs. Consolidation was more frequently observed on lower lobes, and more frequently detected during the second CT (64.0%) with positive RT-PCR than the first CT with initial negative RT-PCR (53.1%). The median of total lung severity score and the number of lobes affected had significant difference between twice chest CT (P=0.007 and P=0.011, respectively). Conclusion: In the first week of disease course, CT was sensitive to the COVID-19 with initial negative RT-PCR.

266223,Innovative educational approaches to house calls in the time of COVID-19,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised unprecedented concerns in the hematopoietic stem cell transplant community. The diagnosis of COVID-19 in these transplant recipients may require extensive laboratory testing and high clinical suspicion, as atypical clinical manifestations or other respiratory viral infections are common in this patient population. The underlying malignancies, immunosuppressed state, frequently observed coinfections, and advanced age in some patients may also predispose them to worse clinical outcomes. Similar outcomes have been previously described with other human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Many hematopoietic stem cell transplant organizations have issued elaborative guidelines that aim to prevent transmission and hence adverse patient outcomes. All potential donors are thoroughly screened, and donated products are cryopreserved in advance. Potential hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are also screened, and most nonurgent transplant cases with low risk of progression and/or death are deferred. Current hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients should adhere to precaution and isolation measures, while their transplant units should also follow strict safety protocols, similar to other infectious outbreaks. The prolonged susceptibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to respiratory viral infections might necessitate extending these measures even after the peak of the outbreak until a gradually return to normality is possible.","Esagian, Stepan M; Giannis, Dimitrios; Ziogas, Ioannis A; Gianni, Panagiota; Sala, Elisa; Döhner, Hartmut",Exp. clin. transplant,,366

In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.","Nanda, Piyush; Ghosh, Amit",PLoS Comput Biol,,366

In this study, we analyse the effect of anthropogenic activity on the Earth vibrations, utilizing ambient noise recorded at twelve broadband seismographs installed in different environmental and geological conditions in Gujarat. We find that the lockdowns caused 1-19 dB decrease in seismic noise levels. The impact of restricted anthropogenic activities is predominantly visible during the daytime in urban areas, in the vicinity of industries and/or highways. A 27-79% reduction in seismic noise ground displacement (drms) is observed in daytime during the lockdown, in populated areas. However, data from station MOR reveals a drastic decrease in drms amplitude both during the day (79%) and night times (87%) since factories in this area operate round the clock. The noise at stations located in remote areas and that due to microseisms, shows negligible variation.","Roy, Ketan Singha; Sharma, Jyoti; Kumar, Santosh; Kumar, M Ravi",Sci Rep,,366
273236,"PAIN MANAGEMENT AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC A Great Run: Remembering Dr. Joel Stark (November 18, 1930–May 4, 2020)",2020,"The paper presents the case study of BERLIN_LOKAL_ZEIT, a collaborative archive and exhibition project aiming to document and reflect individual experiences of the COVID-19 lockdowns in Berlin, Germany. What began as an observational effort in spring 2020became a year-long archive, exhibition, and broadcasting platform that generated various hyper-local interfaces. The paper articulates an improvisational approach to media architecture in the form of self-reflection by the project initiators. Necessitated by the limitations imposed by the lockdowns on cultural production and public discourse, the paper presents an alternative conceptual approach to media architecture that is not based on a fully-specified technological infrastructure for discourse and interaction but instead on improvisational practices that manifest themselves in different technical interfaces. This improvisational approach is not merely a mode of production, but raises questions of about the discourse of media architecture and its underlying assumptions of methodological rigor. In traditional HCI, systems and artifacts are often presented as stable and fully specified, while their users are considered interchangeable. In contrast, we consider urban media interfaces as improvisation-driven infrastructures (or improstructures) in which the actors and their relationships are stable, while the technologies they create are provisional and in flux. As a consequence, the defining property of media architecture is no longer the structural integration of media into architecture but the embodiment of mediated communication in objects and performances at concrete places. In an environment where many physical spaces are longer accessible and human contact among strangers diminished, the project explores the restorative function and capacities of media architecture for shared reflection and discourse in physical public space.","Offenhuber, Dietmar; Auinger, Sam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10833v1.pdf,366

However, the role of physical activity in this context is still debated. By taking advantage of a previous survey, conducted online from 22 April to 7 May 2020, we performed a post-hoc analysis with the aim to assess the associations between disability, physical exercise, and mental health in multiple sclerosis. We retrieved the following data: (i) sociodemographic information, (ii) changes in lifestyle (including exercise), (iii) physical disability, as measured with the Patient-Determined Disease Steps scale, and (iv) anxiety feelings and depressive symptoms assessed via the items included in the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders measurement system. Examination of the interaction plot showed that the effect of disability on depression, but not on anxious symptoms, was significant for all levels of physical exercise (low: b = 1.22, 95% C.I. 0.85, 1.58, p < 0.001; moderate: b = 0.95, 95% C.I. 0.66, 1.24, p < 0.001; and high: b = 0.68, 95% C.I. 0.24, 1.13, p = 0.003). Based on these data, we can conclude that disability significantly impacted depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, with physical activity playing a moderating role. Our results suggest that favoring exercise in multiple sclerosis (MS) would ameliorate psychological wellbeing regardless of the level of physical disability.","Carotenuto, Antonio; Scandurra, Cristiano; Costabile, Teresa; Lavorgna, Luigi; Borriello, Giovanna; Moiola, Lucia; Inglese, Matilde; Trojsi, Francesca; Petruzzo, Martina; Ianniello, Antonio; Nozzolillo, Agostino; Cellerino, Maria; Boffa, Giacomo; Rosa, Laura; Chiodi, Alessandro; Servillo, Giuseppe; Moccia, Marcello; Bonavita, Simona; Filippi, Massimo; Petracca, Maria; Brescia Morra, Vincenzo; Lanzillo, Roberta",,,366

The identification of novel drugs and efficient therapies against these infectious viruses is need of the hour. The eruption of COVID-19 is caused by a novel acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2 which has taken the whole world by storm as it has transformed into a global pandemic. This lethal syndrome is a global health threat to general public which has already affected millions of people. Despite the development of some potential vaccines and repurposed drugs by some Pharma companies, this health emergency needs more attention due to the less efficacy of these vaccines coupled with the emergence of novel and resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Due to enormous structural diversity and biological applications, natural products are considered as a wonderful source of drugs for such diseases. Natural product based drugs constitute a substantial proportion of the pharmaceutical market particularly in the therapeutic areas of infectious diseases and oncology. The naturally occurring bioactive antiviral phytochemicals including alkaloids, flavonoids and peptides have been subjected to virtual screening against COVID-19. Since there is no specific medicine available for the treatment of Covid-19, designing new drugs using in silico methods plays an all important role to find that magic bullet which can target this lethal virus. The in silico method is not only quick but economical also when compared to the other conventional methods which are hit and trial methods. Based on this in silico approach, various natural products have been recently identified which might have a potential to inhibit COVID-19 outbreak. These natural products have been shown by these docking studies to interact with the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. This spike protein has been shown to bind to a transmembrane protein called Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), this protein acts as a receptor for the viral spike protein. This comprehensive review article anticipates providing a summary of the authentic and peer reviewed published literature about the potential of natural metabolites that can be developed into possible lead compounds against this new threat of Covid-19. Main focus of the article will be to highlight natural sources of potential anti-coronavirus molecules, mechanism of action, docking studies and the target proteins as well as their toxicity profiles. This review article intends to provide a starting point for the research endeavors that are needed for the design and development of drugs based on pure natural products, their synthetic or semi-synthetic derivatives and standardized plant extracts. This review article will be highly helpful for scientists who are working or intend to work on antiviral drugs from natural sources.","Khursheed, Aadil; Jain, Vikrant; Rasool, Ajaz; Rather, Manzoor A; Malik, Nisar Ahmad; Shalla, Aabid Hussain",Microb Pathog,,366

In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between therapeutic effectiveness of remdesivir and complications of diabetes mellitus by observing the recovery period among diabetic and nondiabetic patients associated with COVID-19 infection. A total of 850 COVID-19 patients were recruited for this study, out of which 48% were diabetic and 52% were nondiabetics. The results of this study indicated that nondiabetic individuals administered with remdesivir recovered from COVID-19 within 10 days showing a 95% confidence interval (p < 0.01), while the diabetic individuals recovered in 15 days. Nondiabetic patients administered with remdesivir exhibited higher chances of clinical improvement at 15th day than those who were associated with diabetes. Remdesivir administration improved the levels of various biochemical parameters, such as C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, d-Dimer, and ferritin both in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. However, a significant improvement (p < 0.01) was seen in the level of biochemical parameters among nondiabetic patients as compared to that of diabetic patients administered with remdesivir treatment. In the end, it was concluded that remdesivir could be considered as a possible therapeutic agent in the treatment of COVID-19 both in diabetic and nondiabetic situations. However, diabetic patients showed a delayed recovery as compared with that of nondiabetic patients, in which the recovery rate was high.","Qureshi, Qiadat Hasnain; Ashraf, Taimoor; Rehman, Kanwal; Khosa, Muhammad Kaleem; Akash, Muhammad Sajid Hamid",J. med. virol,,366

The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the infected population based on a reaction mechanism. The advantage of modeling the pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation time, accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer, and finally, crystallization of the dissolved salt. The model output favourably compares with the experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model. The droplet evaporation/desiccation time is, indeed, dependent on ambient temperature and is also a strong function of relative humidity. The multi-scale model thus developed and the firm theoretical underpinning that connects the two scales-macro-scale pandemic dynamics and micro-scale droplet physics-thus could emerge as a powerful tool in elucidating the role of environmental factors on infection spread through respiratory droplets.","Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi; Kabi, Prasenjit; Unni, Vishnu R.; Saha, Abhishek",Phys.

The emergence of information and communication technologies and cheaper internet usage charges have led to the penetration of computing devices and smartphones, leading to learning through online portals. In the prevailing covid-19 situation, countries experienced lockdown, work from home, and online learning has emerged in a big way. From traditional classroom teachers to an online learning environment, the role of academicians has changed drastically. Hence, Faculty Development Programs became an important component in this lockdown period for skill and knowledge up-gradation. This study used a quantitative methodology in which a theoretical model UTAUT was tested using hypotheses to assess the interaction between the study variables, performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), facilitating conditions (FC) with behavioral intentions (BI). Data from academicians were collected through a self-Administered questionnaire created using Google forms. Multiple linear regression was used for data analysis using SPSS software 20. It was found that performance expectancy and effort expectancy were significant influencers in academicians' adoption of online FDPs. However, facilitating conditions (FC) was found not a significant predictor for online FDPs.

Also, primary attention to RES has been given at the EU level with the new Green Deal and the new objectives of the Next Generation EU after the Covid pandemic, and at the level of national Governments worldwide. So far, there has not been an analysis of the RES convergence process across countries worldwide, given that the issue of climate change is a global externality. Previous analyses have focused on specific regions, such as EU, OECD, provinces of China. This paper fills this gap, providing new evidence on the convergence process of RES for the 176 countries that account for more than 98% of the world population, from 1990 to 2018. A common panel data set has been used to take into account countries' specific effects. Several socio-economics and political variables are introduced to test conditional convergence such as openness to trade, developments in financial markets, income distribution, level of education. The results of this new contribution reveal that there is evidence of sigma-absolute and conditional beta-convergence process for several groups of countries. Moreover, the conditional convergence analysis shows that spatial spillover effects exert rich and complex impact on convergence speed. Finally, we provide policy recommendations, highlighting that the decarbonization target in 2050 needs additional mobilization of public and private resources to pursue a common, convergence path worldwide.","Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Polinori, Paolo",J Environ Manage,,366

However, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 detection on surfaces in healthcare settings and the public is currently not known. A systematic literature review was performed. On surfaces around COVID-19 cases in healthcare settings (42 studies), the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection rates mostly were between 0% and 27% (Ct values mostly &gt;30). Detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 was only successful in one of seven studies in 9.2% of 76 samples. Most of the positive samples were obtained next to a patient with frequent sputum spitting during sampling. Eight studies were found with data from public surfaces and RNA detection rates between 0% and 22.1% (Ct values mostly &gt;30). Detection of infectious virus was not attempted. Similar results were found in samples from surfaces around confirmed COVID-19 cases in non-healthcare settings (7 studies) and from personal protective equipment (10 studies). Therefore, it seems plausible to assume that inanimate surfaces are not a relevant source for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

While the TNT and PETN systems were newly developed here, all the three systems also tolerated harsher matrices than buffered aqueous model solutions. Besides a single-track strip, the outstanding modularity of the hybrid biosensor materials, in combination with strip patterning technologies, allowed us to obtain a multichannel strip in a straightforward manner, offering comparable analytical performance while allowing to be tailored even more to the user's need.","Climent, Estela; Biyikal, Mustafa; Gröninger, Delia; Weller, Michael G; Martínez-Máñez, Ramón; Rurack, Knut",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,366
282997,Rapid Response Infrastructures for Pandemic Preparedness in Tertiary Care Hospitals: Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Outbreak in Germany,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the critical health problem of the globe, including Ethiopia. Visitors of healthcare facilities are the high-risk groups due to the presence of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value <0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p-value <0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18-6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18-17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46-6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71-14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96-7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06-5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15-15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41-8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential.","Belete, Zebader Walle; Berihun, Gete; Keleb, Awoke; Ademas, Ayechew; Berhanu, Leykun; Abebe, Masresha; Gizeyatu, Adinew; Hassen, Seada; Teshome, Daniel; Lingerew, Mistir; Feleke, Alelgne; Natnael, Tarikuwa; Adane, Metadel",PLoS One,,366
283382,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with psoriasis,2021,"Due to the significant changes of economic growth rate, energy structure, and energy efficiency in China, whether energy policies should be adjusted is worthy of attention. This paper employs ARDL-ECM and Toda-Yamamoto causality to investigate the relationship between renewable energy, non-renewable energy, carbon emissions, economic growth, gross fixed capital formation, and urban population spanning the period 1960-2019 in China. The examined results of ARDL-ECM indicate that renewable energy both have positive impact on GDP in the short term and long term but non-renewable energy only have positive impact on GDP in the short term. Additionally, based on Toda-Yamamoto causality, this paper finds a unidirectional Granger causality running from economic growth to energy consumption and from energy consumption to carbon emissions. And there is a unidirectional Granger causality running from GDP to non-renewable energy consumption. It is worth noting that renewable energy consumption and economic growth have positive bidirectional influence on each other. The study findings suggest that stricter energy conservation and pollution emission reduction policy should be implemented and renewable energy should be applied on a larger scale in order to achieve the goal of sustainable economic development.","Zhang, Xinyue; Zhang, Xingping",,,366

This report summarizes progress toward global polio eradication during January 1, 2018-March 31, 2020 and updates previous reports (1,2). In 2019, Afghanistan and Pakistan reported the highest number of WPV1 cases (176) since 2014. During January 1-March 31, 2020 (as of June 19), 54 WPV1 cases were reported, an approximate fourfold increase from 12 cases during the corresponding period in 2019. Paralytic poliomyelitis can also be caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), which emerges when attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) virus reverts to neurovirulence following prolonged circulation in underimmunized populations (3). Since the global withdrawal of type 2-containing OPV (OPV2) in April 2016, cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks have increased in number and geographic extent (4). During January 2018-March 2020, 21 countries reported 547 cVDPV2 cases. Complicating increased poliovirus transmission during 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and mitigation efforts have resulted in suspension of immunization activities and disruptions to poliovirus surveillance. When the COVID-19 emergency subsides, enhanced support will be needed to resume polio eradication field activities.","Chard, Anna N; Datta, S Deblina; Tallis, Graham; Burns, Cara C; Wassilak, Steven G F; Vertefeuille, John F; Zaffran, Michel",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,366
284864,Chilblains is a common cutaneous finding during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective nationwide study from France,2020,"BACKGROUND: Various cutaneous manifestations have been observed in patients with COVID-19 infection. However, overall similarities in the clinical presentation of these dermatological manifestations have not yet been summarized. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to provide an overview of various cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 through three case reports and a literature review. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, OVID, and Google search engines for original and review articles. Studies written in the English language that mentioned cutaneous symptoms and COVID-19 were included. RESULTS: Eighteen articles and three additional cases reported in this paper were included in this review. Of these studies, 6 are case series and 12 are case report studies. The most common cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 was found to be maculopapular exanthem (morbilliform), presenting in 36.1% (26/72) patients. The other cutaneous manifestations included: a papulovesicular rash (34.7%, 25/72), urticaria (9.7%, 7/72), painful acral red purple papules (15.3%, 11/72) of patients, livedo reticularis lesions (2.8%, 2/72) and petechiae (1.4%, 1/72). Majority of lesions were localized on the trunk (66.7%, 50/72), however, 19.4% (14/72) of patients experienced cutaneous manifestations in the hands and feet. Skin lesion development occurred before the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis in 12.5% (9/72) of the patients, and lesions spontaneously healed in all patients within 10 days. Majority of the studies reported no correlation between COVID-19 severity and skin lesions. CONCLUSION: Infection with COVID-19 may result in dermatological manifestations with various clinical presentations, which may aid in the timely diagnosis of this infection.","Sachdeva, Muskaan; Gianotti, Raffaele; Shah, Monica; Bradanini, Lucia; Tosi, Diego; Veraldi, Stefano; Ziv, Michael; Leshem, Eyal; Dodiuk-Gad, Roni P",J Dermatol Sci,,366

Resulting 3D models are based on few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge about the biological entity represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new technique is based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans, we learn statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the outer membrane shape, spatial properties and distribution characteristics of the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in 3D model construction. Once all imaging evidence is incorporated in the model, additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining rules that spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual interactions among macromolecules, their distances and orientations to other structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive visualization and modeling feedback loop. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle ultrastructure. Its first complete atomistic model, which we present here, can steer biological research to new promising directions in fighting spread of the virus.","Nguyen, Ngan; Strnad, Ondrej; Klein, Tobias; Luo, Deng; Alharbi, Ruwayda; Wonka, Peter; Maritan, Martina; Mindek, Peter; Autin, Ludovic; Goodsell, David S.; Viola, Ivan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01804v1.pdf,366

287820,The Role of Self-Efficacy in Perceived Sensitivity and Severity to COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors,2021,"Healthcare providers around the world have implemented remote routine consultations to minimise disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual clinics are particularly suitable for patients with genetic eye diseases as they rely on detailed histories with genetic counselling. During April-June 2019, the opinion of carers of children with inherited eye disorders attending the ocular genetics service at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (MEH) were canvassed. Sixty-five percent of families (n = 35/54) preferred to have investigations carried out locally rather than travel to MEH, with 64% opting for a virtual consultation to interpret the results. The most popular mode of remote contact was via telephone (14/31), with video call being least preferred (8/31). Hence, 54 families who had received a telephone consultation mid-pandemic (November 2020-January 2021) were contacted to re-evaluate the acceptability of telegenetics using the Clinical Genetics Satisfaction Indicator and Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire. Overall, 50 carers participated (response rate 93%); 58% of participants found teleconsultations acceptable and 54% agreed they increased their access to care, but 67.5% preferred to be seen in person. Patient satisfaction was high with 90% strongly agreeing/agreeing they shared and received all necessary information. Ocular genetics is well-suited for remote service delivery, ideally alternated with face-to-face consultations.","Bell, Suzannah; Karamchandani, Urvi; Malcolmson, Kirsten; Moosajee, Mariya",,,366

Two survey studies (total N = 500) tested predictors of donation intentions of British participants to help those suffering from the crisis in Britain (ingroup donations) and overseas (outgroup donations). Perceptions of international, global common fate in our success in managing and overcoming the crisis was positively associated with prosocial intentions towards both national ingroup and outgroup targets. In contrast, a desire to ?close ranks? within the national ingroup in the face of the pandemic threat was associated with more prosocial intentions towards national ingroup targets only, but it was associated with fewer prosocial intentions towards outgroup targets. This suggests that a focus on global solidarity (in the form of global common fate and identification with all humans) has positive effects on helping both within and across group boundaries, whereas a focus on national solidarity (in the form of ?closing ranks? in the face of the pandemic threat) has positive effects on helping within the national group but negative effects on prosocial tendencies towards outgroup members. The effect of perceived global common fate on both ingroup and outgroup helping was mediated by identification with all of humanity. Findings are discussed in terms of practical implications for managing the COVID-19 crisis.

The viral spike receptor possesses two surface areas of high mutagenic plasticity: the supersite in its N-terminal domain (NTD) that is recognised by all anti-NTD antibodies and its receptor binding domain (RBD) where 17 residues make contact with the human Ace2 protein (angiotensin I converting enzyme 2) and many neutralising antibodies bind. While NTD mutations appear at first glance very diverse, they converge on the structure of the supersite. The mutations within the RBD, on the other hand, hone in on only a small number of key sites (K417, L452, E484, N501) that are allosteric control points enabling spike to escape neutralising antibodies while maintaining or even gaining Ace2-binding activity. The D614G mutation is the hallmark of all variants, as it promotes viral spread by increasing the number of open spike protomers in the homo-trimeric receptor complex.

During the pandemic innovative and flexible approaches were implemented to meet increasing demand for health workers and new skills and responsibilities were adopted over a short period of time. We have seen the rapid adaptation and use of new technologies to deliver care. The pandemic has underlined the importance of valuing, protecting and caring for our health workforce and the need to invest appropriately and adequately in the health workforce to have sufficient, capable and well-motivated health workers. Some of the main challenges that lie ahead of us include the imperative for better investment, to need to improve recruitment and retraining whilst better retaining health workers, a focus on domestic sustainability, redeploying and developing new skills and competences among health workers, enabling more effective multi-professional collaboration and team work, improving the quality of education and training, increasing the public health focus and promoting ethical and sustainable international recruitment of health workers. The WHO European Region through its European Programme of Work 2020-2025 is fully committed to support countries in their efforts to continue to respond to COVID-19 and whilst addressing upcoming health workforce challenges.","Zapata, Tomas; Buchan, James; Azzopardi-Muscat, Natasha",Int J Health Plann Manage,,366

METHOD: cross-sectional study conducted in the five Brazilian regions, among adult individuals, via an electronic form disseminated in social media, addressing general information and the use of masks. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the use and reuse of masks. RESULTS: 3,981 (100%) individuals participated in the study. In total, 95.5% (CI 95%: 94.8-96.1) reported using masks. Fabric masks were more frequently reported (72.7%; CI 95%: 71.3-74.1), followed by surgical masks (27.8%; CI 95%: 26.5-29.2). The percentage of reuse was 71.1% (CI 95%: 69.7-72.5). Most (55.8%; CI 95%: 51.7-60.0) of those exclusively wearing surgical masks reported its reuse. Being a woman and having had contact with individuals presenting respiratory symptoms increased the likelihood of wearing masks (p&#8804;0.001). Additionally, being a woman decreased the likelihood of reusing surgical masks (p&#8804;0.001). CONCLUSION: virtually all the participants reported the use of masks, most frequently fabric masks. The findings draw attention to a risky practice, that of reusing surgical and paper masks. Therefore, guidelines, public policies, and educational strategies are needed to promote the correct use of masks to control and prevent COVID-19.","Pereira-Ávila, Fernanda Maria Vieira; Lam, Simon Ching; Góes, Fernanda Garcia Bezerra; Gir, Elucir; Pereira-Caldeira, Natalia Maria Vieira; Teles, Sheila Araújo; Caetano, Karla Antonieta Amorim; Goulart, Maithê de Carvalho E Lemos; Bazilio, Thamara Rodrigues; Silva, Ana Cristina de Oliveira E",Rev Lat Am Enfermagem,,366

We report a case of femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient after nonsevere infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A common femoral artery thrombosis extended in the first third of superficial and profunda femoral arteries associated with tibial posterior and popliteal artery thrombosis was diagnosed in a 24-year-old man complaining of right lower limb pain for one month. The evolution was good after anticoagulation and antiaggregant treatments and thrombectomy. Etiologic assessment was negative except for nonsevere COVID-19. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 accesses host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein, abundant in the lungs, which is also expressed by endothelial cells and is associated with important inflammatory syndrome and coagulopathy, leading to vascular lesions. Thrombosis prevalence is not fully established and seems to be higher in case of major inflammation and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Arterial thromboembolisms are described in many vascular territories, each time in elderly patients, or in case of severe infection. We described a femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient with negative etiological assessment except nonsevere COVID-19. Treatment consists in anticoagulation and antiaggregant drugs and thrombectomy. Preventing venous thromboembolism treatment is recommended in case of severe infection or in the ICU, but there is no clear recommendation for arterial thromboembolism prevention. This case should lead us to be very careful of the arterial event risk even if the infection is nonsevere and the patient is young.","Veyre, Florian; Poulain-Veyre, Corinne; Esparcieux, Aurélie; Monsarrat, Nicolas; Aouifi, Abdellah; Lapeze, Joel; Chatelard, Philippe",Ann. vasc. surg,,366

METHODS: We used whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from ten European regions belonging to eight countries to perform phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. We developed dedicated bioinformatics pipelines to identify regional MTCs and to assess demographic factors potentially associated with their formation. RESULTS: The total number and the scale of MTCs varied from small household clusters identified in all regions, to a super-spreading event found in Uusimaa-FI. Specific age groups were more likely to belong to MTCs in different regions. The clustered sequences referring to the age groups 50-100 years old (y.o.) were increased in all regions two weeks after the establishment of the lockdown, while those referring to the age group 0-19 y.o. decreased only in those regions where schools' closure was combined with a lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The spatiotemporal profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 MTCs can be a useful tool to monitor the effectiveness of the interventions and to reveal cryptic transmissions that have not been identified through contact tracing.","Bousali, Maria; Dimadi, Aristea; Kostaki, Evangelia-Georgia; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K; Sgouras, Dionyssios N; Magiorkinis, Gkikas; Papatheodoridis, George; Pogka, Vasiliki; Lourida, Giota; Argyraki, Aikaterini; Angelakis, Emmanouil; Sourvinos, George; Beloukas, Apostolos; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Karamitros, Timokratis",,,366

METHODS: All children (1 month- 18 years) who fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria of MIS-C presenting to two tertiary care centers in Karachi from May 2020 till August 31st were included. KD and VM admitted to one of the study centers in the last five years prior to this pandemic, was compared to MIS-C. RESULTS: Thirty children with median age of 24 (interquartile range (IQR)1-192) months met the criteria for MIS-C. Three phenotypes were identified, 12 patients (40%) with KD, ten (33%) VM and eight (26%) had features of TSS. Echocardiography showed coronary involvement in 10 (33%), and moderate to severe Left Ventricular dysfunction in 10 (33%) patients. Steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were administered to 24 (80%) and 12 (41%) patients respectively while 7 (23%) received both. Overall, 20% children expired. During the last five years, 30 and 47 children were diagnosed with KD and VM, respectively. Their comparison with MIS-C group showed lymphopenia, thrombocytosis, and higher CRP as well as more frequent atypical presentation in MIS-C KD group with less coronary involvement. The MIS-C VM was more likely to present with fulminant myocarditis. CONCLUSIONS: Our MIS-C cohort is younger with higher mortality compared to previous reports.

299125,Rheumatic disease management in the Campania region of Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Hypofractionation of prostate cancer radiotherapy achieves tumour control at lower total radiation doses, however, increased rectal and bladder toxicities have been observed. To realise the radiobiological advantage of hypofractionation whilst minimising harm, the potential reduction in dose to organs at risk was investigated for biofocused radiotherapy. Patient-specific tumour location and cell density information were derived from multiparametric imaging. Uniform-dose plans and biologically-optimised plans were generated for a standard schedule (78 Gy/39 fractions) and hypofractionated schedules (60 Gy/20 fractions and 36.25 Gy/5 fractions). Results showed that biologically-optimised plans yielded statistically lower doses to the rectum and bladder compared to isoeffective uniform-dose plans for all fractionation schedules. A reduction in the number of fractions increased the target dose modulation required to achieve equal tumour control. On average, biologically-optimised, moderately-hypofractionated plans demonstrated 16.3% (p-value:0.01) and 16.0% (p-value:0.04) reduction in rectal and bladder dose compared with standard fractionation. The tissue-sparing effect was more pronounced in extreme hypofractionation with mean reduction in rectal and bladder dose of 37.4% (p-value:<0.01) and 46.8% (p-value:0.02), respectively. This study suggests that the ability to utilise patient-specific tumour biology information will provide greater incentive to employ hypofractionation in the treatment of localised prostate cancer with radiotherapy. However, to exploit the radiobiological advantages given by hypofractionation, greater attention to geometric accuracy is required due to increased sensitivity to treatment uncertainties.","Her, Emily Jungmin; Ebert, Martin Andrew; Kennedy, Angel M; Reynolds, Hayley M; Sun, Yu; Williams, Scott; Haworth, Annette",Phys. med. biol,,366

Despite the great achievements of the existing point-of-care testing (POCT) technology, accurate on-site screening of oxalate remains a tricky issue. To this aim, we proposed a ""lab in a tube"" platform which integrated portable hydrogel kit with smartphone for real-time monitoring of oxalate to achieve quantitatively precise analysis. In this work, a stimuli-responsive hydrogel-based kit was constructed via embedding manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheets into sodium alginate hydrogel system. Based on the intrinsic oxidase-like activity, MnO2 nanosheets-based nanozyme triggered color reaction by introducing a common sensing probe 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine. Meanwhile, the presence of oxalate would decompose MnO2 nanosheets, inducing the decrease of nanozyme activity, which resulted in the color response of portable kit. Coupling with ImageJ software, the image information of kit captured via smartphone could be transduced into the hue intensity, which provided a directly quantitative tool to detect oxalate with a detection limit of 8.0 µmol L-1. This portable smartphone biosensor was successfully applied for screening urine sample within 10 min for high-throughput analysis (twelve samples) without the need for any advanced analytical instruments. Based on the merits of simple operation, cost-efficiency, and good selectivity, the availability of the miniaturized biosensor platform for POCT will achieve the requirements of routine screening and disease prevention.","Jin, Rui; Zhao, Lianjing; Yan, Xu; Han, Xiaosong; Liu, Mengqi; Chen, Yue; Li, Qingyun; Su, Dandan; Liu, Fangmeng; Sun, Peng; Liu, Xiaomin; Wang, Chenguang; Lu, Geyu",Biosens Bioelectron,,366

This study aimed to examine factors related to preventive behaviors of emerging adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive online survey design was used. Data were collected using a self-administrated, 28-item questionnaire completed by 239 undergraduate students from a university in Seoul, South Korea. The questionnaire was developed based on previous studies and the guidelines of the World Health Organization about COVID-19 preventive behaviors. The mean age of participants was 21.97 years, and the average score for COVID-19 preventive behaviors was 4.13 (SD: ±0.42) on a 5-point scale. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that subjective norms related to parents (ß = 0.425, p < 0.001), issue involvement related to COVID-19 (ß = 0.160, p = 0.024), and sex (ß = 0.137, p = 0.029) were significant factors related to preventive behaviors of emerging adults after controlling for demographic characteristics. The variables explained 20.1% of the variance in preventive behaviors. The results of this study suggest that better strategies for subjective norms related to parents and issue involvement related to COVID-19 must be considered to improve emerging adults' preventive behaviors.","Park, Sunhee; Kim, Beomsoo; Kim, Kyoung A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366

Although the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 remains uncertain, it may serve as a potential prophylactic agent especially in those at high risk, such as healthcare workers, household contacts of infected patients, and the immunocompromised. Our aim was to identify possible hydroxychloroquine dosing regimens through simulation in those at high risk of infections by optimizing exposures above the in vitro generated half maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) and to help guide researchers in dose-selection for COVID-19 prophylactic studies. To maintain weekly troughs above EC50 in > 50% of subjects at steady-state in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, an 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg twice or 3 times weekly is required. In an exposure driven, post-exposure prophylaxis setting, 800 mg loading dose followed in 6 hours by 600 mg, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days achieved daily troughs above EC50 in > 50% subjects. These doses are higher than recommended for malaria chemoprophylaxis, and clinical trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy.","Al-Kofahi, Mahmoud; Jacobson, Pamala; Boulware, David R; Matas, Arthur; Kandaswamy, Raja; Jaber, Mutaz M; Rajasingham, Radha; Young, Jo-Anne H; Nicol, Melanie R",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,366
304239,"Initiating psychiatry teleclinics during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan",2020,"AIM: Perinatal telemedicine efforts have commenced worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As there have been no prior studies on the acceptance of telemedicine by pregnant women, we conducted this survey to investigate the same. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous questionnaire survey of pregnant women who underwent telemedicine check-ups from March 4 to June 30, 2020, using a mobile fetal heart rate monitor and video call system through the Hokkaido University Hospital. RESULTS: Out of the 77 individuals who received prenatal telemedicine check-ups, 54 individuals (70%) had complications, and 64 individuals (83%) consented for the questionnaire survey. In the video call system, 18 individuals (28%) were found to be unwell and 17 individuals (27%) experienced difficulty using the mobile fetal heart rate monitoring device. Assuming scores for face-to-face consultations were five out of 10, the mean score for satisfaction was 4.2, but 19 (30%) women felt equal or greater satisfaction with face-to-face consultations. If not for the threat of COVID-19, only four individuals (6%) proactively expressed a desire for telemedicine, with a significantly less demand observed among primiparous women than multiparous women. The permissible additional financial burden enabling telemedicine was $10 or less for 80% of subjects. CONCLUSION: In this small preliminary study, 30% of the pregnant women felt equal or greater satisfaction with telemedicine than face-to-face consultations. A stronger demand for telemedicine was exhibited by multiparous women than primiparous women. Thus, a system that would be advantages by limiting subjects and enabling low-cost examinations is required for making perinatal telemedicine more popular.","Nakagawa, Kinuko; Umazume, Takeshi; Mayama, Michinori; Chiba, Kentaro; Saito, Yoshihiro; Noshiro, Kiwamu; Morikawa, Mamoru; Yoshino, Masanori; Watari, Hidemichi",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,,366

CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 16-year-old female who presented with clinical symptoms suggestive of appendicitis and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) that revealed features concerning for appendicitis. After laparoscopic appendectomy, histopathology of the appendix demonstrated only mild serosal inflammation and was not consistent with acute appendicitis. Her overall clinical presentation was felt to be consistent with MIS-C and she subsequently improved with immunomodulatory and steroid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We note that MIS-C can mimic acute appendicitis. This case highlights MIS-C as a cause of abdominal imaging with features concerning for appendicitis, and MIS-C should be considered in the differential for a patient with appendicitis-like symptoms and a positive COVID-19 IgG. Lab criteria, specifically low-normal white blood cell count and thrombocytopenia, appears to be of high relevance in differing MIS-C from acute appendicitis, even when appendix radiologically is dilated.","Hwang, Michelle; Wilson, Kelsey; Wendt, Lisa; Pohlman, Joshua; Densmore, Emily; Kaeppler, Caitlin; Van Arendonk, Kyle; Yale, Sarah",BMC Pediatr,,366
307452,"Letter to the Editor about the Article ""Excess Mortality Estimation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Preliminary Data from Portugal https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.13928""",2020,"Background: The pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) creates many challenges for the healthcare sector. Currently, little is known of how the pandemic has impacted patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this study was to determine whether emergency cardiovascular surgeries can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Between 17 January 2020 and 11 February 2020, 13 patients were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital for emergency cardiovascular surgery. During this time, Wuhan was a COVID-19 epicenter, and Wuhan Union Hospital is a sentinel hospital located in this area. These patients' epidemiological histories, clinical records, laboratory assessments, imaging findings, and surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Throat swabs were collected from some patients preoperatively and all patients postoperatively for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to determine whether these patients had COVID-19. Results: This cohort included 5 cases of acute aortic dissection, 3 cases of congenital heart disease, 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with end-stage heart failure, 1 case of aortocoronary fistula that had undergone previous surgery, 1 case of subacute infective endocarditis with cerebral infarction, and 1 case of multivessel coronary disease. Six patients were suspected COVID-19 cases (46.2%). There were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in this cohort. None of the patients in this cohort died and none developed severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure, or septic shock after surgery. No cross-infection occurred with other patients or medical staff who came into close contact with this cohort. Conclusions: Emergency surgery is crucial and unavoidable for many patients with acute and severe cardiovascular disease, regardless of the pandemic. Our study indicates that, with adequate preparation and the provision of appropriate treatment, satisfactory outcomes can be achieved for such patients.","Hu, Xingjian; Wang, Yin; Xia, Jiahong; Dong, Nianguo; Shi, Jiawei",J Thorac Dis,,366
307461,RESEARCHFactors Associated with Nursing Homes' Late Participation in COVID-19 Reporting,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To develop recommendations for the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A task force comprising of 25 rheumatologists from the 5 regions of the continent was formed and operated through a hub-and-spoke model with a central working committee (CWC) and 4 subgroups. The subgroups championed separate scopes of the clinical questions and formulated preliminary statements of recommendations which were processed centrally in the CWC. The CWC and each subgroup met by several virtual meetings, and two rounds of voting were conducted on the drafted statements of recommendations. Votes were online-delivered and recommendations were pruned down according to predefined criteria. Each statement was rated between 1 and 9 with 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 representing disagreement, uncertainty and agreement, respectively. The levels of agreement on the statements were stratified as low, moderate or high according to the spread of votes. A statement was retired if it had a mean vote below 7 or a 'low' level of agreement. RESULTS: A total of 126 initial statements of recommendations were drafted, and these were reduced to 22 after the two rounds of voting. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary statements of recommendations will serve to guide the clinical practice of rheumatology across Africa amidst the changing practices and uncertainties in the current era of COVID-19. It is recognized that further updates to the recommendations will be needed as more evidence emerges. Key Points â¢ AFLAR has developed preliminary recommendations for the management of RMDs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. â¢ COVID-19 is an unprecedented experience which has brought new concerns regarding the use of some disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and these recommendations seek to provide guidelines to the African rheumatologists. â¢ Hydroxychloroquine shortage has become rampart across Africa as the drug is being used as prophylaxis against COVID-19 and this may necessitate a review of treatment plan for some patients with RMDs. â¢ Breastfeeding should continue for as long as possible if a woman is positive for SARS-CoV-2 as there is currently no evidence that the infection can be transmitted through breast milk.","Akintayo, Richard Oluyinka; Bahiri, Rachid; El Miedany, Yasser; Olaosebikan, Hakeem; Kalla, Asgar Ali; Adebajo, Adewale Olukayode; Migowa, Angela Nyangore; Slimani, Samy; Koussougbo, Ouma Devi; Kawther, Ben Abdelghani; Akpabio, Akpabio Akanimo; Ghozlani, Imad; Dey, Dzifa; Hassan, Waleed A; Govind, Nimmisha; Makan, Kavita; Mohamed, Abdelgaffar; Genga, Eugene Kalman; Ghassem, Mohamed Khattry Ahmed; Mortada, Mohamed; Hamdi, Wafa; Wabi, Moudjib O; Tikly, Mohammed; Ngandeu-Singwe, Madeleine; Scott, Christian",Clin. rheumatol,,366

Our objective was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on somatic symptoms among Chinese college and primary school students, to provide reference data pertaining to the mental health of this population in the context of a public health emergency. In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression analysis and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms. Our data indicate that governments and other relevant agencies should implement different measures to prevent and control mental health disorders diseases in primary school and college students.","Liu, Shengyi; Liu, Ying; Liu, Yong",Psychiatry Res,,366

Objective: The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency and severity of STD in COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the association with demographic characteristics, hospital admission, symptoms, comorbidities, and blood biomarkers. METHODS: We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study on patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (n=846) and controls (n=143) from 15 Spanish hospitals. Data on STD were collected prospectively using an in-person survey. The severity of STD was categorized using a visual analog scale. We analyzed time to onset, recovery rate, time to recovery, hospital admission, pneumonia, comorbidities, smoking, and symptoms. RESULTS: STD was at least 2-fold more common in COVID-19-positive patients than in controls. COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients were older, with a lower frequency of STD, and recovered earlier than outpatients. Analysis stratified by severity of STD showed that more than half of COVID-19 patients presented severe loss of smell (53.7%) or taste (52.2%); both senses were impaired in >90%. In the multivariate analysis, older age (>60 years), being hospitalized, and increased C-reactive protein were associated with a better sense of smell and/or taste. COVID-19-positive patients reported improvement in smell (45.6%) and taste (46.1%) at the time of the survey; in 90.6% this was within 2 weeks of infection. CONCLUSION: STD is a common symptom in COVID-19 and presents mainly in young and nonhospitalized patients.

312357,Management of Maxillofacial Trauma in Attempt Suicide Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Seasonal influenza remains a major public health problem, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, mostly of elderly people. Despite the wide availability of vaccines, there are multiple problems decreasing the effectiveness of vaccination programs. These include viral variability and hence the requirement to match strains by estimating which will become prevalent each season, problems associated with vaccine and adjuvant production, and the route of administration as well as the perceived lower vaccine efficiency in older adults. Clinical protection is still suboptimal for all of these reasons, and vaccine uptake remains too low in most countries. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines include developing universal vaccines independent of the circulating strains in any particular season and stimulating cellular as well as humoral responses, especially in the elderly. This commentary assesses progress over the last 3 years towards achieving these aims. Since the beginning of 2020, an unprecedented international academic and industrial effort to develop effective vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has diverted attention away from influenza, but many of the lessons learned for the one will synergize with the other to mutual advantage. And, unlike the SARS-1 epidemic and, we hope, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, influenza will not be eliminated and thus efforts to improve influenza vaccines will remain of crucial importance.","Pawelec, Graham; McElhaney, Janet",F1000Research,,366

To date, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), lists â¼130,000 articles from the WHO COVID-19 database, PubMed Central, medRxiv, and bioRxiv, as collected by Semantic Scholar. According to LitCovid (11 August 2020), â¼40,300 COVID19-related articles are currently listed in PubMed. It has been shown in clinical settings that the analysis of past research results and the mining of available data can provide novel opportunities for the successful application of currently approved therapeutics and their combinations for the treatment of conditions caused by a novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, effective responses to the pandemic require the development of efficient applications, methods and algorithms for data navigation, text-mining, clustering, classification, analysis, and reasoning. Thus, our COVID19 Drug Repository represents a modular platform for drug data navigation and analysis, with an emphasis on COVID-19-related information currently being reported. The COVID19 Drug Repository enables users to focus on different levels of complexity, starting from general information about (FDA-) approved drugs, PubMed references, clinical trials, recipes as well as the descriptions of molecular mechanisms of drugs' action.

The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics and clinical significance of dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets in the course of COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective study, the levels of peripheral lymphocyte subsets including CD4+, CD8+, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+, CD38+, CD3+HLA-DR+, CD19+, CD20+, and CD16+CD56+ cells were measured by flow cytometry in 52 confirmed hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at the day of admission and after 7 days of care. Clinical response was defined as improvement in symptoms (fever, dyspnea, and cough as well as blood oxygen saturation), and patients who met these criteria after 1 week of admission were classified as early responders; others who survived and finally discharged from the hospital were classified as late responders and patients who died were categorized as nonresponders. Immunophenotyping of studied cell changes on the first day of admission and 7 days after treatment were compared. Besides, the correlation between cellular subset variation and clinical response and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Total counts of white blood cell, T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD38+ lymphocytes, and CD3+HLA-DR+ lymphocytes were significantly increased in both early and late responders. No statistically significant difference was observed in CD4+/CD8+ ratio, B cells, FOXP3+Treg lymphocytes, and FOXP3 median fluorescence intensity among studied groups. According to the multivariate analysis, an increase in CD4+ T cells (p = 0.019), CD8+ T cells (p = 0.001), and administration of interferon (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of clinical response. CONCLUSION: We found an increasing trend in total T cells, T helpers, cytotoxic T cells, activated lymphocytes, and natural killer cells among responders. This trend was not statistically significant among nonresponders. The findings of this study may enhance our knowledge about the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Rezaei, Mitra; Marjani, Majid; Mahmoudi, Shima; Mortaz, Esmaeil; Mansouri, Davood",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,,366
313448,Research Into Early Immune System Activity and Later Psychological Distress: Promises and Challenges Ahead,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) hospitalizations declined worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear how shelter-in-place orders affected acute CVD hospitalizations, illness severity, and outcomes. HYPOTHESIS: COVID-19 pandemic was associated with reduced acute CVD hospitalizations (heart failure [HF], acute coronary syndrome [ACS], and stroke [CVA]), and worse HF illness severity. METHODS: We compared acute CVD hospitalizations at Duke University Health System before and after North Carolina's shelter-in-place order (January 1-March 29 vs. March 30-August 31), and used parallel comparison cohorts from 2019. We explored illness severity among admitted HF patients using ADHERE (""high risk"": >2 points) and GWTG-HF ("">10%"": >57 points) in-hospital mortality risk scores, as well as echocardiography-derived parameters. RESULTS: Comparing hospitalizations during January 1-March 29 (N = 1618) vs. March 30-August 31 (N = 2501) in 2020, mean daily CVD hospitalizations decreased (18.2 vs. 16.1 per day, p = .0036), with decreased length of stay (8.4 vs. 7.5 days, p = .0081) and no change in in-hospital mortality (4.7 vs. 5.3%, p = .41). HF hospitalizations decreased (9.0 vs. 7.7 per day, p = .0019), with higher ADHERE (""high risk"": 2.5 vs. 4.5%; p = .030), but unchanged GWTG-HF ("">10%"": 5.3 vs. 4.6%; p = .45), risk groups. Mean LVEF was lower (39.0 vs. 37.2%, p = .034), with higher mean LV mass (262.4 vs. 276.6 g, p = .014). CONCLUSIONS: CVD hospitalizations, HF illness severity, and echocardiography measures did not change between admission periods in 2019. Evaluating short-term data, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place order was associated with reductions in acute CVD hospitalizations, particularly HF, with no significant increase in in-hospital mortality and only minor differences in HF illness severity.","Rao, Vishal N; Kelsey, Michelle D; Kelsey, Anita M; Russell, Stuart D; Mentz, Robert J; Patel, Manesh R; Fudim, Marat",Clin. cardiol,,366

The SARS-CoV-2 genome includes conserved RNA elements that offer potential small-molecule drug targets, but most of their 3D structures have not been experimentally characterized. Here, we provide a compilation of chemical mapping data from our and other labs, secondary structure models, and 3D model ensembles based on Rosetta's FARFAR2 algorithm for SARS-CoV-2 RNA regions including the individual stems SL1-8 in the extended 5' UTR; the reverse complement of the 5' UTR SL1-4; the frameshift stimulating element (FSE); and the extended pseudoknot, hypervariable region, and s2m of the 3' UTR. For eleven of these elements (the stems in SL1-8, reverse complement of SL1-4, FSE, s2m and 3' UTR pseudoknot), modeling convergence supports the accuracy of predicted low energy states; subsequent cryo-EM characterization of the FSE confirms modeling accuracy.

Presentation of the disease often includes upper respiratory symptoms like dry cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and rhinorrhea that can develop to respiratory failure, needing intubation. Furthermore, the occurrence of acute and subacute neurological manifestations such as stroke, encephalitis, headache, and seizures are frequently stated in patients with COVID-19. One of the reported neurological complications of severe COVID-19 is the demolition of the myelin sheath. Indeed, the complex immunological dysfunction provides a substrate for the development of demyelination. Nevertheless, few published reports in the literature describe demyelination in subjects with COVID-19. In this short narrative review, we discuss probable pathological mechanisms that may trigger demyelination in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and summarize the clinical evidence, confirming SARS-CoV-2 condition as a risk factor for the destruction of myelin.","Shabani, Zahra",Acta neurol.

To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titres of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titres measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titres were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred, while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases. Viral burdens estimated according to threshold cycle values at the RT-PCR seemed to impact antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide insights into the nature of humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 and diagnostic performance of antibody tests.","Wakui, Masatoshi; Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Kurafuji, Toshinobu; Noguchi, Masayo; Ohno, Akemi; Yokota, Hiromitsu; Kikuchi, Haruhito; Hasegawa, Naoki; Saya, Hideyuki; Murata, Mitsuru",Ann Clin Biochem,,366

Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) could help develop mitigation strategies to prevent further COVID-19 spread. Our aim is to evaluate self-reported and census-based SDoH as a mediator of health disparities in COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional ecological study and included all COVID-19 cases report by the COVID-19 Florida dashboard as the dependent variable. The independent variables were census-based median household income, population and household size, and self-reported SDoH using a validated survey. We calculated the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of COVID-19 by zip code using Poisson regression and structured equation modelling to evaluate the mediation effect of income and SDoH on COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: We included 97,594 COVID-19 positive cases across 79 Miami-Dade ZIP codes with a median age of 43 years; females represented 50.7% of the cases. The highest IRR (4.44) were for ZIP code 33125 (income $21,106, 6% Black, 93% Hispanic), while the lowest IRR (0.86) was for ZIP code 33146 (median household incomes $96,609, 3% Black and 53% Hispanic). In structured equation models, the indirect coefficient of income in the relationship between race/ethnicity and COVID-19 were only significant for Blacks and not Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: This ecological analysis using ZIP code and aggregate individual-level SDoH shows that in Miami-Dade county, COVID infection is associated with economic disadvantage in a particular geographical area and not with racial/ethnic distribution.","Palacio, Ana; Tamariz, Leonardo",J. gen. intern. med,,366

Publicly released data for 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan of China were analyzed in this paper. METHODS: Various statistical and network analysis methods were employed. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19 patients show gender (55% vs 45%) and age (81% aged between 21 and 60) preferences; possible causes were explored. The estimated average, mode and median incubation periods are 7.4, 4 and 7 days. Incubation periods of 92% of patients were no more than 14 days. The epidemic in Henan has undergone three stages and has shown high correlations with the numbers of patients recently returned from Wuhan. Network analysis revealed that 208 cases were clustering infected, and various People's Hospitals are the main force in treating COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The incubation period was statistically estimated, and the proposed state transition diagram can explore the epidemic stages of emerging infectious disease. We suggest that although the quarantine measures are gradually working, strong measures still might be needed for a period of time, since â¼7.45% of patients may have very long incubation periods.

During the lockdown and restrictions placed on public activities and gatherings, green spaces have become one of the only sources of resilience amidst the coronavirus pandemic, in part because of their positive effects on psychological, physical and social cohesion and spiritual wellness. This study analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 and government response policies to the pandemic on park visitation at global, regional and national levels and assesses the importance of parks during this global pandemic. The data we collected primarily from Google's Community Mobility Reports and the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. The results for most countries included in the analysis show that park visitation has increased since February 16th, 2020 compared to visitor numbers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions on social gathering, movement, and the closure of workplace and indoor recreational places, are correlated with more visits to parks. Stay-at-home restrictions and government stringency index are negatively associated with park visits at a global scale. Demand from residents for parks and outdoor green spaces has increased since the outbreak began, and highlights the important role and benefits provided by parks, especially urban and community parks, under the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide recommendations for park managers and other decision-makers in terms of park management and planning during health crises, as well as for park design and development.

The data regarding palliative team involvement in patients with COVID-19, however, remains scarce. We aimed to investigate outcomes of palliative team involvement for the patients with COVID-19 in NYC. METHODS: Consecutive 225 patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in our urban academic medical center in NYC were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those with a palliative care consult (palliative group: 14.2% [n = 32]) versus those with no palliative care consult (no palliative group: 85.8% [n = 193]). RESULTS: The palliative group was older and had more comorbidities. During the hospital course, the palliative group had more intensive care unit stays, rapid response team activations, and more use of vasopressors (P < .05). Patients with palliative care had higher rates of invasive mechanical ventilation than those without (46.9% vs 10.4%, P < .001). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in 12 patients (6.5% vs 5.2%, P = .77) and death rate was 100% in both subsets. Notably, initial code status was not different between the 2 groups, however, code status at discharge was significantly different between them (P < .001). The rate of full code decreased by 70% in the palliative group and by 47.5% in the no palliative care group from admission to the time of death.

319432,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on acute spine surgery referrals to UK tertiary spinal unit: any lessons to be learnt?,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-COV-2 causes digestive system symptom, the effect of which remains equivocal. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 were classified into 4 groups according to symptom. The study traced the onset and duration of symptoms, compared laboratory examinations and conducted bioinformatic analysis. Immune indices were further analyzed. RESULTS: By March 16, 25 patients with COVID-19 and 13 with suspect COVID-19 were admitted to West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Digestive system symptom group had the highest level of ESR (mm/h, Pï¼0.0001), serum ferritin (ng/ml, Pï¼0.0001), hepatic enzymes (Pï¼0.05), and retentive lymphocyte count/percentage (Pï¼0.05) and its subsets (Pï¼0.05). Combined group (respiratory combined with subsequent digestive system symptom) had the highest level of IL-6 (pg/ml, P=0.0046), CRP (mg/L, P=0.0004) and moderate lymphocyte depletion. Respiratory system symptom and asymptomatic groups suffered the most from lymphocyte depletion (Pï¼0.05). Bioinformatic analysis indicated co-expression of binding related proteins of SARS-COV-2 (ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Furin) in small intestine. CD147 was extensively expressed in alimentary tract. CTSL, PIKfyve, TPC2 and CTSB could be detected with &#8805;moderate expressions in a variety of organs including alimentary system. CONCLUSIONS: Alimentary system is possibly attacked by SARS-COV-2 other than hyperinflammation or immune dysregulation caused by it. Involvement of alimentary system might further protect mild and moderate cases from lymphocyte depletion caused by COVID-19.","Chen, Sai; Zhou, Jing; Ou, Xiaoqi; Cheng, Wei; Qin, Yun; Guo, Yingqiang; Jiang, Yunhan",Int J Clin Pract,,366

320034,The analgesic efficiency of pregabalin for the treatment of postoperative pain in total hip arthroplasty: A randomized controlled study protocol,2020,"OBJECTIVE: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the most serious type of acute coronary syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of bivalirudin application during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) in older patients with acute STEMI. METHODS: A total of 672 older patients with STEMI (>75 years) who underwent PPCI were studied. The primary endpoints were 30-day net adverse clinical events (NACEs) post-emergency percutaneous coronary intervention, including major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium grades 2 to 5 (BARC 2-5) bleeding events. RESULTS: The incidence of NACEs and BARC 2-5 bleeding events in the bivalirudin group was significantly lower than that in the unfractionated heparin group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that bivalirudin significantly reduced 30-day NACEs (odds ratio: 0.700, 95% confidence interval: 0.492-0.995) and BARC 2-5 bleeding events (odds ratio: 0.561, 95% confidence interval: 0.343-0.918). At 1-year follow-up, these results were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Bivalirudin can be safely and effectively used during PPCI in older patients with STEMI. Bivalirudin reduces the risks of NACEs and bleeding within 30 days after PPCI, without increasing the risks of MACCEs and stent thrombosis compared with heparin.","Chen, Hongwu; Yu, Xiaofan; Kong, Xiangyong; Li, Longwei; Wu, Jiawei; Ma, Likun",J Int Med Res,,366

Although the greater focus on social determinants is laudable and necessary, there is a tendency for health care organizations to implement SDOH programs at scale without rigorous evidence of effect, rather than targeting interventions to specific patients and assessing their impact. This broad, and sometimes blind, application of SDOH interventions can be costly and wasteful. We argue for rejecting the ""more is better"" mindset and specifically targeting patients who truly need and would substantially benefit from SDOH interventions. Matching interventions to the most appropriate patients involves screening for social needs, developing rigorous evidence of effect, and accompanying policy reform.","Jain, Sachin H; Chandrashekar, Pooja",Am J Manag Care,,366

320924,The Use of Telemedicine for Patients with Mental Illness and COVID-19 Infection,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To understand the opinions of clinicians about the risks, benefits, barriers, and facilitators to the practice of parent sleep during skin-to-skin care in hospital settings. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Online survey. PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians who self-identified as infant care providers, that is, neonatal clinicians (N = 158). METHODS: We sent an online survey invitation to neonatal clinicians through neonatal websites, conferences, and social media sites in the United States and used snowball recruitment. We used a risk management framework to analyze qualitative data. We used descriptive statistics and the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests to determine if opinions differed based on clinician and organizational characteristics. RESULTS: Respondents' support of parent sleep during skin-to-skin care (yes/no) did not differ on the basis of whether the clinician had taken a formal course on skin-to-skin care, facilitated skin-to-skin care more than 100 times, or frequently promoted skin-to-skin care in current practice. Respondents who supported parent sleep (n = 93, 59% of respondents) reported greater implementation of risk control strategies than nonsupporters (n = 53 [57%] vs. n = 3 [5%]; p < .001), such as frequent monitoring of vital signs (n = 33 [35%] vs. n = 2 [3%]; p < .001), use of devices to support skin-to-skin care (n = 49 [53%] vs. n = 19 [29%]; p = .003), and proper positioning (n = 20 [22%] vs. n = 0 [0%]; p < .001). Nonsupporters more frequently reported that parent sleep during skin-to-skin care violates safe sleep recommendations, is habit forming for home, poses a fall risk, and jeopardizes the infant's airway. CONCLUSION: Most respondents supported parent sleep during skin-to-skin care, but concerns regarding safety for the infant remained a barrier. The use of a risk management framework may help facilitate a systematic approach to improve the implementation of safe skin-to-skin practices.","Weber, Ashley; Elder, Mason; Voos, Kristin C; Lambert, Joshua W; Kaplan, Heather C; Jackson, Yamile C",J. obstet. gynecol. neonatal nurs,,366

321754,Administration of end-of-life drugs by family caregivers during covid-19: opportunity for future home prescribing plans,2020,"PURPOSE: Strategies for deploying clinical pharmacists to increase access to buprenorphine in inpatient, outpatient and transitional care, and community practice settings are described. SUMMARY: Access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is essential, but patients face many barriers when pursuing treatment and MOUD. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has compounded the opioid crisis and worsened outcomes by introducing new barriers to MOUD access. Many strategies to ensure continued access to MOUD have been described, but the role of leveraging pharmacists during the opioid/COVID-19 syndemic to improve medication access and outcomes remains underappreciated. Pharmacists, while both qualified and capable of liberalizing access to all forms of MOUD, may have the strongest impact by increasing access to buprenorphine. Herein we present progressive strategies to maintain and extend buprenorphine access for patients with OUD through deployment of clinical pharmacists, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which access may be further restricted. CONCLUSION: Leveraging pharmacists to extend access to MOUD, particularly buprenorphine, remains an underutilized strategy that should be implemented, particularly during the concurrent COVID-19 global pandemic.","Peckham, Alyssa M; Ball, Jennifer; Colvard, Michelle D; Dadiomov, David; Hill, Lucas G; Nichols, Stephanie D; Tallian, Kimberly; Ventricelli, Daniel J; Tran, Tran H",,,366
322332,Sleep and Motion Disorders of Physicians and Nurses Working in Hospitals Facing the Pandemic of COVID 19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to find a novel targeted imaging and drug delivery vehicle for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a common and troublesome disease that still lacks effective therapy and imaging options. As an attempt to improve the disease treatment, we tested &#945;MSH for the targeting of nanoliposomes to IBD sites. &#945;MSH, an endogenous tridecapeptide, binds to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) and has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. MC1-R is found on macrophages, neutrophils and the renal tubule system. We formulated and tested a liposomal nanoparticle involving &#945;MSH in order to achieve a specific targeting to the inflamed intestines. METHODS: NDP-&#945;MSH peptide conjugated to Alexa Fluor&#8482; 680 was linked to the liposomal membrane via NSuccinyl PE and additionally loaded into the lumen of the liposomes. Liposomes without the &#945;MSH-conjugate and free NDP-&#945;MSH were used as a control. The liposomes were also loaded with ICG to track them. The liposomes were tested in DSS treated mice, which had received DSS via drinking water order to develop a model IBD. Inflammation severity was assessed by the Disease Activity Index (DAI) score and ex vivo histological CD68 staining of samples taken from different parts of the intestine. The liposome targeting was analyzed by analyzing the ICG and ALEXA 680 fluorescence in the intestine compared to the biodistribution. RESULTS: NPD-&#945;MSH was successfully labeled with Alexa and retained its biological activity. Liposomes were identified in expected regions in the inflamed bowel regions and in the kidneys, where MC1-R is abundant. In vivo liposome targeting correlated with the macrophage concentration at the site of the inflammation supporting the active targeting of the liposomes through &#945;MSH. The liposomal &#945;MSH was well tolerated by animals. CONCLUSION: This study opens up the possibility to further develop an &#945;MSH targeted theranostic delivery to different clinically relevant applications in IBD inflammation but also opens possibilities for use in other inflammations like lung inflammation in Covid 19.","Peñate-Medina, Tuula; Damoah, Christabel; Benezra, Miriam; Will, Olga; Kairemo, Kalevi; Humbert, Jana; Sebens, Susanne; Peñate-Medina, Oula",Curr Pharm Des,,366

322501,Drug Evaluation during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected health care delivery, effects that are juxtaposed with health care professional (HCP) burnout and mental distress. The Opioid Use Disorder Provider COVID-19 Survey was conducted to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice and HCP well-being. METHODS: The cross-sectional survey was e-mailed to listservs with approximately 157,000 subscribers of diverse professions between July 14 and August 15, 2020. Two dependent variables evaluated HCP functioning and work-life balance. Independent variables assessed organizational practices and HCP experiences. Covariates included participant demographic characteristics, addiction board certification, and practice setting. Multilevel multivariate logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: Among 812 survey respondents, most were men, White, and physicians, with 46% located in urban settings. Function-impairing anxiety was reported by 17%, and 28% reported more difficulty with work-life balance. Difficulty with functioning was positively associated with having staff who were sick with COVID-19 and feeling close to patients, and was negatively associated with being male and having no staff changes. Difficulty with work-life balance was positively associated with addiction board certification; working in multiple settings; having layoffs, furloughs, or reduced hours; staff illness with COVID-19; and group well-being check-ins. It was negatively associated with male gender, older age, and no staff changes. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic, provider, and organizational-practice variables were associated with reporting negative measures of well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results should inform HCPs and their organizations on factors that may lead to burnout, with particular focus on gender and age-related concerns and the role of well-being check-ins.","Blevins, Derek; Henry, Brandy F; Sung, Minhee; Edelman, E Jennifer; Black, Anne C; Dawes, Michael; Molfenter, Todd; Hagle, Holly; Drexler, Karen; Cates-Wessel, Kathryn; Levin, Frances R",Psychiatr Serv,,366
323216,Study Examines How the Covid -19 Pandemic Impacts Quality of Life in Patients with Cancer,2020,"COVID-19 in humans is caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that belongs to the beta family of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illness in 10-15% of infected individuals and mortality in 2-3%. Vaccines are urgently needed to prevent infection and to contain viral spread. Although several mRNA- and adenovirus-based vaccines are highly effective, their dependence on the ""cold chain"" transportation makes global vaccination a difficult task. In this context, a stable lyophilized vaccine may present certain advantages. Accordingly, establishing additional vaccine platforms remains vital to tackle SARS- CoV-2 and any future variants that may arise. Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been used to eradicate smallpox disease, and several attenuated viral strains with enhanced safety for human applications have been developed. We have generated two candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on two vaccinia viral strains, MVA and v-NY, that express full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Whereas MVA is growth-restricted in mammalian cells, the v-NY strain is replication-competent. We demonstrate that both candidate recombinant vaccines induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in C57BL/6 mice vaccinated according to prime-boost regimens. Furthermore, our vaccination regimens generated TH1-biased immune responses in mice. Most importantly, prime-boost vaccination of a Syrian hamster infection model with MVA-S and v-NY-S protected the hamsters against SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting that these two vaccines are promising candidates for future development. Finally, our vaccination regimens generated neutralizing antibodies that partially cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Kulkarni, Rakesh; Chen, Wen-Ching; Lee, Ying; Kao, Chi-Fei; Hu, Shiu-Lok; Ma, Hsiu-Hua; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Liao, Chun-Che; Liang, Jian-Jong; Ko, Hui-Ying; Sun, Cheng-Pu; Lin, Yin-Shoiou; Wang, Yu-Chiuan; Wei, Sung-Chan; Lin, Yi-Ling; Ma, Che; Chao, Yu-Chan; Chou, Yu-Chi; Chang, Wen",,,366

In the summer during the COVID-19 pandemic, a differential diagnosis between the two conditions is important. However, no studies have compared and distinguished heat-related illness from COVID-19. We aimed to compare the data between patients with early-stage heat-related illness and those with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included 90 patients with early-stage heat-related illness selected from Heatstroke STUDY 2017-2019 (nationwide registries of heat-related illness in Japan) and 86 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with complaints of fever or fatigue and were admitted to one of two hospitals in Tokyo, Japan. RESULTS: Amongvital signs, systolic blood pressure (119 vs. 125 mmHg, p = 0.02), oxygen saturation (98% vs. 97%, p < 0.001), and body temperature (36.6 vs. 37.6 °C, p<0.001) showed significant between-group differences for the heatstroke and COVID-19 groups, respectively. Numerous intergroup differences in laboratory findings were present, including white blood cell counts (10.8 vs. 5.2 × 103/µL, p<0.001), creatinine (2.2 vs. 0.85 mg/dL, p<0.001), and C-reactive protein (0.2 vs. 2.8 mg/dL, p<0.001), although a logistic regression model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.966 using these three factors. A Random Forest machine learning model achieved accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC of 0.908, 0.976, 0.842, and 0.978, respectively. Creatinine was the most important feature of this model.

In on-ground, classroom-based education, these programs are commonly used on University-owned devices with software preinstalled. Remote education typically involves the use of student-owned devices, which complicates the use of such software, owing to the fact that (a) student devices have differing configurations (e.g., Windows vs MacOS) and processing power, and (b) not all student devices are suitable for use with such software. Smartphones are near-ubiquitous devices, with smartphone ownership exceeding personal computer ownership, according to a recent survey.

As COVID-19 surged in Boston in March 2020, we worked to rapidly create a Palliative Care Compassion Unit (PCCU) to care for those dying of COVID-19 or non-COVID-19-related illnesses. The PCCU provided interdisciplinary end-of-life care, supported families, and enabled surge teams to focus on patients needing life-sustaining treatments. In this study, we describe the creation of the PCCU, including opportunities and challenges, in hopes of lending insight to other palliative care teams who may need to rapidly craft new care models during a crisis.","Drutchas, Alexis; Kavanaugh, Alison; Cina, Kristin; Rinehart, Todd; Krakauer, Eric L; Doyle, Kathleen; Davila, Carine; Byrne-Martelli, Sarah; Kamdar, Mihir",J. palliat. med,,366

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google Community Mobility Reports (CMR) provide the necessary data to explore community mobility further. Therefore, we aimed to examine the relationship between community mobility on COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta, Indonesia. MethodsWe utilized the mobility data from Google from February 15 to December 31, 2020. We explored several statistical models to estimate the COVID-19 dynamics in Jakarta. Model 1 was a Poisson Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Model 2 was a Negative Binomial Regression Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and Model 3 was a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). ResultsWe found that Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with some adjustments using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was the best fit model. It explained 52% of COVID-19 cases in Jakarta (R-Square: 0.52, p<0.05). All mobility variables were significant predictors of COVID-19 cases (p<0.05). More precisely, about 1% change in grocery and pharmacy would contribute to a 4.12% increase of the COVID-19 cases in Jakarta. Retails and recreations, workplaces, transit stations, and parks would result in 3.11%, 2.56%, 2.26%, and 1.93% of more COVID-19 cases, respectively. ConclusionOur study indicates that increased mobility contributes to increased COVID-19 cases. This finding will be beneficial to assist policymakers to have better outbreak management strategies, to anticipate increased COVID-19 cases in the future at certain public places and during seasonal events such as annual religious holidays or other long holidays in particular.","Nanda, Ratih Oktri; Nursetyo, Aldilas Achmad; Ramadona, Aditya Lia; Imron, Muhammad Ali; Fuad, Anis; Setyawan, Althaf; Ahmad, Riris Andono",,,366

327964,A Predictive Study of Resilience and Its Relationship with Academic and Work Dimensions during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BackgroundFor SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, the nasal epithelium is a key portal for infection. Therefore, the nose is an important target of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against these viruses. We developed a nasal spray (AM-301, a medical device marketed as Bentrio) to protect against infection by SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other viruses. Aims of the studyTo test the safety and efficacy of AM-301 against SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsAM-301 was tested on an in vitro 3D model of primary human nasal airway epithelium. Safety was assessed in assays for tight junction integrity, cytotoxicity and cilia beating frequency. Efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated in prophylaxis and infection mitigation assays. ResultsAM-301 did not have any detrimental effect on the nasal epithelium. Prophylactic treatment with AM-301 reduced viral titer significantly vs. controls over 4 days, reaching a maximum reduction of 99%. When treatment with AM-301 was started 24 or 30 h after infection, epithelia that received the formulation had a 12- or 14-fold lower titer than controls. ConclusionAM-301 was found to be safe in vitro, and it significantly decelerated viral titer growth in experimental models of prophylaxis and mitigation. Its physical (non-pharmaceutical) mechanism of action, safety and efficacy pave the way for further investigation of its possible use against a broad spectrum of viruses, allergens and pollutants.","Fais, Fabio; Juskeviciene, Reda; Francardo, Veronica; Mateos, Stéphanie; Constant, Samuel; Borelli, Massimo; Hohenfeld, Ilja P.; Meyer, Thomas",,,366

330607,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on people living with visual disability,2020,"Despite active antiretroviral therapy (ART), community-acquired bacterial pulmonary infections remain one of the most opportunistic infections in patients with HIV infection. Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare and serious complication of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) characterized by pulmonary consolidation with multiple small lung cavities and parenchymal necrosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a frequent pathogen of necrotizing acute CAP and data regarding its management is limited. Based on the severity of clinical presentation and presence of P. aeruginosa infection risk factors, broader empiric antibiotic therapy can be provided. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman with medical history of HIV diagnosed since 2012 on emtricitabine/tenofovir and raltegravir who presented to the urgency department due to non-productive cough of 3 days of evolution. Also reported dyspnea, fever, chills, fatigue and general malaise. She denied night sweats, hemoptysis, weight loss, and diarrhea. Vitals signs remarkable for tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension. Physical examination remarkable for respiratory distress, dry oral mucosa and diffuse bilateral rhonchi. ABG showed respiratory alkalosis accompanied with hypoxemia and elevated A-a gradient. CBC remarkable for leukocytosis with bandemia, monocytosis and lymphopenia with microcytic anemia and normal platelets. Inflammatory markers including CRP, ESR and fibrinogen were elevated. Coagulation was prolonged. Chemistry remarkable for hypotonic hypovolemic hyponatremia, moderate hypokalemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, hypoalbuminemia and very high alkaline phosphatase. SARS-COV 2 PCR was negative. Chest CT showed bilateral patchy densities, right consolidate and multiple cavitation at the right upper lung field. Patient was initially treated with lung protective mechanical ventilation, vasopressors and empiric broad spectrum antibiotics. Sputum culture grew pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other laboratories such as acid fast and influenza were negative. Blood culture was also positive for pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is a rare cause of necrotizing pneumonia. In the past, streptococcus pneumoniae caused 95% of CAP, however today is only detected in only 10-15% of inpatients cases in United States. Other etiologies for CAP include Haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis and less commonly P. Aeruginosa. P. Aeruginosa is responsible of 5-7% of cases of CAP in HIV patients. Blood cultures are positive in about 20 to 25% of inpatients with pneumococcal pneumonia but in fewer cases of pneumonia caused by H. influenzae or P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is associated with high mortality and poor prognosis in immunocompromised patients and septic shock. The aim of this case is to raise awareness of pseudomonas necrotizing pneumonia for early detection, adequate management and better outcomes.","Nieves-Ortiz, A.; Torres-Torres, G.; Fonseca Ferrer, V.; Hernandez-Moya, K.; Garcia Puebla, J.

This study addresses the apparently reasonable hypothesis that variants of these genes may modulate viral infectivity, making some individuals more vulnerable than others. Through whole-exome sequencing, the frequency of exonic variants of the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin genes was analyzed in relation to presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a familial multiple sclerosis cohort including 120 individuals from Madrid. The ACE2 gene showed a low level of polymorphism, and none variant was significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. These variants have previously been detected in Italy. While TMPRSS2 is highly polymorphic, the variants found do not coincide with those described in other studies, with the exception of rs75603675, which may be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The synonymous variants rs61735792 and rs61735794 showed a significant association with infection. Despite the limited number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, some variants, especially in TMPRSS2, may be associated with COVID-19.","Torre-Fuentes, Laura; Matías-Guiu, Jorge; Hernández-Lorenzo, Laura; Montero-Escribano, Paloma; Pytel, Vanesa; Porta-Etessam, Jesús; Gómez-Pinedo, Ulises; Matías-Guiu, Jordi A",J. med. virol,,366

In the present study presentation and outcome of patients with STEMI in the year 2020 were compared with the years before in a German registry that includes all patients hospitalized for acute STEMI in a region with approximately 1 million inhabitants. In the year 2020 726 patients with STEMI were registered compared with 10.226 patients in the years 2006 to 2019 (730 ± 57 patients per year). No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding age, gender and medical history of patients. However, in the year 2020 a significantly higher rate of patients admitted with cardiogenic shock (21.9% vs 14.2%, p <0.01) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) (14.3% vs 11.1%, p <0.01) was observed. The rate of patients with subacute myocardial infarction (14.3% vs 11.6%, p <0.05) was elevated in 2020. Hospital mortality increased by 52% from the years 2006 to 2019 (8.4%) to the year 2020 (12.8%, p <0.01). Only 4 patients (0.6%) with STEMI in the year 2020 had SARS-CoV-2 infection, none of those died in-hospital. In conclusion, in the year 2020 a highly significant increase of STEMI-patients admitted to hospital with advanced infarction and poor prognosis was observed. As the structure of the emergency network to treat patients with STEMI was unchanged during the study period, the most obvious reason for these changes was COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown and the fear of many people to contact medical staff during the pandemic.","Wienbergen, Harm; Retzlaff, Tina; Schmucker, Johannes; Marin, Luis Alberto Mata; Rühle, Stephan; Garstka, Daniela; Osteresch, Rico; Fach, Andreas; Hambrecht, Rainer",Am. j. cardiol,,366

331417,COVID-19 in Older Adults: A Series of 76 Patients Aged 85 Years and Older with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from initial COVID-19 vaccine trials; thus, data to guide vaccine decision-making are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in pregnant and lactating women compared to: (1) non-pregnant controls and (2) natural COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: 131 reproductive-age vaccine recipients (84 pregnant, 31 lactating, and 16 non-pregnant) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at two academic medical centers. Titers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and RBD IgG, IgA and IgM were quantified in participant sera (N=131) and breastmilk (N=31) at baseline, second vaccine dose, 2-6 weeks post second vaccine, and at delivery by Luminex. Umbilical cord sera (N=10) titers were assessed at delivery. Titers were compared to those of pregnant women 4-12 weeks from natural infection (N=37) by ELISA. A pseudovirus neutralization assay was used to quantify neutralizing antibody titers for the subset of women who delivered during the study period. Post-vaccination symptoms were assessed via questionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis tests and a mixed effects model, with correction for multiple comparisons, were used to assess differences between groups. RESULTS: Vaccine-induced antibody titers were equivalent in pregnant and lactating compared to non-pregnant women (median [IQR] 5.59 [4.68-5.89] pregnant, 5.74 [5.06-6.22] lactating, 5.62 [4.77-5.98] non-pregnant, p = 0.24). All titers were significantly higher than those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (p < 0.0001). Vaccine-generated antibodies were present in all umbilical cord blood and breastmilk samples. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in umbilical cord compared to maternal sera, although this finding did not achieve statistical significance (median [IQR] 104.7 [61.2-188.2] maternal sera, 52.3 [11.7-69.6] cord sera, p=0.05). The second vaccine dose (boost dose) increased SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, but not IgA, in maternal blood and breastmilk. No differences were noted in reactogenicity across the groups. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mRNA vaccines generated robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women, with immunogenicity and reactogenicity similar to that observed in non-pregnant women. Vaccine-induced immune responses were significantly greater than the response to natural infection. Immune transfer to neonates occurred via placenta and breastmilk.","Gray, Kathryn J; Bordt, Evan A; Atyeo, Caroline; Deriso, Elizabeth; Akinwunmi, Babatunde; Young, Nicola; Medina Baez, Aranxta; Shook, Lydia L; Cvrk, Dana; James, Kaitlyn; De Guzman, Rose; Brigida, Sara; Diouf, Khady; Goldfarb, Ilona; Bebell, Lisa M; Yonker, Lael M; Fasano, Alessio; Rabi, S Alireza; Elovitz, Michal A; Alter, Galit; Edlow, Andrea G",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,,366

We describe a nested RT-PCR assay (~1500 bps) to detect multiple nucleotide changes resulting in key spike protein mutations distinctive of the major known circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the three Variants of Concern (VOCs) 20I/501Y.V1 (United Kingdom), 20H/501Y.V2 (South Africa), and 20 J/501Y.V3 (Brazil), as well as the 20E.EU1 variant (Spain), the CAL.20C recently identified in California, and the mink-associated variant (GR, lineage B.1.1.298). Prior to application to field samples, the discriminatory potential of this PCR assay was explored using GISAID and Nextclade. To extend variant detection to challenging matrices such as sewage, where the amplification of long fragments is problematic, two short nested RT-PCR assays (~300 bps) were also designed, targeting portions of the region spanned by the long nested assay. The three newly-designed assays were then tested on field samples, including 31 clinical samples (7 fully-sequenced swab samples, and 24 uncharacterized ones) and 34 urban wastewater samples, some of which collected in areas where circulation of VOCs had been reported. The long assay successfully amplified 29 of the 31 swabs (93%), allowing the correct identification of variants 20I/501Y.V1 and 20E.EU1 present in the panel of previously characterized samples. The Spanish variant was detected in 14/24 of the uncharacterized samples as well. The sequences obtained using the short assays were consistent with those obtained with the long assay. Mutations characteristic of VOCs (UK and Brazilian variant) and of other variant (Spanish) were detected in sewage samples. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the presence of sequences harboring key mutations of 20I/501Y.V1 and 20 J/501Y.V3 in urban wastewaters, highlighting the potential contribution of wastewater surveillance to explore SARS-CoV-2 diversity. The developed nested RT-PCR assays can be used as an initial rapid screening test to select clinical samples containing mutations of interest. This can speed up diagnosis and optimize resources since it allows full genome sequencing to be done only on clinically relevant specimens. The assays can be also employed for a rapid and cost-effective detection of VOCs or other variants in sewage for the purposes of wastewater-based epidemiology. The approach proposed here can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 variant diversity, geographic distribution and impact worldwide.","La Rosa, G; Mancini, P; Bonanno Ferraro, G; Veneri, C; Iaconelli, M; Lucentini, L; Bonadonna, L; Brusaferro, S; Brandtner, D; Fasanella, A; Pace, L; Parisi, A; Galante, D; Suffredini, E",Water Res,,366

335075,Rapid Implementation of Telemedicine for Hcv Management of Pwid during Covid Pandemic,2020,"Porcine enteric coronaviruses (CoVs) cause highly contagious enteric diarrhea in suckling piglets. These COV infections are characterized by clinical signs of vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high morbidity and mortality, resulting in significant economic losses and tremendous threats to the pig farming industry worldwide. Because the clinical manifestations of pigs infected by different CoVs are similar, it is difficult to differentiate between the specific pathogens. Effective high-throughput detection methods are powerful tools used in the prevention and control of diseases. The immune system of piglets is not well developed, so serological methods to detect antibodies against these viruses are not suitable for rapid and early detection. This paper reviews various PCR-based methods used for the rapid and efficient detection of these pathogenic CoVs in swine intestines. KEY POINTS: 1. Swine enteric coronaviruses (CoVs) emerged and reemerged in past years. 2. Enteric CoVs infect pigs at all ages with high mortality rate in suckling pigs. 3. Rapid and efficient detection methods are needed and critical for diagnosis.","Fu, Yuguang; Li, Baoyu; Liu, Guangliang",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,366

To achieve a reliable estimation in a wide area such as an apartment, multiple RGBD cameras are frequently used. Firstly, these setups are relatively expensive. Secondly, they seldom perform an effective data fusion using the multiple camera sources at an early stage of the processing pipeline. Occlusions and partial views make this second point very relevant in these scenarios. The proposal presented in this paper makes use of graph neural networks to merge the information acquired from multiple camera sources, achieving a mean absolute error below 125 mm for the location and 10 degrees for the orientation using low-resolution RGB images. The experiments, conducted in an apartment with three cameras, benchmarked two different graph neural network implementations and a third architecture based on fully connected layers.

STUDY DESIGN: A dynamic, discrete time, stochastic individual-based model was developed to simulate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. METHODS: The model was fitted to the observed trends in COVID-19 deaths and intensive care unit (ICU) bed use in Greece. RESULTS: If Greece had not implemented social distancing interventions, the healthcare system would have been overwhelmed between March 30 and April 4. The combined social distancing interventions and increase in ICU beds averted 4360 (95% credible interval: 3050, 5700) deaths and prevented the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed.

This study explores neurologists' perceptions of telephone and videophone remote consultations. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with neurologists and a GP with a specialist interest (n = 22). Interviews were conducted remotely via Zoom®, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged: 'unknown unknowns (risks/uncertainties)', 'better service', 'challenges', and 'beyond the pandemic'. Thematic saturation was achieved by interview 19. Participants highlighted a number of benefits of remote consultations but over 80% also complained of a reduction in work satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The sudden introduction of tele-neurology is unlikely to be fully reversed when pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted. However, this study confirms tele-neurology cannot completely replace face-to-face consultations. Some patient groups and consultation types require direct contact. Moreover, significant administrative and infrastructural investment will be required to develop the full potential of tele-neurology. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Tele-medicine is capable of improving access and efficiency of specialist neurology services, but limited by lack of non-verbal communication and technical problems. It could enhance service provision with sufficient infrastructural and administrative investment, but may reduce neurologists' job statisfaction.","Courtney, Ellie; Blackburn, Daniel; Reuber, Markus",Patient educ. couns,,366

Treatments were arranged in a completely randomized block design with 12 treatments and two replicates in a factorial scheme (4 × 3) with four levels of N (0, 80, 160 or 320 kg ha-1 N) and three plant densities (9, 25, and 49 plant m-²). Higher number of tillers was observed in the treatment with 9 plants m-² and under higher levels of N, especially in the second and third generations. Still, the N influenced quadratically the appearance rate of basal and total tillers, which were also affected by plant density and interaction N × D. However, the appearance rate of aerial tiller was not influenced by factors evaluated. The mortality rate of total tiller was influenced quadratically by the nitrogen levels and plant densities. The mortality rate of basal tiller responded quadratically to plant density, whereas the mortality rate of aerial tiller increased linearly with fertilization. Pastures with low or intermediate densities fertilized with nitrogen, presented a more intense pattern of tiller renewal.","Gomes dos Santos Braz, Thiago; Miranda da Fonseca, Dilermando; Paiva de Freitas, Fabrício; Azevedo Martuscello, Janaina; Eduardo Rozalino Santos, Manoel; Vitória Santos, Márcia",Acta Sci.

Physicians from hospitals located in areas with different COVID-19 caseload levels, were invited to participate in a national e-survey between April and May 2020. Study participants were mainly emergency physicians, and anaesthesiologists, infectious disease consultants, and intensive care. The survey assessed participant's characteristics, factors potentially associated with resilience, and resilience using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (RISC-25), with higher scores indicative of greater resilience. Factors associated with the resilience score were assessed using a multivariable linear regression. Of 451 responding physicians involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, 442 were included (98%). Age was 36.1 ± 10.3 years and 51.8% were male; 63% worked in the emergency department (n = 282), 10.4% in anesthesiology (n = 46), 9.9% in infectious disease department (n = 44), 4.8% in intensive care unit (n = 21) or other specialties (n = 49). The median RISC-25 score was at 69 (IQR 62-75). Factors associated with higher RISC scores were anesthesia as a specialty, parenthood, no previous history of anxiety or depression and nor increased anxiety. To conclude, this study is the first to characterize levels of resilience among physicians involved in COVID-19 unit. Our data points to certain protective characteristics and some detrimental factors, such as anxiety or depression, that could be amenable to remediating or preventing strategies to promote resilience and support caregivers in a pandemic.","Douillet, D; Caillaud, A; Riou, J; Miroux, P; Thibaud, E; Noizet, M; Oberlin, M; Léger, M; Mahieu, R; Riquin, E; Javaudin, F; Morin, F; Moumneh, T; Savary, D; Roy, P-M; Hugli, O",Transl Psychiatry,,366

BAPN-F is a potent lathyrogen, which inhibits collagen cross-linking by irreversibly blocking the lysil oxidase enzyme, permitting more time for parallel reorientation of the repair tissue. Sixteen two-year old Arabian horses without any leg problems were selected for this study and divided into two groups: Group 1(rest) and Group 2 (exercise). Tendinitis was induced by injecting collagenase (0.5 ml; 2.5 mg/ml) on the superficial flexor tendon of both forelimbs. Twenty days after tendinitis was induced, intra1esiona1therapy was done by injecting BAPN-F (3 ml; 0.8 mg/ml) in one of the legs every other day until five treatments were completed. The contralatera1 limb received an injection of sa1ine at the same time period. The hea1ing process was monitored by clinical and sonographic examinations during the whole experiment. Results obtained indicate that beta-aminopropionitrile fumarate coupled with control1edloading improved scar remodeling and maturation of the tendon scarring.","Liz Garcia Alves, Ana; Aparecida Marchesan Rodrigues, Maria; Secorun Borges, Alexandre; Luiz de Mello Nicoletti, José; Thomassian, Armen; Alberto Hussni, Carlos",R.

Aims and objectives: This article draws attention to social circumstances of people with disabilities often unacknowledged in research evidence: hidden figures of disability. Methods: Selected results from the Canadian Survey on Disability are examined with a focus on working-age youth and adults (aged 15 to 64) with a range of disabilities. Findings: Five figures of disability and corresponding conceptual models are identified. These hidden figures of disability are the uncounted, those with needs unsupported, youth in multiple transitions, potential workers, and what may be called 'the fearful'. Several models of disability are identified intersecting with the evidence. These are the absent citizen, biomedical model and charitable model, social and economic integration model, human rights and full citizenship, and psycho-emotional model of affective disablism and ableism. Discussion: Hidden figures of disability are more than statistical tests and texts;more than calculations derived from quantitative research where people become a data point.The function of drawing hidden figures is to disclose and describe the bodily experiences of people with disabilities in their social positions and structural contexts. Conclusion: We need to see the production of evidence for policy not as painting a portrait but as portraits in the plural, and appreciate not only what is in the frame but also what faces and forms of knowledge get glossed over or brushed aside.","Prince, M.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 78 questions investigating social determinants of health, mood changes, symptoms of anxiety, increase in sleep disorders and unusual repetitive movements was offered to parents living in Italy with children &#8804;18 years; including families of children with disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, chronic diseases, and specific learning disabilities. The survey was conducted on the Qualtrics platform 6 months after the beginning of the pandemic and distributed in hospitals and paediatricians' waiting rooms as well as through social networks. The primary outcomes were the increase in sleep disorders among children and adolescents. Possible risk factors were investigated through multivariable regression. RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred ten volunteer parents responded to the questions concerning mood changes, sleep disorders and unusual repetitive movements, and were included in the present study. The majority were female (91.8%) and Italian (97.0%). 72.7% answered that their children had become more nervous, worried, or sad (80.2% in children with learning disabilities); 77.6% reported feelings of loneliness and 69.3% more difficulties in children falling asleep, 30.2% in staying asleep, and 18.7% an increase in nightmares and/or sleep terrors. Statistical analysis identified socioeconomic status, parent's job loss, food insecurity, family attitude toward the pandemic, and children's mood swing, feelings of loneliness, or missing outdoor activities, as major risk factors for sleep disorders. CONCLUSION: The first Covid-19 lockdown impacted children's and adolescents' health through an increase in sleep disorders. In the following phases of the pandemic, this evidence may be useful to investigate and treat these disorders as well as make decisions about containment health policies concerning this age group.","Dondi, Arianna; Fetta, Anna; Lenzi, Jacopo; Morigi, Francesca; Candela, Egidio; Rocca, Alessandro; Cordelli, Duccio Maria; Lanari, Marcello",Ital J Pediatr,,366

In this work, we evaluate whether disruptions related to Covid-19 have affected new and existing patients' access to pharmacological therapies without interruption. We do so by performing a retrospective analysis on a dataset of 9.4 billion US prescription drug claims from 252 million patients from May, 2019 through August, 2020 (about 93% of prescriptions dispensed within those months). Using fixed effect (conditional likelihood) linear models, we evaluate continuity of care, how many days of supply patients received, and the likelihood of discontinuing therapy for drugs from classes with significant population health impacts. Findings indicate that more prescriptions were filled in March 2020 than in any prior month, followed by a significant drop in monthly dispensing. Compared to the pre-Covid era, a patient's likelihood of discontinuing some medications increased after the spread of Covid: norgestrel-ethinyl estradiol (hormonal contraceptive) discontinuation increased 0.62% (95% CI: 0.59% to 0.65%, p<0.001); dexmethylphenidate HCL (ADHD stimulant treatment) discontinuation increased 2.84% (95% CI: 2.79% to 2.89%, p<0.001); escitalopram oxalate (SSRI antidepressant) discontinuation increased 0.57% (95% CI: 0.561% to 0.578%, p<0.001); and haloperidol (antipsychotic) discontinuation increased 1.49% (95% CI: 1.41% to 1.57%, p<0.001). In contrast, the likelihood of discontinuing tacrolimus (immunosuppressant) decreased 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12% to 0.19%, p<0.001). The likelihood of discontinuing buprenorphine/naloxone (opioid addiction therapy) decreased 0.59% (95% CI: 0.55% to 0.62% decrease, p<0.001). We also observe a notable decline in new patients accessing these latter two therapies. Most US patients were able to access chronic medications during the early months of Covid-19, but still were more likely to discontinue their therapies than in previous months. Further, fewer than normal new patients started taking medications that may be vital to their care. Providers would do well to inquire about adherence and provide prompt, nonjudgmental, re-initiation of medications. From a policy perspective, opioid management programs seem to demonstrate a robust ability to manage existing patients in spite of disruption.","Clement, Jeffrey; Jacobi, Maura; Greenwood, Brad N",PLoS One,,366

The aim of this study was to describe population level SARS-CoV-2 upper respiratory tract (URT) viral load dynamics by stratifying positivity rates and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) values of URT samples from COVID-19 cases by days since symptom onset, and to explore utility of Ct values in determining length of time post-infection and thus potential infectivity. Of 123,124 samples tested for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, 579 samples (407 positive and 172 negative) from 368 symptomatic non-hospitalised individuals with PCR-confirmed infection were included. Sample positivity rate was 61.5% (8/13) for pre-symptomatic samples, rising to 93.2% (317/340) for samples collected during the purported symptomatic infectious period (days 0-10 post-symptom onset), and dropping to 36.3% (82/226) for post-infectious period samples (day 11 onwards). URT viral load peaked shortly after symptom onset, with median Ct values ranging 20.00-29.99 until 15 days post-symptom onset, and >30.00 after this time. Of samples with a Ct value of <20.00, 96.1% were collected during the symptomatic infectious period. However, of samples with a Ct value &#8805;30.00 and &#8805;35.00, 46.9% and 18.5%, respectively, were also collected during the symptomatic infectious period. The findings of this study indicate that at or soon after symptom onset represents the optimum time to test for SARS-CoV-2 in the URT, with median Ct values suggesting the useful testing window extends until around 15 days post-symptom onset. In asymptomatic individuals or those with unknown dates of symptom onset, Ct values <20.00 imply recent onset/potential infectivity, but Ct values &#8805;30.00 or &#8805;35.00 do not exclude recent onset/potential infectivity. Individual sample Ct values should not be used as an absolute marker of length of time post-infection or to exclude infectivity where date of symptom onset is unavailable.","Fox-Lewis, Andrew; Fox-Lewis, Shivani; Beaumont, Jenna; Drinkovic, Dragana; Harrower, Jay; Howe, Kevin; Jackson, Catherine; Rahnama, Fahimeh; Shilton, Blair; Qiao, Helen; Smith, Kevin K; Morpeth, Susan C; Taylor, Susan; Blakiston, Matthew; Roberts, Sally; McAuliffe, Gary",Pathology,,366

METHODS: A total of 107 patients admitted to a CTC were included as the study population, and their mental health problems including depression (patient health questionnaire-9), anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder scale-7), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist-5) and somatic symptoms (by patient health questionnaire-15) were evaluated every week during their stay. The stigma related to COVID-19 infection was evaluated with an adjusted version of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) stigma scale. RESULTS: During the first week of isolation, the prevalence of more-than-moderate depression was 24.3%, more-than-moderate anxiety was 14.9%, more-than-moderate somatic symptoms was 36.5% and possible PTSD was 5.6% of total population. For depression and anxiety, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors. For PTSD, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection as well as total duration of isolation were found to be significant risk factors. Prevalence of depression, anxiety and possible PTSD remained similar across the four weeks of observations, though the prevalence of severe depression, increased after four weeks of stay. Somatic symptoms seemed to decrease during their stay. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that social mitigation of COVID-19 related stigma, as well as care of patients with pre-existing mental health problems are important mental health measures during this crisis period. It is also important that clinical guidelines and public health policies be well balanced over the protection of the public and those quarantined to minimize the negative psychosocial consequences from isolation of the patients.","Kang, EunKyo; Lee, Sun Young; Kim, Min Sun; Jung, Hyemin; Kim, Kyae Hyung; Kim, Kyoung Nam; Park, Hye Yoon; Lee, Yu Jin; Cho, Belong; Sohn, Jee Hoon",J Korean Med Sci,,366

DESIGN: The long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long COVID. Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and symptoms extending over three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-COVID functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The ""patient acceptable symptomatic state"" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method. RESULTS: Validation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed COVID-19, 79% female, and 12.5% hospitalized for COVID-19). The long COVID ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and 0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33). CONCLUSIONS: The long covid ST and IT tools, constructed from patients' lived experiences, provide the first validated and reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.","Tran, Viet-Thi; Riveros, Caroline; Clepier, Bérangère; Desvarieux, Moïse; Collet, Camille; Yordanov, Youri; Ravaud, Philippe",Clin. infect. dis,,366

SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Associated Coronavirus) is a member of the coronavirus family, so its study is useful for relevant virus data research. In this work, we conduct a proposed approach that is non-medical/clinical, generate graphs from five features of the SARS outbreak data in five countries and regions, and offer insights from a visual analysis perspective. The results show that prevention measures such as quarantine are the most common control policies used, and areas with strict measures did have fewer peak period days; for instance, Hong Kong handled the outbreak better than other areas. Data conflict issues found with this approach are discussed as well. Visual analysis is also proved to be a useful technique to present the SARS outbreak data at this stage; furthermore, we are proceeding to apply a similar methodology with more features to future COVID-19 research from a visual analysis perfective.","Hua, Jie; Wang, Guohua; Huang, Maolin; Hua, Shuyang; Yang, Shuanghe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366
347244,Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on posttraumatic stress in patients with psychiatric illness,2021,"AimsSerious mental illness (SMI) is now accepted as a significant risk factor for contracting COVID-19, increasing the rates of adverse outcomes, including hospitalisation and mortality. Risk assessments are the cornerstone of protecting vulnerable groups of individuals. The QCovid risk calculator is a newly developed tool to predict the risk of death or hospitalisation from COVID-19. It has not been applied in SMI populations. We aimed to use the QCovid risk calculator in an inpatient rehabilitation setting to identify and mitigate risk for people with SMI with personalised COVID-19 prevention plans.MethodClinical and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained for 22 inpatients. Firstly, the QCovid risk calculator was used to ascertain the absolute and relative risks to patients (Odds Ratios (OR) of mortality and/or hospitalisation) from COVID-19. Patients were stratified as high (OR &gt; 10), moderate (OR 5-10) and low (OR &lt; 5) risk. Secondly, personalised COVID-19 prevention plans were coproduced by patients and clinicians addressing 1) risk factors contributing to increased QCovid risk, 2) patient's personal goals, concerns, and preferences 3) maximizing patient engagement in COVID-19 infection prevention strategies. Finally, uptake of personalised COVID-19 prevention plans was evaluated after four weeks using a customised patient feedback questionnaire.ResultOf the 22 inpatients (68% male), 14 patients (64%) had schizophrenia and 3 patients (14%) had schizoaffective disorder as primary diagnosis. 13 (59%) patients were prescribed clozapine. QCovid risk stratification showed 10% of patients as high risk, 29% as moderate risk, and 61% as low risk. Apart from SMI in all 22 inpatients, the most common QCovid risk factors were increased body mass index (64%, n = 14;23% overweight and 41% obese), diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 (27%, n = 6) and epilepsy (n = 4, 18%). 19 of the 22 patients provided feedback on their personalised COVID-19 prevention plans. Most patients (79%) felt they had “contributed significantly” to their COVID-19 prevention plans, and their individual goals and concerns were valued. 79% were “satisfied” with their COVID-19 prevention plans. Subjective perception of safety from COVID-19 was high, with 95% of patients feeling “safe and well-protected from COVID-19”.ConclusionComprehensive assessment of COVID-19 risks in vulnerable groups enables personalised risk mitigation, both at an individual and service level. Our findings show the importance of applying current knowledge to protect vulnerable patients with SMI through personalised prevention plans. This approach can be scaled up to understand risks for services and teams, while allowing clinicians to adapt their use for individualised COVID-19 prevention.","Patel, Jinal Fraser Scott Mohan Rajesh",BJPsych Open,,366

An online cross-sectional survey was carried out about one month (April 20-22, 2020) after the Israeli government reinforced the severe social distancing regulations, among a convenience sample of 315 participants (60% women) with chronic conditions (27% metabolic, 17% cardiovascular, 21% cancer/autoimmune, 18% orthopedic/pain, 12% mental-health). Results suggested that about half of the participants reported a decline in physical or mental SRH, and as many as two-thirds reported feeling lonely. A significant deterioration in health behaviors was reported, including a decrease in vegetable consumption (p = 0.008) and physical activity (p < 0.001), an increase in time spent on social media (p < 0.001), and a perception among about half of the participants that they were eating more than before. Ordinal regression suggested that a decline in general SRH was linked with female gender (p = 0.016), lack of higher education (p = 0.015), crowded housing conditions (p = 0.001), longer illness duration (p = 0.010), and loneliness (p = 0.008). Findings highlight the important role of loneliness in SRH during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Future studies are warranted to clarify the long-term effects of social-distancing and loneliness on people with chronic illnesses.","Elran-Barak, Roni; Mozeikov, Maya",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366

The model, which was rigorously analysed and parametrized using COVID-19 data published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), was used to assess the community-wide impact of various control and mitigation strategies in some jurisdictions within Nigeria (notably the states of Kano and Lagos, and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja). Numerical simulations of the model showed that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled in Nigeria using moderate levels of social-distancing strategy in the jurisdictions and in the entire nation. Although the use of face masks in public can significantly reduce COVID-19 in Nigeria, its use, as a sole intervention strategy, may fail to lead to a substantial reduction in disease burden. Such substantial reduction is feasible in the jurisdictions (and the entire Nigerian nation) if the public face mask use strategy is complemented with a social-distancing strategy. The community lockdown measures implemented in Nigeria on March 30, 2020 need to be maintained for at least three to four months to lead to the effective containment of COVID-19 outbreaks in the country. Relaxing, or fully lifting, the lockdown measures sooner, in an effort to re-open the economy or the country, may trigger a deadly second wave of the pandemic.","Iboi, Enahoro A; Sharomi, Oluwaseun; Ngonghala, Calistus N; Gumel, Abba B",Math Biosci Eng,,366

The virus has been labelled as a pandemic by the WHO. Virologists have found that this virus outbreak is similar to past outbreaks of viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome that caused severe respiratory syndrome and transmitted rapidly in humans. These single stranded RNA viruses come under the genera of ß-coronaviruses which ultimately infect lungs and respiratory tract.

COVID-19 has the potential to decimate these already strained surgical healthcare services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialised care for patients. The objective of this broad evidence synthesis is to identify and summarise the available literature regarding the efficacy of different personal protective equipment (PPE) in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in health personnel caring for patients undergoing trauma surgery in low-resource environments. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the L·OVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram. This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of experimental and quasi-experimental studies, as well as individual studies of such designs, evaluating the effect of different PPE on the risk of COVID-19 infection in HCWs involved in emergency trauma surgery. Critical appraisal of eligible studies for methodological quality will be conducted. Data will be extracted using the standardised data extraction tool in Covidence. Studies will, when possible, be pooled in a statistical meta-analysis using JBI SUMARI.

355780,Causes and consequences of fever during pregnancy: A retrospective study in a gynaecological emergency department,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Pooled testing is a potentially efficient alternative strategy for COVID-19 testing in congregate settings. We evaluated the utility and cost-savings of pooled testing based on imperfect test performance and potential dilution effect due to pooling and created a practical calculator for online use. METHODS: We developed a 2-stage pooled testing model accounting for dilution. The model was applied to hypothetical scenarios of 100 specimens collected during a one-week time-horizon cycle for varying levels of COVID-19 prevalence and test sensitivity and specificity, and to 338 skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in Los Angeles County (Los Angeles) (data collected and analyzed in 2020). RESULTS: Optimal pool sizes ranged from 1 to 12 in instances where there is a least one case in the batch of specimens. 40% of Los Angeles SNFs had more than one case triggering a response-testing strategy. The median number (minimum; maximum) of tests performed per facility were 56 (14; 356) for a pool size of 4, 64 (13; 429) for a pool size of 10, and 52 (11; 352) for an optimal pool size strategy among response-testing facilities. The median costs of tests in response-testing facilities were $8250 ($1100; $46,100), $6000 ($1340; $37,700), $6820 ($1260; $43,540), and $5960 ($1100; $37,380) when adopting individual testing, a pooled testing strategy using pool sizes of 4, 10, and optimal pool size, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled testing is an efficient strategy for congregate settings with a low prevalence of COVID-19. Dilution as a result of pooling can lead to erroneous false-negative results.","Nianogo, Roch A; Emeruwa, I Obi; Gounder, Prabhu; Manuel, Vladimir; Anderson, Nathaniel W; Kuo, Tony; Inkelas, Moira; Arah, Onyebuchi A",J. med. virol,,366

Reply to Br J Anaesth 2021; 126: e101-2,2021,"The Corona pandemic poses major demands for long-term care, which might have impacted the intention to quit the profession among managers of long-term care facilities. We used cross-sectional data of an online survey of long-term care managers from outpatient and inpatient nursing and palliative care facilities surveyed in April 2020 (survey cycle one; n = 532) and between December 2020 and January 2021 (survey cycle two; n = 301). The results show a significant association between the perceived pandemic-specific and general demands and the intention to leave the profession. This association was significantly stronger for general demands in survey cycle two compared with survey cycle one. The results highlight the pandemic's immediate impact on long-term care. In view of the increasing number of people in need of care and the already existing scarcity of specialized nursing staff, the results highlight the need for initiatives to ensure the provision of long-term care, also and especially in such times of crisis.","Pförtner, Timo-Kolja; Pfaff, Holger; Hower, Kira Isabel",J. public health (Oxf),,366

Surface-type chondromyxoid fibroma, however, remains an extremely rare occurrence. We present a case of a 55-year-old woman, who experienced right arm pain for 5 years. After unsuccessful treatment for presumed thoracic outlet syndrome, MRI revealed a large mass abutting the anteromedial cortex of the distal humeral diaphysis in a subperiosteal location. Further characterization was made with radiography, CT, and bone scan, which were followed by ultrasound-guided biopsy. Although histopathologic features were suggestive of chondromyxoid fibroma, the diagnosis remained somewhat uncertain initially due to the very unusual location involving the diaphysis of the humerus. Surgical resection was performed, and subsequent histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma. Despite being a rare entity, surface-type chondromyxoid fibroma would need to be considered in the differential when dealing with expansile surface diaphyseal lesions.","Delorme, Jean-Philippe; Purgina, Bibianna; Jibri, Zaid",Skelet. radiol,,366

360542,Impact of Quarantine During COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality of Life of Patients with Allergic Conjunctivitis,2020,"Besides maintaining health precautions, vaccination has been the only prevention from SARS-CoV-2, though no clinically proved 100% effective vaccine has been developed till date. At this stage, to withhold the debris of this pandemic, experts need to know the impact of the vaccine efficacy rate's threshold and how long this pandemic may extent with vaccines that have different efficacy rates. In this article, a mathematical model study has been done on the importance of vaccination and vaccine efficiency rate during an ongoing pandemic. We simulated a five compartment mathematical model to analyze the pandemic scenario in both California, and whole U.S. We considered four vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson and Johnson, which are being used rigorously to control the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition with two special cases: a vaccine with 100% efficacy rate and no vaccine under use. Both the infection and death rates are very high in California. Our model suggests that the pandemic situation in California will be under control in the last quartile of the year 2023 if frequent vaccination is continued with the Pfizer vaccine. During this time, six waves will happen from the beginning of the immunization where the case fatality and recovery rates will be 1.697% and 98.30%, respectively. However, according to the considered model, this period might be extended to the mid of 2024 when vaccines with lower efficacy rates are used. The more effective a vaccine, the less people suffer from this malign infection. Although specific groups of people get prioritized initially, mass vaccination is needed to control the spread of the disease.","Mahmud, Md. Shahriar; Kamrujjaman, Md.; Adan, Md.

To address this issue, domain generalization methods have been proposed, which however usually use static convolutions and are less flexible. In this paper, we propose a multi-source domain generalization model, namely domain and content adaptive convolution (DCAC), for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we design the domain adaptive convolution (DAC) module and content adaptive convolution (CAC) module and incorporate both into an encoder-decoder backbone. In the DAC module, a dynamic convolutional head is conditioned on the predicted domain code of the input to make our model adapt to the unseen target domain. In the CAC module, a dynamic convolutional head is conditioned on the global image features to make our model adapt to the test image. We evaluated the DCAC model against the baseline and four state-of-the-art domain generalization methods on the prostate segmentation, COVID-19 lesion segmentation, and optic cup/optic disc segmentation tasks. Our results indicate that the proposed DCAC model outperforms all competing methods on each segmentation task, and also demonstrate the effectiveness of the DAC and CAC modules.","Hu, Shishuai; Liao, Zehui; Zhang, Jianpeng; Xia, Yong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05676v1.pdf,366

365330,Surgical activity in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide observational cohort study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Reporting of COVID-19 cases, deaths and testing has often lacked context for appropriate assessment of disease burden within risk groups. The research considers how routine surveillance data might provide initial insights and identify risk factors, setting COVID-19 deaths early in the pandemic into context. This will facilitate the understanding of wider consequences of a pandemic from the earliest stage, reducing fear, aiding in accurately assessing disease burden and ensuring appropriate disease mitigation. SETTING: UK, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: The study is a secondary analysis of routine, public domain, surveillance data and information from Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Health Service (NHS) 111 and Public Health England (PHE) on deaths and disease. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Our principal focus is ONS data on deaths mentioning COVID-19 on the death certificate. We also consider information provided in NHS 111 and PHE data summaries. RESULTS: Deaths with COVID-19 significantly contributed to, yet do not entirely explain, abnormally elevated all-cause mortality in the UK from weeks 12-18 of 2020. Early in the UK epidemic, COVID-19 was the greatest threat to those with underlying illness, rarely endangering people aged under 40 years. COVID-19-related death rates differed by region, possibly reflecting underlying population structure. Risk of COVID-19-related death was greater for healthcare and social care staff and black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals, having allowed for documented risk factors. CONCLUSION: Early contextualisation of public health data is critical to recognising who gets sick, when and why. Understanding at-risk groups facilitates a targeted response considering indirect consequences of society's reaction to a pandemic alongside disease-related impacts. COVID-19-related deaths mainly mirror historical patterns, and excess non-COVID-19-related deaths partly reflect reduced access to and uptake of healthcare during lockdown. Future outbreak response will improve through better understanding of connectivity between disease monitoring systems to aid interpretation of disease risk patterns, facilitating nuanced mitigation measures.","Clough, Helen E; McIntyre, K Marie; Patterson, Grace E; Harris, John P; Rushton, Jonathan",BMJ Open,,366
365386,"Partial home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, physical function, and physical activity in patients with symptomatic lower extremity peripheral artery disease",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 in Italy had its first epidemic manifestations on January 31, 2020. The socio-sanitary rules imposed by the government concerned the social distance and management of intimate relationships, the sense of individual responsibility toward public health. Physical distancing and housing isolation have produced new representations of intrafamily, generational, neighborhood, community responsibility, bringing out a new ""medicalized dimension"" of society. In light of this contextual framework, the research aims are to analyze how: the perception of individual responsibility for public and familial health and physical distancing has redrawn the relation between subjects-family-community; the State's technical-health intervention has reformulated the idea of social closeness, but also how the pandemic fear and social confinement has re-evaluated a desire for community, neighborhood, proximity; during the lockdown families, friends, neighbors have reconstructed feelings of closeness and forms of belonging. The methodology used is quanti-qualitative and involved 300 women through an online questionnaire. The data collected highlight how the house during the lockdown is perceived as a safe place and how women implement both the recommendations and the behaviors aimed at preventing contagion, but also ways that allow coping with the situation from a perspective of well-being. Furthermore, the data show how the dimension of distancing has loosened the relational dimension outside the family unit, with a greater distancing compared to pre-pandemic data. However, the majority of women report that they have joined solidarity initiatives, demonstrating that they want to maintain ties and participate actively in community life.","Parisi, Rosa; Lagomarsino, Francesca; Rania, Nadia; Coppola, Ilaria",Front Public Health,,366

In this context, we aimed to determine the outcome of integrated therapy for COVID-19 using KSK in virologic clearance and length of hospital stay. Methods: It was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study. We included the COVID-19 patients admitted to SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Chennai, during May-June 2020.The KSK was administered along with the standard of care for all the patients. We collected demographic, clinical data and laboratory parameters data and were presented as frequencies and proportions. Results: We collected 204 COVID-19 positive patients' data. The mean (SD) age was 39.5 (13.4) years with a range of 13-79. Majority of the patients were male (n=157; 77%), 28% (n=58) had any co-morbidities and 61% (n=131) were with mild symptoms. Fever (n=57;27.9%) and cough (n=53; 25.9%) were the commonly reported symptoms. Paracetamol (n=135; 66.7%) and Zincovit (n=197, 96.6%) were the commonly administered medicines along with KSK. About 74% of asymptomatic (n=54) and 65% of mild symptomatic (n=85) patients turned negative for COVID-19 in RT-PCR within 4-7 days. There was a significant difference in the blood parameters (p<0.05) after the integrated treatment. Conclusion: The use of KSK with standard care of treatment in COVID-19 treatment had notable results in the duration taken for virologic clearance, thereby reducing the length of hospital stay and improvement in laboratory parameters.","Meenakumari, Ramaswamy; Thangaraj, Karuppiah; Sundaram, Arunachalam; Sundaram, Malayappan Meenakshi; Shanmugapriya, Ponnappan; Mariappan, Andi; George, Melvin; Suba, Venkatesan; Rajalakshmi, Elumalai; Sendhilkumar, Muthappan",,,366

Autopsy identified evidence of disseminated tuberculosis (TB) as well as histopathological findings similar to those described in recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 infections, including diffuse microthrombosis. TB remains a serious public health threat in hyperendemic regions like sub-Saharan Africa, and is often diagnosed late in infants. In addition to raising the question of additive/synergistic pathophysiology and/or immune reconstitution, this case of coinfection also highlights the importance of leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic response to strengthen efforts for TB prevention, screening and detection.","Mulale, Unami Koolebogile; Kashamba, Thanolo; Strysko, Jonathan; Kyokunda, Lynnette Tumwine",BMJ case reports,,366

We share feedback from our providers on our processes and offer specific recommendations for systems experiencing a similar influx in the current and future pandemics. METHODS: To assess the experiences and perceived readiness of these physicians (n = 183), we distributed a 32-item survey between March and June of 2020. Thematic analyses and response rates were examined to develop results. RESULTS: Responses highlighted varying experiences and attitudes of our frontline physicians during an emerging pandemic. Thematic analyses revealed a series of lessons learned, including the need to (1) provide orientations, (2) clarify roles/workflow, (3) balance team workload, (4) keep teams updated on evolving policies, (5) make team members feel valued, and (6) ensure they have necessary tools available. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons from our deployment and assessment are scalable at other institutions.","Hauck, Kevin D; Hochman, Katherine A; Pochapin, Mark B; Zabar, Sondra R; Wilhite, Jeffrey A; Glynn, Gretchen; Bosworth, Brian P",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,366
369724,"Posttraumatic stress disorder in time of COVID-19: Trauma or not trauma, is that the question?",2021,"There is a need to evaluate and minimise the risk of novel coronavirus infections at mass gathering events, such as sports. In particular, to consider how to hold mass gathering events, it is important to clarify how the local infection prevalence, the number of spectators, the capacity proportion, and the implementation of preventions affect the infection risk. In this study, we used an environmental exposure model to analyse the relationship between infection risk and infection prevalence, the number of spectators, and the capacity proportion at mass gathering events in football and baseball games. In addition to assessing risk reduction through the implementation of various preventive measures, we assessed how face-mask-wearing proportion affects infection risk. Furthermore, the model was applied to estimate the number of infectors who entered the stadium and the number of newly infected individuals, and to compare them with actual reported cases. The model analysis revealed an 86%-95% reduction in the infection risk due to the implementation of face-mask wearing and hand washing. Among the individual measures, face-mask wearing was particularly effective, and the infection risk increased as the face-mask-wearing proportion decreased. A linear relationship was observed between infection risk at mass gathering events and the infection prevalence. Furthermore, the number of newly infected individuals was also dependent on the number of spectators and the capacity proportion independent of the infection prevalence, confirming the importance of considering spectator capacity in infection risk management. These results highlight that it is beneficial for organisers to ensure prevention compliance and to mitigate or limit the number of spectators according to the prevalence of local infection. Both the estimated and reported numbers of newly infected individuals after the events were small, below 10 per 3-4 million spectators, despite a small gap between these numbers.","Yasutaka, Tetsuo; Murakami, Michio; Iwasaki, Yuichi; Naito, Wataru; Onishi, Masaki; Fujita, Tsukasa; Imoto, Seiya",,,366
370467,Urologic Emergency Care in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,2021,"Purpose: To ascertain ophthalmologist's perceptions about webinars as a method of continued medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, a 21-question survey was circulated using digital media platform to approximately 1400 ophthalmologists in India between 16th August 2020 to 31st August 2020. The questionnaire focussed on the quality and usefulness of webinars based on the Bloom's taxonomy. The responses (on 4- or 5-point Likert scale) were analyzed among three professional groups- ophthalmologists in-training, consultants in public sector, and private practitioners. Results: 393 ophthalmologists participated in the survey, with a response rate of 28%. The mean age was 34.6 ± 9.7 years, and males constituted 49.6% (199/393) of the respondents. Forty-seven percent of the respondents perceived the quality of webinars as good or excellent (185/393), 72.8% reported knowledge gain from webinars (286/393), and 63.9% felt that webinars are important in clinical practice and should continue post-COVID-19 pandemic (251/393), with distinct responses among the professional groups. The drawbacks perceived were overt number of webinars (371; 94.4%), confusion regarding which webinars to attend (313; 79.6%), repetition of the information (296; 75.3%), limited opportunity for participant interaction (146; 37.2%) and disparate weightage to the core disciplines of Ophthalmology. Conclusion: Most respondents had favorable perceptions of Ophthalmology webinars happening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is need for improvisation in the volume of webinars, target-audience-based delivery, and participant interaction to add value to this new dimension of teaching-learning.","Rana, Rimpi; Kumawat, Devesh; Sahay, Pranita; Gour, Neeraj; Patel, Siddharth; Samanta, Ramanuj; Singh, Anupam; Mittal, Sanjeev",Indian J Ophthalmol,,366
371282,Perspectives of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative study,2021,"In early March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic, and in late March 2020 partial lockdown was ordered by the São Paulo state government. The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in São Paulo - Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality stations in São Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to -77.3%), NO2 (up to -54.3%), and CO (up to -64.8%) concentrations were observed in the urban area during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean. By contrast, an increase of approximately 30% in ozone concentrations was observed in urban areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic, probably related to nitrogen monoxide decreases. Although the partial lockdown has contributed to a positive impact on air quality, it is important to take into account the negative impacts on social aspects, considering the deaths caused by COVID-19 and also the dramatic economic effects.","Nakada, Liane Yuri Kondo; Urban, Rodrigo Custodio",Sci Total Environ,,366

Most data derive from small retrospective series of patients transplanted years ago. We aimed to report a single-center case series of five consecutive patients in the early postoperative period of deceased-donor liver transplantation who developed nosocomial COVID-19. Two patients presented important respiratory discomfort and eventually died. One was 69 years old and had severe coronary disease. She rapidly worsened after COVID-19 diagnosis on 9th postoperative day. The other was 67 years old with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, who experienced prolonged postoperative course, complicated with cytomegalovirus infection and kidney failure. He was diagnosed on 36th postoperative day and remained on mechanical ventilation for 20 days, ultimately succumbing of secondary bacterial infection. The third, fourth, and fifth patients were diagnosed on 10th, 11th, and 18th postoperative day, respectively, and presented satisfactory clinical evolution. These last two patients were severely immunosuppressed, since one underwent steroid bolus for acute cellular rejection and another also used anti-thymocyte globulin for treating steroid-resistant rejection. Our novel experience highlights that COVID-19 may negatively impact the postoperative course, especially in elder and obese patients with comorbidities, and draws attention to COVID-19 nosocomial spread in the early postoperative period.","Waisberg, Daniel Reis; Abdala, Edson; Nacif, Lucas Souto; Haddad, Luciana Bertocco; Ducatti, Liliana; Santos, Vinicius Rocha; Gouveia, Larissa Nunes; Lazari, Carolina Santos; Martino, Rodrigo Bronze; Pinheiro, Rafael Soares; Arantes, Rubens Macedo; Terrabuio, Debora Raquel; Malbouisson, Luiz Marcelo; Galvao, Flavio Henrique; Andraus, Wellington; Carneiro-D039,; Albuquerque, Luiz Augusto",Transpl Infect Dis,,366
373619,Active Older Adults Keep Aerobic Capacity and Experience Small Reductions in Body Strength During Confinement Due to COVID-19 Outbreak,2021,"Network analysis provides powerful tools to learn about a variety of social systems. However, most analyses implicitly assume that the considered relational data is error-free, reliable and accurately reflects the system to be analysed. Especially if the network consists of multiple groups, this assumption conflicts with a range of systematic biases, measurement errors and other inaccuracies that are well documented in the literature. To investigate the effects of such errors we introduce a framework for simulating systematic bias in attributed networks. Our framework enables us to model erroneous edge observations that are driven by external node attributes or errors arising from the (hidden) network structure itself. We exemplify how systematic inaccuracies distort conclusions drawn from network analyses on the network analysis task of minority representations in degree-based rankings. By analysing synthetic and real networks with varying homophily levels and group sizes, we find that introducing systematic edge errors can result both in a strongly increased or decreased ranking of the minority. The observed effect depends both on the type of edge error considered and level of homophily in the system. We thus conclude that the implications of systematic bias in edge data depend on an interplay between network topology and type of systematic error. This emphasises the need for an error model framework as developed here, which provides a first step towards studying the effects of systematic edge-uncertainty for various network analysis tasks.","Stamm, Felix I.; Neuhauser, Leonie; Lemmerich, Florian; Schaub, Michael T.; Strohmaier, Markus",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11546v2.pdf,366

So far, it has caused 203,815,431 confirmed cases and 4,310,623 deaths in the world. We collected sequences from 150,659 COVID-19 patients. Based on the previous phylogenomic analysis, we found three major branches of the virus RNA genomic mutation located in Asia, America, and Europe which is consistent with other studies. We selected sites with high mutation frequencies from Asia, America, and Europe. There are only 13 common mutation sites in these three regions. It infers that the viral mutations are highly dependent on their location and different locations have specific mutations. Most mutations can lead to amino acid substitutions, which occurred in 3/5UTR, S/N/M protein, and ORF1ab/3a/8/10. Thus, the mutations may affect the pathogenesis of the virus. In addition, we applied an ARIMA model to predict the short-term frequency change of these top mutation sites during the spread of the disease. We tested a variety of settings of the ARIMA model to optimize the prediction effect of three patterns. This model can provide good help for predicting short-term mutation frequency changes.","Wei, Bomin; Sun, Yuzhe; Gong, Xiang",,,366

The StressTransfer network is designed to complement the existing seismic networks in three defined areas: the southern Upper Rhine graben, the Albstadt shear zone, and the central Molasse basin around the town of Bad Saulgau. The network monitors mainly the micro-seismic activity, and will allow us to study the related faults and the stress field. The network consists of 15 seismic broadband stations, five for each region that complement permanent and other temporary recording stations. The data-quality analysis proves an overall good recording quality, despite the problems due to the densely populated area. Recording stations located inside the Upper Rhine graben are characterized by a relatively high-noise level due to freeways and railways located nearby as well as sites on thick, partly unconsolidated fluvial sediments. The comparison of the I95 noise amplitude level at our recording stationswith the double P-wave onset amplitude of an exemplary M-L 1.0 earthquake in 12 km distance reveals the ability to detect even lower-magnitude events at most of the StressTransfer seismic stations. For six stations, it is difficult during daytime;at four stations, we are probably not able to detect comparable small events. From March to May 2020, we observe a reduction of the daily noise amplitude of 20%-30%, due to the severe restrictions related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, giving us the chance to search for really low-magnitude events. Our study demonstrates that a careful selection of recording sites allows to monitor faulting processes even in highly populated regions with unfavorable subsurface conditions. In addition, we record teleseismicwaveforms at the newlocations, to improve the resolution of deeper structures.","Mader, S.; Ritter, J. R. R.",Seismological Research Letters,,366

377044,A Midwest COVID-19 Cohort for the Evaluation of Multimorbidity and Adverse Outcomes from COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid changes in clinical service delivery across hospital systems nationally. Local realities and resources were key driving factors impacting workflow changes, including for pediatric consultation-liaison psychiatry service (PCLPS) providers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the early changes implemented by 22 PCLPSs from the United States and Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding similarities and differences in adaptations made to PCLPS care delivery can inform best practices and future models of care. METHODS: A 20-point survey relating to PCLPS changes during the COVID-19 pandemic was sent to professional listservs. Baseline hospital demographics, hospital and PCLPS workflow changes, and PCLPS experience were collected from March 20 to April 28, 2020, and from August 18 to September 10, 2020. Qualitative data were collected from responding sites. An exploratory thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the qualitative data that were not dependent on predetermined coding themes. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: Twenty-two academic hospitals in the United States and Canada responded to the survey, with an average of 303 beds/hospital. Most respondents (18/22) were children's hospitals. Despite differences in regional impact of COVID-19 and resource availability, there was significant overlap in respondent experiences. Restricted visitation to one caregiver, use of virtual rounding, ongoing trainee involvement, and an overall low number of COVID-positive pediatric patients were common. While there was variability in PCLPS care delivery occurring virtually versus in person, all respondents maintained some level of on-site presence. Technological limitations and pediatric provider preference led to increased on-site presence. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first multicenter study exploring pandemic-related PCLPS changes in North America. Findings of this study demonstrate that PCLPSs rapidly adapted to COVID-19 realities. Common themes emerged that may serve as a model for future practice. However, important gaps in understanding their effectiveness and acceptability need to be addressed. This multisite survey highlights the importance of establishing consensus through national professional organizations to inform provider and hospital practices.","Brahmbhatt, Khyati; Mournet, Annabelle M; Malas, Nasuh; DeSouza, Claire; Greenblatt, Jeanne; Afzal, Khalid I; Giles, Lisa L; Charoensook, Janet; Feuer, Vera; Raza, Haniya; Mooneyham, GenaLynne C; Pergjika, Alba; Schlesinger, Amanda; Chapman, Andrea; Strain, Angela; Gandhi, Bela; Johnson, Kyle; Mroczkowski, Megan M; Ibeziako, Patricia; Graham, Regina; Yoon, Yesie; Plioplys, Sigita; Fuchs, Catherine; Shaw, Richard J; Pao, Maryland",,,366

Information about the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who were not admitted to hospital is limited. Some risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 are controversial (eg, smoking). Moreover, the impact of city closure on mortality and admission rates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 infection among a sample of patients in Wuhan whose conditions were reported on social media. METHODS: We enrolled 599 patients with COVID-19 from 67 hospitals in Wuhan in the study; 117 of the participants (19.5%) were not admitted to hospital. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features of the patients were extracted from their social media posts and coded. Telephone follow-up was conducted 1 month later (between March 15 and 23, 2020) to check the clinical outcomes of the patients and acquire other relevant information. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 who died (72 years, IQR 66.5-82.0) was significantly higher than that of patients who recovered (61 years, IQR 53-69, P<.001). We found that lack of admission to hospital (odds ratio [OR] 5.82, 95% CI 3.36-10.1; P<.001), older age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.1; P<.001), diffuse distribution (OR 11.09, 95% CI 0.93-132.9; P=.058), and hypoxemia (odds ratio 2.94, 95% CI 1.32-6.6; P=.009) were associated with increasing odds of death. Smoking was not significantly associated with mortality risk (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.44-1.85; P=.78). CONCLUSIONS: Older age, diffuse distribution, and hypoxemia are factors that can help clinicians identify patients with COVID-19 who have poor prognosis. Our study suggests that aggregated data from social media can also be comprehensive, immediate, and informative in disease prognosis.","Liu, Dong; Wang, Yuyan; Wang, Juan; Liu, Jue; Yue, Yongjie; Liu, Wenjun; Zhang, Fuhai; Wang, Ziping",J Med Internet Res,,366
379997,Early impact of COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric surgical practice in Nigeria: A national survey of paediatric surgeons,2020,"Reviews of COVID-19 CT imaging along with postmortem lung biopsies and autopsies indicate that the majority of patients with COVID-19 pulmonary involvement have secondary organising pneumonia (OP) or its histological variant, acute fibrinous and organising pneumonia, both well-known complications of viral infections. Further, many publications on COVID-19 have debated the puzzling clinical characteristics of 'silent hypoxemia', 'happy hypoxemics' and 'atypical ARDS', all features consistent with OP. The recent announcement that RECOVERY, a randomised controlled trial comparing dexamethasone to placebo in COVID-19, was terminated early due to excess deaths in the control group further suggests patients present with OP given that corticosteroid therapy is the first-line treatment. Although RECOVERY along with other cohort studies report positive effects with corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, treatment approaches could be made more effective given that secondary OP often requires prolonged duration and/or careful and monitored tapering of corticosteroid dose, with 'pulse' doses needed for the well-described fulminant subtype. Increasing recognition of this diagnosis will thus lead to more appropriate and effective treatment strategies in COVID-19, which may lead to a further reduction of need for ventilatory support and improved survival.","Kory, Pierre; Kanne, Jeffrey P",,,366

The healthcare employees taking part in the pandemic will eventually be affected by the process. The aim of the study is to determine the levels of the anxiety, depression, and stress of the healthcare employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. As the data collection tool, an e-survey was used. In the first section, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) was used. In the second section of the survey, the problems experienced by the healthcare employees during the pandemic and their working media were aimed to be defined. In the last section, the socio-demographic features of the employees were investigated. 2076 healthcare employees participated in the study. The results showed that the major cause of the anxiety or stress among healthcare employees comes from the fear to contaminate the COVID-19 virus to their families (86.9%). It was observed that the levels of depression, anxiety and stress of female employees are higher than that of male employees (p < 0.003). The highest depression, anxiety and stress levels of healthcare employees come from the pandemic, emergency, and internal services (p < 0.001). Health managers and policymakers need to make a move immediately to find solutions for the physical and psychological needs of the health employees. On the other hand, in order to minimize the risk, preparation of the work power plans beforehand and inclusion of obligatory referral chain into health services can be suggested.","Tengilimoglu, Dilaver; Zekioglu, Aysu; Tosun, Nurperihan; Isik, Oguz; Tengilimoglu, Onur",Leg Med (Tokyo),,366

Bovine IDVs (BIDVs) from Japan have been distributed nationwide since 2010 and are genetically distinct from foreign IDVs. We isolated BIDVs from three BRD outbreaks, in Hokkaido during 2018-2020, to understand their genetic and antigenic characteristics. Retrospective surveillance was performed using sera collected throughout the last decade in Hokkaido to investigate BIDV existence. Three BIDVs were isolated using cell culture. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses using sequence data of the three BIDVs and IDVs from Japan and other countries available in GenBank demonstrated that Japanese BIDVs, including the three BIDV isolates, were genetically distinct from other IDVs. Genotype classifications based on the rotavirus genotype classification revealed multiple genotypes of RNA segments 1-7. Two BIDVs were of a new genotype, different from those of other Japanese BIDVs. Neutralization assays against two BIDVs with different genotypes using sera collected in acute and recovery phases of BRD revealed differences in cross-reactivity to heterogenous BIDVs. Retrospective surveillance suggested that BIDV existed in Hokkaido, in 2009. Our findings suggest that BIDVs of different genotypes and antigenicity are distributed and maintained in Hokkaido and provide new insights into molecular characteristics and the evolution of IDVs.","Hayakawa, Jun; Masuko, Tomomi; Takehana, Tae; Suzuki, Tohru",Viruses,,366
382262,All-cause excess mortality observed by age group and regions in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England,2020,"Given the volume of research and discussion on the health, medical, economic, financial, political, and travel advisory aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, it is essential to enquire if an outbreak of the epidemic might have been anticipated, given the well-documented history of SARS and MERS, among other infectious diseases. If various issues directly related to health security risks could have been predicted accurately, public health and medical contingency plans might have been prepared and activated in advance of an epidemic such as COVID-19. This paper evaluates an important source of health security, the Global Health Security Index (2019), which provided data before the discovery of COVID-19 in December 2019. Therefore, it is possible to evaluate how countries might have been prepared for a global epidemic, or pandemic, and acted accordingly in an effective and timely manner. The GHS index numerical scores are calculated as the arithmetic (AM), geometric (GM), and harmonic (HM) means of six categories, where AM uses equal weights for each category. The GHS Index scores are regressed on the numerical score rankings of the six categories to check if the use of equal weights of 0.167 in the calculation of the GHS Index using AM is justified, with GM and HM providing a check of the robustness of the arithmetic mean. The highest weights are determined to be around 0.244-0.246, while the lowest weights are around 0.186-0.187 for AM. The ordinal GHS Index is regressed on the ordinal rankings of the six categories to check for the optimal weights in the calculation of the ordinal Global Health Security (GHS) Index, where the highest weight is 0.368, while the lowest is 0.142, so the estimated results are wider apart than for the numerical score rankings. Overall, Rapid Response and Detection and Reporting have the largest impacts on the GHS Index score, whereas Risk Environment and Prevention have the smallest effects. The quantitative and qualitative results are different when GM and HM are used.","Chang, Chia-Lin; McAleer, Michael",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366

384010,The many faces of COVID-19: managing uncertainty,2021,"Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts also struck by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown measures were ineffective with no sign of flattening the curve. Therefore, the high risk of transmission is evident with an increasing number of affected people. Under this circumstance, a multiple hazards scenario can be developed in this country due to climatic hazards such as cyclones, floods, landslides, heat waves, and the outbreak of infectious diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The country experiences simultaneously the global pandemic, exceptionally prolonged flood along with the recovery stage from the damages due to the cyclone (Amphan). Therefore, these multiple factors have been putting pressure on losing millions of homes, livelihoods, and agricultural crops. This study aimed to assess the potential impact of a simultaneous strike of climatic hazards and infectious disease outbreaks and their possible strategic management in Bangladesh under different scenarios. A mixed methodological approach was followed in this study including a questionnaire survey, in-depth discussion with experts, and extensive literature review to assess the multi-hazard scenario in a resource-limited setting with high population density. A set of statistical techniques were used to analyze the responses (n = 1590) from different social groups (healthcare professionals, academicians, students, Government and NGO officials, and businessman) under three scenarios. The results revealed the high possibility of aggravating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic if there is a climatic hazard such as flood, cyclone have appeared. The majority of the respondents agreed that the situation will become more devastating if there is another outbreak of diseases such as dengue, cholera, and diarrhoea. The poor and fragile healthcare system of this country cannot bear such unprecedented pressure. The lack of risk assessment and communication, lack of sectoral coordination might restrict the contingency plan of the government. Therefore, considering the unprecedented worst cases a stringent strategic plan for emergency response, short term and long-term management should have to be formulated. Resilience building through proactive planning and implementation of integrated, inclusive and sustainable strategies will be effective to ensure the health and socio-economic security for multi-hazard threats in the country.","Rahman, Md Mostafizur; Bodrud-Doza, Md; Shammi, Mashura; Md Towfiqul Islam, Abu Reza; Moniruzzaman Khan, Abu Sadat",Environ Res,,366

Our aim was to assess the clinical usefulness of thisrecommendation in an endoscopy unit during the first wave and the recovery phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods From March 2020 to July 2020 (first wave and recovery phase), every patient undergoing an endoscopicexamination in our unit was contacted by phone 14 days after the procedure to check about the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms and to inquire about any new SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis using a predesigned questionnaire. Most ofthe patients had a preprocedure nasopharyngal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 (PCR), and all procedures were performedusing a full PPE. Results 424 inpatients (A) and 1187 outpatients (B) were included. Their main characteristics are summarized in [table 1].Overall, 211 patients (13.1 %) had symptoms that could be related to COVID-19. However, only two cases of SARS-CoV-2positive PCR were detected (0,12 %), one in each group. The +PCR in group A was during the first wave and the +PCR ingroup B was during the recovery phase. Positive group A patient was detected during her admission because complicationsof a multiple myeloma. Positive group B patient was detected because typical COVID-19 symptoms. No infection inhealthcare workers related to these procedures was detected. Conclusions 1) The rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing an endoscopic examination is exceedingly loweven during the acceleration phase;2) The practical relevance of a control telephone call 14 days post-procedure isquestionable.

384546,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on alcohol use disorders and complications,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, a serious threat to sustainable development prospects, is spreading within countries at varying speeds, among other things depending on their population density, behavioural responses, cultural factors, personal hygiene practices and habits. This has led to significant variation in countries' policy responses aimed at stemming the proliferation of the virus. Using crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis, we conducted a comparative study at the European level to study the performance of different combinations of COVID-19 containment measures along with the response speeds. A set of configurations for two different scenarios (above-and below-median death rates) helps to illustrate how specific containment measures in each examined European country are related to the number of deaths. The main observation arising from the analysis is that the speed of response along with the decision to suspend international flights might determine the epidemic outbreak's impact on fatality. The results also imply that several different combinations of containment measures are associated with death rates across Europe. The outcome of this analysis can assist in identifying which set of containment measures in the event of an epidemic outbreak is beneficial/detrimental.","Primc, Kaja; Slabe-Erker, Renata",Sustainability,,366

They not only cause serious human and animal deaths, but also cause serious public health problems worldwide. Currently, seven species are known to infect humans, namely SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. The coronavirus nonstructural protein 16 (NSP16) structure is similar to the 5'-end capping system of mRNA used by eukaryotic hosts and plays a vital role in evading host immunity response and protects the nascent viral mRNA from degradation. NSP16 is also well-conserved among related coronaviruses and requires its binding partner NSP10 to activate its enzymatic activity. With the continued threat of viral emergence highlighted by human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, mutant strains continue to appear, affecting the highly conserved NSP16: this provides a possible therapeutic approach applicable to any novel coronavirus. To this end, current information on the 2'-O-MTase activity mechanism, the differences between NSP16 and NSP10 in human coronaviruses, and the current potential prevention and treatment strategies related to NSP16 are summarized in this review.","Chang, Li-Jen; Chen, Tsung-Hsien",Viruses,,366

388533,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on otolaryngologists: Should we be concerned?,2021,"Phosphylation of the pivotal enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by nerve agents (NAs) leads to irreversible inhibition of the enzyme and accumulation of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which induces cholinergic crisis, that is, overstimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic membrane receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. In severe cases, subsequent desensitisation of the receptors results in hypoxia, vasodepression, and respiratory arrest, followed by death. Prompt action is therefore critical to improve the chances of victim's survival and recovery. Standard therapy of NA poisoning generally involves administration of anticholinergic atropine and an oxime reactivator of phosphylated AChE. Anticholinesterase compounds or NA bioscavengers can also be applied to preserve native AChE from inhibition. With this review of 70 years of research we aim to present current and potential approaches to counteracting NA poisoning.","Hrvat, Nikolina Macek; Kovarik, Zrinka",Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,,366

OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative study to categorize and describe barriers to teamwork posed by PPE and distancing in the emergency setting. METHODS: We conducted 55 semi-structured interviews between June 2020 and August 2020 with personnel from two emergency departments serving in a variety of roles. We then performed a thematic analysis to identify and construct patterns of teamwork challenges into themes. RESULTS: We discovered two types of challenges to teamwork: material barriers related to wearing masks, gowns and powered air-purifying respirators, and spatial barriers implemented to conserve PPE and limit coronavirus exposure. Both material and spatial barriers resulted in disrupted communication, roles and interpersonal relationships, but they did so in unique ways. Material barriers muffled information flow, impeded team member recognition and role/task division, and reduced belonging and cohesion while increasing interpersonal strain. Spatial barriers resulted in mediated communication and added physical and emotional distance between teammates and patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify specific aspects of how intensified PPE use disrupts teamwork and can inform efforts to ensure care quality and safety in emergency settings as PPE use continues during and, potentially beyond, the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic.","Hayirli, Tuna C; Stark, Nicholas; Bhanja, Aditi; Hardy, James; Peabody, Christopher R; Kerrissey, Michaela J",Int. j. qual. health care,,366

PPS associated with negative psychological responses to COVID 19. Worry about mental health (OR 1.46) exceeded worry about physical health (OR 1.13). PPS not associated with adherence to social distancing guidelines but was with stress related to social distancing and worries about infection of self/others. Interpretation: Mental health status (PPS) was associated with concurrent clinical ratings and COVID 19 specific negative responses. A focus on mental health during the pandemic is warranted, especially among those with mental health vulnerabilities. We will include PPS when conducting longitudinal analyses of mental health trajectories and risk and resilience factors that may account for differing clinical outcomes.

391645,Covid-19: Ethical issues for nurses,2020,"BackgroundThe Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the target for many COVID-19 vaccines. Here we report results for phase 1 clinical trial of two COVID-19 vaccine candidates based on recombinant dimeric RBD (d-RBD). MethodsWe performed a randomized, double-blind, phase I clinical trial in the National Centre of Toxicology in Havana. Sixty Cuban volunteers aged 19-59 years were randomized into three groups (20 subjects each): 1) FINLAY-FR-1 (50 mcg d-RBD plus outer membrane vesicles from N. meningitidis); 2) FINLAY-FR-1A-50 mcg d-RBD (three doses); 3) FINLAY-FR-1A-25 mcg d-RDB (three doses). The FINLAY-FR-1 group was randomly divided to receive a third dose of the same vaccine candidate (homologous schedule) or of FINLAY-FR-1A-50 (heterologous schedule). The primary outcomes were safety and reactogenicity. The secondary outcome was vaccine immunogenicity. Humoral response at baseline and following each vaccination was evaluated using live-virus neutralization test, anti-RBD IgG ELISA and in-vitro neutralization test of RBD:hACE2 interaction. ResultsMost adverse events were of mild intensity (63.5%), solicited (58.8%), and local (61.8%); 69.4% with causal association with vaccination. Serious adverse events were not found. The FINLAY-FR-1 group reported more adverse events than the other two groups. After the third dose, anti-RBD seroconversion was 100%, 94.4% and 90% for the FINLAY-FR-1, FINLAY-FR-1A-50 and FINLAY-FR-1A-25 respectively. The in-vitro inhibition of RBD:hACE2 interaction increased after the second dose in all formulations. The geometric mean neutralizing titres after the third dose rose significantly in the group vaccinated with FINLAY-FR-1 with respect to the other formulations and the COVID-19 Convalescent Serum Panel. No differences were found between FINLAY-FR-1 homologous or heterologous schedules. ConclusionsVaccine candidates were safe and immunogenic, and induced live-virus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The highest values were obtained when outer membrane vesicles were used as adjuvant.

393352,Short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with a chronic pain disorder,2021,"Technology‐delivered psychological interventions, particularly online and telephonic counselling, have flourished in recent years, with the need for such a flexible delivery method increasing due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. While empirical research on technology‐delivered psychological interventions is limited, findings indicate that therapists have a positive attitude towards online counselling. There is a particular lack of research on therapists' perceptions and experiences of using technology‐delivered interventions. The primary aim of this study was to explore therapists' experiences of providing online counselling, thereby gaining insight into the therapeutic experience, processes and efficacy from the therapists' perspective. Data were collected through semi‐structured interviews with five therapists, registered with organisations providing professional counselling and psychotherapy, with experience of providing synchronous/real‐time online video, audio or chat‐mediated counselling sessions. The interviews comprised open‐ended questions. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data, through which two superordinate themes were identified: (a) environmental adaptation and (b) practice enhancement. Our findings suggest that therapists’ online counselling experiences incorporate several factors related to environmental adaptation and practice enhancement that impact the therapeutic process, outcomes, progress and relationship. The findings could inform the development of training, awareness‐raising and skills‐enhanced interventions for psychotherapists already using and hoping to use online therapeutic interventions.

396145,Validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the insomnia catastrophizing scale,2021,"Objective: To collect main ingredients and targets of Qing-Fei-Pai-Du-Tang (QFPDT), and to investigate the relationship between the targets and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the multi-component, multi-target mechanism of QFPDT for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: The meridian tropisms, compounds and targets of each herb in QFPDT were collected from ETCM, TCMID and NPASS databases. Cytoscape software was used to construct and analyze networks. DAVID and STRING were applied for functional enrichment analysis of targets. Results: The top meridian tropism of herbs in QFPDT was lung meridian. Among QFPDT’s 790 putative targets, 232 targets were co-expressed with ACE2, the receptor of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The targets included seven densely interacting ribosomal proteins. Important targets were enriched on two classes of disease pathways, i.e., virus infection and lung injury. In addition, many targets interacted with six proteins of HIV virus. Important targets regulated a series of pathways belong to translation, endocrine system, immune system, nervous system and signal transduction. Conclusion: The main targeting organ of QFPDT is the lung and the second is the spleen. By regulating a series of proteins co-expressed with ACE2 and a series of signaling pathways closely related to the occurrence and development of diseases, it plays a role in balancing immunity and eliminating inflammation. It may act as an antiviral agent by targeting ribosomal proteins that are necessary for viral replication to inhibit viral mRNA translation and inhibiting a group of proteins that interact with viral proteins.","Zhao, Jing; Tian, Sai-Sai; Yang, Jian; Liu, Jian-Feng; Zhang, Wei-Dong",Chin.

396273,Patient-facing healthcare workers and their families have a higher risk of hospital admission with COVID-19 than the general population,2021,"A new SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus has caused a pandemic known as COVID-19. Among coronaviruses, the main protease (Mpro) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (-9.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (-8.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro was found to be 0.517 Å and 0.817 Å between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro. Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro and therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Farah, Mohammad Abul; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay",Life Sci,,366

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effect of remdesivir on clinical and virologic outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients from June to July 2020. Primary clinical endpoints included clinical recovery, additional mechanical ventilator (MV) support, and duration of oxygen or MV support. Viral load reduction by hospital day (HD) 15 was evaluated by calculating changes in cycle threshold (Ct) values. RESULTS: A total of 86 severe COVID-19 patients were evaluated including 48 remdesivir-treated patients. Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Remdesivir was administered an average of 7.42 days from symptom onset. The proportions of clinical recovery of the remdesivir and supportive care group at HD 14 (56.3% and 39.5%) and HD 28 (87.5% and 78.9%) were not statistically different. The proportion of patients requiring MV support by HD 28 was significantly lower in the remdesivir group than in the supportive care group (22.9% vs. 44.7%, P = 0.032), and MV duration was significantly shorter in the remdesivir group (average, 1.97 vs. 5.37 days; P = 0.017).

We determine epidemiological distributions for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 using a large dataset (N = 21 000 - 157 000) from the Brazilian Sistema de Informação de Vigilância Epidemiológica da Gripe database. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2 and 17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of 15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalized lognormal for onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.","Hawryluk, Iwona; Mellan, Thomas A; Hoeltgebaum, Henrique; Mishra, Swapnil; Schnekenberg, Ricardo P; Whittaker, Charles; Zhu, Harrison; Gandy, Axel; Donnelly, Christl A; Flaxman, Seth; Bhatt, Samir",J R Soc Interface,,366

METHODS: On February 28, 2020, contingency plans were implemented at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Among them, the decision to refrain from reallocating the Stroke Team and Stroke Unit to the care of patients with COVID-19. From March 1 to March 31, 2020, we measured the number of emergency calls to the Emergency Medical System in Catalonia (7.5 million inhabitants), and the Stroke Codes dispatched to Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. We recorded all stroke admissions, and the adequacy of acute care measures, including the number of thrombectomies, workflow metrics, angiographic results, and clinical outcomes. Data were compared with March 2019 using parametric or nonparametric methods as appropriate. RESULTS: At Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, 1232 patients with COVID-19 were admitted in March 2020, demanding 60% of the hospital bed capacity. Relative to March 2019, the Emergency Medical System had a 330% mean increment in the number of calls (158 005 versus 679 569), but fewer Stroke Code activations (517 versus 426). Stroke admissions (108 versus 83) and the number of thrombectomies (21 versus 16) declined at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, particularly after lockdown of the population. Younger age was found in stroke admissions during the pandemic (median [interquartile range] 69 [64-73] versus 75 [73-80] years, P=0.009). In-hospital, there were no differences in workflow metrics, angiographic results, complications, or outcomes at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic reduced by a quarter the stroke admissions and thrombectomies performed at a Comprehensive Stroke Center but did not affect the quality of care metrics. During the lockdown, there was an overload of emergency calls but fewer Stroke Code activations, particularly in elderly patients. Hospital contingency plans, patient transport systems, and population-targeted alerts must act concertedly to better protect the chain of stroke care in times of pandemic.","Rudilosso, Salvatore; Laredo, Carlos; Vera, Víctor; Vargas, Martha; Renú, Arturo; Llull, Laura; Obach, Víctor; Amaro, Sergio; Urra, Xabier; Torres, Ferrán; Jiménez-Fàbrega, Francesc Xavier; Chamorro, Ángel",Stroke,,366

Cases of H7N9 human infections emerged in eastern China in 2013 and immediately raised pandemic concerns as historically, pandemics were caused by the introduction of new subtypes into immunologically naïve human populations. Highly pathogenic H7N9 cases with severe disease were reported recently, indicating the continuing public health threat and the need for a prophylactic vaccine. Here we review the development of recombinant influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) as vaccines against H7N9 virus. Several approaches to vaccine development are reviewed including the expression of VLPs in mammalian, plant and insect cell expression systems. Although considerable progress has been achieved, including demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of H7N9 VLPs in the human clinical trials, the remaining challenges need to be addressed.

There are three main forms of vitamin A, retinol, retinal and retinoic acid (RA) with the latter being most biologically active and all-trans-RA (ATRA) its main derivative. Vitamin A is a key regulator of the functions of various innate and adaptive immune cells and promotes immune-homeostasis. Importantly, it augments the interferon-based innate immune response to RNA viruses decreasing RNA virus replication. Several clinical trials report decreased mortality in measles and Ebola with vitamin A supplementation.During the Covid-19 pandemic interventions such as convalescent plasma, antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulator drugs have been tried but most of them are difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. The current review explores the possibility of mega dose vitamin A as an affordable adjunct therapy for Covid-19 illness with minimal reversible side effects. Insight is provided into the effect of vitamin A on ACE-2 expression in the respiratory tract and its association with the prognosis of Covid-19 patients. Vitamin A supplementation may aid the generation of protective immune response to Covid-19 vaccines. An overview of the dosage and safety profile of vitamin A is presented along with recommended doses for prophylactic/therapeutic use in randomised controlled trials in Covid-19 patients.","Midha, Ish K; Kumar, Nilesh; Kumar, Amit; Madan, Taruna",Rev Med Virol,,366

SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious with a high basic reproduction number (R0 ) of 2.2-5.7 that has led to its exponential spread. Besides, very little is known about it in terms of immunogenicity and its molecular targets. SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by multiple organ failure and death in a small percentage of individuals. Cardiac injury has emerged as another dreaded outcome of COVID-19 complications. However, a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. In this review, we discuss the virus, possible mechanisms of COVID-19-induced cardiac injury, and potential therapeutic strategies, and we explore if exosomes could be targeted to treat symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, we discussed the virus-induced sepsis, which may be the cause of multiple organ failure, including myocardial injury.","Patil, Mallikarjun; Singh, Sarojini; Henderson, John; Krishnamurthy, Prasanna",J. cell. physiol,,366

407714,An innovation in Flipped Class Room: A teaching model to facilitate synchronous and asynchronous learning during a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The role of VDAC1, the most abundant mitochondrial outer membrane protein, in cell death depends on cell types and stimuli. Both silencing and upregulation of VDAC1 in various type of cancer cell lines can stimulate apoptosis. In contrast, in mouse embryonic stem (MES) cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the roles of VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1-/-) in apoptotic cell death are contradictory. The contribution and underlying mechanism of VDAC1-/- in oxidative stress-induced cell death in cardiac cells has not been established. We hypothesized that VDAC1 is an essential regulator of oxidative stress-induced cell death in H9c2 cells. METHODS: We knocked out VDAC1 in this rat cardiomyoblast cell line with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique to produce VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells, and determined if VDAC1 is critical in promoting cell death via oxidative stress induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP), an organic peroxide, or rotenone (ROT), an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I by measuring cell viability with MTT assay, cell death with TUNEL stain and LDH release. The mitochondrial and glycolytic stress were examined by measuring O2 consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) with a Seahorse XFp analyzer. RESULTS: We found that under control conditions, VDAC1-/- did not affect H9c2 cell proliferation or mitochondrial respiration. However, compared to the wildtype (WT) cells, exposure to either tBHP or ROT enhanced the production of ROS, ECAR, and the proton (H+) production rate (PPR) from glycolysis, as well as promoted apoptotic cell death in VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells. VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells also exhibited markedly reduced mitochondria-bound hexokinase II (HKII) and Bax. Restoration of VDAC1 in VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells reinstated mitochondria-bound HKII and concomitantly decreased tBHP and ROT-induced ROS production and cell death. Interestingly, mitochondrial respiration remained the same after tBHP treatment in VDAC1-/- and WT H9c2 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that VDAC1-/- in H9c2 cells enhances oxidative stress-mediated cell apoptosis that is directly linked to the reduction of mitochondria-bound HKII and concomitantly associated with enhanced ROS production, ECAR, and PPR.","Yang, Meiying; Sun, Jie; Stowe, David F; Tajkhorshid, Emad; Kwok, Wai-Meng; Camara, Amadou K S",Cell Physiol Biochem,,366

408209,Planning the Restorative Dental Treatment at the Time of Coronavirus Pandemic: A Two-arm Strategy,2021,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 pandemic has multifaceted presentations with rising evidence of immune-mediated mechanisms underplay. We sought to explore the outcomes of severe COVID-19 patients treated with a multi-mechanism approach (MMA) in addition to standard-of-care (SC) versus patients who only received SC treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively for patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This observational cohort study was performed at five institutions, 3 in the United States and 2 in Honduras. Patients were stratified for MMA vs. SC treatment during ICU stay. MMA treatment consists of widely available medications started immediately upon hospitalization. These interventions target immunomodulation, anticoagulation, viral suppression, and oxygenation. Primary outcomes included in-hospital mortality and length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization and were measured using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 86 patients admitted, 65 (76%) who had severe COVID-19 were included in the study; 30 (46%) patients were in SC group, compared with 35 (54%) patients treated with MMA group. Twelve (40%) patients in the SC group died, compared with 5 (14%) in the MMA group (p-value = 0.01, Chi squared test). After adjustment for gender, age, treatment group, Q-SOFA score, the MMA group had a mean length of stay 8.15 days, when compared with SC group with 13.55 days. ICU length of stay was reduced by a mean of 5.4 days (adjusted for a mean age of 54 years, p-value 0.03) and up to 9 days (unadjusted for mean age), with no significant reduction in overall adjusted mortality rate, where the strongest predictor of mortality was the use of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: The finding that MMA decreases the average ICU length of stay by 5.4 days and up to 9 days in older patients suggests that implementation of this treatment protocol could allow a healthcare system to manage 60% more COVID-19 patients with the same number of ICU beds.","Valerio Pascua, Fernando; Diaz, Oscar; Medina, Rina; Contreras, Brian; Mistroff, Jeff; Espinosa, Daniel; Sekhon, Anupamjeet; Paz Handal, Diego; Pineda, Estela; Vargas Pineda, Miguel; Pineda, Hector; Diaz, Maribel; Lewis, Anita S; Hesse, Heike; Castro Lainez, Miriams T; Stevens, Mark L; Sierra-Hoffman, Miguel; Ontai, Sidney C; VanBuren, Vincent",PLoS One,,366

Since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and declaration of the SDG 4, many countries have opted to embrace the lifelong education for all by integrating ICT in teaching and learning at all school levels. The Ghanaian Government's initiative to ensure ""education anytime anywhere for everyone"" by revolutionizing teaching and learning through ICT has faced a lot of challenges and criticisms. The main mission of the Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) in 2003 was to transform Ghana into an information and technology-driven high-income economy through education, but this goal is yet to be realized. In the wake of the COVID-19 which has forced many countries and educational sectors to adopt online learning, there is a need to discuss the effectiveness of online learning and barriers to online learning in the developing contexts, and how to successfully integrate ICT in schools for online learning, especially rural schools where students' educational careers are in jeopardy because they benefit less from online learning. The paper identifies critical factors that affect online learning, recommends post COVID-19 strategies to promote e-learning for policymakers in education and the government, and concludes with a conceptual model for emergency transition to e-learning.","Adarkwah, Michael Agyemang",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,366

Among SARS-CoV-2-infections-associated neurological symptoms fatigue, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness and anosmia/ageusia are most frequent, but less frequent neurological deficits such as seizures, Guillain-Barré syndrome or ataxia may also occur. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we present a case of a 62-year-old man who developed a subacute cerebellar syndrome with limb-, truncal- and gait ataxia and scanning speech 1 day after clinical resolution of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Apart from ataxia, there were no signs indicative of opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia syndrome or Miller Fisher syndrome. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed mild cerebellar atrophy. SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cerebellum was excluded by normal cerebrospinal fluid cell counts and, most importantly, absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody production. Other causes of ataxia such as other viral infections, other autoimmune and/or paraneoplastic diseases or intoxication were ruled out. The neurological deficits improved rapidly after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory and clinical findings as well as the marked improvement after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy suggest a post-infectious, immune-mediated cause of ataxia. This report should make clinicians aware to consider SARS-CoV-2 infection as a potential cause of post-infectious neurological deficits with an atypical clinical presentation and to consider high-dose corticosteroid treatment in case that a post-infectious immune-mediated mechanism is assumed.","Werner, Jana; Reichen, Ina; Huber, Michael; Abela, Irene A; Weller, Michael; Jelcic, Ilijas",BMC Infect Dis,,366
412998,Increased consumption of crystal (Methamphetamine) during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"The outbreak of the COVID‐19 pandemic crisis around the world and the resulting unprecedented measures taken by governments required organizations to quickly adopt new ways of (remotely) working. At face value, this would suggest a higher vulnerability for cyber threats. This research note analyses how a global financial institution dealt with this challenge by using Hollnagel's four abilities for resilient performance as a theoretical lens. Semi‐structured in‐depth interviews with eleven key actors were conducted. Three findings stand out. First, the interviews suggest that the organization performed cyber resiliently in the sense that the number of incidents and impact were not significantly higher. Second, the interviews show that all four abilities of resilience were formally developed prior to the COVID‐19 outbreak, but rarely resulted in anticipatory adjustment. Third, the interviews indicate that the ability to respond contributed most to the organization's cyber resilience during the pandemic crisis. To conclude, our research note raises the question to what extent the four potentials should be developed beforehand in order to perform resiliently during crises.

Suzie Bailey, director of leadership and organisational development at the health think tank the King’s Fund, said it was a “bitter irony” that many staff were made ill because of their work and “particularly shocking” that ethnic minority staff reported worse experiences. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said, “We recognise the pressures that staff have faced during this time, and the government is doing everything it can to support their wellbeing, including through £37m this year to fund staff mental health hubs, a dedicated helpline, and a 24/7 text support service.","Iacobucci, Gareth",BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online),,366
413873,Acceptability of a COVID-19 Vaccine Among Healthcare Workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the intensive care units' (ICUs) reorganization that was forced by the COVID-19 emergency, attention to traditional infection control measures may have been reduced. Nevertheless, evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is still limited and mixed. In this study, we estimated the pandemic impact on HAI incidence and investigated the HAI type occurring in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to the main ICU of the Umberto I teaching hospital of Rome from March 1st and April 4th 2020 were compared with patients hospitalized in 2019. We assessed the association of risk factors and time-to-first event through multivariable Fine and Grey's regression models, that consider the competitive risk of death on the development of HAI (Model 1) or device related-HAI (dr-HAI, Model 2) and provide estimates of the sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) and its associated confidence interval (CI). A subgroup analysis was performed on the 2020 cohort. RESULTS: Data from 104 patients were retrieved. Overall, 59 HAIs were recorded, 32 of which occurred in the COVID-19 group. Patients admitted in 2020 were found to be positively associated with both HAI and dr-HAI onset (SHR: 2.66, 95% CI 1.31-5.38, and SHR: 10.0, 95% CI 1.84-54.41, respectively). Despite being not confirmed at the multivariable analysis, a greater proportion of dr-HAIs seemed to occur in COVID-19 patients, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, and catheter-related urinary tract infections. CONCLUSIONS: We observed an increase in the incidence of patients with HAIs, especially dr-HAIs, mainly sustained by COVID-19 patients. A greater susceptibility of these patients to device-related infections was hypothesized, but further studies are needed.","Baccolini, V; Migliara, G; Isonne, C; Dorelli, B; Barone, L C; Giannini, D; Marotta, D; Marte, M; Mazzalai, E; Alessandri, F; Pugliese, F; Ceccarelli, G; De Vito, C; Marzuillo, C; De Giusti, M; Villari, P",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,,366

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive longitudinal study from March to July 2020 by analyzing data of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 among ED visitors and healthcare workers in King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz University Hospital. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 1,182 swab samples were collected for testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), of which 285 (24.1%) tested positive. Of the 285 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18 were healthcare workers and 267 were patients. As a result of using the respiratory pathway for COVID-19 patients, the hospital managed to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 not only between patients but also between patients and healthcare workers, while also containing the pandemic. There were no cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded among the patients who visited the ED or the flu clinic. All confirmed cases were community acquired and patients were cared for under constrained measures. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing infection control measures and restricting those with respiratory symptoms to the ED pathway prevented nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ED.","Alqahtani, Fulwah; Alanazi, Marzouqah; Alassaf, Wajdan; Aleanizy, Fadilah Sfouq; Aljahany, Muna; Joseph, Mercy; AlRaye, Mohammad",J. complement. integr. med,,366

417359,Implications of Global and Local Inequalities in COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution for People With Severe Mental Disorders in Latin America,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acne is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease with a high prevalence in adolescent and early adult years. The aim of this study was to assess the self-perceived beliefs of Montenegrin secondary school pupils regarding the acne aggravating and ameliorating factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey of the pupils was conducted during October and November 2020 in four randomly selected public secondary schools in Podgorica, Montenegro. All 500 pupils were asked to fill in a questionnaire that included questions on age, sex, presence of acne, perceived acne aggravating and ameliorating factors, and sources of their information about acne. RESULTS: A total of 500 pupils, 234 (46.8%) boys, and 266 (53.2%) girls, aged 14-17 years, participated in the study. Acne was self-reported in 249 (49.8%) pupils, whereas 251 (50.2%) did not report acne. Factors most often believed to aggravate acne were inadequate face washing (85.0%), hormones (84.0%), sweets (82.0%), greasy food (72.6%), makeup (71.2%), and stress (67.8%). Overall the most prevalent acne ameliorating factors were cosmetic treatment (80.4%), increased water consumption (77.6%), a diet change to a healthier food choice (77.4%), and being on school holidays (62.2%). Girls reported more frequently that genetics, stress, sweets consumption, inadequate face wash, and makeup are acne exacerbating factors, whilst cosmetic treatment, increased water consumption, smoking, and being on school holidays are acne ameliorating factors. Boys more frequently considered the benefit of losing weight. There was no statistically significant difference between pupils with and without acne in perceived factors, except for cosmetic treatment. Those with acne more frequently believed in the benefits of cosmetic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents' self-perceived beliefs about factors that aggravate and ameliorate acne are myths and misconceptions without evidence-based justification. More efforts are needed to educate pupils about the acne aggravating and ameliorating factors, its health-related consequences, and the treatment possibilities.","Raznatovic Durovic, Milena; Jankovic, Janko; Durovic, Milica; Spiric, Jelena; Jankovic, Slavenka",PLoS One,,366
417402,The immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on motor neuron disease services and mortality in Scotland,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the public health response to COVID-19 within a large prison with a high number of clinically vulnerable residents. DESIGN: An outbreak investigation was undertaken among all residents and staff. A screening event involved nose and throat swab samples from residents and staff, examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An electronic questionnaire regarding risk factors was distributed to staff. RESULTS: 58 residents out of 1,156 (5.0%, 95% CI: 3.8 - 6.3) and 129 staff out of 510 (25.3%, 95% CI: 21.5 - 29.1) displayed COVID-19 symptoms, including six and eight confirmed, respectively. Residents reported cough symptoms with no fever (29.3%), followed by a cough and fever (15.5%). 62.1% of symptomatic residents were 50 years or older, placing them in the group at risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Wing I had the highest attack rate (12.5%). 1,063 individuals were swabbed during the 5-day screening event, and all had negative swab results. CONCLUSION: The findings were consistent with the hypothesis of a propagating outbreak with decreasing incidence since the peak date of onset. COVID-19 transmission within a high-risk setting was quickly contained, and an explosive outbreak was prevented through a multi-agency public health response.","Wilburn, Jennifer; Blakey, Eleanor; Trindall, Amy; Burr, Helen; Tanti, Vince; Doolan, Sue; Palmer, Ian; Jewell, Tony; Balakrishnan, Ravikumar",Int J Infect Dis,,366
417613,Metacognitive Therapy for Work-Related Stress: A Feasibility Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Little is known as yet about the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children being treated for cancer. METHODS: We collected information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of 29 children (16 females and 13 males, median age 7 years, range [0-16]) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection while on chemotherapy/immunotherapy (N=26), or after stem cell transplantation (N=3) during the peak of the epidemic in Italy. These patients suffered from leukemia (N=16), lymphoma (N=3), solid tumors (N=10), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (N=1). RESULTS: The course of the disease was mild in all cases, with only 12 children developing symptoms (pneumonia in 3 cases), and none needing intensive care. Fifteen patients were hospitalized, including 7 asymptomatic patients. Nine patients (including 5 with no symptoms) were given hydroxychloroquine, and 3 of them were also given lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to take a milder clinical course in children than in adults with cancer. Specific SARS-CoV-2 treatment seems unnecessary for most children. In the light of our findings, and albeit with the necessary caution, we suggest avoiding major changes to planned anticancer treatments in pediatric patients acquiring COVID-19.","Bisogno, Gianni; Provenzi, Massimo; Zama, Daniele; Tondo, Annalisa; Meazza, Cristina; Colombini, Antonella; Galaverna, Federica; Compagno, Francesca; Carraro, Francesca; De Santis, Raffaela; Meneghello, Linda; Baretta, Valentina; Cesaro, Simone",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,,366

418150,Has the COVID 19 Virus Changed Adherence to Hand Washing among Healthcare Workers?,2021,"Background: Several studies have reported the beneficial effect of glucocorticoids in the treatment of cytokine storm that occurs in patients with severe COVID-19. Various glucocorticoids regimens have been proposed. Methods: Retrospective observational study that includes patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compares admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or death during hospitalization in three groups of patients: no glucocorticoids treatment, use of glucocorticoids doses equivalent to less than 250 mg of prednisone daily and use of equivalent doses greater than or equal to 250 mg of prednisone daily. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression, using the propensity index as a covariant. Results: Of the 259 patients enrolled in the study, 67 (25.9%) had an unfavorable evolution, dying or requiring ICU admission. Comparative analyzes between different glucocorticoids treatments and the association with ICU admission or death were: glucocorticoids treatment (any dose) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.71 (0.30-1.66)), treatment with glucocorticoids (&#8805; 250 mg prednisone daily) versus no glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.35 (0.11-1.08)) and glucocorticoids treatment (&#8805; 250 mg prednisone daily) versus patients with glucocorticoids doses <250 mg prednisone daily or without glucocorticoids treatment (OR: 0.30 (0.10-0.88)). Conclusion: The results of this study show that patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia treated with glucocorticoids pulses with equivalent doses of prednisone greater than or equal to 250 mg have a more favorable evolution (less mortality and less admission to ICU).","Pascual Pareja, José Francisco; García-Caballero, Rebeca; Rangel, Llanos Soler; Vázquez-Ronda, Miguel Angel; Franco, Silvia Roa; Jiménez, Gema Navarro; Palanco, Miguel Angel Moreno; González-Ruano, Patricia; López-Menchaca, Ramiro; Ruíz-Seco, Pilar; Muñoz, Bárbara Pagán; Gómez, Alejandro Gómez; Pérez-Monte, Beatriz; Martínez, Rebeca Fuerte; López, Jose Luis Valle; Blanco, Arturo Muñoz; Lorite, Isabel Rábago; Martín, Patricia Martínez; San Martín, Gonzalo Serralta; Y Jorge Francisco, Gómez-Cerezo",,,366
418219,Serving patients in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Although COVID-19 has become a major challenge to global health, there are currently no efficacious agents for effective treatment. Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which contributes to most COVID-19 mortalities. Research points to interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a crucial signature of the cytokine storm, and the clinical use of the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab shows potential for treatment of COVID-19 patient. In this study, we challenged wild-type and adenovirus-5/human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-expressing BALB/c mice with a combination of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike-extracellular domain protein. High levels of TNF-&#945; and nearly 100 times increased IL-6 were detected at 6 h, but disappeared by 24 h in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) following immunostimulant challenge. Lung injury observed by histopathologic changes and magnetic resonance imaging at 24 h indicated that increased TNF-&#945; and IL-6 may initiate CSS in the lung, resulting in the continual production of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that TNF-&#945; and IL-6 may contribute to the occurrence of CSS in COVID-19. We also investigated multiple monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibitors for neutralizing the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19: mAbs against IL-1&#945;, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and inhibitors of p38 and JAK partially relieved CSS; mAbs against IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and GM-CSF, and inhibitors of p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and myeloperoxidase somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung. This novel murine model opens a biologically safe, time-saving avenue for clarifying the mechanism of CSS/ARDS in COVID-19 and developing new therapeutic drugs.","Gu, Tingxuan; Zhao, Simin; Jin, Guoguo; Song, Mengqiu; Zhi, Yafei; Zhao, Ran; Ma, Fayang; Zheng, Yaqiu; Wang, Keke; Liu, Hui; Xin, Mingxia; Han, Wei; Li, Xiang; Dong, Christopher D; Liu, Kangdong; Dong, Zigang",Front Immunol,,366

420270,Policy and Health: Leveraging a Social Determinants of Health Framework to Alleviate the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients With Cancer,2021,"In this article, we investigate the binding processes of a fragment of the coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), the hexapeptide YKYRYL on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and its inhibitory effect on the binding and activation of the coronavirus-2 spike protein CoV-2 RBD at ACE2. In agreement with an experimental study, we find a high affinity of the hexapeptide to the binding interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, which we investigate using 20 independent equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over a total of 1 µs and a 200-ns enhanced correlation guided MD simulation. We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the assembly process of the CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 in long-time enhanced correlation guided MD simulations. In that set of simulations, we find that CoV-2 RBD does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates because of an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to CoV-2 RBD, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2 so that the activation of CoV-2 RBD might be inhibited in this case. Our results indicate that the hexapeptide might be a possible treatment option that prevents the viral activation through the inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD.","Peter, Emanuel K; Schug, Alexander",Biophys. j,,366

After discharge from hospital, most patients are treated in primary care. Little is known how general practitioners (GPs) perform critical illness aftercare and how it can be improved. Within a randomised controlled trial, an outreach training programme has been developed and applied. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe GPs' views and experiences of caring for postsepsis patients and of participating a specific outreach training. DESIGN: Semistructured qualitative interviews. SETTING: 14 primary care practices in the metropolitan area of Berlin, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: 14 GPs who had participated in a structured sepsis aftercare programme in primary care. RESULTS: Themes identified in sepsis aftercare were: continuity of care and good relationship with patients, GP's experiences during their patient's critical illness and impact of persisting symptoms. An outreach education as part of the intervention was considered by the GPs to be acceptable, helpful to improve knowledge of the management of postintensive care complications and useful for sepsis aftercare in daily practice. CONCLUSIONS: GPs provide continuity of care to patients surviving sepsis. Better communication at the intensive care unit-GP interface and training in management of long-term complications of sepsis may be helpful to improve sepsis aftercare.

420972,Gender and Age Differences Reveal Risk Patterns in COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"All over the world; measures have been implemented to contain the novel Sars-CoV-2 virus since its outbreak in the beginning of 2020. These measures-among which social distancing and contact restrictions were most prominent-may have an overall effect on people's psychological well-being. The present study seeks to examine whether lockdown measures affected people's well-being; anxiety; depressive symptoms during the lockdown and whether these effects could be explained by reduced satisfaction of the basic psychological needs of autonomy and relatedness. N = 1086 participants of different ages and educational levels from all over Germany reported strong declines in autonomy and well-being; small declines in relatedness satisfaction; moderate increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms. These effects were stronger for people with moderate to bad subjective overall health. Latent change modeling revealed that, especially, decreases in autonomy satisfaction led to stronger decreases in well-being as well as stronger increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms; whereas decreases in relatedness had much weaker effects. Our results imply differential effects depending on individual preconditions; but also more generally that peoples' need for autonomy was most strongly affected by the lockdown measures, which should be considered as important information in planning future lockdowns.","Schwinger, Malte; Trautner, Maike; Kärchner, Henrike; Otterpohl, Nantje",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366

Early identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients is crucial. We aimed to derive and validate a simple score for the prediction of severe outcomes. A retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was carried out by the Italian Society of Internal Medicine. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and treatment variables were collected at hospital admission at five hospitals. Three algorithm selection models were used to construct a predictive risk score: backward Selection, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Random Forest. Severe outcome was defined as the composite of need for non-invasive ventilation, need for orotracheal intubation, or death. A total of 610 patients were included in the analysis, 313 had a severe outcome. The subset for the derivation analysis included 335 patients, the subset for the validation analysis 275 patients. The LASSO selection identified 6 variables (age, history of coronary heart disease, CRP, AST, D-dimer, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) and resulted in the best performing score with an area under the curve of 0.79 in the derivation cohort and 0.80 in the validation cohort. Using a cut-off of 7 out of 13 points, sensitivity was 0.93, specificity 0.34, positive predictive value 0.59, and negative predictive value 0.82.

422354,Understanding the impact of information sources on COVID-19 related preventive measures in Finland,2021,"In this study, we examined the role of the eastern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) in the dispersion of bat adenovirus and bat alphacoronavirus in east Asia, considering their gene flows and divergence times (based on deep-sequencing data), using bat fecal guano samples. Bats in China moved to Jeju Island and/or Taiwan in the last 20,000 years via the Korean Peninsula and/or Japan. The phylogenies of host mitochondrial D-loop DNA was not significantly congruent with those of bat adenovirus (m2XY = 0.07, p = 0.08), and bat alphacoronavirus (m2XY = 0.48, p = 0.20). We estimate that the first divergence time of bats carrying bat adenovirus in five caves studied (designated as K1, K2, JJ, N2, and F3) occurred approximately 3.17 million years ago. In contrast, the first divergence time of bat adenovirus among bats in the 5 caves was estimated to be approximately 224.32 years ago. The first divergence time of bats in caves CH, JJ, WY, N2, F1, F2, and F3 harboring bat alphacoronavirus was estimated to be 1.59 million years ago. The first divergence time of bat alphacoronavirus among the 7 caves was estimated to be approximately 2,596.92 years ago. The origin of bat adenovirus remains unclear, whereas our findings suggest that bat alphacoronavirus originated in Japan. Surprisingly, bat adenovirus and bat alphacoronavirus appeared to diverge substantially over the last 100 years, even though our gene-flow data indicate that the eastern bent-winged bat serves as an important natural reservoir of both viruses.","Kimprasit, Thachawech; Nunome, Mitsuo; Iida, Keisuke; Murakami, Yoshitaka; Wong, Min-Liang; Wu, Chung-Hsin; Kobayashi, Ryosuke; Hengjan, Yupadee; Takemae, Hitoshi; Yonemitsu, Kenzo; Kuwata, Ryusei; Shimoda, Hiroshi; Si, Lifan; Sohn, Joon-Hyuk; Asakawa, Susumu; Ichiyanagi, Kenji; Maeda, Ken; Oh, Hong-Shik; Mizutani, Tetsuya; Kimura, Junpei; Iida, Atsuo; Hondo, Eiichi",PLoS One,,366

Multiple biomarkers have been used to assess the ecotoxicity of arsenic, however, the mechanisms of toxicity remain unclear. This paper describes the exposure of the earthworm (Eisenia fetida) to natural soil with different As-V concentrations for 28 days, then biomarkers from oxidative stress and burrowing behavior were quantified to evaluate As-V stress. Dynamic changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (MDA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and antioxidant enzymes activity (Gpx, SOD, CAT) implied two stages of intensified stress responses and physiological adaptability. The transcriptional expression and regulation of antioxidant enzymes showed different responses. The mRNA expression of sod1 was up-regulated, while that of cat showed no significant change. The related regulators, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), showed dose-dependent activation, suggesting antioxidant defense induced by Nrf2 signaling. The burrowing behavior after 14-day exposure indicated that As-V inhibited burrowing activity, especially the burrow length and maximum burrow depth. These multiple biomarkers were integrated using a biomarker response index (BRI) model, which showed significant dose-effect relationship especially on day 28, and suggested that ATP was a sensitive and representative biomarker. This study provided evidence that burrowing activity, Nrf2 and HO-1 were useful biomarkers warranting inclusion into the BRI model. Arsenic toxicity was comprehensively understood through redox homeostasis regulation, biochemical and behavioral changes, and these results suggested new strategies for soil pollutants diagnosis.","Deng, Songge; Wu, Yizhao; Duan, Hanqi; Cavanagh, Jo-Anne E; Wang, Xiuhong; Qiu, Jiangping; Li, Yinsheng",Sci Total Environ,,366

424497,[Survey of Online Outpatient Clinic Usage Experiences and Analysis of Factors Influencing Retreatment],2021,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) cause an enteric disease characterized by diarrhea clinically indistinguishable. Both viruses are simultaneously detected in clinical cases, but a study involving the co-infection has not been reported. The study was therefore conducted to investigate the disease severity following a co-infection with PEDV and PDCoV. In the study, 4-day-old pigs were orally inoculated with PEDV and PDCoV, either alone or in combination. Following challenge, fecal score was monitored on a daily basis. Fecal swabs were collected and assayed for the presence of viruses. Three pigs per group were necropsied at 3 and 5 days post inoculation (dpi). Microscopic lesions and villous height to crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio, together with the presence of PEDV and PDCoV antigens, were evaluated in small intestinal tissues. Expressions of interferon alpha (IFN-&#945;) and interleukin 12 (IL12) were investigated in small intestinal mucosa. The findings indicated that coinoculation increased the disease severity, demonstrated by significantly prolonged fecal score and virus shedding and decreasing VH:CD ratio in the jejunum compared with pigs inoculated with either PEDV or PDCoV alone.

424725,The Early Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgical Urologic Oncology Practice in Turkey: Multi-Institutional Experience From Different Geographic Areas,2020,"Abstract The global shortage of reagents and kits for nucleic acid extraction and molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 requires new cost-effective strategies for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially in countries that need to increase detection capacity. Pooled nucleic acid testing has been extensively used as a cost-effective strategy for HIV, HepB, HepC and influenza. Also, protocols dispensing of RNA extraction appears as an attractive option for detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we found that pooling of 5 samples showed that CT variations were in the range of 1.0-4,5 units, with less likelihood of a false negative result. Results of the sample without nucleic acid ex-traction, was unsatisfactory, with a significant increase in CT values, and thus for risk of a false negative result. In conclusion, pooling nasopharyngeal samples with both automated and manual extraction proved reliable, and thus a potential efficient alternative for the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 in developing countries.","Farfan, Mauricio J.; Torres, Juan P.; ORyan, Miguel; Olivares, Mauricio; Gallardo, Pablo; Lastra, Jorge; Salas, Carolina",Rev. chil. infectol,,366

We describe the early genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated healthcare professionals (HCP). Our post-vaccination COVID-19 symptoms-based surveillance program among HCPs in a 17-hospital network, identified all vaccinated HCP who tested positive for COVID-19 after routine screening or after self-reporting. From 01/01/2021 to 04/30/2021, 23,687 HCP received either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. All available post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 samples and a random collection from non-vaccinated patients during the similar timeframe were subjected to VOC screening and whole genome sequencing (WGS). 62% (23,697/37,500) of HCPs received at least one vaccine dose, with 95% (22,458) fully vaccinated. We detected 138 (0.58%, 138/23,697) COVID-19 cases, 105 among partially vaccinated and 33 (0.15%, 33/22,458) among fully vaccinated. Five partially vaccinated required hospitalization, four with supplemental oxygen. VOC screening from 16 fully vaccinated HCPs identified 6 (38%) harboring N501Y and 1 (6%) with E484K polymorphisms; concurrent non-vaccinated samples was 37% (523/1404) and 20% (284/1394), respectively. There was an upward trend from January to April for E484K/Q (3% to 26%) and N501Y (1% to 49%). WGS analysis from vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals indicated highly congruent phylogenies. We did not detect an increased frequency of any RBD/NTD polymorphism between groups (P>0.05). Our results support robust protection by vaccination, particularly among recipients of both doses. Despite VOCs accounting for over 40% of SARS-CoV-2 from fully vaccinated individuals, the genomic diversity appears to proportionally represent those among non-vaccinated populations. IMPORTANCEA number of highly effective vaccines have been developed and deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence and epidemiological dominance of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, with high transmission potential and immune evasion properties, the so-called Variants of Concern (VOC), continues to be a major concern. Whether these VOCs alter the efficacy of the administered vaccines is of great concern, and a critical question to study. We describe the initial genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from vaccinated healthcare professionals and probe specifically for VOC enrichment. Our findings support the high-level of protection provided by full vaccination despite a steep increase in the prevalence of polymorphisms associated with increased transmission potential (N501Y) and immune evasion (E484K) in the non-vaccinated population. Thus, we do not find evidence of VOC enrichment among vaccinated groups. Overall, the genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 recovered post-vaccination appears to proportionally represent the observed viral diversity within the community.","Mathema, Barun; Chen, Liang; Chow, Kar Fai; Zhao, Yanan; Zody, Michael C; Mediavilla, Jose R; Cunningham, Marcus H; Composto, Kaelea; Lee, Annie; Oschwald, Dayna M; Germer, Soren; Fennessey, Samantha; Patel, Kishan; Wilson, David; Cassell, Ann; Pascual, Lauren; Ip, Andrew; Corvelo, Andre; Dar, Sophia; Kramer, Yael; Maniatis, Tom; Perlin, David S; Kreiswirth, Barry N",,,366

However, robust and accurate screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays is still a globally recognized challenge because of two bottlenecks: 1) imaging features of COVID-19 share some similarities with other pneumonia on chest X-rays, and 2) the misdiagnosis rate of COVID-19 is very high, and the misdiagnosis cost is expensive. While a few pioneering works have made much progress, they underestimate both crucial bottlenecks. In this paper, we report our solution, discriminative cost-sensitive learning (DCSL), which should be the choice if the clinical needs the assisted screening of COVID-19 from chest X-rays. DCSL combines both advantages from fine-grained classification and cost-sensitive learning. Firstly, DCSL develops a conditional center loss that learns deep discriminative representation. Secondly, DCSL establishes score-level cost-sensitive learning that can adaptively enlarge the cost of misclassifying COVID-19 examples into other classes. DCSL is so flexible that it can apply in any deep neural network. We collected a large-scale multi-class dataset comprised of 2,239 chest X-ray examples: 239 examples from confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1,000 examples with confirmed bacterial or viral pneumonia cases, and 1,000 examples of healthy people. Extensive experiments on the three-class classification show that our algorithm remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. It achieves an accuracy of 97.01%, a precision of 97%, a sensitivity of 97.09%, and an F1-score of 96.98%. These results endow our algorithm as an efficient tool for the fast large-scale screening of COVID-19.","Li, Tianyang; Han, Zhongyi; Wei, Benzheng; Zheng, Yuanjie; Hong, Yanfei; Cong, Jinyu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12592v2.pdf,366

The VHH family forms a set of interesting proteins derived from antibodies that maintain their capacity to recognize the antigen, despite their relatively small molecular weight (in the 12,000 Da range). Continuing our exploration of the possibilities of those molecules, we chose to design alternative molecules with maintained antigen recognition, but enhanced capacity, by fusing four VHH with one Fc, the fragment crystallizable region of antibodies. In doing so, we aimed at having a molecule with superior quantitative antigen recognition (×4) while maintaining its size below the 110 kDa. In the present paper, we described the building of those molecules that we coined VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 . The structure of VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 in complex with HER2 antigen was determined using electronic microscopy and modeling. The molecule is shown to bind four HER2 proteins at the end of its flexible arms. VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 also shows an internalization capacity via HER2 receptor superior to the reference anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, Herceptin®, and to a simple fusion of two VHH with one Fc (VHH2 -Fc). This new type of molecules, VHH2 -Fc-VHH2 , could be an interesting addition to the therapeutic arsenal with multiple applications, from diagnostic to therapy.","Chabrol, Eric; Fagnen, Charline; Landron, Sophie; Marcheteau, Estelle; Stojko, Johann; Guenin, Sophie-Pénélope; Antoine, Mathias; Fould, Benjamin; Ferry, Gilles; Boutin, Jean A; Vénien-Bryan, Catherine",Protein sci,,366

It is observed that the proposed method yields high accuracy for short term prediction with error less than 3% for daily predictions and less than 8% for weekly predictions. Indian states are categorised into different zones based on the spread of positive cases and daily growth rate for easy identification of novel coronavirus hot-spots. Preventive measures to reduce the spread in respective zones are also suggested. A website is created where the state-wise predictions are updated using the proposed model for authorities,researchers and planners.

OBJECTIVE: (1) evaluate the effectiveness and cost of using social media news feed advertisements, clinic-based approach, and web-based snowball sampling to reach inadequately active adults with T1D, and (2) compare characteristics of enrollees against normative data. METHODS: Participants were recruited between November 2019 and August 2020. Method #1: Facebook and Instagram news feed advertisements ran for five 1-8 day windows targeting adults (18-64yr) in the greater New Haven and Hartford, CT areas with &#8805;1 diabetes-related profile interest. If interested, participants completed a webform so that the research team could contact them for eligibility screening. Method #2: In-person approach of patients 18-24yr with T1D at clinical visits November-December 2019. Those interested immediately completed eligibility screening. Older patients could not be approached due to clinic restrictions. Method #3: Snowball sampling by physically active individuals with T1D contacting their peers on Facebook and emails for 48 days with details to contact the research staff to express interest and complete eligibility screening. Other methods referred participants similarly to snowball sampling. RESULTS: Method #1: Advertisements were displayed to 11,738 unique viewers and attracted 274 clickers (2.33%), of whom 20 (7.3%) volunteered, of whom 8 (40%) were eligible. Costs averaged US $1.20 per click and US $95.88 per eligible volunteer. Men had lower click rates than women (1.71% vs 3.17%, P < .001) but their responsiveness and eligibility rates did not differ. Method #2: We approached 40 patients of whom 32 (80%) inquired about the study, of whom 20 (63%) volunteered, of whom 2 (10%) were eligible. Costs including personnel for in-person approaches averaged US $21.01 per inquirer and US $479.79 per eligible volunteer. Method #3: Snowball sampling generated 13 inquirers, of whom 12 (92%) volunteered, of whom 8 (67%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible and total costs averaged $20.59 per eligible volunteer. Other methods yielded 7 inquirers, of whom 5 (71%) volunteered, of whom 2 (40%) were eligible. Incremental costs to attract inquirers were negligible and total costs averaged $34.94 per eligible volunteer. Demographic overrepresentations emerged in the overall cohort (optimal glycemic control, obesity, low exercise), those recruited by news feed (obesity, older age), and snowball sampling (optimal glycemic control, low exercise). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based advertising and recruitment strategies are a promising means to attract adults with T1D to clinical trials and exercise interventions, costs comparing favorably to prior trials despite targeting an uncommon condition (i.e., T1D) and commitment to an intervention. They should be tailored in future studies to increase access to higher-risk participants.","Ash, Garrett I; Griggs, Stephanie; Nally, Laura M; Stults-Kolehmainen, Matthew; Jeon, Sangchoon; Brandt, Cynthia; Gulanski, Barbara I; Spanakis, Elias K; Baker, Julien S; Whittemore, Robin; Weinzimer, Stuart A; Fucito, Lisa M",,,366

435579,The use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland: A survey study of 2315 young adults,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Tracheostomy is an important surgical procedure for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients who underwent prolonged tracheal intubation. Surgical indication of tracheostomy is greatly affected by the general condition of the patient, comorbidity, prognosis, hospital resources, and staff experience. Thus, the optimal timing of tracheostomy remains controversial. METHODS: We reviewed our early experience with COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at one tertiary hospital in Japan from February to September 2020 and analyzed the timing of tracheostomy, operative results, and occupational infection in healthcare workers (HCWs). RESULTS: Of 16 patients received tracheal intubation with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, five patients (31%) received surgical tracheostomy in our hospital. The average consultation time for surgical tracheostomy was 7.4 days (range, 6 - 9 days) from the COVID-19 team to the otolaryngologist. The duration from tracheal intubation to tracheostomy ranged from 14 to 27 days (average, 20 days). The average time of tracheostomy was 27 min (range, 17 - 39 min), and post-wound bleeding occurred in only one patient. No significant differences in hemoglobin (Hb) levels were found between the pre- and postoperative periods (mean: 10.2 vs. 10.2 g/dl, p = 0.93). Similarly, no difference was found in white blood cell (WBC) count (mean: 12,200 vs. 9,900 cells /µl, p = 0.25). After the tracheostomy, there was no occupational infection among the HCWs who assisted the tracheostomy patients during the perioperative period. CONCLUSION: We proposed a modified weaning protocol and surgical indications of tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients and recommend that an optimal timing for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients of 2 - 3 weeks after tracheal intubation, from our early experiences in Japan. An experienced multi-disciplinary tracheostomy team is essential to perform a safe tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and to minimize the risk of occupational infection in HCWs.","Nishio, Naoki; Hiramatsu, Mariko; Goto, Yukari; Shindo, Yuichiro; Yamamoto, Takanori; Jingushi, Naruhiro; Wakahara, Keiko; Sone, Michihiko",Auris nasus larynx,,366

However, limited information describing their clinical characteristics and outcomes exists. Our study aims to describe clinical features and risk stratification strategies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with PE. We retrospectively analyzed 101 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and acute PE. Clinical outcomes measured were intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, bleeding and transfusion events, acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality. Pulmonary severity index (PESI) scores were used for risk stratification. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (50%), obesity (27%) and hyperlipidemia (32%) among this cohort. Baseline D-dimer abnormalities (4,647.0 ± 8,281.8) were noted on admission with a 3-fold increase at the time of PE diagnosis (13,288.4 ± 14,917.9; p <0.05). Five (5%) patients required systemic thrombolysis and 12 (12%) patients experienced moderate to severe bleeding. Thirty-one (31%) patients developed AKI and 1 (1%) patient required renal replacement therapy. Twenty-three (23%) patients were admitted to intensive care unit, of which 20 (20%) patients received mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate was 20%. Most patients (65%) had Intermediate to high risk PESI scores (>85), which portended a worse prognosis with higher mortality rate and length of stay. In conclusion, this study provides characteristics and early outcomes for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and acute pulmonary embolism. PESI scores were utilized for risk stratifying clinical outcomes. Our results should serve to alert the medical community to heighted vigilance of this VTE complication associated with COVID-19 infection.","Xu, Hai; Martin, Angel; Singh, Avneet; Narasimhan, Mangala; Lau, Joe; Weinberg, Mitchell; Jauhar, Rajiv; Rao, Gaurav",Am J Cardiol,,366

437076,The effects of psychobiotics on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in early-life stress and neuropsychiatric disorders,2020,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in millions of infections worldwide. While the search for an effective antiviral is still ongoing, experimental therapies based on repurposing of available antivirals is being attempted, of which HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have gained considerable interest. Inhibition profiling of the PIs directly against the viral protease has never been attempted in vitro, and while few studies reported an efficacy of lopinavir and ritonavir in SARS-CoV-2 context, the mechanism of action of the drugs remains to be validated. METHODS: We carried out an in-depth analysis of the efficacy of HIV PIs against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro) in cell culture and in vitro enzymatic assays, using a methodology that enabled us to focus solely on any potential inhibitory effects of the inhibitors against the viral protease. For cell culture experiments a dark-to-bright GFP reporter substrate system was designed. RESULTS: Lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, saquinavir, and atazanavir were able to inhibit the viral protease in cell culture, albeit in concentrations much higher than their achievable plasma levels, given their current drug formulations. While inhibition by lopinavir was attributed to its cytotoxicity, ritonavir was the most effective of the panel, with IC50 of 13.7 µM. None of the inhibitors showed significant inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in our in vitro enzymatic assays up to 100 µM concentration. CONCLUSION: Targeting of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by some of the HIV PIs might be of limited clinical potential, given the high concentration of the drugs required to achieve significant inhibition. Therefore, given their weak inhibition of the viral protease, any potential beneficial effect of the PIs in COVID-19 context might perhaps be attributed to acting on other molecular target(s), rather than SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Mahdi, Mohamed; Mótyán, János András; Szojka, Zsófia Ilona; Golda, Mária; Miczi, Márió; Tozsér, József",Virol J,,366

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey of parents of primary and secondary school-age children. SETTING: Community setting. PARTICIPANTS: 1214 parents of school-age children in the UK. METHODS: An online survey explored the impact of lockdown on the mental health of parents with school-age children, and in particular about feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Associations between the UCLA Three-Item Loneliness Scale (UCLATILS), the Direct Measure of Loneliness (DMOL) and the characteristics of the study participants were assessed using ordinal logistic regression models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported measures of social isolation and loneliness using UCLATILS and DMOL. RESULTS: Half of respondents felt they lacked companionship, 45% had feelings of being left out, 58% felt isolated and 46% felt lonely during the first 100 days of lockdown. The factors that were associated with higher levels of loneliness on UCLATILS were female gender, parenting a child with special needs, lack of a dedicated space for distance learning, disruption of sleep patterns and low levels of physical activity during the lockdown. Factors associated with a higher DMOL were female gender, single parenting, parenting a child with special needs, unemployment, low physical activity, lack of a dedicated study space and disruption of sleep patterns during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown has increased feelings of social isolation and loneliness among parents of school-age children. The sustained adoption of two modifiable health-seeking lifestyle behaviours (increased levels of physical activity and the maintenance of good sleep hygiene practices) wmay help reduce feelings of social isolation and loneliness during lockdown.","El-Osta, Austen; Alaa, Aos; Webber, Iman; Riboli Sasco, Eva; Bagkeris, Emmanouil; Millar, Helen; Vidal-Hall, Charlotte; Majeed, Azeem",BMJ Open,,366

In Spain, 68% of all coronavirus hospitalizations correspond to those over 60 years of age. This work aims to highlight the evidence about the measures to be implemented through current and future guidelines. The need to prepare for action by implementing international protocols stand out. There is a trend towards biopsychosocial care of elderly people in all settings where they are, adapting care and personalizing decisions on hospital admissions, palliative care, among other criteria, to years adjusted to quality of life, as well as alternatives for monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 pathology and others existing in this population group. Measures to reduce the transmission of the virus through hygiene and social distancing are necessary, attending to biopsychosocial health of the elderly isolated. Intersectoral communication is proposed as innovative alternatives, and the use of technological tools, accompanied by adequate digital health literacy. Future lines focus on guaranteeing social and health rights, equating the social and health system at the same level, and achieving real coordination.

440003,Impact of Treatment With TNF-α Inhibitors for Hidradenitis Suppurativa During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Recent efforts in understanding the course and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections have highlighted both potential beneficial as well as detrimental effects of cross-reactive antibodies derived from memory immunity. Specifically, due to a significant degree of sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the coronavirus family, memory B-cells that emerged from previous infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) could be re-activated upon encountering the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, thus prompting the production of cross-reactive antibodies. Understanding the affinity and concentration of these potentially cross-reactive antibodies to the new SARS-CoV-2 antigens is therefore particularly important when assessing both existing immunity against common HCoVs and adverse effects like antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in COVID-19. However, these two fundamental parameters cannot easily be deconvoluted by surface-based assays like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which are routinely used to assess cross-reactivity. Here, we have used microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling (MAAP) to quantitatively evaluate the humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent patients by determining both antibody affinity and concentration against spike antigens of SARS-CoV-2 directly in nine convalescent COVID-19 patient and three pre-pandemic sera that were seropositive for common HCoVs. All 12 sera contained low concentrations of high affinity antibodies against spike antigens of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, indicative of past exposure to these pathogens, while the affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was lower. These results suggest that cross-reactivity as a consequence of memory re-activation upon an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection may not be a significant factor in generating immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Denninger, Viola; Xu, Catherine K.; Meisl, Georg; Morgunov, Alexey S.; Fiedler, Sebastian; Ilsley, Alison; Emmenegger, Marc; Malik, Anisa Y.; Piziorska, Monika A.; Schneider, Matthias M.; Devenish, Sean R.

Although children appear to have a lower risk compared to adults of severe COVID-19 disease, a substantial number of children globally will benefit from pharmacologic treatments. It will be reasonable to extrapolate efficacy of most treatments from adult trials to children. Pediatric trials should focus on characterizing a treatment's pharmacokinetics, optimal dose and safety, across the age spectrum.

Our aim was to evaluate the content-quality and audience engagement of YouTube videos pertaining to the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)-CoV-2 virus which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), during the early phase of the pandemic. We chose the first 30 videos for seven different search phrases: ""2019 nCoV,"" ""SARS CoV-2,"" ""COVID-19 virus,"" ""coronavirus treatment,"" ""coronavirus explained,"" ""what is the coronavirus"" and ""coronavirus information."" Video contents were evaluated by two independent medical students with more than 5 years of experience using the DISCERN instrument. Qualitative data, quantitative data and upload source for each video was noted for a quality and audience engagement analysis. Out of the total 210 videos, 137 met our inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The mean DISCERN score was 31.33 out of 75 possible points, which indicates that the quality of YouTube videos on COVID-19 is currently poor. There was excellent reliability between the two raters (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.96). 55% of the videos discussed prevention, 49% discussed symptoms and 46% discussed the spread of the virus. Most of the videos were uploaded by news channels (50%) and education channels (40%).

442674,Patient satisfaction and associated factors during COVID-19 pandemic in North Shoa health care facilities,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Recent rampant spread of COVID-19 cases in nursing homes has highlighted the concerns around nursing homes' ability to contain the spread of infections. The ability of nursing homes to invest in quality improvement initiatives may depend on resource availability. In this study, we sought to examine whether lower profit margins, as a proxy for lack of resources, are associated with persistent infection control citations. DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Medicare-certified nursing homes in the US with financial and facility characteristics data (n = 12,194). METHODS: We combined facility-level data on nursing home profit margins from Medicare Cost Reports with deficiency citation data from Nursing Home Compare (2017-2019) and facility characteristics data from LTCFocus.org. We descriptively analyzed infection control citations by profit margins quintiles. We used logistic regressions to examine the relationship between profit margin quintiles and citations for infection prevention and control, adjusting for facility and market characteristics. RESULTS: About three-fourths of all facilities received deficiency citations for infection prevention and control during 1 or more years from 2017 to 2019 with about 10% of facilities cited in all 3 years. Facilities in the highest profit margin quintile had 7.6% of facilities with citations for infection prevention and control in each of the 3 years compared with 8.1%, 10.0%, 10.7%, and 13.7% for facilities in the fourth, third, second, and first quintiles of profit margins, respectively. Multivariable regressions showed that facilities with the lowest profit margins (first quintile) had 54.3% higher odds of being cited in at least 1 year and 87.6% higher odds of being cited in each of the 3 years compared with facilities with the highest profit margins (fifth quintile). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicate that nursing homes may need more resources to prevent citations for infection prevention and control.","Sharma, Hari; Xu, Lili",J. Am. Med. Dir.

Previous studies on cells and model lipid bilayers featuring phase-separated domains found an intricate interplay between the membrane geometry and its chemical composition. However, the lack of a model system with simultaneous control over the membrane shape and conservation of its composition precluded a fundamental understanding of curvature-induced effects. Here, we present a new class of multicomponent vesicles supported by colloidal scaffolds of designed shape. We find that the domain composition adapts to the geometry, giving rise to a novel""antimixed""state. Theoretical modelling allowed us to link the pinning of domains by regions of high curvature to the material parameters of the membrane. Our results provide key insights into the phase separation of cellular membranes and on curved surfaces in general.","Rinaldin, Melissa; Fonda, Piermarco; Giomi, Luca; Kraft, Daniela J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08596v1.pdf,366

Infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19) may remain asymptomatic in the initial phase, leading to under-recognition and incidental detection on procedures for standard clinical indications. Hospitals, in particular diagnostic imaging services, should prepare accordingly in regard to health precautions while keeping in mind the potential discrepancies between clinical presentation and resultant radiologic patterns. This awareness should be heightened in patients at higher risk (ie, prisoners). Furthermore, by acting upon the incidental detection of this virus during its early stages, subsequent steps could help prevent the spread of the virus.","Yoo, Kevin; Choi, Robert Y.; Sun, Justin; Veselis, Clinton; Kamat, Bhishak; Kumaran, Maruti; Agosto, Omar; Maresky, Hillel S.",Radiol.

Are conjunctival congestion and conjunctiva-related symptoms in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus definitely related to the novel coronavirus? Conjunctival congestion is one of the common clinical signs of various types of conjunctivitis. The symptoms and signs of conjunctivitis in COVID-19 patients may be attributed to a variety of factors.

It has also enthused practitioners, due to the major implications for improving forecast-driven decision-making. The evidence in support of the superforecasting hypothesis was provided via a 4-year project led by Tetlock and Mellers, which was based on an exhaustive experiment with more than 5000 experts across the globe, resulting in identifying 260 superforecasters. The result, however, jeopardizes the applicability of the proposition, as exciting as it may be for the academic world; if every company in the world needs to rely on the aforementioned 260 experts, then this will end up an impractical and expensive endeavor. Thus, it would make sense to test the superforecasting hypothesis in real-life conditions: when only a small pool of experts is available, and there is limited time to identify the superforecasters. If under these constrained conditions the hypothesis still holds, then many small and medium-sized organizations could identify fast and consequently utilize their own superforecasters. In this study, we provide supportive empirical evidence from an experiment with an initial (small) pool of 314 experts and an identification phase of (just) 9 months. Furthermore - and corroborating to the superforecasting literature, we also find preliminary evidence that even an additional training of just 20 min, can influence positively the number of superforecasters identified.","Katsagounos, Ilias; Thomakos, Dimitrios D; Litsiou, Konstantia; Nikolopoulos, Konstantinos",European journal of operational research,,366

451843,Patient experience after modifying visit delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social interactions were restricted, including community services for disabled older adults. This study aimed to describe the change of use in community services related to long-term care insurance (LTCI) during the pandemic in Japan. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted using data collected via a cloud-based management support platform for older adult care provider ""Kaipoke"", by a private-sector company ""SMS Co., Ltd."", in which care-managers of LTCI manage their office work. Data collection occurred from July 2019 to June 2020. Study subjects were LTCI service users aged 65 years and above. Subjects were living at home. We examined changes in the number of users of LTCI services before and after the COVID-19 pandemic began, using an interrupted time-series analysis. Results indicated that the use of outpatient services was reduced; however, home-visit services were maintained. The decrease in use was significant in the seven prefectures where the infection initially spread. There are concerns that older adults or surrounding caregivers can be affected by such changes in LTC service use. It is therefore necessary to implement sustainable measures from a long-term perspective and investigate their influence as part of future studies.","Ito, Tomoko; Hirata-Mogi, Sachiko; Watanabe, Taeko; Sugiyama, Takehiro; Jin, Xueying; Kobayashi, Shu; Tamiya, Nanako",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366
453246,Lessons from healthcare personnel screening and management during H1N1 pandemic in preparation for the impending COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in India,2020,"A global pandemic has significantly impacted the ability to conduct diagnostic evaluations for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the wake of the coronavirus, autism centers and providers quickly needed to implement innovative diagnostic processes to adapt in order to continue serve patient needs while minimizing the spread of the virus. The International Collaborative for Diagnostic Evaluation of Autism (IDEA) is a grassroots organization that came together to discuss standards of care during the pandemic and to provide a forum wherein providers communicated decisions. This white paper is intended to provide examples of how different centers adjusted their standard approaches to conduct diagnostic evaluations for ASD during the pandemic and to provide insight to other centers as they go through similar challenges.","Jang, Jina; White, Stormi Pulver; Esler, Amy N; Kim, So Hyun; Klaiman, Cheryl; Megerian, Jonathan T; Morse, Amy; Nadler, Cy; Kanne, Stephen M",J. autism dev. disord,,366
453247,Lessons from healthcare personnel screening and management during H1N1 pandemic in preparation for the impending COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in India,2020,"Point-of-care tests (POCTs) offer considerable potential for improving clinical and public health management of COVID-19 by providing timely information to guide decision-making, but data on real-world performance are in short supply. Besides SARS-CoV-2-specific tests, there is growing interest in the role of surrogate (non-specific) tests such as FebriDx, a biochemical POCT which can be used to distinguish viral from bacterial infection in patients with influenza-like illnesses. This short report assesses what is currently known about FebriDx performance across settings and populations by comparison with some of the more intensively evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific POCTs. While FebriDx shows some potential in supporting triage for early-stage infection in acute care settings, this is dependent on SARS-CoV-2 being the most likely cause for influenza-like illnesses, with reduction in discriminatory power when COVID-19 case numbers are low, and when co-circulating viral respiratory infections become more prevalent during the autumn and winter. Too little is currently known about its performance in primary care and the community to support use in these contexts, and further evaluation is needed. Reliable SARS CoV2-specific POCTs-when they become available-are likely to rapidly overtake surrogates as the preferred option given the greater specificity they provide.","Ismail, Sharif A; Huntley, Catherine; Post, Nathan; Rigby, Samuel; Shrotri, Madhumita; Williams, Sarah V; Peacock, Sharon J",Influenza other respir. viruses,,366
453248,Lessons from healthcare personnel screening and management during H1N1 pandemic in preparation for the impending COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital in India,2020,"BACKGROUND: Substantial limitations have been imposed on passenger air travel to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between regions and countries. However, as case numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks elsewhere. METHODS: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location, accounting for local population density. RESULTS: Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United States, Europe, and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in flight volumes and destination population densities create a non-uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of an outbreak. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health interventions.","Daon, Yair; Thompson, Robin N; Obolski, Uri",J. travel med,,366
453608,The relationship between Vitamin D deficiency and polycystic ovary syndrome,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have been employed as a public and personal health control measure against the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Their use is intended as personal protection to prevent infection and as source control to limit transmission of the virus in a community or healthcare setting. Yet the wearing of masks has become a catalyst for political conflict, an arena where scientific evidence is often viewed through a partisan lens. The way that anti-maskers chafe at the mask requirement evokes a time when people were advised to wear a mask during the 1918 pandemic. As the Spanish flu swept through the world causing global devastation in 1918 and 1919, face masks became ubiquitous to help in preventing the spread of disease. A century apart, medical authorities urged and urge the wearing of masks to help slow the spread of disease. Nonetheless, people were and remain resistant to this simple and common sense advice. The purpose of this article is twofold: to provide a brief literature review on the unequivocal scientific evidence that masks reduce community transmission in view of the current pandemic, review mask use in children and to compare and contrast attitudes to mask wearing during the Spanish flu and the COVID-19 pandemic, and analyse where these attitudes stem from.","Scerri, Mariella; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,,366

This study evaluated students' experience in the course, the curriculum content and format, and its short-term impact on students' knowledge and attitudes around COVID-19. METHODS: Students responded to discussion board prompts throughout the course and submitted pre-/post-course reflections. Pre-/post-course questionnaires assessed pandemic knowledge and attitudes using 4-point Likert scales. Authors collected aggregate data on enrollment, discussion posts, field placements, and scholarly work resulting from course activities. After the elective, authors conducted a focus group with a convenience sample of 6 participants. Institutional elective evaluation data was included in analysis. Authors analyzed questionnaire data with summary statistics and paired t-tests comparing knowledge and attitudes before and after the elective. Reflection pieces, discussion posts, and focus group data were analyzed using content analysis with a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: Twenty-seven students enrolled. Each student posted an average of 2.4 original discussion posts and 3.1 responses. Mean knowledge score increased from 43.8 to 60.8% (p < 0.001) between pre- and post-course questionnaires. Knowledge self-assessment also increased (2.4 vs. 3.5 on Likert scale, p < 0.0001), and students reported increased engagement in the pandemic response (2.7 vs. 3.6, p < 0.0001). Students reported increased fluency in discussing the pandemic and increased appreciation for the field of public health. There was no difference in students' level of anxiety about the pandemic after course participation (3.0 vs. 3.1, p = 0.53). Twelve students (44.4%) completed the institutional evaluation. All rated the course ""very good"" or ""excellent."" Students favorably reviewed the field placements, suggested readings, self-directed research, and learning from peers. They suggested more clearly defined expectations and improved balance between volunteer and educational hours. CONCLUSIONS: The elective was well-received by students, achieved stated objectives, and garnered public attention. Course leadership should monitor students' time commitment closely in service-learning settings to ensure appropriate balance of service and education. Student engagement in a disaster response is insufficient to address anxiety related to the disaster; future course iterations should include a focus on self-care during times of crisis. This educational innovation could serve as a model for medical schools globally.","Altillo, Brandon S A; Gray, Megan; Avashia, Swati B; Norwood, Aliza; Nelson, Elizabeth A; Johnston, Clarissa; Bhavnani, Darlene; Patel, Hemali; Allen, Coburn H; Adeni, Sarayu; Phelps, Nicholas D; Mercer, Tim",BMC Med Educ,,366
454239,Proximal femur fractures in COVID-19 emergency: the experience of two Orthopedics and Traumatology Departments in the first eight weeks of the Italian epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive therapies are developed on the principle that specific cognitive appraisals are key determinants in the development and maintenance of mental health disorders. It is likely that particular appraisals of the coronavirus pandemic will have explanatory power for subsequent mental health outcomes in the general public. To enable testing of this hypothesis we developed a questionnaire assessing coronavirus-related cognitions. METHODS: 12 285 participants completed online a 46-item pool of cognitions about coronavirus and six measures of different mental health problems. The sample was randomly split into derivation and validation samples. Exploratory factor analyses determined the factor structure, selection of items, and model fit in the derivation sample. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) then tested this model in the validation sample. Associations of the questionnaire with mental health outcomes were examined. RESULTS: The 26-item, seven-factor, Oxford Psychological Investigation of Coronavirus Questionnaire [TOPIC-Q] was developed. CFA demonstrated a good model fit (&#967;2 = 2108.43, df = 278, p < 0.001, comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.950, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.942, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.033, standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.038). The factors were: cognitions about (1) safety and vulnerability, (2) negative long-term impact, (3) having the virus, (4) spreading the virus, (5) social judgment, (6) negative self, and (7) being targeted. The questionnaire explained significant variance in depression (45.8%), social anxiety (37.3%), agoraphobia (23.2%), paranoia (27.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (57.1%), and panic disorder (31.4%). Cognitions about negative long-term impact had the greatest explanatory power across disorders. CONCLUSIONS: TOPIC-Q provides a method to assess appraisals of the pandemic, which is likely to prove helpful both in longitudinal studies assessing mental health outcomes and in delivery of psychological therapy.","Rosebrock, Laina; Cernis, Emma; Lambe, Sinéad; Waite, Felicity; Rek, Stephanie; Petit, Ariane; Ehlers, Anke; Clark, David M; Freeman, Daniel",Psychol Med,,366

454278,"Association among income loss, financial strain and depressive symptoms during COVID-19: evidence from two longitudinal studies",2020,"INTRODUCTION: For patients with COVID-19, several characteristics have been identified that may be associated with adverse outcomes. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the effect of obesity on young adult patients with COVID-19. We sought to identify whether adverse outcomes are associated with obesity, particularly in COVID-19 patients 45 years and younger. METHODS: This was a two-center, retrospective cohort study that included 210 patients. Eligible patients were between the ages of 18-45 years old, had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction via nasopharyngeal swab, and were not pregnant. Primary outcomes were defined as follows: 1) in-hospital mortality during the study period; 2) need for mechanical ventilation; and 3) admission to the hospital. We analyzed baseline characteristics of the cohort using descriptive statistics. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated to assess associations between outcomes and obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) >30. RESULTS: Of those patients who tested positive, 18 died during hospitalization (9%), 36 (17%) required mechanical ventilation, and 94 (45%) were admitted. Each of the primary outcomes was significantly associated with a BMI >30 (mortality OR = 6.29, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76-22.46, p = 0.0046; mechanical ventilation OR = 6.01, 95% CI, 2.5-14.48, p = 0.0001; admission OR 2.61, 95% CI, 1.49-4.58, p =.0008). CONCLUSION: Obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in young patients with COVID-19. Future studies examining the clinical characteristics and risk factors of COVID-19 patients across large, diverse populations will strengthen our understanding of this novel and complex disease.","Steinberg, Eric; Wright, Ellsworth; Kushner, Beth",West J Emerg Med,,366

In this study, we investigated human T cell recall responses to fully glycosylated spike trimer, recombinant N protein, as well as to S, N, M, and E peptide pools in the early convalescent phase and compared them with influenza-specific memory responses from the same donors. All subjects showed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses to at least one Ag. Both SARS-CoV-2-specific and influenza-specific CD4+ T cell responses were predominantly of the central memory phenotype; however SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells exhibited a lower IFN-Î³ to TNF ratio compared with influenza-specific memory responses from the same donors, independent of disease severity. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were less multifunctional than influenza-specific T cells, particularly in severe cases, potentially suggesting exhaustion. Most SARS-CoV-2-convalescent subjects also produced IFN-Î³ in response to seasonal OC43 S protein. We observed granzyme B+/IFN-Î³+, CD4+, and CD8+ proliferative responses to peptide pools in most individuals, with CD4+ T cell responses predominating over CD8+ T cell responses. Peripheral T follicular helper (pTfh) responses to S or N strongly correlated with serum neutralization assays as well as receptor binding domain-specific IgA; however, the frequency of pTfh responses to SARS-CoV-2 was lower than the frequency of pTfh responses to influenza virus. Overall, T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 are robust; however, CD4+ Th1 responses predominate over CD8+ T cell responses, have a more inflammatory profile, and have a weaker pTfh response than the response to influenza virus within the same donors, potentially contributing to COVID-19 disease.","Law, Jaclyn C; Koh, Wan Hon; Budylowski, Patrick; Lin, Jonah; Yue, FengYun; Abe, Kento T; Rathod, Bhavisha; Girard, Melanie; Li, Zhijie; Rini, James M; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison; Chan, Adrienne K; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Watts, Tania H; A Ostrowski, Mario",,,366

455123,Assessing the Relationship between Infection Citations and COVID-19 Infections in Nursing Homes,2021,"Introduction: Rwanda has made significant advancements in medical and economic development over the last 20 years and has emerged as a leader in healthcare in the East African region. The COVID-19 pandemic, which reached Rwanda in March 2020, presented new and unique challenges for infectious disease control. The objective of this paper is to characterize Rwanda's domestic response to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight effective strategies so that other countries, including high and middle-income countries, can learn from its innovative initiatives. Methods: Government publications describing Rwanda's healthcare capacity were first consulted to obtain the country's baseline context. Next, official government and healthcare system communications, including case counts, prevention and screening protocols, treatment facility practices, and behavioral guidelines for the public, were read thoroughly to understand the course of the pandemic in Rwanda and the specific measures in the response. Results: As of 31 December 2020, Rwanda has recorded 8,383 cumulative COVID-19 cases, 6,542 recoveries, and 92 deaths since the first case on 14 March 2020. The Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Centre, and the Epidemic and Surveillance Response division have collaborated on preparative measures since the pandemic began in January 2020. The formation of a Joint Task Force in early March led to the Coronavirus National Preparedness and Response Plan, an extensive six-month plan that established a national incident management system and detailed four phases of a comprehensive national response. Notable strategies have included disseminating public information through drones, robots for screening and inpatient care, and official communications through social media platforms to combat misinformation and mobilize a cohesive response from the population. Conclusion: Rwanda's government and healthcare system has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with innovative interventions to prevent and contain the virus. Importantly, the response has utilized adaptive and innovative technology and robust risk communication and community engagement to deliver an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Karim, Naz; Jing, Ling; Lee, J Austin; Kharel, Ramu; Lubetkin, Derek; Clancy, Camille M; Uwamahoro, Doris; Nahayo, Ernest; Biramahire, Joseph; Aluisio, Adam R; Ndebwanimana, Vincent",Ann Glob Health,,366

455777,Paediatric dental A&E service during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Serological testing is needed to investigate the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from front-line essential workers to their household members. However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of finger stick capillary whole blood, collected in the home and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). We describe assay performance and demonstrate its utility for remote sampling with results from a community-based study. METHODS: An ELISA to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized to quantify IgG antibodies in DBS. Samples were self-collected from a community sample of 232 participants enriched with health care workers, including 30 known COVID-19 cases and their household members. RESULTS: Among 30 individuals sharing a household with a virus-confirmed case of COVID-19, 80% were seropositive. Of 202 community individuals without prior confirmed acute COVID-19 diagnoses, 36% were seropositive. Of documented convalescent COVID-19 cases from the community, 29 of 30 (97%) were seropositive for IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain. CONCLUSION: DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection. Early analysis suggests a high rate of transmission among household members. High rates of seroconversion were also noted following recovery from infection. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples can facilitate seroprevalence assessment in community settings to address epidemiological questions, monitor duration of antibody responses, and assess if antibodies against the spike protein correlate with protection from reinfection.","McDade, Thomas W; McNally, Elizabeth M; Zelikovich, Aaron S; D039,; Aquila, Richard; Mustanski, Brian; Miller, Aaron; Vaught, Lauren A; Reiser, Nina L; Bogdanovic, Elena; Fallon, Katherine S; Demonbreun, Alexis R",PLoS One,,366

As part of ongoing work, AU$10000 was provided to the community to address important, self-determined, health priorities through the Can Get Health in Canterbury program. Program staff worked with community members to support the planning and implementation of two community-led events: a soccer (football) tournament and a picnic day. This paper explores the potential for this funding model and the effect of the project on both the community and health services. Data were qualitatively analysed using a range of data sources within the project. These included, attendance sheets, meeting minutes, qualitative field notes, staff reflections and transcripts of focus group and individual discussions. This analysis identified that the project: (1) enabled community empowerment and collective control over funding decisions relating to their health; (2) supported social connection among the Australian Rohingya community; (3) built capacity in the community welfare organisation -Burmese Rohingya Community Australia; and (4) enabled reflective practice and learnings. This paper presents an innovative model for engaging with refugee communities.

Cremation law requires collection of clinical information that can improve understanding of deaths in both hospital and community settings. Age, sex, date and place of death, occupation, comorbidities and where infection acquired was recorded for all deaths from COVID-19, between 6 April and 30 May, for whom an application was made for cremation at a South Wales' crematorium. Of 752 cremations, 215 (28.6%) were COVID-19 (115 (53.5%) male and 100 (46.5%) female). Median age was 82 years (youngest patient 47 and the oldest 103 years). Over half the deaths (121/215: 56.3%) were over 80 years. Males' odds of dying in hospital, rather than the community were 1.96 times that of females (95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.03-3.74, P = 0.054) despite being of similar age and having a similar number of comorbidities. Only 21 (9.8%) of 215 patients had no comorbidities recorded. Patients dying in care homes were significantly older than those dying in hospital (median 88 years (interquartile (IQ) range 82-93 years) vs. 80 years (IQ range 71-87 years): P < 0.0001). Patients dying in hospital had significantly more comorbidities than those dying in care homes (median 2: IQ range 1-3 vs. 1: IQ range 1-2: P < 0.001). Sixty three (29.3%) of infections were hospital acquired and a further 55 (25.6%) acquired in care homes. In a series, of hospital and community deaths, persons over 80 with an average two comorbidities predominated. Men were more likely to die in hospital. Half the infections were acquired in hospitals or care homes with implications for management of the pandemic.","Salmon, R L; Monaghan, S P",Epidemiol Infect,,366

COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world in a short time. Confronted with such a highly infectious respiratory disease, the research and development of anti-COVID-19 drugs became an urgent work due to the lack of specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Nevertheless, several existing drugs are available to relieve the clinical symptoms of COVID-19. We reviewed information on selected anti-SARS-CoV-2 candidate therapeutic agents published until June 2, 2020. We also discussed the strategies of the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs in the future. Our review provides a novel insight into the future development of a safer, efficient, and toxic-less anti-COVID-19 drug.","Huang, Lianzhou; Chen, Yuanqiu; Xiao, Ji; Luo, Weisheng; Li, Feng; Wang, Yuan; Wang, Yiliang; Wang, Yifei",Front.

459828,Telehealth in cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Research on COVID-19 has reported data on epidemiology and pathophysiology but less about what it means to be a person living through this illness. Research involving the patients' perspectives may help to improve healthcare professionals' understanding of ways to support patients. AIMS: To gain in-depth understanding of the meaning of a COVID-19 illness trajectory from the patients' perspective. METHODS: Fifteen participants who had undergone an illness trajectory due to confirmed COVID-19 infection participated in individual qualitative interviews. Data collection, analysis and interpretation were inspired by Ricoeur's philosophy and Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception and embodiment has been applied as a theoretical frame. FINDINGS: Being infected with coronavirus is expressed as an experience in which the participants oscillate between relief, security, imprisonment and raw fear. A predominant focus on the physical dimensions of the diseased body was found in the encounters between patient and healthcare system, and distance may furthermore be a consequence of use of protective equipment. Stigma and fear of infection were also expressed. After COVID-19, an overwhelming feeling of a door opening to freedom is perceived. However, the body is marked, and bears witness to decay from this insidious and frightening virus. The responsibility for assessing their bodily symptoms is placed with the individual patients themselves, who feel lonely and fearful and this keeps them indoors. CONCLUSIONS: During a COVID-19 illness, trajectory concerns about the unknown course of this disease are highlighted. Isolation is confrontational; however, a companionship between patients might emerge. The study shed light on an unavoidable gap between the patients and healthcare professionals due to the use protective equipment. After COVID-19, the body is labelled as something others fear and become a symbol of awe and alienation for others.","Missel, Malene; Bernild, Camilla; Westh Christensen, Signe; Dagyaran, Ilkay; Kikkenborg Berg, Selina",Scand. j. caring sci,,366
461304,Who will receive the last ventilator: why COVID-19 policies should not prioritise healthcare workers,2021,"In partnership with Recreation Nova Scotia, we received a ""Community Mental Health"" grant from the Nova Scotia government based on the argument that: (1) recreation could be a resource for improving the mental health of all Nova Scotians, and (2) recreation practitioners needed access to training and resources so they could remove barriers to community participation and create more welcoming environments and programs. While the Recreation for Mental Health game was originally designed to train community recreation practitioners about the barriers people living with mental health problems experience when trying to access community recreation (and about strategies and supports to overcome these barriers), TR practitioners in Nova Scotia also advocated for the use of the game as a leisure education tool to support the recovery of their clients or patients. In addition to adding evidence to the leisure-based stress-coping literature, from our perspective this article highlights the importance of community-based and (largely volunteer driven/supported) organizations to ensure a spectrum of recreation-related supports and services are available to persons recovering from PTSD and other mental health disorders. Dr. Shintaro Kono and colleagues Ethan Blumhorst and Jasmine Cave have provided important insights on the benefits of an adaptive scuba diving program in their article titled ""An Exploratory Study of Adaptive Scuba Diving's Effects on Psychological Well-Being among Military Veterans"" Like the previous article, Kono and colleagues highlight the prevalence of mental health problems experienced by military veterans and the important role recreation can serve as an alternative therapy.","Hutchinson, Susan Sullivan Anne-Marie",Therapeutic Recreation Journal,,366
461394,COVID-19 Pandemic Significantly Decreases Acute Surgical Complaints,2020,"To battle with economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government implemented various measures to mitigate economic loss. From issuance of stimulus checks to reopening businesses, consumers had to constantly alter their behavior in response to government policies. Using anonymized card transactions and mobile device-based location tracking data, we analyze the factors that contribute to these behavior changes, focusing on stimulus check issuance and state-wide reopening. Our finding suggests that stimulus payment has a significant immediate effect of boosting spending, but it typically does not reverse a downward trend. State-wide reopening had a small effect on spending. Foot traffic increased gradually after stimulus check issuance, but only increased slightly after reopening, which also coincided or preceded several policy changes and confounding events (e.g., protests) in the US. We also find differences in the reaction to these policies in different regions in the US. Our results may be used to inform future economic recovery policies and their potential consumer response.","Yang, Zhiqing Choe Youngjun Martell Matthew",Journal of Safety Science and Resilience,,366

Additional pressure created by coronavirus adversely affected the mental health and psychological well-being of healthcare workers, leading many to question their desire and willingness to continue working in healthcare. This study aimed to identify predictors for career change ideation among healthcare professionals in two countries; Lithuania and the United Kingdom amid the coronavirus pandemic. In total, 610 healthcare professionals from Lithuania and the UK (285 and 325, respectively) participated in a survey from May to August 2020. Psychological distress and psychological well-being were measured using the self-report scales ""DASS-21"" and ""WHO-5"". Almost half of the sample (49.2%), 59.6% and 40.0% in Lithuanian and the UK, respectively, exhibited career change ideation, the country effect was significant (AOR = 2.21, p < 0.001). Stronger ideation to leave healthcare was predicted by higher levels of depression (AOR = 1.10, p = 0.005), stress (AOR = 1.10, p = 0.007), anxiety surrounding inadequate personal protective equipment (AOR = 2.27, p = 0.009), and lower psychological well-being scores (AOR = 1.10, p = 0.007). We conclude that psychosocial support must be provided for healthcare professionals to prevent burnout and loss of staff amid the pandemic.","Norkiene, Ieva; Jovarauskaite, Lina; Kvedaraite, Monika; Uppal, Encarl; Phull, Mandeep Kaur; Chander, Heidi; Halford, Kathryn; Kazlauskas, Evaldas",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,366

We created a cohort of Veterans who were tested positive for COVID-19, extracted data on age, gender, and race, and clinical characteristics from their electronic health records, and trained a DNN model for predicting the adverse outcome. Then, we analyzed the association of the demographic variables with the risks of the adverse outcome using the impact scores and interaction scores for explaining DNN models. The results showed that, on average, older age and African American race were associated with higher risks while female gender was associated with lower risks. However, individual-level impact scores of age showed that age was a more impactful risk factor in younger patients and in older patients with fewer comorbidities. The individual-level impact scores of gender and race variables had a wide span covering both positive and negative values. The interaction scores between the demographic variables showed that the interaction effects were minimal compared to the impact scores associated with them. In conclusion, the DNN model is able to capture the non-linear relationship between the risk factors and the adverse outcome, and the impact scores and interaction scores can help explain the complicated non-linear effects between the demographic variables and the risk of the outcome.","Shao, Yijun; Ahmed, Ali; Liappis, Angelike P; Faselis, Charles; Nelson, Stuart J; Zeng-Treitler, Qing",J Healthc Inform Res,,366

And in the current post-COVID-19 era, agricultural SMEs have difficulty in obtaining the favours of financial institutions in normal lending due to their weak credit guarantee capabilities and high credit management costs. Difficulty in financing has become a bottleneck problem that plagues the development of enterprises and restricts the development of agricultural modernization. How to evaluate and control its credit risk is not only a major way to solve the financing difficulties of agricultural SMEs, but also the basis for the stable development of supply chain financial services. This paper analyzes three typical financing modes of agricultural SMEs from the perspective of supply chain finance, and takes the agricultural SMEs in the New OTC Market as an example to construct a Logistic model, and uses factor analysis to effectively predict the credit risk of supply chain finance. The results show that the operational efficiency factors, growth factors and related core corporate profitability of agricultural SMEs financing enterprises significantly affect their credit risk. After testing, the model is highly accurate in predicting the financing risks of agricultural SMEs. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Tong, Z.; Yang, S.","2021 International Conference on Economic Innovation and Low-carbon Development, EILCD 2021",,366

473412,Transmission routes of COVID-19 in the dental practice,2020,"COVID-19, the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV2 is a major threat to the entire human race. It is reported that SARS-CoV2 seems to have relatively low pathogenicity and higher transmissibility than previously outbroke SARS-CoV. To explore the reason of increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV2 compared to SARS-CoV, we have performed a comparative analysis on the structural proteins (Spike, Envelope, Membrane, Nucleoprotein) of two viruses. Our analysis revealed that extensive substitutions of hydrophobic to polar and charged amino acids in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV2 creates an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)at the beginning of membrane-fusion subunit and intrinsically disordered residues in fusion peptide. IDR provides potential site for proteolysis by furin and enriched disordered residues facilitate prompt fusion of the SARS-CoV2 with host membrane by recruiting Molecular Recognition features. Here, we have hypothesized that mutation driven accumulation of intrinsically disordered residues in spike glycoproteins play dual role in enhancing viral transmissibility than previous SARS-corona virus. These analyses may help in epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) clinical practice uniquely exposes providers to COVID-19. The purpose of the present study was to understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on OMS residency training programs (OMSRTPs): 1) training and education; 2) availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE); 3) experience with, and use of, screening and viral testing; 4) resident experience; and 5) program director (PD) experience and observations of the immediate and future effects on OMSRTPs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OMS residents and PDs in OMSRTPs in the United States were invited to participate in the present cross-sectional study from April 1, 2020 to May 1, 2020. A 51-question survey was used to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on OMSRTPs and to assess the 5 specific aims of the present study. RESULTS: A total of 160 residents and 13 PDs participated in the survey, representing 83% of US states or territories with OMSRTPs. Almost all residents (96.5%) reported modifications to their training program, and 14% had been reassigned to off-service clinical rotations (eg, medicine, intensive care unit). The use of an N95 respirator mask plus standard PPE precautions during aerosol-generating procedures varied by procedure location, with 36.8% reporting limited access to these respirators. Widespread screening practices were in use, with 83.6% using laboratory-based viral testing. Residents scheduled to graduate in 2022 were most concerned with the completion of the graduation requirements and with decreased operative experience. Most residents (94.2%) had moved to web-based didactics, and a plurality (47%) had found increased value in the didactics.

474862,"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in People Aged Over 60 in the COVID-19 Outbreak in a Sample Collected in Northern Spain",2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (later named as COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China and, later on, detected in other parts of China. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. METHODS: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number (Rc), as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio- Re(t), of the disease transmission in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. RESULTS: The estimation outcomes indicate that Rc is 3.36 (95% CI: 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to a prolonged disease transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause a second wave of epidemic or outbreaks. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the pandemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in the mainland of China apart from Hubei province.","Wan, Hui; Cui, Jing-An; Yang, Guo-Jing",Infect Dis Poverty,,366

RECENT FINDINGS: The rise of the COVID-19 virus saw a dramatic reduction in elective surgery and outpatient services with a subsequent reduction in experiential learning for trainees. This has spurred the rising trend to maintain the mission of education and clinical service, virtually. There have been unprecedented levels of international collaboration in the 'pandemic year of 2020' that has seen various platforms conceived to harmonize varying practices from global experts towards the ultimate goal of education propagation and improved patient care. The continent of Africa, amidst its own unique challenges, has boldly stepped into the virtual realm in form of a resident-centred platform coined University Of Cape Town-Africa Virtual ENT, and two multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings: the African Head and Neck Society Virtual Tumour Board and the African Virtual Cochlear Implant Meeting. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-lasting effects on clinical practice and training programs globally.

Recommendations of the Spanish Association of Surgeons,2020,"The first part of this paper is a brief survey of the approaches to economic inequality based on ideas from statistical physics and kinetic theory. These include the Boltzmann kinetic equation, the time-reversal symmetry, the ergodicity hypothesis, entropy maximization, and the Fokker-Planck equation. The origins of the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution and the Pareto power law are discussed in relation to additive and multiplicative stochastic processes. The second part of the paper analyzes income distribution data in the USA for the time period 1983-2018 using a two-class decomposition. We present overwhelming evidence that the lower class (more than 90% of the population) is described by the exponential distribution, whereas the upper class (about 4% of the population in 2018) by the power law. We show that the significant growth of inequality during this time period is due to the sharp increase in the upper-class income share, whereas relative inequality within the lower class remains constant. We speculate that the expansion of the upper-class population and income shares may be due to increasing digitization and non-locality of the economy in the last 40 years.","Ludwig, Danial; Yakovenko, Victor M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03140v1.pdf,366

We previously demonstrated that alpha-1 adrenergic receptor (âº1-AR) antagonists can prevent hyperinflammation and death in mice. Here, we conducted retrospective analyses in two cohorts of patients with acute respiratory distress (ARD, n = 18,547) and three cohorts with pneumonia (n = 400,907). Federated across two ARD cohorts, we find that patients exposed to âº1-AR antagonists, as compared to unexposed patients, had a 34% relative risk reduction for mechanical ventilation and death (OR = 0.70, p = 0.021). We replicated these methods on three pneumonia cohorts, all with similar effects on both outcomes. All results were robust to sensitivity analyses. These results highlight the urgent need for prospective trials testing whether prophylactic use of âº1-AR antagonists ameliorates lower respiratory tract infection-associated hyperinflammation and death, as observed in COVID-19.","Koenecke, Allison; Powell, Michael; Xiong, Ruoxuan; Shen, Zhu; Fischer, Nicole; Huq, Sakibul; Khalafallah, Adham M; Trevisan, Marco; Sparen, Pär; Carrero, Juan J; Nishimura, Akihiko; Caffo, Brian; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Bai, Renyuan; Staedtke, Verena; Thomas, David L; Papadopoulos, Nickolas; Kinzler, Ken W; Vogelstein, Bert; Zhou, Shibin; Bettegowda, Chetan; Konig, Maximilian F; Mensh, Brett D; Vogelstein, Joshua T; Athey, Susan",eLife (Cambridge),,366
478096,Lessons Learned for Orthopaedic Care Within the NYC COVID Epicenter Utilizing the USNS Comfort,2020,"The novel 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has spread worldwide and is currently a major healthcare challenge around the world. Chest computed tomography (CT) and X-ray images have been well recognized to be two effective techniques for clinical COVID-19 disease diagnoses. Due to faster imaging time and considerably lower cost than CT, detecting COVID-19 in chest X-ray (CXR) images is preferred for efficient diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. However, considering the similarity between COVID-19 and pneumonia, CXR samples with deep features distributed near category boundaries are easily misclassified by the hyperplanes learned from limited training data. Moreover, most existing approaches for COVID-19 detection focus on the accuracy of prediction and overlook uncertainty estimation, which is particularly important when dealing with noisy datasets. To alleviate these concerns, we propose a novel deep network named RCoNet ks for robust COVID-19 detection which employs Deformable Mutual Information Maximization (DeIM), Mixed High-order Moment Feature (MHMF), and Multiexpert Uncertainty-aware Learning (MUL). With DeIM, the mutual information (MI) between input data and the corresponding latent representations can be well estimated and maximized to capture compact and disentangled representational characteristics. Meanwhile, MHMF can fully explore the benefits of using high-order statistics and extract discriminative features of complex distributions in medical imaging. Finally, MUL creates multiple parallel dropout networks for each CXR image to evaluate uncertainty and thus prevent performance degradation caused by the noise in the data. The experimental results show that RCoNet ks achieves the state-of-the-art performance on an open-source COVIDx dataset of 15 134 original CXR images across several metrics. Crucially, our method is shown to be more effective than existing methods with the presence of noise in the data.","Dong, Shunjie; Yang, Qianqian; Fu, Yu; Tian, Mei; Zhuo, Cheng",IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst,,366

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 497 pregnant women between May and July 2020 using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) to determine the effect of obstetrics history, fear of hospitalization, concerns about the pandemic, birth, and the health of both mother and infant, on antenatal depression during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. FINDINGS: The general EDS mean score of the total group was determined as mean 13.70 ± 6.22, which was higher than the critical cutoff point of 13. According to the multiple linear regression model applied in the study, the best predictive variables for the mean EDS score were determined to be concerned about completing a healthy pregnancy (r = -0.45), social media and news programs related to COVID-19 increasing levels of concern (r = -0.31), fear of hospitalization as the birth approaches (r = -0.45), having bad dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic (r = -0.41), the request for an elective cesarean delivery because of fear of catching COVID-19 (r = -0.40), fear of breastfeeding the infant (r = -0.45), and concerns that their own health would be negatively affected because of the pandemic (r = - 0.39), and these variables affected the mean EDS score negatively (total variance 40.5%, R = 0.642). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need to implement specific antenatal programs to promote the psychological health of pregnant women and reduce antenatal depression during this or similar crises.","Korukcu, Oznur; Ozkaya, Meltem; Boran, Omer Faruk; Bakacak, Murat",Perspect. psychiatr. care,,366

These institutions are often located in remote and economically peripheral areas of the country that have been characterized by high rates of outmigration. Now, these are becoming areas of intense return migration. Community contagion in adjacent locations can easily spill over to residential institutions through care and health workers’ trajectories. Once spread to residential institutions, COVID-19 has a high chance of adversely affecting the health of residents with disabilities. It is vital to ensure disabled people’s health and wellbeing through adequate contagion prevention measures.","Safta-Zecheria, Leyla",Disability &amp; Society,,366
483525,Correction to: POC COVID-19 test for dentistry,2020,"Most of drugs could have certain mucocutaneous reactions and COVID-19 drugs are not an exception that we focused. We systematically reviewed databases until August/15/2020 and among initial 851 articles, 30 articles entered this study (20 case reports, 4 cohorts and 6 controlled clinical trials). The types of reactions included AGEP, morbiliform drug eruptions, vasculitis, DRESS syndrome, urticarial vasculitis and etc. The treatments have been used before side effects occur, included: antimalarial, anti-viral, antibiotics, tocilizumab, enoxaparin and etc. In pandemic, we found 0.004% to 4.15% of definite drug-induced mucocutaneous reactions. The interval between drug usage and the eruption varied about few hours to 1 month; tightly dependent to the type of drug and hydroxychloroqine seems to be the drug with highest mean interval. Antivirals, antimalarials, azithromycin and tocilizumab are most responsive drugs for adverse drug reactions, but antivirals especially in combination with antimalarial drugs are in the first step. Types of skin reactions are usually morbilliform/exanthematous maculopapular rashes or urticarial eruptions which mostly may manage by steroids during few days. In the setting of HCQ, specific reactions like AGEP should be considered. lopinavir/ritonavir is the most prevalent used drug among antivirals with the highest skin adverse reaction; ribarivin and remdisivir also could induce cutaneous drug reactions but favipiravir has no or less adverse effects. Logically the rate of dermatologic adverse effects among anivirals may relate to their frequency of usage. Rarely, potentially life-threatening reactions may occur. Better management strategies could achieve by knowing more about drug-induced mucocutaneous presentations of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

483687,Psychological Adaptation after the COVID-19 Pandemic through the Lens of Evolutionary Biology,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Although the pause in elective surgery was necessary to preserve healthcare resources at the height of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, recent data have highlighted the worsening pain, decline in physical activity, and increase in anxiety among cancelled total hip and knee arthroplasty patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our staged reopening protocol and the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among elective arthroplasty patients. METHODS: We identified all elective hip and knee arthroplasty patients who underwent our universal COVID-19 testing protocol during our phased reopening between May 1, 2020, and July 21, 2020, at our institution. We recorded the SARS-CoV-2 test results of each patient along with their demographics, medical comorbidities, and symptoms at the time of testing. We followed each of these positive patients through their rescheduled cases and recorded any complications or potential SARS-CoV-2 healthcare exposures. RESULTS: Of the 2,329 patients, we identified five patients (0.21%) with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction--confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive test, none with symptoms. All patients were successfully rescheduled and underwent their elective arthroplasty procedure within 6 weeks of their original surgery date. None of these patients experienced a perioperative complication at the time of their rescheduled arthroplasty procedure. No orthopaedic surgeon or staff member caring for these patients reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Our phased reopening protocol with universal preoperative virus testing was safe and identified a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic, elective arthroplasty patients at our institution. With uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that this research can guide future policy decisions regarding elective surgery.","Zangrilli, Julian; Hameed, Daniel; Chisari, Emanuele; Vannello, Chris; Courtney, P Maxwell; Krueger, Chad A",J.

483688,Psychological Adaptation after the COVID-19 Pandemic through the Lens of Evolutionary Biology,2021,"On January 22, 2020, Johns Hopkins University launched its online COVID-19 dashboard to track in real time what began in December as the regional outbreak of a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. The dashboard and its format were quickly adopted by other organizations, making global, national, and regional data on the pandemic available to all. The wealth of data freely offered in this way was collected by syndromic programs whose precise algorithms search official and popular sources for data on COVID-19 and other diseases. The dashboard signals a new phase in the maturation of the “digital revolution” from paper resources and, in their popular employ, a “democratizion” of data and their presentation. This perspective thus uses the COVID-19 experience as an example of the effect of this digital revolution on both expert and popular audiences. Understanding it permits a broader perspective on not simply the pandemic but also the cultural and socioeconomic context in which it has occurred. © 2021 The Author(s)","Koch, T.",Patterns,,366
483933,Mechanical ventilation utilization in covid-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Modeling binary and categorical data is one of the most commonly encountered tasks of applied statisticians and econometricians. While Bayesian methods in this context have been available for decades now, they often require a high level of familiarity with Bayesian statistics or suffer from issues such as low sampling efficiency. To contribute to the accessibility of Bayesian models for binary and categorical data, we introduce novel latent variable representations based on P\'olya Gamma random variables for a range of commonly encountered discrete choice models. From these latent variable representations, new Gibbs sampling algorithms for binary, binomial and multinomial logistic regression models are derived. All models allow for a conditionally Gaussian likelihood representation, rendering extensions to more complex modeling frameworks such as state space models straight-forward. However, sampling efficiency may still be an issue in these data augmentation based estimation frameworks. To counteract this, MCMC boosting strategies are developed and discussed in detail. The merits of our approach are illustrated through extensive simulations and a real data application.","Fruhwirth-Schnatter, Sylvia; Zens, Gregor; Wagner, Helga",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06898v3.pdf,366

484635,Psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 lockdown: A two-wave network analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted graduate medical education, impacting Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-mandated didactics. We aimed to study the utility of 2 methods of virtual learning: the daily National Surgery Resident Lecture Series (NSRLS), and weekly ""SCORE School"" educational webinars designed around the Surgical Council on Resident Education (SCORE) curriculum. DESIGN AND SETTING: NSRLS: The National Surgery Resident Lecture Series was a daily virtual educational session initially led by faculty at an individual surgical residency program. Thirty-eight lectures were assessed for number of live viewings (March 23, 2020-May 15, 2020). SCORE SCHOOL: Attendance at eleven weekly SCORE educational webinars was characterized into live and asynchronous viewings (May 13, 2020-August 5, 2020). Each 1-hour live webinar was produced by SCORE on a Wednesday evening and featured nationally recognized surgeon educators using an online platform that allowed for audience interaction. RESULTS: NSRLS: There were a mean of 71 live viewers per NSRLS session (range 19-118). Participation began to decline in the final 2 weeks as elective case volumes increased, but sessions remained well-attended. SCORE SCHOOL: There were a range of 164-3889 live viewers per SCORE School session. Sessions have most commonly been viewed asynchronously (89.8% of viewings). Live viewership decreased as the academic year ended and then rebounded with the start of the new academic year (range 4.9%-27%). Overall, the eight webinars were viewed 11,135 times. Each webinar continues to be viewed a mean of 43 times a day (range 0-102). Overall, the eleven webinars have been viewed a total of 22,722 times. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual didactics aimed at surgical residents are feasible, well-attended (both live and recorded), and have high levels of viewer engagement. We have observed that careful coordination of timing and topics is ideal. The ability for asynchronous viewing is particularly important for attendance. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt healthcare systems, training programs must continue to adapt to education via virtual platforms.","Theodorou, Christina M; Joshi, Amit R T; Chahine, A Alfred; Boyd, Sally A; Stern, Jeffrey M; Anand, Rahul J; Hickey, Mark; Bradley, Madison; Tilak, Sahil S; Barrett, Kerry B; Klingensmith, Mary E",J. surg. educ,,366

The mechanisms underlying this difference remain unclear. Methods: We compared the immunological landscape between COVID-19 and two other contagious respiratory illnesses (influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)) by clustering analysis of the three diseases based on 27 immune signatures' scores. Results: We identified three immune subtypes: Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, which displayed high, medium, and low immune signatures, respectively. We found 20%, 35.5%, and 44.5% of COVID-19 cases included in Immunity-H, Immunity-M, and Immunity-L, respectively; all influenza cases were included in Immunity-H; 66.7% and 33.3% of RSV cases belonged to Immunity-H and Immunity-L, respectively. These data indicate that most COVID-19 patients have weaker immune signatures than influenza and RSV patients, as evidenced by 22 of the 27 immune signatures having lower enrichment scores in COVID-19 than in influenza and/or RSV. The Immunity-M COVID-19 patients had the highest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and lowest viral loads and were the youngest. In contrast, the Immunity-H COVID-19 patients had the lowest expression levels of ACE2 and IL-6 and highest viral loads and were the oldest. Most immune signatures had lower enrichment levels in the intensive care unit (ICU) than in non-ICU patients. Gene ontology analysis showed that the innate and adaptive immune responses were significantly downregulated in COVID-19 versus healthy individuals. Conclusions: Compared to influenza and RSV, COVID-19 displayed significantly different immunological profiles. Elevated immune signatures are associated with better prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","Abdelrahman, Zeinab; Chen, Zuobing; Lyu, Haoyu; Wang, Xiaosheng",,,366

The underlying reasons and mechanisms for this relative protection are not established. However both genetic and environmental factors might play a role. Polymorphisms in ACE2 gene, ACE gene and in genes for some of the host cell proteases could affect the viral entry and replication. There is some evidence that HLA polymorphisms and several pathways involved in immune and inflammatory response could contribute to ethnic variation. Cross immunity because of past exposure to viral infections as well as malaria is likely to protect from the severe manifestations of disease. Role of BCG vaccination in trained innate immunity is recognised and could be a protective factor against COVID-19. There is limited evidence of the possibility of a less virulent viral strain circulating in South Asia. There is evidence from different parts of the world that temperature and humidity can influence viral survival as well as the host immune response. Finally implementation of early containment measures by some South Asian countries has also contributed to a less disease burden.","Gupta, Ritesh; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,366
492020,Second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: D-dimer levels are not so high anymore,2021,"BACKGROUND: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has brought drastic changes to the field of plastic surgery. It is critical for stakeholders in this field to identify the changes in public interest in plastic procedures to be adequately prepared to meet the challenges of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine tweets related to the public interest in plastic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic and to help stakeholders in the field of plastic surgery adjust their practices and sustain their operations during the current difficult situation of the pandemic. METHODS: Using a web crawler, 73,963 publicly accessible tweets about the most common cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive plastic procedures were collected. The tweets were grouped into three phases, and the tweeting frequencies and Google Trends indices were examined. Tweeting frequency, sentiment, and word frequency analyses were performed with Python modules. RESULTS: Tweeting frequency increased by 24.0% in phase 2 and decreased by 9.1% in phase 3. Tweets about breast augmentation, liposuction, and abdominoplasty (""tummy tuck"") procedures consecutively increased over the three phases of the pandemic. Interest in Botox and chemical peel procedures revived first when the lockdown was lifted. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a negative impact on public sentiment about plastic procedures. The word frequency pattern significantly changed after phase 1 and then remained relatively stable. CONCLUSIONS: According to Twitter data, the public maintained their interest in plastic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders should consider refocusing on breast augmentation, liposuction, and abdominoplasty procedures during the current phase of the pandemic. In the case of a second wave of COVID-19, stakeholders should prepare for a temporary surge of Botox and chemical peel procedures.","Liu, Wenhui; Wei, Zhiru; Cheng, Xu; Pang, Ran; Zhang, Han; Li, Guangshuai",J Med Internet Res,,366
492040,[The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Management of Occupational Injuries],2020,"For several decades there has been accumulating evidence implicating type I interferons (IFNs) as key elements of the immune response. Therapeutic approaches incorporating different recombinant type I IFN proteins have been successfully employed to treat a diverse group of diseases with significant and positive outcomes. The biological activities of type I IFNs are consequences of signaling events occurring in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. Biochemical events involving JAK/STAT proteins that control transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were the first to be identified and are referred to as ""canonical"" signaling. Subsequent identification of JAK/STAT-independent signaling pathways, critical for ISG transcription and/or mRNA translation, are denoted as ""non-canonical"" or ""non-classical"" pathways. In this review, we summarize these signaling cascades and discuss recent developments in the field, specifically as they relate to the biological and clinical implications of engagement of both canonical and non-canonical pathways.","Mazewski, Candice; Perez, Ricardo E; Fish, Eleanor N; Platanias, Leonidas C",Front Immunol,,366

This article looks at walking while conducting psychotherapy with patients and explores the ways in which flexibility in treatment can enhance the alliance, how walking side by side brings the body into focus with its implications for transference and countertransference, and how associations to landscape evoke past memories and access emotions. Issues relating to self-disclosure and boundaries, as well as patient responses to the psychotherapist's personally driven request to consider walking during psychotherapy are addressed. Since writing this article, the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world and required psychotherapists everywhere to bend the frame of treatment and meet with patients virtually-by phone or video conference-to maintain social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. The hardships posed by this shift in treatment frame combine with benefits not dissimilar to those found with psychotherapy while walking.","Schen, Cathy R",Psychodyn Psychiatry,,366

As such, international organizations such as the World Health Organizations and the United Nations Development Program are creating an evidence base on how best to address corruption in health systems. At present, the risk of corruption is even more apparent, given the need for quick and nimble responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may include a relaxation of standards and the rapid mobilization of large funds. As international organizations and governments attempt to respond to the ever-changing demands of this pandemic, there is a need to acknowledge and address the increased opportunity for corruption.In order to explore how such risks of corruption are addressed in international organizations, this paper focuses on the question: How are international organizations implementing measures to promote accountability and transparency, and anti-corruption, in their own operations? The following international organizations were selected as the focus of this paper given their current involvement in anti-corruption, transparency, and accountability in the health sector: the World Health Organization, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank Group, and the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Our findings demonstrate that there has been a clear increase in the volume and scope of anti-corruption, accountability, and transparency measures implemented by these international organizations in recent years. However, the efficacy of these measures remains unclear. Further research is needed to determine how these measures are achieving their transparency, accountability, and anti-corruption goals.","Kohler, Jillian Clare; Bowra, Andrea",Global Health,,366

494276,Impact of COVID-19 on Access to Care: A National Patient Survey,2021,"PURPOSE: This study creates a COVID-19 susceptibility scale at the county level, describes its components, and then assesses the health and socioeconomic resiliency of susceptible places across the rural-urban continuum. METHODS: Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. RESULTS: About 33% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID-19, driven by older and health-compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. CONCLUSIONS: There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter-in-place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread. Pandemic response plans should address vulnerabilities.","Peters, David J",J Rural Health,,366

Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in corneal tissue would seem to have clinical relevance for corneal transplant. Objectives: To investigate the presence of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA in corneal discs of deceased patients with confirmed COVID-19 and assess viral genomic and subgenomic RNA load, possible infectivity, and histologic abnormalities. Design, Setting, and Participants: A case series was conducted of 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 who underwent autopsy between March 20 and May 14, 2020. Eleven corneal discs (1 corneal disc per patient) were harvested for molecular detection of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA, virus isolation, and immunohistochemistry. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads were compared with RNA loads in the conjunctival and throat swab samples and aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and blood samples. Main Outcomes and Measures: Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human corneas. Results: This study comprised 11 patients (6 women [55%]; mean [SD] age, 68.5 [18.8] years). In 6 of 11 eyes (55%), SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was detected in the cornea; subgenomic RNA was present in 4 of these 6 eyes (67%). Infectivity or the presence of viral structural proteins could not be confirmed in any eye. However, patients whose corneal disc was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA also had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 4 of 6 conjunctival swab samples, 1 of 3 aqueous humor samples, 3 of 5 vitreous humor samples, and 4 of 5 blood samples. Overall, conjunctival swab samples had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 5 of 11 cases. Postmortem SARS-CoV-2 viremia was detected in 5 of 9 patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Viral genomic and subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the cornea of patients with COVID-19 viremia. The risk of COVID-19 infection via corneal transplant is low even in donors with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, but further research is necessary to assess the rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via corneal transplant.","Casagrande, Maria; Fitzek, Antonia; Spitzer, Martin S; Püschel, Klaus; Glatzel, Markus; Krasemann, Susanne; Nörz, Dominik; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Pfefferle, Susanne; Schultheiss, Maximilian",JAMA ophthalmol.

For the first time, the levels of 5-mC and 5-hmC in Bos taurus indicus were characterized, which may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in the placenta. The presence of 5-hmC in somatic tissues suggest that 5-hmC has its own biological function and it is not only a byproduct from the oxidation of 5-mC.

In this work, a hypoxia-stimulated strategy based on a smart triblock vector was developed to enhance therapeutic efficacy through the inhibition of cancer stemness. The triblock precursor was designed with a fluorescence chromophore for monitoring hypoxia, a methoxy nitro-unit for biorecognition, and a poly(ethylene glycol)-folate for cancer cell targeting. As the degree of hypoxia increases, the vectors were progressively dissociated as indicated by the enhanced fluorescence intensity in hypoxic cells and compacted three-dimensional spheres. Furthermore, the expression of stem cell markers such as CD133 and SOX2 was significantly inhibited, and the serial passaging of CSCs was notably impaired after treating CSCs with the vectors. The inhibition of cancer cell stemness significantly improved the anticancer efficiency in vivo. Moreover, tumor initiation was reduced and the median survival time of xenograft tumor models was prolonged by regulating cell stemness under hypoxia. Overall, this work provides a promising approach to inhibit tumor resistance and recurrence for efficient tumor therapy.","Wang, Fang; Luo, Rengan; Xin, Hao; Zhang, Yaming; Córdova Wong, Bernardino J; Wang, Weiping; Lei, Jianping",Biomaterials,,366

SARS-CoV-2 positivity was associated with a unique metabolic phenotype and demonstrated a complex systemic response to infection, including severe perturbations in amino acid and kynurenine metabolic pathways. Nine metabolites were elevated in plasma and strongly associated with infection (quinolinic acid, glutamic acid, nicotinic acid, aspartic acid, neopterin, kynurenine, phenylalanine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and taurine; p < 0.05), while four metabolites were lower in infection (tryptophan, histidine, indole-3-acetic acid, and citrulline; p < 0.05). This signature supports a systemic metabolic phenoconversion following infection, indicating possible neurotoxicity and neurological disruption (elevations of 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid) and liver dysfunction (reduction in Fischer's ratio and elevation of taurine). Finally, we report correlations between the key metabolite changes observed in the disease with concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines showing strong immunometabolic disorder in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lawler, Nathan G; Gray, Nicola; Kimhofer, Torben; Boughton, Berin; Gay, Melvin; Yang, Rongchang; Morillon, Aude-Claire; Chin, Sung-Tong; Ryan, Monique; Begum, Sofina; Bong, Sze How; Coudert, Jerome D; Edgar, Dale; Raby, Edward; Pettersson, Sven; Richards, Toby; Holmes, Elaine; Whiley, Luke; Nicholson, Jeremy K",J Proteome Res,,366

There have been more than two million deaths recorded worldwide, with no end in sight until a vaccine is developed. Current research has centred on different aspects of the virus interaction with cell surface receptors, but more needs to be done to further understand its mechanism of action in order to develop a targeted therapy and a method to control the spread of the virus. Lipids play a crucial role throughout the viral life cycle, and viruses are known to exploit lipid signalling and synthesis to affect host cell lipidome. Emerging studies using untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approaches are providing new insight into the host response to COVID-19 infection. Indeed, metabolomic and lipidomic approaches have identified numerous circulating lipids that directly correlate to the severity of the disease, making lipid metabolism a potential therapeutic target. Circulating lipids play a key function in the pathogenesis of the virus and exert an inflammatory response. A better knowledge of lipid metabolism in the host-pathogen interaction will provide valuable insights into viral pathogenesis and to develop novel therapeutic targets.","Casari, Ilaria; Manfredi, Marcello; Metharom, Pat; Falasca, Marco",Prog Lipid Res,,366

Currently, the absence of any effective antiviral treatment is the major concern for the global population. The reports of the occurrence of various point mutations within the important therapeutic target protein of SARS-CoV-2 has elevated the problem. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a major therapeutic target for new antiviral designs. In this study, the efficacy of PF-00835231 was investigated (a Mpro inhibitor under clinical trials) against the Mpro and their reported mutants. Various in silico approaches were used to investigate and compare the efficacy of PF-00835231 and five drugs previously documented to inhibit the Mpro. Our study shows that PF-00835231 is not only effective against the wild type but demonstrates a high affinity against the studied mutants as well.","Baig, Mohammad Hassan; Sharma, Tanuj; Ahmad, Irfan; Abohashrh, Mohammed; Alam, Mohammad Mahtab; Dong, Jae-June",Molecules (Basel),,366

Few cases of coronary stent thrombosis associated with COVID-19 have been reported. Case summary"": In this report, we describe the case of a 65-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction revealing a very late dual coronary stent thrombosis of the left anterior descending and posterior descending arteries. Ten days prior to admission, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with dexamethasone, which led to rapid clinical improvement. After resuscitation, coronary angiography revealed an acute thrombotic occlusion in the two previous drug-eluting stents (implanted in 2010 and 2018), with a high thrombus burden. He was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient did not present any further complications during his hospital stay and was transferred to a cardiac rehabilitation centre. Discussion"": Dual stent thrombosis is an exceptional event highlighting the high procoagulant state promoted by coronavirus 19. This case suggests that strengthening of antithrombotic therapy in CAD patients presenting with COVID-19 should be discussed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Despite the burden of the disease worldwide, still, no licensed vaccine or any specific drug against 2019-nCoV is available. Data from several countries show that few repurposed drugs using existing antiviral drugs have not (so far) been satisfactory and more recently were proven to be even highly toxic. These findings underline an urgent need for preventative and therapeutic interventions designed to target specific aspects of 2019-nCoV. Again the major factor in this urgency is that the process of data acquisition by physical experiment is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Scientific simulations and more in-depth data analysis permit to validate or refute drug repurposing opportunities predicted via target similarity profiling to speed up the development of a new more effective anti-2019-nCoV therapy especially where in vitro and/or in vivo data are not yet available. In addition, several research programs are being developed, aiming at the exploration of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-nCoV. Computational-based technology has given us the tools to explore and identify potentially effective drug and/or vaccine candidates which can effectively shorten the time and reduce the operating cost. The aim of the present review is to address the available information on molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules and define the computational approaches employed in systematic drug repositioning and vaccine development settings for SARS-CoV-2.","Ghaebi, Mahnaz; Osali, Abdolreza; Valizadeh, Hamed; Roshangar, Leila; Ahmadi, Majid",J. cell. physiol,,366

With many of the memories still intact, the one encounter whose mark is an enduring one in my mind is when I caught dengue fever and was admitted to a public hospital. During this stay, I remember largely being restless inside my room. However, visiting an outdoor ground near my ward was always a rejuvenating experience and made me feel stronger and better. It was during that time when I truly realized the significance of indoor as well as outdoor design quality of health care buildings and how they impact the well-being of their users. To say the least, that short stay at the hospital was one of the major reasons that why for my graduate and undergraduate theses, I chose to explore the role of well-designed and accessible outdoor spaces especially gardens in health care buildings for promoting mental as well as physical health and well-being among users. Presently, as we steer through a deadly pandemic, my own experiences from this hospital stay makes me want to reflect back and reemphasize on why there is a need for health care policy makers and relevant governmental bodies to strategize and prioritize long-term goals for implementing measures such as evidence-based design considerations of hospitals, especially in developing countries, and to promote accessible, inclusive, and safe healing spaces where patients may leave with positive experiences instead of negative reminiscences and where the staff can also use these spaces for respite.","Iqbal, S.

One important element in this action is the use of individual protective devices such as filtering facepiece masks. Currently, masks that use a mechanical filter, such as a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter, are often used. In some countries that do not have a well-developed healthcare system or in exceptional situations, there is a real and pressing need to restore filters for reuse. This article presents technical details for a very simple device for sterilization, including of HEPA polymer filters. The results of biological and microscopic tests confirming the effectiveness of the sterilization performed in the device are presented.

In the present study, we investigated whether Ilex kudingcha extract exerts similar inhibitory effects on cholesterol accumulation in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs) and atherogenesis in apoE-deficient mice. Ilex kudingcha extract significantly inhibited cholesterol ester (CE) accumulation induced by acetyl-LDL (acetylated LDL) in HMDMs; however, it generated no effect on cell viability in HMDMs. Ilex kudingcha extract also suppressed CE accumulation in acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT)-overexpressing CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells, thereby indicating that it inhibits ACAT activity. Furthermore, the oral administration of Ilex kudingcha extract to apoE-deficient mice significantly decreased the levels of serum cholesterol, triglyceride, sLOX-1, as well as the regions of atherosclerotic lesions in the mice. Our study reveals crucial new-found evidence that Ilex kudingcha extract significantly inhibits ACAT activity and suppresses atherogenesis.","Fujiwara, Yukio; Okada, Shota; Uryu, Keisuke; Maru, Isafumi; Komohara, Yoshihiro",Biosci. biotechnol. biochem,,366

As drug refinement and vaccine progression require enormously broad investments of time, alternative strategies are urgently needed. In this study, we examined phytochemicals extracted from Avicennia officinalis and evaluated their potential effects against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The antioxidant activities of A. officinalis leaf and fruit extracts at 150 microg/mL were 95.97% and 92.48%, respectively. Furthermore, both extracts displayed low cytotoxicity levels against Artemia salina. The gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed the identifies of 75 phytochemicals from both extracts, and four potent compounds, triacontane, hexacosane, methyl linoleate, and methyl palminoleate, had binding free energy values of -6.75, -6.7, -6.3, and -6.3 Kcal/mol, respectively, in complexes with the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The active residues Cys145, Met165, Glu166, Gln189, and Arg188 in the main protease formed non-bonded interactions with the screened compounds. The root-mean-square difference (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and hydrogen bond data from a molecular dynamics simulation study confirmed the docked complexes' binding rigidity in the atomistic simulated environment.

One of the attractions to the index lies in its coverage as all the countries and by extension regions and territories in the world are considered in the construction of the index. Our results show evidence of a positive relationship between commodity price returns and the global fear index, confirming that commodity returns increase as COVID-19 related fear rises. By way of extension, we further establish that commodity market offers better safe-haven properties than the stock market given the negative association between GFI and the latter. Finally, the GFI series improves the forecast accuracy of the predictive model for commodity price returns and its forecast outcome outperforms the historical average (constant returns) model both for the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patient data collected from the routine care of COVID-19 patients. SETTING: System of >180 acute-care facilities in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All admitted patients with positive identification of COVID-19 and a documented discharge as of May 12, 2020. METHODS: Determination of demographic characteristics, vital signs at admission, patient comorbidities and recorded discharge disposition in this population to construct a logistic regression estimating the odds of mortality, particular for those patients characterized as not being critically ill at admission. RESULTS: In total, 6,180 COVID-19+ patients were identified as of May 12, 2020. Most COVID-19+ patients (4,808, 77.8%) were admitted directly to a medical-surgical unit with no documented critical care or mechanical ventilation within 8 hours of admission. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and vital signs at admission in this subgroup, the largest driver of the odds of mortality was patient age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.08; P < .001). Decreased oxygen saturation at admission was associated with increased odds of mortality (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.12; P < .001) as was diabetes (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.21-2.03; P < .001).

504127,COVID-19 Pandemic - Call for National Preparedness,2020,"BACKGROUND: The management of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients continues to be challenging. Critically ill COVID patients are at increased risk of serious thrombotic events and hence increased mortality. On the other side, COVID-19 patients are also showing major life-threatening bleeds, especially when systemic anticoagulation is used. Pro-coagulant propensity in critically ill COVID-19 patients have been published, but very few have described the incidence of major bleeding and its characteristics. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively observed the incidence of major bleed in 25 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Six cases were identified and described together with their outcome. RESULTS: Major bleeding occurred in six of the 25 studied patients. Four patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation at the onset of the bleed, two required embolization for bleeding control and one died from hemorrhagic shock. Half of the described cases had unusual sites of bleeding including gluteal and abdominal wall muscles. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of major bleeding was witnessed in our sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, with the majority being on therapeutic anticoagulation. This rate may be higher than previously reported, necessitating additional attention from the treating physician when considering empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. Moreover, the uncommon sites of bleeding shed the light on the need for additional studies in our population to identify the predisposing risk factors and mechanisms behind it.","Koubaissi, Salwa A; Daou, Michella Abi Zeid; Mohamad, Rayan; Husari, Ahmad",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,366

Research on the COVID-19 pandemic benefiting from open-access data and machine learning algorithms is still scarce yet can produce relevant and pragmatic information. With country-level pre-COVID-19-pandemic variables, we aimed to cluster countries in groups with shared profiles of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms (k-means) were used to define data-driven clusters of countries; the algorithm was informed by disease prevalence estimates, metrics of air pollution, socio-economic status and health system coverage. Using the one-way ANOVA test, we compared the clusters in terms of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, number of deaths, case fatality rate and order in which the country reported the first case. Results: The model to define the clusters was developed with 155 countries. The model with three principal component analysis parameters and five or six clusters showed the best ability to group countries in relevant sets. There was strong evidence that the model with five or six clusters could stratify countries according to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (p<0.001). However, the model could not stratify countries in terms of number of deaths or case fatality rate. Conclusions: A simple data-driven approach using available global information before the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed able to classify countries in terms of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The model was not able to stratify countries based on COVID-19 mortality data.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M; Castillo-Cara, Manuel",Wellcome Open Res,,366

METHODS: An online survey of CSC staff and clinicians assessed their attitudes, preparedness, and comfort with technology implementation into care. RESULTS: In total, 42 programs from 30 states responded to the web-based survey. Of the six key roles of CSC, the role believed to be most capable for technology to augment was Family Education and Support by 90% (38/42) of participants. Eighty-two per cent (34/42) of clinicians and staff felt that they would benefit from and have interest in receiving digital skills training (41% [17/42] strongly agree, 41% [17/42] agreed). Evaluation of respondent sentiments towards technology revealed that 70 per cent (29/42) (""agree"", or ""strongly agree"") believe that technology can integrate into care easily. CONCLUSIONS: Survey responses show overall positive sentiments towards technology implementation in early psychosis care. Findings also reveal that the digital tool would be better sustained if CSC staff and clinicians received digital skills education. This survey demonstrates that technology can augment early psychosis care while improving quality of care and expanding access to care.","Camacho, Erica; Torous, John",Early intervention in psychiatry (Online),,366
507823,Initial Findings From the North American COVID-19 Myocardial Infarction Registry,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The global COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the way health care is delivered in many countries around the world. Evidence on the experience of those receiving or providing maternity care is important to guide practice through this challenging time. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Australia. Five key stakeholder cohorts were included to explore and compare the experiences of those receiving or providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women, their partners, midwives, medical practitioners and midwifery students who had received or provided maternity care from March 2020 onwards in Australia were recruited via social media and invited to participate in an online survey released between 13th May and 24th June 2020; a total of 3701 completed responses were received. FINDINGS: While anxiety related to COVID-19 was high among all five cohorts, there were statistically significant differences between the responses from each cohort for most survey items. Women were more likely to indicate concern about their own and family's health and safety in relation to COVID-19 whereas midwives, doctors and midwifery students were more likely to be concerned about occupational exposure to COVID-19 through working in a health setting than those receiving care through attending these environments. Midwifery students and women's partners were more likely to respond that they felt isolated because of the changes to the way care was provided. Despite concerns about care received or provided not meeting expectations, most respondents were satisfied with the quality of care provided, although midwives and midwifery students were less likely to agree. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a unique exploration and comparison of experiences of receiving and providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Findings are useful to support further service changes and future service redesign. New evidence provided offers unique insight into key stakeholders' experiences of the rapid changes to health services.","Bradfield, Zoe; Wynter, Karen; Hauck, Yvonne; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Kuliukas, Lesley; Wilson, Alyce N; Szabo, Rebecca A; Homer, Caroline S E; Sweet, Linda",PLoS One,,366

One of the major concerns of hospitals was to limit spread of infection to health-care workers. Because the virus is spread mainly by respiratory droplets and aerosolized particles, procedures that may potentially disperse viral particles, the so-called ""aerosol-generating procedures"" were avoided whenever possible. Included in this category were noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and awake (nonintubated) proning. Accordingly, at many health-care facilities, patients who had increasing oxygen requirements were emergently intubated and mechanically ventilated to avoid exposure to aerosol-generating procedures. With experience, physicians realized that mortality of invasively ventilated patients was high and it was not easy to extubate many of these patients. This raised the concern that HFNC and NIV were being underutilized to avoid intubation and to facilitate extubation. In this article, we attempt to separate fact from fiction and perception from reality pertaining to the aerosol dispersion with NIV, HFNC, and awake proning. We describe precautions that hospitals and health-care providers must take to mitigate risks with these devices.

508195,Medical student dermatology rotations in the context of COVID-19,2020,"BackgroundSurvivors to COVID-19 have described long-term symptoms after acute disease. These signs constitute a heterogeneous group named long COVID or persistent COVID. ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to describe persisting symptoms six months after COVID-19 diagnosis in a prospective cohort in the Northwest Spain DesignThis is a prospective cohort study performed in the COVID-19 Cohort of Galicia Sur Health Institute (COHVID-GS). ParticipantsThis cohort includes patients in clinical follow-up in a health area of 569,534 inhabitants after SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 diagnosis. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were collected during the follow up. Main measures and key resultsA total of 284 patients completed 6 months follow-up, 176 (69.4%) required hospitalization and 29 (10.2%) of them needed critical care. At six months, 119 (48.0%) patients described one or more persisting symptoms. The most prevalent were: extra-thoracic symptoms (39.1%), chest symptoms (27%), dyspnoea (20.6%), and fatigue (16.1%). These symptoms were more common in hospitalized patients (52.3% vs 38.2%) and in women (59.0% vs 40.5%). The multivariate analysis identified Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), female gender and tobacco consumption as risk factors for long COVID. ConclusionsPersisting symptoms are common after COVID-19 especially in hospitalized patients compared to outpatients (52.3% vs. 38.2%). Based on these findings, special attention and clinical follow-up after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection should be provided for hospitalized patients with previous lung diseases, tobacco consumption, and females.","Gonzalez, Alexandre Perez; Araujo-Ameijeiras, Alejandro; Fernandez-Villar, Alberto; Crespo, Manuel; Poveda, Eva",,,366

508255,A Student Telephone Intervention for Primary Care Patient Safety During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the arterial complications and hypercoagulability associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We sought to characterize our experience with arterial thromboembolic complications in patients with hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: All patients admitted from March 1 to April 20, 2020, and who underwent carotid, upper, lower and aortoiliac arterial duplex, computed tomography angiogram or magnetic resonance angiography for suspected arterial thrombosis were included. A retrospective case control study design was used to identify, characterize and evaluate potential risk factors for arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Demographics, characteristics, and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 424 patients underwent 499 arterial duplex, computed tomography angiogram, or magnetic resonance angiography imaging studies with an overall 9.4% positive rate for arterial thromboembolism. Of the 40 patients with arterial thromboembolism, 25 (62.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons and 15 (37.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The odds ratio for arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 was 3.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.68-6.78; P = .001). Although not statistically significant, in patients with arterial thromboembolism, patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive compared with those testing negative or not tested tended to be male (66.7% vs 40.0%; P = .191), have a less frequent history of former or active smoking (42.9% vs 68.0%; P = .233) and have a higher white blood cell count (14.5 vs 9.9; P = .208). Although the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients trended toward a higher the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (8.9 vs 4.1; P = .134), creatinine phosphokinase level (359.0 vs 144.5; P = .667), C-reactive protein level (24.2 vs 13.8; P = .627), lactate dehydrogenase level (576.5 vs 338.0; P = .313), and ferritin level (974.0 vs 412.0; P = .47), these differences did not reach statistical significance. Patients with arterial thromboembolic complications and SARS-CoV-2 positive when compared with SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons were younger (64 vs 70 years; P = .027), had a significantly higher body mass index (32.6 vs 25.5; P = .012), a higher d-dimer at the time of imaging (17.3 vs 1.8; P = .038), a higher average in hospital d-dimer (8.5 vs 2.0; P = .038), a greater distribution of patients with clot in the aortoiliac location (5 vs 1; P = .040), less prior use of any antiplatelet medication (21.4% vs 62.5%; P = .035), and a higher mortality rate (40.0% vs 8.0%; P = .041). Treatment of arterial thromboembolic disease in COVID-19 positive patients included open thromboembolectomy in six patients (40%), anticoagulation alone in four (26.7%), and five (33.3%) did not require or their overall illness severity precluded additional treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 are at risk for acute arterial thromboembolic complications despite a lack of conventional risk factors. A hyperinflammatory state may be responsible for this phenomenon with a preponderance for aortoiliac involvement. These findings provide an early characterization of arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Indes, Jeffrey E; Koleilat, Issam; Hatch, Ayesha Nzeribe; Choinski, Krystina; Jones, Davis Brent; Aldailami, Hasan; Billett, Henny; Denesopolis, John M; Lipsitz, Evan",J. vasc. surg,,366

METHODS: The data were obtained from a health system with 19 emergency departments in northeast Ohio in the United States. Baseline period from January 1 to March 8, 2020, was compared with the COVID period from March 9, to April 2, 2020. The variables included were total daily stroke alerts across the hospital emergency departments, thrombolysis, time to presentation, stroke severity, time from door-to-imaging, time from door-to-needle in thrombolysis, and time from door-to-puncture in thrombectomy. The 2 time periods were compared using nonparametric statistics and Poisson regression. RESULTS: Nine hundred two stroke alerts during the period across the emergency departments were analyzed. Total daily stroke alerts decreased from median, 10 (interquartile range, 8-13) during baseline period to median, 8 (interquartile range, 4-10, P=0.001) during COVID period. Time to presentation, stroke severity, and time to treatment were unchanged. COVID period was associated with decrease in stroke alerts with rate ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.28). Thrombolysis also decreased with rate ratio, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.28-0.97) but thrombectomy remained unchanged rate ratio, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.52-1.62) Conclusions: We observed a significant decrease in acute stroke presentations by &#8776;30% across emergency departments at the time of surge of COVID-19 cases. This observation could be attributed to true decline in stroke incidence or patients not seeking medical attention for emergencies during the pandemic.","Uchino, Ken; Kolikonda, Murali K; Brown, Dena; Kovi, Shivakrishna; Collins, Dana; Khawaja, Zeshaun; Buletko, A Blake; Russman, Andrew N; Hussain, M Shazam",Stroke,,366
510435,Provision of Virtual Outpatient Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Enabling Factors and Experiences from the UBC Pharmacists Clinic,2020,"The clinical signature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of aggregated Aß fibrils that are neurotoxic to the brain. It is the major form of dementia affecting older people worldwide, impeding their normal function. Finding and testing various natural compounds to target and disrupt stable Aß fibrils seems to be a promising and attractive therapeutic approach. Four phenolic compounds from plant sources were taken into consideration for the present work, and were initially screened by docking. Ellagic acid (REF) came out to be the best binder of the Aß oligomer from docking studies. To test the destabilization effect of REF on the Aß oligomer, MD simulation was conducted. The simulation outcome obtained clearly indicates a drift of terminal chains from the Aß oligomer, leading to the disorganization of the characteristically organized cross ß structure of the Aß fibrils. Increased values of RMSD, Rg, RMSF, and SASA are indicative of the destabilization of the Aß fibril in the presence of REF. The disruption of salt bridges and a notable decline in the number of hydrogen bonds and ß-sheet content explain the conformational changes in the Aß fibril structure, ceasing their neurotoxicity. The MM-PBSA results revealed the binding of REF to chain A of the Aß oligomer. The destabilization potential of ellagic acid, as explained by the MD simulation study, establishes it as a promising drug for curing AD. The molecular-level details about the destabilization mechanism of ellagic acid encourage the intensive mining of other natural compounds for therapeutic intervention for AD.","Gupta, Shivani; Dasmahapatra, Ashok Kumar",,,366

Even after recovery, patients are prone to a variety of mental health problems. Recently, some studies focus on the psychological situation of patients when they got COVID-19. However, no study focused on the psychological status of recovered COVID-19-infected patients in China. Our study aims to investigate sleep and mood status, and detect the influencing factors of the psychological status of the COVID-19 patients after recovery. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled from February to April 2020. The social demographic information of all participants was collected by a self-designed questionnaire. Insomnia and depression symptoms were evaluated through the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D). RESULTS: The rates of insomnia and depression were 26.45% and 9.92% in the COVID-19 patients after recovery. There were significant differences in physical, mental impairment, and the need for psychological assistance between the COVID-19 recovered patients with depression and the patients without depression. In addition, age and health status may be the influencing factors for insomnia, and care about the views of others may be the influencing factor of depression (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results, we found that COVID-19 recovered patients had a low rate of depression and a high rate of insomnia. We need to pay more attention to their sleep condition than mood status.","Xu, Fei; Wang, Xixin; Yang, Yanguo; Zhang, Kai; Shi, Yudong; Xia, Lei; Hu, Xiaowen; Liu, Huanzhong",Sleep medicine,,366

To consider the effect of solvent species on the local configuration of the active single metal, a thermodynamical full-landscape searching (TFLS) scheme is employed. The calculated thermodynamic overpotentials (Î·td ) from our TFLS indicate that Co@N4 TG displays high catalytic activity toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and reduction reaction (ORR), with Î·td OER and Î·td ORR as 0.397 and 0.357â V, respectively. Its OER potential cannot be captured if only one four electron reaction loop (FERL) is considered. The actual active pathways do not always turn out to be the reactions starting from the bare site.

Design: Case series of 73 patients. Setting: Large tertiary hospital in Milan. Participants: Mechanically ventilated patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 20 February and 2 April 2020. Main outcome measures: Demographic and daily clinical data were collected to identify predictors of early mortality. Results: Of the 73 patients included in the study, most were male (83.6%), the median age was 61 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-69 years), and hypertension affected 52.9% of patients. Lymphocytopenia (median, 0.77 x 103 per mm3 ; IQR, 0.58-1.00 x 103 per mm3), hyperinflammation with C-reactive protein (median, 184.5 mg/dL; IQR, 108.2-269.1 mg/dL) and pro-coagulant status with D-dimer (median, 10.1 µg/m; IQR, 5.0-23.8 µg/m) were present. Median tidal volume was 6.7 mL/kg (IQR, 6.0-7.5 mL/kg), and median positive end-expiratory pressure was 12 cmH2O (IQR, 10-14 cmH2O). In the first 3 days, prone positioning (12-16 h) was used in 63.8% of patients and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in five patients (6.8%). After a median follow-up of 19.0 days (IQR, 15.0-27.0 days), 17 patients (23.3%) had died, 23 (31.5%) had been discharged from the ICU, and 33 (45.2%) were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22; P = 0.004) and hypertension (OR, 6.15; 95% CI, 1.75-29.11; P = 0.009) were associated with mortality, while early improvement in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio was associated with being discharged alive from the ICU (P = 0.002 for interaction).

516486,Challenges for healthcare communication during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Purpose: Governments around the world have used social distancing methods to slow the spread of COVID-19 Some people, however, have ignored repeated warnings about the need to maintain social distance The purpose of this study was to segment individuals based on their perceptions of social distancing with respect to shared constructs, such as attitudes and demographic profiles The findings can assist social marketing efforts to target specific groups for health campaigns Design/methodology/approach: This study used a priori methods, meaning that the type and number of segments were determined in advance Amazon’s Mturk was used to collect data from an online sample of US residents (n = 759) in May 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic Findings: Individuals’ perceptions of social distancing were segmented as follows: Segment 1 = majority social distancing followers;Segment 2 = social distancing inbetweeners;and Segment 3 = minority social distancing rebels Interestingly, some of these segments were strongly affiliated with political parties In addition, the results show attitudes toward social distancing appear to be influenced by individuals’ beliefs regarding their susceptibility to coronavirus and the potential severity of the symptoms or disease’s impact on their lives Research limitations/implications: This study makes several theoretical and practical contributions to the literature on these issues In particular, it involved the application of the health belief model to the context of attitudes toward social distancing, which were found to be influenced by individuals’ beliefs regarding whether they are susceptible to coronavirus infection and whether the symptoms or disease could have a significant effect on their lives Practical implications: The results of this study will assist public health researchers, social marketers and policymakers in efforts to improve the effectiveness of health campaigns Public health campaigns in the USA need to be bi-partisan The finding that the social distancing rebels were mostly Republicans is consistent with an earlier report that those who identify with this party were less convinced than those who identified with the Democratic party regarding the efficacy of maintaining social distancing measures and more concerned about the adverse effects of these measures on the economy Originality/value: Only a few studies have segmented populations based on their perceptions of social distancing This study was designed to understand the distinguishing features of such segments to enhance health messaging and content and convince those reluctant to engage in social distancing to view the issue from the perspective of marketing and medical practitioners © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Arli, D.; Ang, T.; Wei, S.",Journal of Social Marketing,,366
516752,A physiological link for psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19: role of amino acid deficiency,2020,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between socioeconomic status and the risk of contracting coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains controversial. We aimed to investigate whether socioeconomic status affected the risk of contracting COVID-19 in the South Korean population. METHODS: The NHIS-COVID-19 database cohort was used in this population-based study. We collected the data of COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed between January 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020 and those of the control population. The income levels of all individuals as of February 2020 were extracted, and study participants were classified into four groups based on quartiles: Q1 (the lowest) to Q4 (the highest). Data were statistically analyzed using multivariable logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: In total, 122,040 individuals-7669 and 114,371 individuals in the COVID-19 and control groups, respectively-were included in the final analysis. The multivariable logistic regression model showed that the Q1 group had a 1.19-fold higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than the Q4 group, whereas the Q2 and Q3 groups showed no significant differences. In the 20-39 years age group, compared with the Q4 group, the Q3 and Q2 groups showed 11 and 22% lower risks of contracting COVID-19, respectively. In the &#8805;60 years age group, compared with the Q4 group, the Q1, Q2, and Q3 groups showed a 1.39-, 1.29-, and 1.14-fold higher risks of COVID-19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lower socioeconomic status was associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 in South Korea. This association was more evident in the older population (age &#8805; 60 years), whereas both lower and higher socioeconomic statuses were associated with higher risks of contracting COVID-19 in the young adult population (in the 20-39 year age group). Strategies for the prevention of COVID-19 should focus on individuals of lower socioeconomic status and on young adults of higher and lower socioeconomic status.","Oh, Tak Kyu; Choi, Jae-Wook; Song, In-Ae",BMC Public Health,,366
517408,"Creating a Safe, Return-to-sport Environment in Upstate New York during the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: Reports from countries severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic suggest a decline in acute coronary syndrome (ACS)-related hospitalizations. The generalizability of this observation on ACS admissions and possible related causes in countries with low COVID-19 incidence are not known. HYPOTHESIS: ACS admissions were reduced in a country spared by COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide study on the incidence rates of ACS-related admissions during a 6-week period of the COVID-19 outbreak and the corresponding control period in 2019 in Greece, a country with strict social measures, low COVID-19 incidence, and no excess in mortality. RESULTS: ACS admissions in the COVID-19 (n = 771) compared with the control (n = 1077) period were reduced overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 0.72, P < .001) and for each ACS type (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]: IRR: 0.76, P = .001; non-STEMI: IRR: 0.74, P < .001; and unstable angina [UA]: IRR: 0.63, P = .002). The decrease in STEMI admissions was stable throughout the COVID-19 period (temporal correlation; R2 = 0.11, P = .53), whereas there was a gradual decline in non-STEMI/UA admissions (R2 = 0.75, P = .026) following the progressively stricter social measures. During the COVID-19 period, patients admitted with ACS presented more frequently with left ventricular systolic impairment (22.2 vs 15.5% control period; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a reduction in ACS hospitalizations during the COVID-19 outbreak in a country with strict social measures, low community transmission, and no excess in mortality. Medical care avoidance behavior is an important factor for these observations, while a true reduction of the ACS incidence due to self-isolation/quarantining may have also played a role.","Papafaklis, Michail I; Katsouras, Christos S; Tsigkas, Grigorios; Toutouzas, Konstantinos; Davlouros, Periklis; Hahalis, George N; Kousta, Maria S; Styliadis, Ioannis G; Triantafyllou, Konstantinos; Pappas, Loukas; Tsiourantani, Fotini; Varytimiadi, Efthymia; Anyfantakis, Zacharias-Alexandros; Iakovis, Nikolaos; Grammata, Paraskevi; Karvounis, Haralambos; Ziakas, Antonios; Sianos, George; Tziakas, Dimitrios; Pappa, Evgenia; Dagre, Anna; Patsilinakos, Sotirios; Trikas, Athanasios; Lamprou, Thomais; Mamarelis, Ioannis; Katsimagklis, Georgios; Karmpaliotis, Dimitri; Naka, Katerina; Michalis, Lampros K",Clin. cardiol,,366

518331,Perceptions of students regarding e-learning during covid-19 at a private medical college,2020,"We describe a mammalian cell-based assay to identify coronavirus 3CL protease (3CLpro) inhibitors. This assay is based on rescuing protease-mediated cytotoxicity and does not require live virus. By enabling the facile testing of compounds across a range of 15 distantly related coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes, we identify compounds with broad 3CLpro inhibitory activity. We also adapt the assay for use in compound screening and in doing so uncover additional SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. We observe strong concordance between data emerging from this assay and those obtained from live virus testing. The reported approach democratizes the testing of 3CLpro inhibitors by developing a simplified method for identifying coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors that can be used by the majority of laboratories, rather than the few with extensive biosafety infrastructure. We identify two lead compounds, GC376 and compound 4, with broad activity against all 3CL proteases tested including 3CLpro enzymes from understudied zoonotic coronaviruses.ImportanceMultiple coronavirus pandemics have occurred over the last two decades. This has highlighted a need to be proactive in the development of therapeutics that can be readily deployed in the case of future coronavirus pandemics. We develop and validate a simplified cell-based assay for the identification of chemical inhibitors of 3CL proteases encoded by a wide range of coronaviruses. This assay is reporter-free, does not require specialized biocontainment, and is optimized for performance in high-throughput screening. By testing reported 3CL protease inhibitors against a large collection of 3CL proteases with variable sequence similarity, we identify compounds with broad activity against 3CL proteases and uncover structural insights that contribute to their broad activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate this assay is suitable for identifying chemical inhibitors of proteases from families other than 3CL proteases.","Resnick, Samuel J; Iketani, Sho; Hong, Seo Jung; Zask, Arie; Liu, Hengrui; Kim, Sungsoo; Melore, Schuyler; Lin, Fang-Yu; Nair, Manoj S; Huang, Yaoxing; Lee, Sumin; Tay, Nicholas E S; Rovis, Tomislav; Yang, Hee Won; Xing, Li; Stockwell, Brent R; Ho, David D; Chavez, Alejandro",J. virol,,366

METHODS: After systematically searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 retrospective, 6 prospective observational, and 2 cross-sectional studies was performed according to the guidelines of the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) statement. RESULTS: Overall, 4382 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Men accounted for significantly more patients than did women (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.02; P < .001). The total incidence of VTE among the patients with COVID-19 was 28.3% (95% CI, 21.6%-35.4%), with an incidence of 38.0% (95% CI, 29.1%-47.4%) and 17.2% (95% CI, 11.4%-23.8%) among those with severe and general COVID-19, respectively. The total incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities was 18.3% (95% CI, 10.8%-27.2%). The incidence of DVT was 22.1% (95% CI, 11.0%-35.5%) and 12.8% (95% CI, 5.0%-23.3%) in those with severe and general COVID-19, respectively. The total incidence of pulmonary embolism was 17.6% (95% CI, 12.3%-23.5%), with a rate of 21.7% (95% CI, 14.8%-29.3%) in severe cases and 12.5% (95% CI, 6.1%-23.5%) in general cases. When COVID-19 severity was unclassified, the mortality for the patients with VTE was not significantly greater (25.2%; 95% CI, 12.2%-40.5%) than that for those without VTE (10.2%; 95% CI, 3.4%-19.5%; OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 0.46-7.64; P = .377). However, among the patients with severe COVID-19, those who had developed VTE had significantly greater mortality compared with those without VTE (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.15-3.53; P = .014). The patients with COVID-19 and VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels than did similar patients without VTE in multiple studies. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of VTE, DVT, and pulmonary embolism has been substantial among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially among those with severe COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 and VTE had significantly greater mortality compared with similar patients without VTE. An increased D-dimer level might be an indicator of the occurrence of VTE in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Yandong; Cai, Jiawei; Wang, Chao; Jin, Jie; Qu, Lefeng",J. Vasc. Surg. Venous Lymphat.

However, the role of BKPyV integration on oncogenesis is still unclear. In this study, next-generation virome capture sequencing of primary and metastatic tumors were performed in three patients with BKPyV-associated urothelial carcinoma after renal transplantation. As a result, a total of 332 viral integration sites were identified in the six tumors. Integration of BKPyV in both primary and metastatic tumors followed the mechanism of microhomology-mediated end joining mostly, since microhomologies between human and BKPyV genomes were significantly enriched in flanking regions of 84% of the integration sites. Viral DNA breakpoints were nonrandom and tended to assemble in large T gene, small T gene and viral protein 2 gene. There were three, one and one consensus integration sites between the primary and metastatic tumors, which affected LINC01924, eIF3c, and NEIL2 genes in the three cases respectively. Thus, we concluded that integration of BKPyV was a continuous process occurring in both primary and metastatic tumors, generating heterogenous tumor cell populations. Through this ongoing process, certain cell populations might have gained growth advantage or metastatic potential, as a result of viral integration either affecting the cellular genes where the viral DNA integrated to or altering the expression or function of the viral genes.","Wang, Yuchen; Liu, Yanna; Deng, Wenfeng; Fu, Fangxiang; Yan, Susha; Yang, Hongwei; Liu, Rumin; Geng, Jian; Xu, Jian; Wu, Yihan; Ma, Junfeng; Zhou, Jiapeng; Liu, Na; Jin, Yu; Xia, Renfei; Elias, Nahel; Lee, Richard J; Feldman, Adam S; Blute, Michael L; Colvin, Robert B; Wu, Chin-Lee; Miao, Yun",Oncogene,,366

The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic could therefore have a serious impact on the health of people with CF (pwCF). METHODS: We used the 38-country European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) to collect case data about pwCF and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Up to 30 June 2020, 16 countries reported 130 SARS-CoV-2 cases in people with CF, yielding an incidence of 2.70/1000 pwCF. Incidence was higher in lung-transplanted patients (n=23) versus non-transplanted patients (n=107) (8.43 versus 2.36 cases/1000). Incidence was higher in pwCF versus the age-matched general population in the age groups <15, 15-24, and 25-49 years (p<0.001), with similar trends for pwCF with and without lung transplant. Compared to the general population, pwCF (regardless of transplantation status) had significantly higher rates of admission to hospital for all age groups with available data, and higher rates of intensive care, although not statistically significant. Most pwCF recovered (96.2%), however 5 died, of whom 3 were lung transplant recipients. The case fatality rate for pwCF (3.85%, 95% CI: 1.26-8.75) was non-significantly lower than that of the general population (7.46%; p=0.133). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in severe illness and death for pwCF, even for younger patients and especially for lung transplant recipients. PwCF should continue to shield from infection and should be prioritized for vaccination.","Naehrlich, Lutz; Orenti, Annalisa; Dunlevy, Fiona; Kasmi, Irena; Harutyunyan, Satenik; Pfleger, Andreas; Keegan, Svetlana; Daneau, Géraldine; Petrova, Guergana; Tjesic-Drinkovic, Duska; Yiallouros, Panayiotis; Bilkova, Alena; Olesen, Hanne Vebert; Burgel, Pierre-Régis; Parulava, Tsitsino; Diamantea, Filia; Párniczky, Andrea; McKone, Edward F; Mei-Zahav, Meir; Salvatore, Marco; Colombo, Carla; Aleksejeva, Elina; Malakauskas, Kestutis; Schlesser, Marc; Fustik, Stojka; Turcu, Oxana; Zomer-van Ommen, Domenique; Wathne, Anita Senstad; Wozniacki, Lukasz; Pereira, Luísa; Pop, Liviu; Kashirskaya, Nataliya; Rodic, Milan; Kayserova, Hana; Krivecs, Uro; Mondejar-Lopez, Pedro; de Monestrol, Isabelle; Dogru, Deniz; Makukh, Halyna; Cosgriff, Rebecca; van Koningsbruggen-Rietschel, Silke; Jung, Andreas",J. cyst. fibros,,366

METHODS: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies that compared the use of upper airway sleep apnea surgery or bariatric surgery to no treatment as well as studies that reported on patient-important and physiologic outcomes pre- and postoperatively. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the clinical significance of using surgery to treat obstructive sleep apnea in adults. Finally, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence for making recommendations. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 274 studies that provided data suitable for statistical analyses. The analyses demonstrated that surgery as a rescue therapy results in a clinically significant reduction in excessive sleepiness, snoring, blood pressure (BP), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), increase in lowest oxygen saturation (LSAT), sleep quality, and improvement in quality of life in adults with OSA who are intolerant or unaccepting of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. The analyses demonstrated that surgery as an adjunctive therapy results in a clinically significant reduction in optimal PAP pressure and improvement in PAP adherence in adults with OSA who are intolerant or unaccepting of PAP due to side effects associated with high pressure requirements. The analyses also demonstrated that surgery as an initial treatment results in a clinically significant reduction in AHI/RDI, sleepiness, snoring, BP, and ODI, and increase in LSAT in adults with OSA and major anatomical obstruction. Analysis of bariatric surgery data showed a clinically significant reduction in BP, AHI/RDI, sleepiness, snoring, optimal PAP level, BMI, ODI, and an increase in LSAT in adults with OSA and obesity. Analyses of very limited evidence suggest that upper airway surgery does not result in a clinically significant increase in risk of serious persistent adverse events and suggested that bariatric surgery may result in a clinically significant risk of iron malabsorption that may be managed with iron supplements. The task force provided a detailed summary of the evidence along with the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations.","Kent, David; Stanley, Jeffrey; Aurora, R Nisha; Levine, Corinna G; Gottlieb, Daniel J; Spann, Matthew D; Torre, Carlos A; Green, Katherine; Harrod, Christopher G",J. clin. sleep med,,366

The predominant diagnostic test is viral RNA detection by RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs specimens, however the results are not promptly obtainable in all patient care locations. Routine laboratory testing, in contrast, is readily available with a turn-around time (TAT) usually within 1-2 hours. METHOD: We developed a machine learning model incorporating patient demographic features (age, sex, race) with 27 routine laboratory tests to predict an individual’s SARS-CoV-2 infection status. Laboratory test results obtained within two days before the release of SARS-CoV-2-RT-PCR result were used to train a gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) model from 3,356 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tested patients (1,402 positive and 1,954 negative) evaluated at a metropolitan hospital. RESULTS: The model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.854 (95% CI: 0.829-0.878). Application of this model to an independent patient dataset from a separate hospital resulted in a comparable AUC (0.838), validating the generalization of its use. Moreover, our model predicted initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity in 66% individuals whose RT-PCR result changed from negative to positive within two days. CONCLUSION: This model employing routine laboratory test results offers opportunities for early and rapid identification of high-risk SARS-CoV-2 infected patients before their RT-PCR results are available. It may play an important role in assisting the identification of SARS-COV-2 infected patients in areas where RT-PCR testing is not accessible due to financial or supply constraints.","Yang, He S; Hou, Yu; Vasovic, Ljiljana V; Steel, Peter; Chadburn, Amy; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Velu, Priya; Cushing, Melissa M; Loda, Massimo; Kaushal, Rainu; Zhao, Zhen; Wang, Fei",Clin Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32821907/; https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa200,366

Here we utilized a combination of targeted amino acids (AAs) and clinical biochemical profiling to analyze the plasma of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) subjects at the hospitalization stage and 1-month post-infection convalescent stage, respectively, to investigate the systematic injury during COVID-19 disease progress. We found the virus-induced inflammatory status and reduced liver synthesis capacity in hospitalized patients, which manifested with increased branched-chain AAs (BCAAs), aromatic AAs (AAAs), one-carbon related metabolites, and decreased methionine. Most of these disturbances during infection recover except for the increased levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines (ACs) in the convalescent subjects, implying the existence of incomplete fatty acids oxidation during recovery periods. Our results suggested that the imbalance of the AA profiling in COVID-19 patients. The majority of disturbed AAs recovered in 1 month. The incomplete fatty acid oxidation products suggested it might take longer time for convalescent patients to get complete recovery.","Wu, Junfang; Zhao, Mingming; Li, Chenze; Zhang, Yuxuan; Wang, Dao Wen",Biosci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625490/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20204201,366
590716,Induction of labour during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey of impact on practice in the UK,2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 comprises several severity stages ranging from oligosymptomatic disease to multi-organ failure and fatal outcomes. The mechanisms why COVID-19 is a mild disease in some patients and progresses to a severe multi-organ and often fatal disease with respiratory failure are not known. Biomarkers that predict the course of disease are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate a large spectrum of established laboratory measurements. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients from the prospective PULMPOHOM and CORSAAR studies were recruited and comprised 35 patients with COVID-19, 23 with conventional pneumonia, and 28 control patients undergoing elective non-pulmonary surgery. Venous blood was used to measure the serum concentrations of 79 proteins by Luminex multiplex immunoassay technology. Distribution of biomarkers between groups and association with disease severity and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The biomarker profiles between the three groups differed significantly with elevation of specific proteins specific for the respective conditions. Several biomarkers correlated significantly with disease severity and death. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis revealed a significant separation of the three disease groups and separated between survivors and deceased patients. Different models were developed to predict mortality based on the baseline measurements of several protein markers. A score combining IL-1ra, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, SCF and CA-9 was associated with significantly higher mortality (AUC 0.929). DISCUSSION: Several newly identified blood markers were significantly increased in patients with severe COVID-19 (AAT, EN-RAGE, myoglobin, SAP, TIMP-1, vWF, decorin) or in patients that died (IL-1ra, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, SCF, CA-9).

591453,Complicated Alcohol Withdrawal—An Unintended Consequence of COVID-19 Lockdown,2020-05-13,"Robot design to simulate interpersonal social interaction is an active area of research with applications in therapy and companionship. Neural responses to eye-to-eye contact in humans have recently been employed to determine the neural systems that are active during social interactions. Whether eye-contact with a social robot engages the same neural system remains to be seen. Here, we employ a similar approach to compare human-human and human-robot social interactions. We assume that if human-human and human-robot eye-contact elicit similar neural activity in the human, then the perceptual and cognitive processing is also the same for human and robot. That is, the robot is processed similar to the human. However, if neural effects are different, then perceptual and cognitive processing is assumed to be different. In this study neural activity was compared for human-to-human and human-to-robot conditions using near infrared spectroscopy for neural imaging, and a robot (Maki) with eyes that blink and move right and left. Eye-contact was confirmed by eye-tracking for both conditions. Increased neural activity was observed in human social systems including the right temporal parietal junction and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during human-human eye contact but not human-robot eye-contact. This suggests that the type of human-robot eye-contact used here is not sufficient to engage the right temporoparietal junction in the human. This study establishes a foundation for future research into human-robot eye-contact to determine how elements of robot design and behavior impact human social processing within this type of interaction and may offer a method for capturing difficult to quantify components of human-robot interaction, such as social engagement.","Kelley, Megan S.; Noah, J.

593053,Have There Been any Changes in the Epidemiology and Etiology of Maxillofacial Trauma During the COVID-19 Pandemic? An Italian Multicenter Study,2020-11-19,"INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic forced many governments to impose nation-wide lockdowns. Government legislation forced limited travel on the population with restrictions on the normal way of life to limit spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of lockdown on the presentation of maxillofacial trauma in a level I trauma centre. METHODS: Comparative analysis was carried out using prospective and retrospective review of all consecutive patients admitted with any maxillofacial fracture in the lockdown period between 15th March and 15th June 2020 with the same period in 2019 to a Regional Trauma Maxillofacial Surgery Unit. Data included basic demographics and mechanism of injury including alcohol/drug influence, polytrauma, site of injury and treatment modality including escalation of care. RESULTS: Across both periods, there were a total of one hundred and five (n = 105) recorded episodes of traumatic fractures with fifty-three (n = 53) in the pre-lockdown cohort and fifty-two (n = 52) in the lockdown. Included patients were significantly (p = 0.024) older during lockdown (mean age 41.44 years SD 20.70, range 5–96) with no differences in gender distribution between cohorts (p = 0.270). Patients in lockdown were more likely to be involved in polytrauma (p < 0.05) and have sustained their injury by cycling/running or any outdoor related activity (p = 0.013). Lockdown saw a significant reduction in alcohol and drug related violence (p < 0.05). Significantly more patients required operative management (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Local lockdowns form part of the governments public health strategy for managing future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Our study showed no significant reduction in volume of trauma during lockdown. It is vital that hospitals maintain trauma capacity to ensure that patients are treated in a timely manner.","Dawoud, Basim E.

Although practitioners focused on the pulmonary devastation, resources for the provision of dialysis proved to be more constrained. To deal with these shortfalls, NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue, NYU Brooklyn, NYU Medical Center and the New York Harbor VA Healthcare System, put together a plan to offset the anticipated increased needs for kidney replacement therapy. Prior to the pandemic, peritoneal dialysis was not used for acute kidney injury at Bellevue Hospital. We were able to rapidly establish an acute peritoneal dialysis program at Bellevue Hospital for acute kidney injury patients in the intensive care unit. A dedicated surgery team was assembled to work with the nephrologists for bedside placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheters. A multi-disciplinary team was trained by the lead nephrologist to deliver peritoneal dialysis in the intensive care unit. Between April 8, 2020 and May 8, 2020, 39 peritoneal dialysis catheters were placed at Bellevue Hospital. 38 patients were successfully started on peritoneal dialysis. As of June 10, 2020, 16 patients recovered renal function. One end stage kidney disease patient was converted to peritoneal dialysis and was discharged. One catheter was poorly functioning, and the patient was changed to hemodialysis before recovering renal function. There were no episodes of peritonitis and nine incidents of minor leaking, which resolved. Some patients received successful peritoneal dialysis while being ventilated in the prone position. In summary, despite severe shortages of staff, supplies and dialysis machines during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to rapidly implement a de novo peritoneal dialysis program which enabled provision of adequate kidney replacement therapy to all admitted patients who needed it. Our experience is a model for the use of acute peritoneal dialysis in crisis situations.","Caplin, N.

Although mitigation measures have been globally considered, the spatial heterogeneity of its effectiveness is evident, underscoring global health inequalities. Using Bayesian-based Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, we evidenced that factors contributing to poverty are also risk factors for COVID-19 case-fatality, and unexpectedly, their impact on the case-fatality risk is comparable to that produced by health factors. Additionally, we confirm that both case-fatality risk and multidimensional poverty index have a heterogeneous spatial distribution, where the lastest consists of health, educational, dwelling, and employment dimensions. Spatio-temporal analysis reveals that the spatial heterogeneity in case-fatalities is associated with the percentage contribution of the health (RR 1.89 95%CI=1.43-2.48) and dwelling (RR 2.01 95%CI=1.37-2.63) dimensions to the multidimensional poverty, but also with the educational (RR 1.21 95%CI=1.03-1.49), and employment (RR 1.23 95%CI=1.02-1.47) dimensions. This spatial correlation indicates that the case-fatality risk increase by 189% and 201% in regions with a higher contribution of the health dimension (i.e., lack of health insurance and self-reporting) and dwelling dimension (i.e., lack of access to safe water, inadequate disposal of human feces, poor housing construction, and critical overcrowding), respectively. These findings assist policy-makers in the spatial and temporal planning of strategies focused on mitigating the case-fatality risk in most vulnerable communities and preparing for future pandemics by progressively reducing the factors that generate health inequality.","Polo, G.; Mera Acosta, C.; Soler-Tovar, D.; Porras Villamil, J.

594759,The global burden of trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review,2020-11-14,"Historically, reducing aerosol-based transmission of respired viruses in indoor environments has been of importance for controlling influenza viruses and common-cold rhinoviruses. The present public health emergency associated with SARS-CoV-2 makes this topic critically important. Yet to be tested is the potential effectiveness of simple interventions that create an isolation zone (IZ) for a suspected/confirmed sick or sensitive person requiring quarantine. The intent in existing homes is to find a practical means to mitigate exposure to airborne contaminants. In creating an IZ in an occupied single-family home in the study, four simple strategies were tested. The test configurations were: (1) IZ windows closed with IZ bathroom exhaust ventilation fan off, (2) IZ windows closed with IZ exhaust fan on, (3) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan off, and (4) IZ window open with IZ exhaust fan on. Incense-generated fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) was used as a marker for virus transmission. The measured transfer of PM(2.5) from the IZ into the main zone (MZ) of the house enabled us to determine the relative effectiveness of four containment strategies. Collectively, the data from pressure differential (across zones) and PM(2.5) measurements suggested that the best containment strategy was achieved through continuously operating the bathroom exhaust fan while keeping the windows closed in the IZ (configuration 2). Interventions using open windows were found to be less reliable, due to variability in wind speed and direction, resulting in an unpredictable and sometimes detrimental pressure differential in the IZ with reference to MZ. Our findings strongly suggest a simple IZ exhaust ventilation strategy has the potential for mitigating the risk from the airborne spread of contaminants, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Khan, Tanvir R.; Parker, Danny S.; Withers, Charles",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070834/,366

However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to examine the prevalence and associated risk factors for psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Amidst the disease outbreak, 41 out of 105 COVID-19 patients in a local designated hospital in China were successfully assessed using a constellation of psychometric questionnaires to determine their psychological morbidities and fatigue. Several potential biopsychosocial risk factors (including pre-existing disabilities, CT severity score of pneumonia, social support, coping strategies) were assessed through multivariable logistic regression analyses to clarify their association with mental health in patients. RESULTS: 43.9% of 41 patients presented with impaired general mental health, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 26.8% had anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and 53.6% had fatigue. We did not find any association between pneumonia severity and psychological morbidities or fatigue in COVID-19 patients. However, high perceived stigmatization was associated with an increased risk of impaired general mental health and high perceived social support was associated with decreased risk. Besides, negative coping inclination was associated with an increased risk of PTSD symptoms; high perceived social support was associated with a decreased risk of anxiety and/or depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological morbidities and chronic fatigue are common among COVID-19 patients. Negative coping inclination and being stigmatized are primary risk factors while perceived social support is the main protective factor.","Qi, Rongfeng; Chen, Wei; Liu, Saiduo; Thompson, Paul M.; Zhang, Long Jiang; Xia, Fei; Cheng, Fang; Hong, Ailing; Surento, Wesley; Luo, Song; Sun, Zhi Yuan; Zhou, Chang Sheng; Li, Lingjiang; Jiang, Xiangao; Lu, Guang Ming",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20031666v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511502/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20031666,366

One of the safety measures implemented was universal screening for SARS-CoV-2 of all ART patients. Our aim was to assess the usefulness of this measure. Design: Cohort study. Materials and Methods: All women initiating ART treatment from May 1st, through July 17, 2020, at one of the two IVF Units of the Assuta Medical Centers, were required to undergo screening with nasopharyngeal swabs and a quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction test to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. All women with symptoms of Covid-19 or those with recent exposure to an infected person were not allowed to commence ART treatment. Since almost all of the IVF cycles performed at our centers are fully covered by the Israeli national health insurance, treatment is very accessible, and thus we believe that our sample is representative of the country’s COVID-19 prevalence. Results: A total of 4,259 asymptomatic women underwent ART treatments at the Assuta Medical Centers, 2,787 ovum pick-ups and and 1,472 frozen embryo transfers. Overall, 23 women (0.54%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate of women who tested positive was similar in our IVF center in Tel-Aviv, 11 of 2,299 women (0.48%), and in our more southern Rishon Lezion center, 12 of 1,970 (0.61%). An additional 11 women had to cancel their IVF treatment as their male partner was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only a fifth of the positive patients came from cities declared by the Ministry of Health as Covid-19 hotspots. Conclusions: Our use of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in all ART patients initiating ART treatment revealed that at this point in the pandemic in central Israel, one in 200 asymptomatic women starting an ART treatment cycle was positive for SARS-CoV-2. This ratio is approximately 10 times lower than the current rate among women screened in Israel due to Covid-19 related symptoms or exposure to a positive person. The potential benefit of universal testing for Covid-19 includes the ability to protect patients and health care staff during these challenging times by lowering the risk of novel coronavirus exposure in the ART clinic. However, universal screening may burden the limited testing resources and may lead to less vigilant use of personal protective measures.","Seidman, Daniel S.; Kahane, Arik; Shulman, Adrian; Schiff, Eyal; Shavit, Tal",Fertility and Sterility,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028220322573; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.056; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0015028220322573,366

Little is known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we report the first confirmed case of early postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient recovering after Hartmann’s procedure for acute diverticulitis. After an otherwise unevenful postoperative course, on post-operative day 8, the patient suddenly presented hyperpyrexia and cough, rapidly evolving to respiratory failure and death 36 h after symptoms onset. CT-scan identified bilateral, diffuse, interstitial pneumonitis and oropharyngeal swab test confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. A previous contact with the partner, developing the same symptoms, remained unrecognized until ICU admission. DISCUSSION: During a pandemic outbreak, the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection of an inside patient initially considered to be infection-free has a pivotal importance not only for the prompt patient’s management, but also to avoid infection spreading to other patients and hospital personnel.In the reported case, a more precise information to the patient regarding the imperative necessity to inform the medical personnel of any person of his entourage presenting, at any time, any tell-tale sign, symptom or examination which may be attributed to COVID-19, may have had allowed to anticipate patient’s isolation and examinations and procedures aimed at identifying such an infection. CONCLUSION: Persistent hyperleucocytosis and increased CRP serum level in spite of uneventful postoperative course were the only, aspecific markers of an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection before symptoms’ onset, and should be considered in future clinical practice in order to adopt the prompt and appropriate patient management and limit COVID-19 contagion in surgical units.","Montali, Filippo; Palmieri, Gerardo; Casali, Lorenzo; Pagliai, Lorenzo; Costi, Renato",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210261220304764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622186/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.06.073; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210261220304764,366

Species barrier jumping has been extensively studied in animal viruses, and the critical role of a suitable intermediate host in animal viruses-generated human pandemics is highly topical. However, studies on host jumping involving plant viruses have been focused on shifting intra-species, leaving aside the putative role of “bridge hosts” in facilitating interspecies crossing. Here, we take advantage of several VPg mutants, derived from a chimeric construct of the potyvirus Plum pox virus (PPV), analyzing its differential behaviour in three herbaceous species. Our results showed that two VPg mutations in a Nicotiana clevelandii-adapted virus, emerged during adaptation to the bridge-host Arabidopsis thaliana, drastically prompted partial adaptation to Chenopodium foetidum. Although both changes are expected to facilitate productive interactions with eIF(iso)4E, polymorphims detected in PPV VPg and the three eIF(iso)4E studied, extrapolated to a recent VPg:eIF4E structural model, suggested that two adaptation ways can be operating. Remarkably, we found that VPg mutations driving host-range expansion in two non-related species, not only are not associated with cost trade-off constraints in the original host, but also improve fitness on it.","Martínez-Turiño, Sandra; Calvo, María; Bedoya, Leonor Cecilia; Zhao, Mingmin; García, Juan Antonio",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920394/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9040805,366

Although mass-vaccination sites have been identified as essential to curb COVID-19, their organization and functioning is challenging. In this paper we present the planning, implementation and evaluation of a massive vaccination center in Lombardy - the largest Region in Italy and the most heavily hit by the pandemic. The massive hub of Novegro (Milan), managed by the Gruppo Ospedaliero San Donato, opened in April 2021. The Novegro massimmunization model was developed building a layout based on the available scientific evidence, on comparative analysis with other existing models and on the experience of COVID-19 immunization delivery of Gruppo Ospedaliero San Donato. We propose a ""vaccine islands"" mass-immunization model, where 4 physicians and 2 nurses operate in each island, with up to 10 islands functioning at the same time, with the capacity of providing up to 6,000 vaccinations per day. During the first week of activity a total of 37,900 doses were administered (2,700/day), most of them with Pfizer vaccine (85.8%) and first doses (70.9%). The productivity was 10.5 vaccines/hour/vaccine station. Quality, efficiency and safety were boosted by ad-hoc personnel training, quality technical infrastructure and the presence of a shock room. Constant process monitoring allowed to identify and promptly tackle process pitfalls, including vaccine refusals (0.36%, below expectations) and post-vaccinations adverse reactions (0.4%).

596096,#Covid4Rheum: an analytical twitter study in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-09-29,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents an urgent health crisis. Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike(1–5) show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally(6–8). To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs(5) in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3–53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to “up” RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both “up” and “down” RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize “up” and “down” RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only “up” RBDs(9). Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3–53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent “down” RBDs, thereby locking spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically. These classifications and structural analyses provide rules for assigning current and future human RBD-targeting antibodies into classes, evaluating avidity effects, suggesting combinations for clinical use, and providing insight into immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Barnes, Christopher O.; Jette, Claudia A.; Abernathy, Morgan E.; Dam, Kim-Marie A.; Esswein, Shannon R.; Gristick, Harry B.; Malyutin, Andrey G.; Sharaf, Naima G.; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E.; Lee, Yu E.; Robbiani, Davide F.; Nussenzweig, Michel C.; West, Anthony P.; Bjorkman, Pamela J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.30.273920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869026/,366

The conventional identification methods require time-consuming culturing, and/ or detection of antibodies, which are not very sensitive and specific. The recent advances in molecular biology techniques in the field of genomics and proteomics greatly facilitate the rapid identification with more accuracy. We have developed two real-time assays ie., SYBR green I based real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for rapid detection as well as typing of some of the emerging viruses of biomedical importance viz. dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, west Nile, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) etc. Both these techniques are capable of detection and differentiation as well as quantifying viral load with higher sensitivity, rapidity, specificity. One of the most important advantages of LAMP is its field applicability, without requirement of any sophisticated equipments. Both these assays have been extensively evaluated and validated with clinical samples of recent epidemics from different parts of India. The establishment of these real time molecular assays will certainly facilitate the rapid detection of viruses with high degree of precision and accuracy in future.","Parida, M.

597082,Family Physicians' Perception of the New mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines,2021,"BACKGROUND: The traditional model for subspecialty education in internal medicine (IM) residencies is a short inpatient consult rotation, which often lacks outpatient exposure and continuity with faculty. Our IM residency program developed a longitudinal subspecialty clinic (LSC) experience, which pairs categorical IM residents with a faculty preceptor in their subspecialty of interest. Residents work in their preceptor’s clinic for one half-day per week during ambulatory blocks throughout the PGY2 year. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the LSC program’s educational impact and determine best practices for successful implementation. METHODS: From May to July 2019, we surveyed residents and preceptors who participated in an LSC between 2014 and 2019, gathering quantitative and qualitative data on their experiences RESULTS: Survey response rates were 66.4% (N=93/140) for residents, 57.7% (N=15/26) for preceptors. Most residents and preceptors were very or extremely satisfied with their LSC experience (83.3% and 71.4%, respectively). Most residents and preceptors reported that the LSC experience was very or extremely effective in enabling residents to explore their subspecialty of interest (76.0%, 86.7%), form a mentoring relationship with their preceptor (71.3%, 80.0%), obtain a letter of recommendation (76.1%, 64.3%), prepare for fellowship (76.3%, 66.7%), gain exposure to outpatient subspecialty practice (90.0%, 73.3%), and gain medical knowledge (84.6%, 80.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that LSCs are effective in facilitating longitudinal subspecialty career exploration, mentorship, and education for residents. Opportunities for improvement include developing a more structured curriculum, addressing scheduling issues, and adding the option to extend the experience to the PGY3 year.","Consunji, Martin V.; Kohlwes, R.

597676,Identifying COVID-19 cases in primary care settings,2020-09-01,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the burden of viral respiratory infections in pre-term infants both during and subsequent to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) hospitalization and to compare this with term infants living in the community. STUDY DESIGN: From March 2013 through March 2015 we enrolled 189 newborns (96 term and 93 pre-term) into a prospective, longitudinal study obtaining nose/throat swabs within 7 days of birth, weekly while hospitalized and then monthly to four months after hospital discharge. Taqman array cards (TAC) were used to identify 16 viral respiratory pathogens by real time PCR. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were gathered from electronic medical records and parent interview while hospitalized with interval histories collected at monthly visits. The hospital course of all pre-term infants who underwent late-onset sepsis evaluations was reviewed. RESULTS: Over 119 weeks, we collected 618 nose/throat swabs from at risk pre-term infants in our Level IV regional NICU. Only four infants had viral respiratory infections, all less than 28 weeks gestation at birth. Two infants were symptomatic with the infections recognized by the clinical team. The daily risk of acquiring a respiratory viral infection in pre-term infants in the NICU was significantly lower than in the full term cohort living in the community. Once discharged from the hospital viral respiratory infections were common in all infants. CONCLUSIONS: Viral respiratory infections are infrequent in a NICU with strict infection prevention strategies, and do not appear to cause unrecognized illness. Both preterm and term infants living in the community quickly acquire respiratory viral infections.","Caserta, Mary T.; Yang, Hongmei; Gill, Steven R; Holden-Wiltse, Jeanne; Pryhuber, Gloria",The Journal of Pediatrics,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5328856?pdf=render; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347616313853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28041669/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347616313853; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.11.077,366
598489,Predicting Unscheduled Emergency Department Return Visits Among Older Adults: Population-Based Retrospective Study,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND: Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can be used in sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing environments to prioritize individuals at the highest risk of infection and optimize resource allocation. We previously derived a CPR to predict asymptomatic chlamydia and/or gonorrhea (CT/NG) infection among women and heterosexual men at in-person STI clinics based on 5 predictors. Population differences between clinic-based and Internet-based testers may limit the tool's application across settings. The primary objective of this study was to assess the validity, sensitivity, and overall performance of this CPR within an Internet-based testing environment (GetCheckedOnline.com). METHODS: We analyzed GetCheckedOnline online risk assessment and laboratory data from October 2015 to June 2019. We compared the STI clinic population used for CPR derivation (data previously published) and the GetCheckedOnline validation population using χ(2) tests. Calibration and discrimination were assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and the area under the receiver operating curve, respectively. Sensitivity and the fraction of total screening tests offered were quantified for CPR-predicted risk scores. RESULTS: Asymptomatic CT/NG infection prevalence in the GetCheckedOnline population (n = 5478) was higher than in the STI clinic population (n = 10,437; 2.4% vs. 1.8%, P = 0.007). When applied to GetCheckedOnline, the CPR had reasonable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow, P = 0.90) and discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic, 0.64). By screening only individuals with total risk scores ≥4, we would detect 97% of infections and reduce screening by 14%. CONCLUSIONS: The application of an existing CPR to detect asymptomatic CT/NG infection is valid within an Internet-based STI testing environment. Clinical prediction rules applied online can reduce unnecessary STI testing and optimize resource allocation within publicly funded health systems.","Ablona, Aidan; Falasinnu, Titilola; Irvine, Michael; Estcourt, Claudia; Flowers, Paul; Murti, Michelle; Gómez-Ramírez, Oralia; Fairley, Christopher K.; Mishra, Sharmistha; Burchell, Ann; Grennan, Troy; Gilbert, Mark",Sex Transm Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315748/; https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001340,366
598575,Perspective of Attending Physicians on the Use of Telemedicine in an Outpatient Arthroplasty Setting During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-02-21,"BACKGROUND: The etiology of severe pneumonia is frequently not identified by routine disease surveillance in Thailand. Since 2010, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and US CDC have conducted surveillance to detect known and new etiologies of severe pneumonia. METHODS: Surveillance for severe community-acquired pneumonia was initiated in December 2010 among 30 hospitals in 17 provinces covering all regions of Thailand. Interlinked clinical, laboratory, pathological and epidemiological components of the network were created with specialized guidelines for each to aid case investigation and notification. Severe pneumonia was defined as chest-radiograph confirmed pneumonia of unknown etiology in a patient hospitalized ≤48 h and requiring intubation with ventilator support or who died within 48 h after hospitalization; patients with underlying chronic pulmonary or neurological disease were excluded. Respiratory and pathological specimens were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for nine viruses, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 14 bacteria. Cases were reported via a secure web-based system. RESULTS: Of specimens from 972 cases available for testing during December 2010 through December 2015, 589 (60.6%) had a potential etiology identified; 399 (67.8%) were from children aged < 5 years. At least one viral agent was detected in 394 (40.5%) cases, with the most common of single vial pathogen detected being respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (110/589, 18.7%) especially in children under 5 years. Bacterial pathogens were detected in 341 cases of which 67 cases had apparent mixed infections. The system added MERS-CoV testing in September 2012 as part of Thailand’s outbreak preparedness; no cases were identified from the 767 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced surveillance improved the understanding of the etiology of severe pneumonia cases and improved the MOPH’s preparedness and response capacity for emerging respiratory pathogens in Thailand thereby enhanced global health security. Guidelines for investigation of severe pneumonia from this project were incorporated into surveillance and research activities within Thailand and shared for adaption by other countries.","Bunthi, Charatdao; Baggett, Henry C.; Gregory, Christopher J.; Thamthitiwat, Somsak; Yingyong, Thitipong; Paveenkittiporn, Wantana; Kerdsin, Anusak; Chittaganpitch, Malinee; Ruangchira-urai, Ruchira; Akarasewi, Pasakorn; Ungchusak, Kumnuan",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32326941/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-6774-5,366

(Saururaceae) and three of its constituent flavonoids (quercetin, quercitrin and rutin) against murine coronavirus and dengue virus (DENV). METHODS: The antiviral activities of various concentrations of the EA fraction of H. cordata and flavonoids were assessed using virus neutralization tests against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and DENV type 2 (DENV-2). Cinanserin hydrochloride was also tested against MHV. The EA fraction of H. cordata was tested for acute oral toxicity in C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: The EA fraction of H. cordata inhibited viral infectivity up to 6 d. Cinanserin hydrochloride was able to inhibit MHV for only 2 d. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of the EA fraction of H. cordata added before the viral adsorption stage were 0.98 μg/mL for MHV and 7.50 μg/mL for DENV-2 with absence of cytotoxicity. The mice fed with the EA fraction up to 2 000 mg/kg did not induce any signs of acute toxicity, with normal histological features of major organs. Certain flavonoids exhibited comparatively weaker antiviral activity, notably quercetin which could inhibit both MHV and DENV-2. This was followed by quercitrin which could inhibit DENV-2 but not MHV, whereas rutin did not exert any inhibitory effect on either virus. When quercetin was combined with quercitrin, enhancement of anti-DENV-2 activity and reduced cytotoxicity were observed. However, the synergistic efficacy of the flavonoid combination was still less than that of the EA fraction. CONCLUSIONS: The compounds in H. cordata contribute to the superior antiviral efficacy of the EA fraction which lacked cytotoxicity in vitro and acute toxicity in vivo. H. cordata has much potential for the development of antiviral agents against coronavirus and dengue infections.","Chiow, K.H.; Phoon, M.C.; Putti, Thomas; Tan, Benny K.H.; Chow, Vincent T.",Asian Pac J Trop Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1995764515002230; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apjtm.2015.12.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26851778/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1995764515002230,366

This is relevant not only for these patients but also for the general population, because studies of IEIs can unveil key requirements for host defense. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the presentation, manifestations, and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IEI to inform physicians and enhance understanding of host defense against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: An invitation to participate in a retrospective study was distributed globally to scientific, medical, and patient societies involved in the care and advocacy for patients with IEI. RESULTS: We gathered information on 94 patients with IEI with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Their median age was 25 to 34 years. Fifty-three patients (56%) suffered from primary antibody deficiency, 9 (9.6%) had immune dysregulation syndrome, 6 (6.4%) a phagocyte defect, 7 (7.4%) an autoinflammatory disorder, 14 (15%) a combined immunodeficiency, 3 (3%) an innate immune defect, and 2 (2%) bone marrow failure. Ten were asymptomatic, 25 were treated as outpatients, 28 required admission without intensive care or ventilation, 13 required noninvasive ventilation or oxygen administration, 18 were admitted to intensive care units, 12 required invasive ventilation, and 3 required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Nine patients (7 adults and 2 children) died. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that (1) more than 30% of patients with IEI had mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and (2) risk factors predisposing to severe disease/mortality in the general population also seemed to affect patients with IEI, including more younger patients. Further studies will identify pathways that are associated with increased risk of severe disease and are nonredundant or redundant for protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Meyts, Isabelle; Bucciol, Giorgia; Quinti, Isabella; Neven, Bénédicte; Fischer, Alain; Seoane, Elena; Lopez-Granados, Eduardo; Gianelli, Carla; Robles-Marhuenda, Angel; Jeandel, Pierre-Yves; Paillard, Catherine; Sankaran, Vijay G.; Demirdag, Yesim Yilmaz; Lougaris, Vassilios; Aiuti, Alessandro; Plebani, Alessandro; Milito, Cinzia; Dalm, Virgil ASH.; Guevara-Hoyer, Kissy; Sánchez-Ramón, Silvia; Bezrodnik, Liliana; Barzaghi, Federica; Gonzalez-Granado, Luis Ignacio; Hayman, Grant R.; Uzel, Gulbu; Mendonça, Leonardo Oliveira; Agostini, Carlo; Spadaro, Giuseppe; Badolato, Raffaele; Soresina, Annarosa; Vermeulen, François; Bosteels, Cedric; Lambrecht, Bart N.; Keller, Michael; Mustillo, Peter J.; Abraham, Roshini S.; Gupta, Sudhir; Ozen, Ahmet; Karakoc-Aydiner, Elif; Baris, Safa; Freeman, Alexandra F.; Yamazaki-Nakashimada, Marco; Scheffler-Mendoza, Selma; Espinosa-Padilla, Sara; Gennery, Andrew R.; Jolles, Stephen; Espinosa, Yazmin; Poli, M.

Viruses are classically considered to exert their pathologic actions through acute or chronic infection followed by the host response. This host response causes the release of cytokines leading to vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and cardiovascular complications. However, viruses may employ an alternative pathway to soluble cytokine-induced pathologies—by initiating the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. The best-understood example of this alternative pathway is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-elicited EVs and their propensity to harm vascular endothelial cells. Specifically, an HIV-encoded accessory protein called the “negative factor” (Nef) was demonstrated in EVs from the body fluids of HIV patients on successful combined antiretroviral therapy (ART); it was also demonstrated to be sufficient in inducing endothelial and cardiovascular dysfunction. This review will highlight HIV-Nef as an example of how HIV can produce EVs loaded with proinflammatory cargo to disseminate cardiovascular pathologies. It will further discuss whether EV production can explain SARS-CoV-2-mediated pulmonary and cardiovascular pathologies.","Clauss, Matthias; Chelvanambi, Sarvesh; Cook, Christine; ElMergawy, Rabab; Dhillon, Navneet",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207152/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061168,366

The mean (±SD) knowledge score of the participants was 15.33 (± 2.24) and was found to be associated with education level and age groups (p-value = 0.022, P value =0.010) respectively. The mean (±SD) attitude score was 04.15 (± 0.97) and was significantly associated with older groups and better-educated participants (p-value =0.001, p-value = 0.048) respectively. The practices related to COVID-19 preventive measures mean (±SD) was 02.58 (± 1.73) with a significant difference between age groups and area of residence. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the participants had good knowledge and satisfactory attitude that was not similarly expressed into practice. Efforts are needed in health education and law enforcement to improve the practices among all groups with special emphasis on younger and less educated males.

Self-selected urologists worldwide completed an online survey by the Société Internationale d’Urologie (SIU). A total of 2494 urologists from 76 countries responded, including 1161 (46.6%) urologists in an academic setting, 719 (28.8%) in a private practice, and 614 (24.6%) in the public sector. The largest proportion (1074 (43.1%)) were from Europe, with the remainder from East/Southeast Asia (441 (17.7%)), West/Southwest Asia (386 (15.5%)), Africa (209 (8.4%)), South America (198 (7.9%)), and North America (186 (7.5%)). An analysis of differences in responses was carried out by region and practice setting. The results reveal significant restrictions in outpatient consultation and non-emergency surgery, with nonspecific efforts towards additional precautions for preventing the spread of COVID-19 during emergency surgery. These restrictions were less notable in East/Southeast Asia. Urologists often bear the decision-making responsibility regarding access to elective surgery (40.3%). Restriction of both outpatient clinics and non-emergency surgery is considerable worldwide but is lower in East/Southeast Asia. Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 during emergency surgery are common but not specific. The pandemic has had a profound impact on urology practice.

This study aimed at evaluating the relationship between area-level indicators of income and total mortality during the first phase of COVID-19 pandemic in the most hit Italian region. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study based on the number of deaths registered in the municipalities of the Lombardy region (Italy) between January 2019 and June 2020. Municipalities were grouped according to quintiles of average income and pension of their resident population. Monthly age-standardized mortality ratios (MRs) between the poorest and the richest municipalities and the corresponding 95% CI were computed to evaluate whether the pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities widened during the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the study period, 175 853 deaths were registered. During the pre-pandemic period (January 2019 to February 2020) the MR between the poorest and the richest municipalities ranged between 1.12 (95% CI: 1.00–1.25) and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.20–1.47). In March 2020, when the pandemic began to rapidly spread in the region, it raised up to 1.61 (95% CI: 1.51–1.72) and decreased thereafter, reaching the pre-pandemic values in April 2020. Similar results were observed in the analysis of the mortality at ages 65 and over in municipalities grouped according to average pension, where the MR increased up to 1.82 (95% CI: 1.70–1.94) in March 2020.

603230,Economic and psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown: Strategies to combat the crisis,2021-03-15,"Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a major role in the immune response as a soluble pattern-recognition receptor. MBL deficiency and susceptibility to different types of infections have been subject to extensive studies over the last decades. In humans and chickens, several studies have shown that MBL participates in the protection of hosts against virus infections. Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of economic importance in the poultry industry caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). MBL has earlier been described to play a potential role in the pathogenesis of IBV infection and the production of IBV-specific antibodies, which may be exploited in optimising IBV vaccine strategies. The present study shows that MBL has the capability to bind to IBV in vitro. Chickens from two inbred lines (L10H and L10L) selected for high or low MBL serum concentrations, respectively, were vaccinated against IBV with or without the addition of the MBL ligands mannan, chitosan and fructooligosaccharide (FOS). The addition of MBL ligands to the IBV vaccine, especially FOS, enhanced the production of IBV-specific IgG antibody production in L10H chickens, but not L10L chickens after the second vaccination. The addition of FOS to the vaccine also increased the number of circulating CD4+ cells in L10H chickens compared to L10L chickens. The L10H chickens as well as the L10L chickens also showed an increased number of CD4−CD8α−γδ T-cells when an MBL ligand was added to the vaccine, most pronouncedly after the first vaccination. As MBL ligands co-administered with IBV vaccine induced differences between the two chicken lines, these results indirectly suggest that MBL is involved in the immune response to IBV vaccination. Furthermore, the higher antibody response in L10H chickens receiving vaccine and FOS makes FOS a potential adjuvant candidate in an IBV vaccine.","Kjærup, Rikke M.; Dalgaard, Tina S.; Norup, Liselotte R.; Bergman, Ingrid-Maria; Sørensen, Poul; Juul-Madsen, Helle R.",Immunobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24305086/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2013.10.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0171298513001964; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0171298513001964,366

603484,Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on alcohol use disorders and complications,2021-05-19,"The transmission of viruses from animal hosts into humans have led to the emergence of several diseases. Usually these cross-species transmissions are blocked by host restriction factors, which are proteins that can block virus replication at a specific step. In the natural virus host, the restriction factor activity is usually suppressed by a viral antagonist protein, but this is not the case for restriction factors from an unnatural host. However, due to ongoing viral evolution, sometimes the viral antagonist can evolve to suppress restriction factors in a new host, enabling cross-species transmission. Here we examine the classical case of this paradigm by reviewing research on APOBEC3 restriction factors and how they can suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). APOBEC3 enzymes are single-stranded DNA cytidine deaminases that can induce mutagenesis of proviral DNA by catalyzing the conversion of cytidine to promutagenic uridine on single-stranded viral (−)DNA if they escape the HIV/SIV antagonist protein, Vif. APOBEC3 degradation is induced by Vif through the proteasome pathway. SIV has been transmitted between Old World Monkeys and to hominids. Here we examine the adaptations that enabled such events and the ongoing impact of the APOBEC3-Vif interface on HIV in humans.","Gaba, Amit; Flath, Ben; Chelico, Linda",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34200141/,366

BCoV causing enteric and respiratory disease is widespread in cattle farms worldwide; however, limited information is available regarding the molecular characterization of BCoV because of its large genome size, despite its significant economic impact. This study aimed to better understand the genomic characterization and evolutionary dynamics of BCoV via comparative sequence and phylogenetic analyses through whole genome sequence analysis using 67 BCoV isolates collected throughout Japan from 2006 to 2017. On comparing the genomic sequences of the 67 BCoVs, genetic variations were detected in 5 of 10 open reading frames (ORFs) in the BCoV genome. Phylogenetic analysis using whole genomes from the 67 Japanese BCoV isolates in addition to those from 16 reference BCoV strains, revealed the existence of two major genotypes (classical and US wild ruminant genotypes). All Japanese BCoV isolates originated from the US wild ruminant genotype, and they tended to form the same clusters based on the year and farm of collection, not the disease type. Phylogenetic trees on hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), spike glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N) genes and ORF1 revealed clusters similar to that on whole genome, suggesting that the evolution of BCoVs may be closely associated with variations in these genes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of BCoV S genes including those of European and Asian BCoVs and human enteric coronavirus along with the Japanese BCoVs revealed that BCoVs differentiated into two major types (European and American types). Moreover, the European and American types were divided into eleven and three genotypes, respectively. Our analysis also demonstrated that BCoVs with different genotypes periodically emerged and predominantly circulated within the country. These findings provide useful information to elucidate the detailed molecular characterization of BCoVs, which have spread worldwide. Further genomic analyses of BCoV are essential to deepen the understanding of the evolution of this virus.","Suzuki, Tohru; Otake, Yoshihiro; Uchimoto, Satoko; Hasebe, Ayako; Goto, Yusuke",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12020183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041103/,366

Nevertheless, far less is known about the impact on specific populations such as university students, whose psychological vulnerability has been shown in previous research. This study sought to examine different indicators of mental health in university students during the Spanish lockdown; we also analyzed the main sources of stress perceived by students in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, and the coping strategies adopted when faced with the situation. Data was collected from 932 students (704 women) through a web-based platform. Measures of anxiety (i.e., GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), irritability, and self-perceived change in mental health were administered, as well as ad hoc measures of stressors and coping strategies. Results indicated that students experienced considerable psychological problems during the confinement, with higher rates of emotional difficulties in women and undergraduate students than in men and postgraduates, respectively. Psychological distress was mainly related to several specific domains of stressors, as perceived by the participants: academic future, task overload, worsening of interpersonal conflicts, and restrictions in pleasant social contact; and far less related to the spread of the disease and its consequences for physical health. As regards coping strategies, both reframing skills and daily routines were shown to be the most effective. A path-analysis model integrating stressors, coping, and mental health revealed that coping strategies partially mediated the effect of stressors on psychological health. In general, results suggest that students’ psychological health was substantially affected by the COVID-19 situation and that the academic and relational changes were the most notable sources of stress. This study reinforces the need to monitor and promote mental health in university students to boost resilience in times of crisis.

It is assumed that activation of TMEM16A will induce electrolyte secretion, and thus reduce airway mucus plugging and improve mucociliary clearance. A benefit of activation of TMEM16A was shown in vitro and in studies in sheep, but others reported an increase in mucus production and airway contraction by activation of TMEM16A. We analyzed expression of TMEM16A in healthy and inflamed human and mouse airways and examined the consequences of activation or inhibition of TMEM16A in asthmatic mice. TMEM16A was found to be upregulated in the lungs of patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis, as well as in the airways of asthmatic mice. Activation or potentiation of TMEM16A by the compounds Eact or brevenal, respectively, induced acute mucus release from airway goblet cells and induced bronchoconstriction in mice in vivo. In contrast, niclosamide, an inhibitor of TMEM16A, blocked mucus production and mucus secretion in vivo and in vitro. Treatment of airway epithelial cells with niclosamide strongly inhibited expression of the essential transcription factor of Th2-dependent inflammation and goblet cell differentiation, SAM pointed domain-containing ETS-like factor (SPDEF). Activation of TMEM16A in people with inflammatory airway diseases is likely to induce mucus secretion along with airway constriction. In contrast, inhibitors of TMEM16A may suppress pulmonary Th2 inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, mucus production, and bronchoconstriction, partially by inhibiting expression of SPDEF.","Centeio, Raquel; Ousingsawat, Jiraporn; Cabrita, Inês; Schreiber, Rainer; Talbi, Khaoula; Benedetto, Roberta; Doušová, Tereza; Verbeken, Eric K.; De Boeck, Kris; Cohen, Isaac; Kunzelmann, Karl",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22157852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360618/,366

A detailed physical map of this phage genome has been constructed and is being extensively studied at the molecular level. Here, we demonstrate the expression of two late proteins of bacteriophage MB78 derived from the same gene as a result of possible ribosomal frameshifting. In vitro transcription-translation yields a major protein that migrates as 28kDa, whereas in vivo expression using pET expression vectors yields two equally expressed proteins of molecular sizes 28 and 26kDa. A putative slippery sequence TTTAAAG and a pseudoknot structure, two essential cis elements required for the classical ribosomal frameshifting, are identified in the reading frame. Mutations created at the slippery sequence resulted in a single 28kDa protein and completely abolished the expression of 26kDa protein. Thus, we have produced the first evidence that ribosomal frameshifting occurs in bacteriophage MB78 of Salmonella typhimurium.","Kolla, Venkatadri; Chakravorty, Maharani; Pandey, Bindu; Srinivasula, Srinivasa M; Mukherjee, Annapurna; Litwack, Gerald",Gene,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811190000264X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10974552/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811190000264X,366

We present a fast and simple method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and S protein (SP) via time-resolved Foerster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) with donor- and acceptor-labeled polyclonal anti-NP and -SP antibodies. Using recombinant proteins and cell culture-grown SARS-CoV-2 the limits of detection were established as 25 pg of NP or 20 infectious viral units (i.u.), and 875 pg of SP or 625 i.u. of SARS-CoV-2. Testing RT-PCR positive (n=48, with cycle threshold [Ct] values from 11 to 30) or negative (n=96) nasopharyngeal swabs, we showed that the assay yields positive results for all samples with Ct values of <25 and a single RT-PCR negative sample. We determined the presence of infectious virus in the RT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs by virus isolation, and observed a strong association between the presence of infectious virus and a positive antigen test result. The NP-based assay showed 97.4% (37/38) sensitivity and 100% (10/10) specificity in comparison with virus isolation, and 77.1% (37/48) and 99.0% (95/96) in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The assay is performed in a buffer that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and is relatively simple to set up as an ""in-house"" test. The assay principle as such is applicable to other viral infections, and could also be readily adapted to a massively high throughput testing format.","Rusanen, J.; Kareinen, L.; Szirovicza, L.; Ugurlu, H.; Levanov, L.; Jaaskelainen, A.

607602,"Prevalence of COVID-19 Antibodies in Healthcare Workers at the Peak of the Pandemic in Mumbai, India: A Preliminary Study",2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of recommended measures, such as “cover your mouth when coughing”, in disrupting the chain of transmission of infectious respiratory diseases (IRD) has been questioned. The objective of the current study was to determine the effectiveness of simple primary respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette maneuvers in blocking droplets expelled as aerosol during coughing. METHOD: In this study, 31 healthy non-smokers performed cough etiquette maneuvers in an effort to cover their voluntarily elicited best effort coughs in an open bench format. A laser diffraction system was used to obtain accurate, non-invasive, quantitative, real time measurements of the size and number of droplets emitted during the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers. RESULTS: Recommended cough etiquette maneuvers did not block the release and dispersion of a variety of different diameter droplets to the surrounding environment. Droplets smaller than one-micron size dominate the total number of droplets leaked when practicing assessed maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS: All the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers, performed as recommended, do not block droplets expelled as aerosol when coughing. This aerosol can penetrate profound levels of the respiratory system. Practicing these assessed primary respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette maneuvers would still permit direct, indirect, and/or airborne transmission and spread of IRD, such as influenza and Tuberculosis. All the assessed cough etiquette maneuvers, as recommended, do not fully interrupt the chain of transmission of IRD. This knowledge urges us all to critically review recommended CE and to search for new evidence-based procedures that effectively disrupt the transmission of respiratory pathogens. Interrupting the chain of transmission of IRD will optimize the protection of first responders, paramedics, nurses, and doctors working in triage sites, emergency rooms, intensive care units, and the general public against cough-droplet-spread diseases.","Zayas, Gustavo; Chiang, Ming C; Wong, Eric; MacDonald, Fred; Lange, Carlos F; Senthilselvan, Ambikaipakan; King, Malcolm",BMC Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-13-811; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24010919/,366

The Chinese government proposes that both Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine can be used in combination to treat pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV2, and TCM effectively provides continuous prevention and treatment. METHODS: : The present review analyzes and summarizes the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with TCM. A classified analysis of the efficacy and advantages of TCM for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 was performed, and the mechanisms of TCM in treating COVID-19 are summarized. RESULTS: : TCM is effective in preventing COVID-19, and medical staff can prevent an iatrogenic infection by taking a decoction made based on the principles of TCM. As of March 13, 2020, new cases of COVID-19 in China have decreased in number to single digits. TCM's curative effect was outstanding, with a national participation rate of over 90%. More than 70,000 people were cured of COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital. Only approximately 10,000 patients are currently being treated, and the total treatment time is approximately 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: : TCM is currently the best choice for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, and it is expected that it will be promoted by countries around the world.","Zhao, Zhenyu; Li, Yanda; Zhou, Liangyun; Zhou, Xiuteng; Xie, Bowen; Zhang, Wenjin; Sun, Jiahui",Phytomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843234/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0944711320301409; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944711320301409?v=s5,366

It emerged in 2002 and its aetiological agent, the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), crossed the species barrier to infect humans, showing high morbidity and mortality rates. No vaccines are currently licensed for SARS-CoV and important efforts have been performed during the first outbreak to develop diagnostic tools. Here we demonstrate the transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana of two important antigenic determinants of the SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the membrane protein (M) using a virus-derived vector or agro-infiltration, respectively. For the M protein, this is the first description of production in plants, while for plant-derived N protein we demonstrate that it is recognized by sera of patients from the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. The availability of recombinant N and M proteins from plants opens the way to further evaluation of their potential utility for the development of diagnostic and protection/therapy tools to be quickly manufactured, at low cost and with minimal risk, to face potential new highly infectious SARS-CoV outbreaks.","Demurtas, Olivia C.; Massa, Silvia; Illiano, Elena; De Martinis, Domenico; Chan, Paul K.

Hyponatraemia has been frequently described. Conversely, hypernatraemia has rarely been described in COVID-19. METHODS: The studied cohort encompasses all COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the Messina Hospital, Italy, during the first wave of the epidemic. Since healthcare structures were not overwhelmed at that time, indications for hospitalization were homogeneous throughout the study period. Serum sodium levels, kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)], demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded at admission. Correlation between mortality, sodium and eGFR was evaluated by survival curves and univariate and multivariate regression models. RESULTS: Baseline biochemical and clinical data at the time of admission were available for 115 COVID-19-confirmed patients. The median age at admission was 73 years (48% men), with a median Charlson Comorbidity Index of 4. A total of 23.5% of patients presented with a sodium level ≥146 mmol/L, while 7.8% had sodium <135 mmol/L. Hypernatraemic patients were older, with higher comorbidity. Age, hypernatraemia and reduced eGFR were associated with increased mortality in both univariate and multivariate regression models (P < 0.001). The combination of hypernatraemia and reduced renal function at admission had an odds ratio of 47.67 (95% confidence interval 10.08–225.43) of dying compared with patients with an eGFR ≥60 mL/min and sodium <145 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the association between hypernatraemia and reduced eGFR at referral is a highly relevant prognostic marker for death during hospitalization. The role of this association should be further tested in larger, multicentre cohorts.","Longhitano, Elisa; Nardi, Chiara; Calabrese, Vincenzo; Messina, Roberta; Mazzeo, Giuliana; Venanzi Rullo, Emmanuele; Ceccarelli, Manuela; Chatrenet, Antoine; Saulnier, Patrick; Torreggiani, Massimo; Nunnari, Giuseppe; Piccoli, Giorgina Barbara; Santoro, Domenico",Clin Kidney J,https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfab122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603699/,366

During the development of sepsis, neutrophils migrate from the circulating blood to infected tissues and mediate the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that kill pathogens. However, the overactivation of neutrophils can promote the formation of immunothrombosis and even cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which damages microcirculation. The outcome of sepsis depends on early recognition and intervention, so clinical evaluation of NETs function may be a valuable biomarker for early diagnosis of sepsis. The interaction of NETs with platelets, complement, and endothelium mediates the formation of immunothrombosis in sepsis. Inhibiting the formation of NETs is also considered to be one of the potential treatments for sepsis. In this review, we will discuss the key role of neutrophils and NETs in sepsis and septic thrombosis, in order to reveal new mechanisms for thrombosis treatment of sepsis.","Chen, Zhaoyuan; Zhang, Hao; Qu, Mengdi; Nan, Ke; Cao, Hanzhong; Cata, Juan P.; Chen, Wankun; Miao, Changhong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816356/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.653228,366

The most common chronic health condition among LTC residents is dementia, and persons living with dementia (PLWD) rely on FCGs to maintain their care provision. This study aims to evaluate the impact of visitor restrictions and resulting loss of FCGs providing in-person care to PLWD in LTC during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An online survey and follow-up focus groups were conducted June to September 2020 (n=70). Mixed quantitative (descriptive statistics) and qualitative (thematic analysis) methods were used to evaluate study data. RESULTS: FCGs were unable to provide in-person care and while alternative communication methods were offered, they were not always effective. FCGs experienced negative outcomes including social isolation (66%), strain (63%), and reduced quality of life (57%). PLWD showed an increase in responsive behaviours (51%) and dementia progression. Consequently, 85% of FCGs indicated they are willing to undergo specialized training to maintain access to their PLWD. CONCLUSION: FCGs need continuous access to PLWD they care for in LTC to continue providing essential care.","Hindmarch, Whitney; McGhan, Gwen; Flemons, Kristin; McCaughey, Deirdre",Can Geriatr J,https://doi.org/10.5770/cgj.24.508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34484502/,366

612240,Importance of infection control and continence management plans in assisted living communities during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: There has been increasing recognition that certain vulnerable populations in the United States of America struggle to meet their menstruation-related needs, including people experiencing homelessness. Media and policy attention on this subject has focused on the provision of free menstrual products to vulnerable populations, including a New York City legislative bill, which guarantees access to menstrual products for Department of Homeless Services shelter residents (Intros 1123-A). METHODS: This qualitative study explored the challenges people experiencing homelessness in New York City face in accessing menstrual products. Data collection was conducted from June to August 2019 and included: Semi-structured key informant interviews with staff from relevant government agencies and homeless service providers (n = 15), and semi-structured in-depth interviews with individuals with experience living on the street and in shelters (n = 22). Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Key themes that emerged included: (1) insufficient and inconsistent access to menstrual products; (2) systemic challenges to providing menstrual products; and (3) creative solutions to promote access to menstrual products. Both shelter- and street-living individuals reported significant barriers to accessing menstrual products. While both populations struggle, those in shelters were more likely to be able to purchase menstrual products or access free products at their shelter, while those living on the streets were more likely to have to resort to panhandling, theft, or using makeshift materials in place of menstrual products. Across both populations, individuals described barriers to accessing free products at shelters and service providers, primarily due to distribution systems that rely on gatekeepers to provide a few pads or tampons at a time, sometimes of inadequate quality and only upon request. Shelters and service providers also described challenges providing these products, including inconsistent supply. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the critical importance of expanding and improving initiatives seeking to provide access to menstrual products for vulnerable populations. Despite policy level efforts to support menstrual product access, individuals experiencing homelessness in New York City, whether living in shelters or on the street, are often not able to access the menstrual products that they need to manage their monthly menstrual flow.","Gruer, Caitlin; Hopper, Kim; Smith, Rachel Clark; Kelly, Erin; Maroko, Andrew; Sommer, Marni",Reprod Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01133-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849575/,366

En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons: suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode. Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats. L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion. Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Abstract Objective. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10 000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods. This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results. The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection’s spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ wellbeing) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside, could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion. The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.","Fovet, Thomas; Lancelevee, Camille; Eck, Marion; Scouflaire, Tatiana; Becache, Eve; Dandelot, Dominique; Giravalli, Pascale; Guillard, Alexandre; Horrach, Pierre; Lacambre, Mathieu; Lefebvre, Tiphaine; Moncany, Anne-Hélène; Touitou, David; David, Michel; Thomas, Pierre",Encephale,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475693/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300877?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,366

614197,Dental Care during COVID-19 Outbreak: A Web-Based Survey,2020-09-03,"Background. COVID-19 infection has led to an overwhelming effort by health institutions to meet the high demand for hospital admissions. Aim. To analyse the clinical variables associated with readmission of patients who had previously been discharged after admission for COVID-19. Design and methods. We studied a retrospective cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted and subsequently discharged alive. We then conducted a nested case-control study paired (1:1 ratio) by age, sex and period of admission. Results. Out of 1368 patients who were discharged during the study period, 61 patients (4.4%) were readmitted. Immunocompromised patients were at increased risk for readmission. There was also a trend towards a higher probability of readmission in hypertensive patients (p=0.07). Cases had had a shorter hospital stay and a higher prevalence of fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge. There were no significant differences in oxygen levels measured at admission and discharge by pulse oximetry intra-subject or between the groups. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio at hospital admission tended to be higher in cases than in controls (p=0.06). The motive for readmission in 10 patients (16.4%), was a thrombotic event in venous or arterial territory (p<0.001). Neither glucocorticoids nor anticoagulants prescribed at hospital discharge were associated with a lower readmission rate. Conclusions. The rate of readmission after discharge from hospital for COVID-19 was low. Immunocompromised patients and those presenting with fever during the 48 hours prior to discharge are at greater risk of readmission to hospital.","Parra, Lina Marcela; Cantero, MIreia; Morras, Ignacio; Vallejo, Alberto; Diego, Itziar; Jimenez-Tejero, Elena; Munez, Elena; Asensio, Angel; Fernandez-Cruz, Ana; Ramos-Martinez, Antonio",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118455; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.31.20118455v1?rss=1,366

The present research aimed to determine the burnout levels of social workers in Spain during the first wave of the pandemic and the predictive variables. The methodological approach used was developed from a quantitative perspective through a simple random sampling from the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) on a sample of Spanish social workers. The results showed high levels of emotional exhaustion (70.1%) and depersonalization (48.5%), although the data related to a reduced sense of personal accomplishment (36.6%) was low. The burnout level was 20.4%, a reduced record considering the values of the first two subscales. In contrast, the logistic regressions carried out showed that teleworking and psychological treatment are predictive variables of emotional exhaustion. With depersonalization, age (41–50 years) and the perception of needing psychological or psychiatric treatment in the future act as predictive variables. In critical scenarios such as a pandemic, work organizations should implement measures to reduce the high percentages of emotional exhaustion, the workload, and the dehumanization of professionals, a consequence linked to depersonalization.","Martínez-López, José Ángel; Lázaro-Pérez, Cristina; Gómez-Galán, José",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069394/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18105416,366

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is not only limited to local pneumonia but also represents multiple organ involvement, with potential for systemic complications. One year after the pandemic, pathophysiological knowledge has evolved, and many therapeutic advances have occurred, but mortality rates are still elevated in severe/critical COVID-19 cases. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can exert immunomodulatory, antiviral, and pro-regenerative paracrine/endocrine actions and are therefore promising candidates for MSC-based therapies. In this review, we discuss the rationale for MSC-based therapies based on currently available preclinical and clinical evidence of safety, potential efficacy, and mechanisms of action. Finally, we present a critical analysis of the risks, limitations, challenges, and opportunities that place MSC-based products as a therapeutic strategy that may complement the current arsenal against COVID-19 and reduce the pandemic’s unmet medical needs.","da Silva, Kátia Nunes; Gobatto, André Luiz Nunes; Costa-Ferro, Zaquer Suzana Munhoz; Cavalcante, Bruno Raphael Ribeiro; Caria, Alex Cleber Improta; de Aragão França, Luciana Souza; Nonaka, Carolina Kymie Vasques; de Macêdo Lima, Fernanda; Lopes-Pacheco, Miquéias; Rocco, Patricia Rieken Macêdo; de Freitas Souza, Bruno Solano",Stem Cell Res Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315546/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-021-02502-7,366

The proposed model incorporates both asymptomatic infectious and hospitalized infectious subpopulations to the standard infectious subpopulation of the classical SEIR model. In parallel, it also incorporates feedback vaccination and antiviral treatment controls. The exposed subpopulation has three different transitions to the three kinds of infectious subpopulations under eventually different proportionality parameters. The existence of a unique disease-free equilibrium point and a unique endemic one is proved together with the calculation of their explicit components. Their local asymptotic stability properties and the attainability of the endemic equilibrium point are investigated based on the next generation matrix properties, the value of the basic reproduction number, and nonnegativity properties of the solution and its equilibrium states. The reproduction numbers in the presence of one or both controls is linked to the control-free reproduction number to emphasize that such a number decreases with the control gains. We also prove that, depending on the value of the basic reproduction number, only one of them is a global asymptotic attractor and that the solution has no limit cycles.","De la Sen, M.; Ibeas, A.",Adv Differ Equ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33552151/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13662-021-03248-5,366

In the present study, we analyzed the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein, including the cleavage site, of both respiratory (n=5) and enteric (n=3) BoCV isolates including two paired isolates from the same feedlot animals and compared them with the prototype Mebus and two enteric and one respiratory BoCV strains from Quebec. A total of 75 polymorphic nucleotides were identified in the S1 subunit of the spike glycoprotein of BoCV isolates compared with the Mebus strain. These polymorphisms led to 42 amino acid changes at 38 distinct sites. The amino acid changes were distributed throughout the S1 subunit with clustering around residues 40–118, 146–179, and 458–531. Among these variations, only 19 amino acid substitutions altered the charge, hydrophobicity and surface probability of the protein. Based on phylogenetic analysis, our respiratory and enteric isolates clustered into two major groups with two subgroups. Although, there were only a few amino acid changes between the respiratory and enteric paired isolates, the other two respiratory isolates, one isolated from the same farm as a paired strain and the other from a different farm, showed more sequence diversity. Amino acid alterations in residues 113, 115, 118, 146, 148, 501, 510 and 531 of respiratory isolates conferred significant changes in the predicted secondary structure compared with the prototype winter dysentery (WD) and the calf diarrhea (CD) strains of BoCV. In conclusion, the data suggests that respiratory strains of BoCV may differ genetically from the classical calf enteric and adult WD strains.","Hasoksuz, Mustafa; Sreevatsan, Srinand; Cho, Kyoung-Oh; Hoet, Armando E; Saif, Linda J",Virus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170202000047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11900843/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170202000047,366

The patient survived following treatment with awake veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). CASE SUMMARY: A 53-year-old male patient attended our hospital following a cough for 11 d and fever for 9 d. According to his computed tomography (CT) scan and real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay of a throat swab, nucleic acid was positive, confirming that he had COVID-19. He was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit due to respiratory failure. The patient received antiviral drugs, a small dose of glucocorticoid, and respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation, but the treatment effect was poor. On the 28(th )day after admission, veno-venous ECMO and prone position ventilation (PPV) were performed, combined with awake ECMO and other comprehensive rehabilitation measures. On the 17(th )day of ECMO, the patient started to improve and his chest CT and lung compliance improved. ECMO was discontinued after 27 days, and mechanical ventilation was also discontinued after 9 days. The patient was then transferred to the rehabilitation department. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can damage lung tissues and cause evident inflammatory exudation, thus affecting oxygenation function. Awake ECMO, PPV, and comprehensive rehabilitation are effective in patients with critical COVID-19 and respiratory failure.","Zhang, Jing-Chen; Li, Tong",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368315/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i21.5963,366

We aimed to investigate the influence of the Dutch lockdown on cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) and investigate relations with change in mental wellbeing and experienced psychosocial stressors during the lockdown. DESIGN: Explorative longitudinal baseline-, pre- and during lockdown survey study. SETTING: The Netherlands, on-line between January 2019 and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Community sample of 120 monthly to daily cannabis users and reference group of 63 non-using controls. MEASUREMENTS: Change in cannabis use and CUD symptom severity from baseline to pre- to post-lockdown. Change in cannabis use motives, mental health, quality of social relationships and job status from pre- to post-lockdown. FINDINGS: In cannabis users, lockdown related to increased cannabis use [B = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.26-3.66, P = 0.024], but not CUD symptom severity. Cannabis users experienced 30% job loss and increased loneliness [P < 0.001, Bayes factor (BF)10 > 100], while contact with partners (P = 0.005, BF10 = 8.21) and families improved (P < 0.001, BF10 = 19.73), with no differences between cannabis users and control. Generally, mental health problems (all Ps > 0.277, all BF10 < 0.139) did not change, but individual differences were significant and severity of cannabis use pre-lockdown, COVID-19-related worries, change in anxiety, expansion motives, social motives and family contact all uniquely related to variance in change in cannabis use or CUD. CONCLUSIONS: While cannabis use among daily cannabis users in the Netherlands increased at the group level during the period of COVID-19 lockdown, the effect of the first months of lockdown on cannabis use disorder severity and mental wellbeing varied significantly among individual daily cannabis users.","Cousijn, Janna; Kuhns, Lauren; Larsen, Helle; Kroon, Emese",Addiction,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394560/; https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15387,366
618551,Experiences of Women Who Gave Birth in US Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-01-12,"Background The association between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, established CV disease (CVD), and susceptibility to CV complications or mortality in COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods We conducted a cohort study of consecutive adults hospitalised for severe COVID-19 between 1st March and 30th June 2020. Pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors and associations with mortality and CV complications were ascertained. Findings Among 1,721 patients (median age 71 years, 57% male), 349 (20.3%) had pre-existing CVD (CVD), 888 (51.6%) had CV risk factors without CVD (RF-CVD), 484 (28.1%) had neither. Patients with CVD were older with a higher burden of non-CV comorbidities. During follow-up, 438 (25.5%) patients died: 37% with CVD, 25.7% with RF-CVD and 16.5% with neither. CVD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients <70 years of age (adjusted HR 2.43 [95%CI 1.16-5.07]), but not in those [≥]70 years (aHR 1.14 [95%CI 0.77-1.69]). RF-CVD were not independently associated with mortality in either age group (<70y aHR 1.21 [95%CI 0.72-2.01], [≥]70y aHR 1.07 [95%CI 0.76-1.52]). Most CV complications occurred in patients with CVD (66%) versus RF-CVD (17%) or neither (11%; p<0.001). 213 [12.4%] patients developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). CVD was not an independent predictor of VTE. Interpretation In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, pre-existing established CVD appears to be a more important contributor to mortality than CV risk factors in the absence of CVD. CVD-related hazard may be mediated, in part, by new CV complications. Optimal care and vigilance for destabilised CVD are essential in this patient group.","O Gallagher, K.; Shek, A.; Bean, D.

OBJECTIVE: The Pediatric Infection-Point-of-Care (PI-POC) trial is investigating novel methods to improve and strengthen the differential diagnostics of suspected childhood CNS infections in low-income health systems such as those in Southwestern Uganda. This will be achieved by evaluating (1) a novel DNA-based diagnostic assay for CNS infections, (2) a commercially available multiplex PCR-based meningitis/encephalitis (ME) panel for clinical use in a facility-limited laboratory setting, (3) proteomics profiling of blood from children with severe CNS infection as compared to outpatient controls with fever yet not severely ill, and (4) Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) as a biomarker in blood for viral CNS infection. Further changes in the etiology of childhood CNS infections after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae will be investigated. In addition, the carriage and invasive rate of Neisseria meningitidis will be recorded and serotyped, and the expression of its major virulence factor (polysaccharide capsule) will be investigated. METHODS: The PI-POC trial is a prospective observational study of children including newborns up to 12 years of age with clinical features of CNS infection, and age-/sex-matched outpatient controls with fever yet not severely ill. Participants are recruited at 2 Pediatric clinics in Mbarara, Uganda. Cerebrospinal fluid (for cases only), blood, and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs (for both cases and controls) sampled at both clinics are analyzed at the Epicentre Research Laboratory through gold-standard methods for CNS infection diagnosis (microscopy, biochemistry, and culture) and a commercially available ME panel for multiplex PCR analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid. An additional blood sample from cases is collected on day 3 after admission. After initial clinical analyses in Mbarara, samples will be transported to Stockholm, Sweden for (1) validation analyses of a novel nucleic acid–based POC test, (2) biomarker research, and (3) serotyping and molecular characterization of S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis. RESULTS: A pilot study was performed from January to April 2019. The PI-POC trial enrollment of patients begun in April 2019 and will continue until September 2020, to include up to 300 cases and controls. Preliminary results from the PI-POC study are expected by the end of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the PI-POC study can potentially facilitate rapid etiological diagnosis of CNS infections in low-resource settings and allow for novel methods for determination of the severity of CNS infection in such environment.

This study aims to determine the infection containment proportions and cost of two variations of quarantine policies based on geographic travel and close contact with infected individuals within deployed US military populations. Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAF) records of individuals quarantined between March 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020 were examined. The infection containment proportion and cost in containment hours were compared between types of quarantine and between geographic areas. Geographic quarantine contained 2 cases out of 63 quarantined individuals in West Africa (3.2%) compared to 0 out of 221 in East Africa (p = 0.0486). Close contact quarantine contained 3 cases out of 31 quarantined individuals in West Africa compared to 4 out of 55 in East Africa (7.3%, p = 0.6989). Total confinement was 42,048 h for each contained infection using geographic quarantine compared to 4076 h using close contact quarantine. In the US military population deployed to Africa for COVID-19, quarantining based on geographic movement is an order of magnitude more costly in terms of time for each contained infection then quarantining based on close contact with infected individuals. There is not a statistical difference between East and West Africa. The associated costs of quarantine must be carefully weighed against the risk of disease spread.","Hall, Andrew; Qureshi, Iram; Glaser, Jacob; Auchincloss, Paul; Wilson, Ramey",Prev Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321121/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743520304023; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106371; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743520304023,366

Three temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For [Formula: see text] , we get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for smaller step sizes [Formula: see text] , while for large [Formula: see text] the growth is found to be exponential. We further performed a comparative case study of early fatality data (under varying levels of lockdown conditions) from three other countries, India, Brazil and South Africa. We show that reasonable agreement with these data can be obtained by incorporating small-world-like connections in our simulations.","Triambak, S.; Mahapatra, D.P.",Physica A,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437121002867; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2021.126014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437121002867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875903/,366
622691,P.76 Introduction of an obstetric simulation programme to meet training needs during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. CONCLUSION: Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.","Yin, Xiaowen; Sun, Yuyong; Zhu, Chunyan; Zhu, Beiying; Gou, Dongfang; Tan, Zhonglin",J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.112; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016503272032557X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32871694/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503272032557X?v=s5,366

SARS-CoV-2, for example, invades the host cells by ACE2 interaction and possibly hijacks the mitochondria. To better understand the disease and to propose novel treatments, crucial aspects of SARS-CoV-2 enrolment with host mitochondria must be studied. The replicative process of the virus leads to consequences in mitochondrial function, and cell metabolism. The hijacking of mitochondria, on the other hand, can drive the extrusion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol. Extracellular mtDNA evoke robust proinflammatory responses once detected, that may act in different pathways, eliciting important immune responses. However, few receptors are validated and are able to detect and respond to mtDNA. In this review, we propose that the mtDNA and its detection might be important in the immune process generated by SARS-CoV-2 and that this mechanism might be important in the lung pathogenesis seen in clinical symptoms. Therefore, investigating the mtDNA receptors and their signaling pathways might provide important clues for therapeutic interventions.","Targhetta, Vitor Pedro; Amaral, Mariana Abrantes; Camara, Niels Olsen Saraiva",The journal of venomous animals and toxins including tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-9199-jvatitd-2020-0183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471404/,366

Such beliefs will be governed by norms besides just the traditional norms of epistemology (e.g., truth and rational support). As agents become better at detecting the agency of others, either through evolutionary history or individual learning, the candidate pool for signaling expands. This logic holds for natural and artificial agents that find themselves in recurring social situations that reward the sharing of one’s thoughts.","Funkhouser, Eric",Synthese,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03412-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34565916/,366

The subjects of this cross-sectional study were people interested in the Osekkai conference (control group) and those actively involved in Osekkai activities (exposure group). The primary outcome of social participation was measured as the frequency of meeting and the number of friends or acquaintances. The demographic data of the participants and process outcomes were measured using a questionnaire provided to all 287 registered participants. The effective response rate was 64.5% (185 responses). The involvement in Osekkai conferences was statistically associated with a high frequency and number of meetings with friends or acquaintances (p < 0.001 and 0.048, respectively). A health check was significantly associated with the number of friends or acquaintances met in the previous month, while high social support was significantly associated with loneliness. Thus, we confirm that Osekkai contributes to high social participation, although we see no relationship with loneliness. Future studies should investigate this cause-and-effect relationship and promote culturally sensitive activities to improve social and health outcomes in rural Japan.","Ohta, Ryuichi; Yata, Akiko; Arakawa, Yuki; Maiguma, Koichi; Sano, Chiaki",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115924; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072993/,366
625074,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric patients with epilepsy in Jordan: The caregiver perspective,2021-08-28,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is one of the newest emerging diseases in Nepal with increasing burden and geographic spread over the years. The main objective of this study was to explore the epidemiological patterns of dengue since its first outbreak (2006) to 2019 in Nepal. METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis that covers the last 14 years (2006–2019) of reported dengue cases from Epidemiology Diseases Control Division (EDCD), Ministry of Health and Population, Government of Nepal. Reported cases were plotted over time and maps of reported case incidence were generated (from 2016 through 2019). An ecological analysis of environmental predictors of case incidence was conducted using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: While endemic dengue has been reported in Nepal since 2006, the case load has increased over time and in 2019 a total of 17 992 dengue cases were reported from 68 districts (from all seven provinces). Compared to the case incidence in 2016, incidence was approximately five times higher in 2018 [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 4.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5–15.3] and over 140 times higher in 2019 (IRR: 141.6; 95% CI 45.8–438.4). A one standard deviation increase in elevation was associated with a 90% decrease in reported case incidence (IRR: 0.10; 95% CI 0.01–0.20). However, the association between elevation and reported cases varied across the years. In 2018 there was a cluster of cases reported from high elevation Kaski District of Gandaki Province. Our results suggest that dengue infections are increasing in magnitude and expanding out of the lowland areas to higher elevations over time. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high risk of dengue outbreak in the lowland Terai region, with increasing spread towards the mid-mountains and beyond as seen over the last 14 years. Urgent measures are required to increase the availability of diagnostics and resources to mitigate future dengue epidemics.

The fear of coronavirus-19 scale (FCV-19S) has emerged as a popular measure of coronavirus-19-related fear. However, its psychometric properties remain unknown in South Africa. RESEARCH PURPOSE: This study set out to investigate the internal validity of the FCV-19S in the South African context using the Rasch measurement model. MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY: There have been some mixed findings on the psychometric properties of the FCV-19S in international research and its psychometric properties are yet to be investigated in South Africa. Investigating these psychometric properties can provide psychometric information to practitioners who wish to use this instrument in the South African context. RESEARCH APPROACH/DESIGN AND METHOD: A cross-sectional survey research design was used. The FCV-19S was administered to 159 adults. The Rasch partial credit model was applied to the item responses to investigate the measurement quality of the FCV-19S. MAIN FINDINGS: The FCV-19S showed somewhat satisfactory internal validity in the South African context within the boundaries of the current sample, and clarity was obtained on the mixed findings obtained in the previous research. Potential shortcomings of the scale were identified that might reduce its applicability to the South African context. PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: Our results provide tentative support for the internal validity of the FCV-19S in South Africa. Suggestions for the improvement of the scale are made. CONTRIBUTION/VALUE-ADD: This is one of the first studies to investigate the internal validity of the FCV-19S in South Africa. Our results hold important implications for the continued use of this scale and have helped to clarify some of the mixed findings obtained in previous research.","Peral, Sergio L.; Morgan, Brandon; Redelinghuys, Kleinjan",SA Journal of Industrial Psychology,https://doi.org/10.4102/sajip.v47i0.1861,366

All sequences were publicly available on the National Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI) platform and were previously aligned with the MEGA X software, where all gaps and ambiguous sites were extracted for the construction of the phylogenetic tree. Of the 301 sites analyzed, 68% varied, 131 of which were parsimonium-informative sites. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the presence of two distinct subgroups, corroborated by the high FST (80%). The high degree of polymorphism found among these samples helped to establish a clear pattern of non-genetic structuring, based on the time of divergence between the groups. All molecular variance estimators confirmed that there was no consensus in the conservation of the studied sequences, also indicating a high variation for the protein products of the virus.

With the accumulation of clinical diagnostic data, the imaging big data features of COVID-19 are gradually clear, and CT imaging diagnosis results become more important. To obtain clear lesion information from the CT images of patients' lungs is helpful for doctors to adopt effective medical methods, and at the same time, is helpful to screen the patients with real infection. Deep learning image segmentation is widely used in the field of medical image segmentation. However, there are some challenges in using deep learning to segment the lung lesions of COVID-19 patients. Since image segmentation requires the labeling of lesion information on a pixel by pixel basis, most professional radiologists need to screen and diagnose patients on the front line, and they do not have enough energy to label a large amount of image data. In this paper, an improved Dense GAN to expand data set is developed, and a multi-layer attention mechanism method, combined with U-Net's COVID-19 pulmonary CT image segmentation, is proposed. The experimental results showed that the segmentation method proposed in this paper improved the segmentation accuracy of COVID-19 pulmonary medical CT image by comparing with other image segmentation methods.","Zhang, Ju; Yu, Lundun; Chen, Decheng; Pan, Weidong; Shi, Chao; Niu, Yan; Yao, Xinwei; Xu, Xiaobin; Cheng, Yun",Biomed Signal Process Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178095/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809421004985?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1746809421004985,366

During December 2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology, which caused severe-acute respiratory distress. The disease was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Due to alarming levels of spread and severity, on the 11(th) of March 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak as a global pandemic. As of September 14 2020, more than 29 million cases have been reported, with over 900,000 deaths globally. Since the outbreak, although not conclusive, discoveries have been made regarding the understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, clinical treatment, and prevention of the disease. SARS-COV-2 has been detected in saliva, respiratory fluids, blood, urine, and faeces. Findings are however controversial regarding its presence in the semen or the testis.

625701,An innovation in Flipped Class Room: A teaching model to facilitate synchronous and asynchronous learning during a pandemic,2021,"The significance of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) for Europe is increasing. The diplomatic initiative “16 + 1,” comprising China and 16 Central, East and Southeast European economies (CESEE), expanded to a “17 + 1” format in April 2019, when Greece officially joined the cooperation forum. This expansion revived interest in Chinese activities aimed at better physical and digital connectivity in Europe and their effects. The article descriptively shows a geographical division of Chinese infrastructure development activities in Europe: the “17 + 1” region is targeted more intensively by Chinese construction projects. Moreover, roughly 90% of all construction contracts with the “17 + 1” region are attributable to connectivity sectors, while Chinese activities in other European regions are more diversified. In Europe, the Western Balkans are expected to economically benefit the most from the BRI, as they show particularly high deficiencies in infrastructure, and so far, have limited access to EU grants. Economic effects of infrastructure projects, however, trickle through European production and supply chains, affecting a larger number of countries than information on projects would suggest. EU initiatives presented since 2018 may help to increase complementarity between Chinese and European infrastructure development plans and reduce associated risks, such as unsustainable debt or new trade barriers arising from increased competition for Chinese investments. The BRI is about to change physical and digital connectivity within Europe, while the EU has yet to become an active player engaging in the initiative, in order to enable improved connectivity in Europe to drive economic convergence and not political divergence.","Gruebler, Julia",Asia Eur J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10308-021-00616-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248452/,366

We developed an ordinary differential equation-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with Bayesian underpinning to estimate the main parameter of R(0) determined by transmission coefficients, incubation period, and the recovery rate. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method was used to tackle the parameters of uncertainty resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 given a small cohort of the cruise ship. The extended stratified SEIR model was also proposed to elucidate the heterogeneity of transmission route by the level of deck with passengers and crews. With the application of the overall model, R(0) was estimated as high as 5.70 (95% credible interval: 4.23–7.79). The entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 63% (95% credible interval: 60–66%) infected passengers. With the deck-specific SEIR model, the heterogeneity of R(0) estimates by each deck was noted. The estimated R(0) figures were 5.18 for passengers (5–14 deck), mainly from the within-deck transmission, and 2.46 for crews (2–4 deck), mainly from the between-deck transmission. Modelling the dynamic of COVID-19 on the cruise ship not only provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine but also elucidates the relative contributions of different transmission modes on the cruise ship though the deck-stratified SEIR model.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the incidence and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP and to compare them with those of severe IFV associated CAP. STUDY DESIGN: From March 2010 to August 2017, all consecutive adult patients with severe HMPV-associated CAP and severe influenza virus (IFV)-associated CAP who required intensive care unit admission were prospectively identified and followed in a 2,700-bed tertiary care hospital. The characteristics and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP patients were compared with those of severe IFV-associated CAP patients. RESULTS: HMPV and IFV were identified in 3.2% (50) and 7.0% (109) of the 1559 patients with severe CAP, respectively. The mortality rates were not significantly different between the HMPV and IFV groups (30-day mortality: 24.0% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.30; 60-day mortality: 32.0% vs. 38.5%, p = 0.43). Oral ribavirin therapy was not associated with improved outcome (60-day mortality: ribavirin therapy group 35.0% [7/20] vs. no ribavirin therapy group 30.0% [9/30], p = 0.71). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in mortality among non-immunocompromised (60-day mortality: HMPV 25.6% vs. IFV 31.1%, p = 0.55) and immunocompromised patients (60-day mortality; HMPV 54.5% vs. 54.3%, p = 0.99).

Barratt Impulse Scale and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale were used to obtain information about patients' self-reported impulsivity and NA. Results: Univariate linear regression analysis showed that NA was positively correlated with the frequency of drug use, type of SUDs, cravings during COVID-19, and impulsivity. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that being female, higher frequency of drug use, stronger cravings, and greater impulsiveness jointly accounted for the variation of NA in elderly patients with SUDs. Conclusions: This study confirmed that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, gender, frequency of drug use, cravings, and impulsivity were associated with NA in elderly patients with SUDs. This study provided a theoretical basis for clinicians to reduce the patients' NA.","Wang, Qianjin; Wang, Yingying; Zuo, Jinsong; Zhou, Yanan; Yang, Winson Fu Zun; Liao, Yanhui; Tang, Jinsong; Wang, Xin; Yang, Qian; Wu, Qiuxia; Wu, Hanjing Emily; Goodman, Colin B; Liu, Tieqiao; Zhang, Xiangyang",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.697472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34354617/,366
629429,Hospital Consultation-Liaison Telepsychiatry-Two Trends and Two New Reports,2021,"This chapter presents a general overview of the anatomy, physiology, and treatment methodology for crocodilians. Most crocodilians grow to be larger than other reptile species and, therefore, have significant space requirements. Like most animals requiring an aquatic environment, crocodilians need water that is clean and free of disease. Crocodilians have a true hard palate in the roof of the mouth that ends caudally in a soft palate. This soft palate has a ventral flap which is referred to as the velum palati. The respiratory system of crocodilians consists of well-developed lungs benefiting from a very effective inspiration aided by the intercostal muscles and the septum post hepaticum. Crocodilians have a four-chambered heart as opposed to the three-chambered heart found in other reptiles and amphibians. The temperature and humidity requirements for crocodilians in captivity vary with the species. An understanding of crocodilian biology and natural history is needed to try and duplicate their natural environment. An important consideration is the allowance of circadian variations in light cycle and temperatures to mimic their natural environment. This is not the case in many commercial operations, where they are maintained at a fairly constant temperature and humidity to achieve faster growth.","Nevarez, Javier",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500093; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500093,366
629522,Best Practice Guidelines for the Management of Acute Craniomaxillofacial Trauma During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-11,"The measures adopted by governments around the world to control the spread of the COVID‐19 virus (e.g., social distancing) have propelled a rapid transition from face‐to‐face to online therapy. Studies on online individual therapy indicate that therapists often have favorable attitudes toward this modality. To date, there is scant work on couples therapists’ attitudes, despite the fact that the provision of online couples’ therapy poses unique challenges (e.g., dealing with escalating conflict remotely). To provide a snapshot, in real time, as to how therapists experience the transition to online therapy, we surveyed 166 Israeli couples’ therapists during April 2020, when lockdown orders prevented therapists from seeing couples face‐to‐face. A few weeks later, when the stay‐at‐home policy was lifted, a subsample (N = 60) of these therapists completed a follow‐up assessment. The results suggest that couples therapists had limited experience using the online modality prior to COVID. The therapists reported experiencing online couples’ therapy as somewhat successful and that their experience of providing therapy during the COVID‐19 crisis had an overall positive impact on their attitudes toward online work. Establishing a strong therapeutic bond with both partners, dealing with escalating conflict, and treatment dropout were identified as the issues of most concern when conducting online couples therapy. The perceived difficulties with online therapy prospectively predicted lower usage of online couples’ therapy, as well as less intention to continue online treatment once the crisis is over.","Machluf, Reut; Abba Daleski, Michal; Shahar, Ben; Kula, Ofra; Bar‐Kalifa, Eran",Fam Process,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861867/; https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12647,366
630076,Emergency psychiatric service seeker referral pattern variations over the course of a pandemic,2020-11-10,"Three mechanisms have been proposed to account for COVID-19 associated olfactory dysfunction; obstruction of the olfactory cleft; epithelial injury and infection of the sustentacular supporting cells, which are known to express ACE2, or injury to the olfactory bulb due to axonal transport through olfactory sensory neurones. The absence of ACE2 expression by olfactory sensory neurones has led to the neurotropic potential of COVID-19 to be discounted. While an accumulating body of evidence supports olfactory epithelial injury as an important mechanism, this does not account for all the features of olfactory dysfunction seen in COVID-19; for example the duration of loss in some patients, evidence of changes within the olfactory bulb on MRI imaging, identification of viral particles within the olfactory bulb in post-mortem specimens and the inverse association between severity of COVID-19 and the prevalence of olfactory loss. The recent identification of a second route of viral entry mediated by NRP1 addresses many of these inconsistencies. Expression by the olfactory sensory neurones and their progenitor cells may facilitate direct injury and axonal transport to the olfactory bulb as well as a mechanism for delayed or absent recovery. Expression by regulatory T cells may play a central role in the cytokine storm. Variability in expression by age, race or gender may explain differing morbidity of infection and inverse association between anosmia and severity; in the case of higher expression there may be a higher risk of olfactory function but greater activation of regulatory T cells that may suppress the cytokine storm.","Hopkins, Claire; Lechien, Jerome R.; Saussez, Sven",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33246692/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720332977?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110406; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720332977,366

630806,Changes in the Care of Neurological Diseases During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single Private Center Study in Argentina,2021-09-03,"[Image: see text] In this paper, the nature of the lowest-energy electrons is detailed. The orbital occupied by such electrons can be termed the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LOMO). There is a good correspondence between the Hückel method in chemistry and graph theory in mathematics; the molecular orbital, which chemists view as the distribution of an electron with a specific energy, is to mathematicians an algebraic entity, an eigenvector. The mathematical counterpart of LOMO is known as eigenvector centrality, a centrality measure characterizing nodes in networks. It may be instrumental in solving some problems in chemistry, and also it has implications for the challenge facing humanity today. This paper starts with a demonstration of the transmission of infectious disease in social networks, although it is unusual for a chemistry paper but may be a suitable example for understanding what the centrality (LOMO) is all about. The converged distribution of infected patients on the network coincides with the distribution of the LOMO of a molecule that shares the same network structure or topology. This is because the mathematical structures behind graph theory and quantum mechanics are common. Furthermore, the LOMO coefficient can be regarded as a manifestation of the centrality of atoms in an atomic assembly, indicating which atom plays the most important role in the assembly or which one has the greatest influence on the network of these atoms. Therefore, it is proposed that one can predict the binding energy of a metal atom to its cluster based on its LOMO coefficient. A possible improvement of the descriptor using a more sophisticated centrality measure is also discussed.","Tsuji, Yuta; Yoshizawa, Kazunari",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490793/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.0c04913,366
630872,“It’s like ‘liquid handcuffs”: The effects of take-home dosing policies on Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) patients’ lives,2021-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Integrated prevention at work promises to eliminate the boundaries between primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention actions taken by stakeholders in the world of work. It is receiving increasing attention from the scientific community because of its concerted and harmonized approach, which promotes employment access, return, and healthy long-term continuation. Although promising, integrated prevention is not yet well-defined, which makes it difficult to operationalize. OBJECTIVE: This manuscript exposes the protocol of a study aiming to conceptualize integrated prevention at work on the basis of scientific and experiential knowledge. METHODS: Using a concept analysis research design, data collection has been planned in 2 parts. A meta-narrative literature review will first be conducted to document how integrated prevention has been defined in the literature. Then, phone interviews will be conducted with key informers (ie, managers, workers, ergonomists, occupational therapists, psychologists, physiotherapists, union and insurance representatives) to document their viewpoints and understanding of integrated prevention at work. Qualitative data gathered during these 2 parts of research will be analyzed using template analysis, which allows data from literature and empirical collection to be analyzed simultaneously. The analysis will bring out the points of convergence, divergence, and complementarity between the information gleaned from literature and key informers’ experiences to arrive at a conceptualization of integrated prevention at work by identifying its uses, attributes, antecedents, and consequences. As a final step, validation and interpretation with a TRIAGE (Technique for Research of Information by Animation of a Group of Experts) group will be carried out in collaboration with the key informers to identify the tools for the implementation of integrated prevention at work and promote workers’ health and safety. RESULTS: This study is expected to offer a contemporary conceptualization of integrated prevention at work that clearly lays out the variables of this concept and elicits the viewpoints of the different stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: This study will contribute to the advancement of knowledge about the professional injury prevention continuum. The clear identification of the uses, attributes, antecedents, and consequences of integrated prevention at work will offer concrete tools to stakeholders to implement innovative and promising approaches to integrated prevention at work.

631716,Longitudinal Weight Gain and Related Risk Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Adults in the US,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND: Weight stigma is common for people with obesity and harmful to health. Links between obesity and complications from COVID−19 have been identified, but it is unknown whether weight stigma poses adverse health implications during this pandemic. PURPOSE: We examined longitudinal associations between prepandemic experiences of weight stigma and eating behaviors, psychological distress, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in a diverse sample of emerging adults. METHODS: Participants (N = 584, 64% female, mean age = 24.6 ± 2.0 years, mean body mass index [BMI] = 28.2) in the COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time (C-EAT) study were cohort members of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010–2018. Weight stigma reported by participants in 2018 was examined as a predictor of binge eating, eating to cope, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and stress during COVID-19. Data were collected via online surveys during the U.S. outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. RESULTS: Prepandemic experiences of weight stigma predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms (β = 0.15, p < .001), stress (β = 0.15, p = .001), eating as a coping strategy (β = 0.16, p < .001), and an increased likelihood of binge eating (odds ratio = 2.88, p < .001) among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic but were unrelated to physical activity. Although associations remained after accounting for demographic characteristics and BMI, the magnitude of longitudinal associations was attenuated after adjusting for prior levels of the outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults who have experienced weight stigma may have increased vulnerability to distress and maladaptive eating during this pandemic. Public health messaging could be improved to support people of diverse body sizes and reduce the harmful consequences of weight stigma.","Puhl, Rebecca M; Lessard, Leah M; Larson, Nicole; Eisenberg, Marla E; Neumark-Stzainer, Dianne",Ann Behav Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32909031/; https://doi.org/10.1093/abm/kaaa077,366

The recent substitutions in spike protein may be critical for the virus to evade the host's immune system and therapeutics that have already been developed. Thus, this study has employed an immunoinformatics pipeline to target the spike protein of this novel strain to construct an immunogenic epitope (CTL, HTL, and B cell) vaccine against the new variant. Our investigation revealed that 12 different epitopes imparted a critical role in immune response induction. This was validated by an exploration of physiochemical properties and experimental feasibility. In silico and host immune simulation confirmed the expression and induction of both primary and secondary immune factors such as IL, cytokines, and antibodies.

There is an urgent need to create novel models to study SARS-CoV-2 using human disease-relevant cells to understand key features of virus biology and facilitate drug screening. As primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory-based, we developed a lung organoid model using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be adapted for drug screens. The lung organoids, particularly aveolar type II cells, express ACE2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transcriptomic analysis following SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed a robust induction of chemokines and cytokines with little type I/III interferon signaling, similar to that observed amongst human COVID-19 pulmonary infections. We performed a high throughput screen using hPSC-derived lung organoids and identified FDA-approved drug candidates, including imatinib and mycophenolic acid, as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Pre- or post-treatment with these drugs at physiologically relevant levels decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection of hPSC-derived lung organoids. Together, these data demonstrate that hPSC-derived lung cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 can model human COVID-19 disease and provide a valuable resource to screen for FDA-approved drugs that might be repurposed and should be considered for COVID-19 clinical trials.","Han, Yuling; Yang, Liuliu; Duan, Xiaohua; Duan, Fuyu; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Yaron, Tomer M.; Wang, Pengfei; Tang, Xuming; Zhang, Tuo; Zhao, Zeping; Bram, Yaron; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Nguyen, Duc; Xu, Dong; Wang, Xing; Uhl, Skyler; Huang, Yaoxing; Johnson, Jared L.; Xiang, Jenny; Wang, Hui; Pan, Fong Cheng; Cantley, Lewis C.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Ho, David D.; Evans, Todd; Schwartz, Robert E.; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Chen, Shuibing",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511403/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079095,366

One notable aspect deserving emphasis however, is the psychological impact in children as a result of the purported surge of domestic violence (DV) in many of the countries that imposed stay-at-home requirement. The imposition of movement restriction policy led to isolation and overcrowding, made worse by loss of income in some instances, causing high levels of stress and anxiety, thereby increasing the risk of DV and child abuse particularly those already living within violent or dysfunctional families. Children exposed to DV have higher risk of developmental delay and behavioural problems, more likely to suffer from post-traumatic symptoms, depression and anxiety, reduced cognitive functioning and social competence. Additionally, these children tend to have poorer academic performance and are more likely to engage in violent or abusive relationship later in life. Health care providers need to be vigilant and actively screen and identify children or families that are affected by DV to protect their physical and mental health well-being.","Boo, Woi Hon",Malays J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.21315/mjms2021.28.3.16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285655/,366
632110,Electroconvulsive Therapy Practice Changes in Older Individuals due to COVID-19: Expert Consensus Statement,2020-08-07,"Rationale: The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is advancing rapidly. In particular, the number of severe courses of the disease is still dramatically high. An efficient drug therapy that helps to improve significantly the fatal combination of damages in the airway epithelia, in the extensive pulmonary microvascularization and finally multiorgan failure, is missing. The physiological, inorganic polymer, polyphosphate (polyP) is a molecule which could prevent the initial phase of the virus life cycle, the attachment of the virus to the target cells, and improve the epithelial integrity as well as the mucus barrier. Results: Surprisingly, polyP matches perfectly with the cationic groove on the RBD. Subsequent binding studies disclosed that polyP, with a physiological chain length of 40 phosphate residues, abolishes the binding propensity of the RBD to the ACE2 receptor. In addition to this first mode of action of polyP, this polymer causes in epithelial cells an increased gene expression of the major mucins in the airways, of MUC5AC and MUC1, as well as a subsequent glycoprotein production. MUC5AC forms a gel-like mucus layer trapping inhaled particles which are then transported out of the airways, while MUC1 constitutes the periciliary liquid layer and supports ciliary beating. As a third mode of action, polyP undergoes enzymatic hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds in the airway system by alkaline phosphatase, releasing metabolic energy. Conclusions: This review summarizes the state of the art of the biotherapeutic potential of the polymer polyP and the findings from basic research and outlines future biomedical applications.","Schepler, Hadrian; Wang, Xiaohong; Neufurth, Meik; Wang, Shunfeng; Schröder, Heinz C.; Müller, Werner E.

Trust in crisis communication is affected by the communication’s characteristics including transparency, timeliness, empathy, and clarity, as well as the source and communication channels used. Crisis communication occurs in a rhetorical arena where various actors, including public health, news media, and the public, are co-producing and responding to messages. Rhetorical arenas must be monitored to assess the acceptance of messaging. The quality and content of Canadian public health and news media crisis communication on Facebook were evaluated to understand the use of key guiding principles of effective crisis communication, the focus of the communication, and subsequent public emotional response to included posts. Four hundred and thirty-eight posts and 26,774 anonymized comments were collected and analyzed. Overall, the guiding principles for effective crisis communication were inconsistently applied and combined. A limited combination of guiding principles, especially those that demonstrate trustworthiness, was likely driving the negative sentiment uncovered in the comments. Public health and news media should use the guiding principles consistently to increase positive sentiment and build trust among followers.","MacKay, Melissa; Colangeli, Taylor; Gillis, Daniel; McWhirter, Jennifer; Papadopoulos, Andrew",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360278/,366

However, the molecular level understanding of the virus structure at different temperature is still not clear. Spike protein is the outermost structural protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which interacts with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a human receptor, and enters the respiratory system. In this study, we performed an all atom molecular dynamics simulation to study the effect of temperature on the structure of the Spike protein. After 200ns of simulation at different temperatures, we came across some interesting phenomena exhibited by the protein. We found that the solvent exposed domain of Spike protein, namely S1, is more mobile than the transmembrane domain, S2. Structural studies implied the presence of several charged residues on the surface of N-terminal Domain of S1 which are optimally oriented at 10-30 °C. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that it is capable of binding to other human receptors and should not be disregarded. Additionally, we found that receptor binding motif (RBM), present on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S1, begins to close around temperature of 40 °C and attains a completely closed conformation at 50 °C. The closed conformation disables its ability to bind to ACE2, due to the burying of its receptor binding residues. Our results clearly show that there are active and inactive states of the protein at different temperatures. This would not only prove beneficial for understanding the fundamental nature of the virus, but would be also useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics. Graphical Abstract Highlights Statistical and epidemiological evidence show that external climatic conditions influence the SARS-CoV infectivity, but we still lack a molecular level understanding of the same. Here, we study the influence of temperature on the structure of the Spike glycoprotein, the outermost structural protein, of the virus which binds to the human receptor ACE2. Results show that the Spike’s S1 domain is very sensitive to external atmospheric conditions compared to the S2 transmembrane domain. The N-terminal domain comprises of several solvent exposed charged residues that are capable of binding to human proteins. The region is specifically stable at temperatures ranging around 10-30° C. The Receptor Binding Motif adopts a closed conformation at 40°C and completely closes at higher temperatures making it unsuitable of binding to human receptors","Rath, Soumya Lipsa; Kumar, Kishant",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.145086,366

633635,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Spine Care Providers and Patients,2020-05-07,"Over the century, the world has witnessed a number of pandemics—such as plague, Spanish flu, smallpox, and tuberculosis. Such pandemics have not only resulted in a great loss to human lives but have also affected the economy of many countries. COVID-19, declared as global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is the latest in this series which has hit the world since the last quarter of 2019. Although a number of scales exist to assess fear and distress of individuals related to COVID-19, it is well articulated in the extant literature that sometimes the proposed scales are context specific and lack applicability in multi-cultural environment as also the factors’ structure of the scale are fit from the context of audience from certain geographical regions. Thus, a need was felt to evaluate the FCV-19S and propose and statistically validate a new COVID-19-based scale called Phobic COVID-19 Disorder scale (Phobic-19 scale). A structured e-questionnaire in English was used to collect the data from the respondents. A 12-item, three-dimensional (fear, anxiety, and distress) scale was developed to capture the emotions of general populations towards COVID-19. The study analyzes the dimensionality and item structure of the scale through exploratory factor analysis and further validated with the help of confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that the Phobic-19 scale has a strong internal consistency along with better psychometric characteristics. Mass replication and a large number of empirical research using the Phobic-19 scale would instill confidence amongst scholars and practitioners in the results. The findings also highlight that the results would help to advance our understanding by providing critical information related to COVID-19 and ensure that the scale provides accurate and usable data.","Nasir, Mohd; Adil, Mohd; Kumar, Mukesh",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00544-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34254004/,366

Therefore, identifying the primary sources of COVID-19 information among older adults can be valuable, as it can enable information on life-saving measures to be effectively disseminated to this population. METHODS: We analyzed the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement that was administrated from June 2020 through July 2020 (n=8,050). A survey-weighted logistic model was conducted to examine the association between sources of COVID-19 information Medicare beneficiaries most relied on (i.e., traditional news sources, social media, comments/guidance from government officials, other webpages/internet, friends/family members, and health care providers) and engaging in all three recommended preventive behaviors (i.e., mask wearing, social distancing, and handwashing). RESULTS: Among study participants, 89.8% engaged in all three recommended preventive behaviors. Approximately 59.3% of beneficiaries reported that they most relied upon traditional news sources for COVID-19 information; 11.4% reported health care providers; 10.6% reported comments/guidance from government officials; 8.8% reported other webpages/internet, 8.6% reported friends/family members; and 1.3% reported they relied upon social media. Beneficiaries who relied on comments/guidance from government officials for COVID-19 information (vs. traditional news sources) were more likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=1.68, 95% CI=1.20,2.35). However, those who relied on COVID-19 information from friends/family members (vs. traditional news sources) were less likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.44,0.73).

634067,COVID-19 In a Rural Health System in New York - Case Series and an Approach to Management,2020,"Quarantine for COVID-19 is hard and could safely be made easier. Lengthy quarantine is difficult for many individuals to rigorously observe. To date, 14 days has been recommended as the quarantine period for people who are exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case, because most infections appear by then. For household close contacts, there remains a 0.5% chance that a COVID-19 infection may appear after that time, because the COVID-19 incubation period is up to 21 days. However, the risk of transmission after 14 days is so small that public health authorities have decided that 0.5% is an acceptable risk to balance the impact of quarantine on individuals, their communities, and our economy. Therefore, this 0.5% risk of infection is a useful benchmark to consider additional strategies for reducing the burden on individuals while reducing spread of COVID-19. With appropriately timed testing and awareness of possible symptoms, a non-symptomatic individual with a negative COVID-19 test at day 7-8 would be at lower risk of being or becoming infectious than someone completing a 14-day quarantine without testing. If we implemented a test-based strategy for determining the end of quarantine, these individuals could be safely released from quarantine at an earlier date, and would be able to more rigorously quarantine themselves while potentially most infectious.","Lewis, D.; Leibrand, S.; Leibrand, H.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.20238287; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.24.20238287v1?rss=1,366

Methods A total of 333 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in the departments of Internal medicine of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital from January 11th to February 10th, 2020 were included. The data were obtained from electronic medical records. The epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, length of hospital stays, and outcomes of pediatric and adult patients were compared. Results Compared with adult patients, pediatric patients had a shorter time of symptom onset to hospitalization than adults [median time, 1 (IQR, 1.0–1.0) d vs. 3 (IQR, 2.0–6.0) d, P < 0.001], milder or fewer symptoms, less severe chest CT findings. The clinical severity classification of children was less severe than adults. Up to 15th March, the end of the follow-up, 33 (100%) children and 292 (97.3%) adult patients had been discharged from hospital. Only 2 (0.7%) adult patients died, with an overall case mortality of 0.6%. The median length of hospital stay of pediatric patients was shorter than that of adult patients [19 (95% CI: 16.6–21.4) d vs. 21 (95% CI: 19.9–22.1) d, P = 0.024].

The impregnation of the CuNP was achieved by spraying the suspension on the surface of filter media. An acid pretreatment was also evaluated to increase the adhesion between fibre and nanoparticle. The synthesis of the CuNP was done by chemical reduction. The bacterial effect was measured through the contact method for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and we demonstrate that the presence of CuNP to filter media reduced up to 99.99% of gram‐negative and 99.98% of gram‐positive bacteria. The pretreatment with HCl was a good alternative to filter modification due to the higher adhesion between CuNP and the fibre while the high efficiency against pathogen microorganisms was kept. The modification of filters with CuNP can improve the air quality of indoor environments, vanishing the pathogen microorganisms circulating in the air.","Machry, Karine; de Souza, Clóvis W.

To overcome the challenge of nucleic acid (NA) extraction and testing kit availability, an efficient method is urgently needed. OBJECTIVES: To establish an efficient, time and resource-saving and cost-effective methods, and to propose an ad hoc pooling approach for mass screening of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We evaluated pooling approach on both direct clinical and NA samples. The standard reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test of the SARS CoV-2 was employed targeting the nucleocapsid (N) and open reading frame (ORF1ab) genomic region of the virus. The experimental pools were created using SARS CoV-2 positive clinical samples and extracted RNA spiked with up to 9 negative samples. For the direct clinical samples viral NA was extracted from each pool to a final extraction volume of 200μL, and subsequently both samples tested using the SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: We found that a single positive sample can be amplified and detected in pools of up to 7 samples depending on the cycle threshold (Ct) value of the original sample, corresponding to high, and low SARS CoV-2 viral copies per reaction. However, to minimize false negativity of the assay with pooling strategies and with unknown false negativity rate of the assay under validation, we recommend pooling of 4/5 in 1 using the standard protocols of the assay, reagents and equipment. The predictive algorithm indicated a pooling ratio of 5 in 1 was expected to retain accuracy of the test irrespective of the Ct value samples spiked, and result in a 137% increase in testing efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The approaches showed its concept in easily customized and resource-saving manner and would allow expanding of current screening capacities and enable the expansion of detection in the community. We recommend clinical sample pooling of 4 or 5 in 1. However, we don’t advise pooling of clinical samples when disease prevalence is greater than 7%; particularly when sample size is large.","Mulu, Andargachew; Alemayehu, Dawit Hailu; Alemu, Fekadu; Tefera, Dessalegn Abeje; Wolde, Sinknesh; Aseffa, Gebeyehu; Seyoum, Tamrayehu; Habtamu, Meseret; Abdissa, Alemseged; Bayih, Abebe Genetu; Beyene, Getachew Tesfaye",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635923/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247767,366

Their job descriptions vary, which may lead to lack of clarity or preparedness regarding their roles and core tasks during a crisis such as COVID‐19. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore hospital‐employed healthcare researchers' experiences of work during the COVID‐19 pandemic. DESIGN: A qualitative design based on Graneheim and Lundman's latent content analysis of two focus groups with researchers in clinical practice was chosen to explore researchers' experiences of work during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: Fifteen hospital researchers participated in two focus groups, divided into predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers. Focus groups were conducted in May 2020 during the COVID‐19 pandemic, using the voice over IP service, Skype®, due to risk of contagion. FINDINGS: ‘Searching for a new normal during the COVID‐19 pandemic’ was the main theme during the latent content interpretation, with subthemes of (i) balancing calm and insecurity, (ii) negotiating core tasks and (iii) considering the future. CONCLUSION: The 15 researchers tried to balance calm and insecurity within work and family, on standby for the hospital's contingency plan, and in their research tasks. This led them to negotiate their core tasks and to reflect on the changes and consequences for their positions as researchers in clinical practice in the future. SUMMARY STATEMENT: During a major healthcare crisis, normal plans and procedures at hospitals are set aside. Working under unexpected and unsecure conditions may lead to postcrisis reactions. Researchers with nursing and allied health backgrounds, who are the first generation of these researchers at hospitals, do not have fully developed and recognized positions. Nurse and allied health researchers searched for a new normal in their work during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Nurse and allied health researchers tried to balance calm and insecurity during the COVID‐19 pandemic, due to the imbalance between their research‐related tasks and their status on standby for clinical tasks in the hospital contingency plan. Nurse and allied health researchers struggled with identifying and negotiating their core tasks by reconsidering possible changes and consequences for their positions as researchers in clinical practice in the future. Nurse and allied health researchers employed in clinical practice were willing to participate on the frontline, monitoring and evaluating major healthcare crises like the COVID‐19 pandemic. This could potentially lead to new and important context‐sensitive learnings after crisis but only if healthcare leaders and organizations clearly formulate the expectations for the researchers.","Berthelsen, Connie; Beck, Malene; Hølge‐Hazelton, Bibi",Int J Nurs Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.12931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908138/,366

The COVID-19 outbreak is considered a pandemic and has created a number of challenges for the general population, patients, and healthcare professionals. Lockdowns have been implemented to slow down the spread of the virus with the expectation that these restrictions will limit the number of cases, and hence the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. However, these restrictions, and in particular lockdowns, impact on the life of everyone living in Ireland. AIM: To record how the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictive measures impacted on people’s activities, work, schooling, and childcare. METHODS: The Corona Citizens’ Science Project was set up as a population-wide survey. A questionnaire was designed, and the survey was first launched on the 8th of April 2020. An overview of results was released in the press days later. Data was collected in four waves: April 8, April 22, May 6, and June 17, 2020. Each wave had core questions allowing to compare each wave, and wave-specific questions, to understand current impact of changing measures. RESULTS: Over four waves, 152,259 responses were collected. The mean age of respondents was 47 with about 10% over the age of 65. Around 75% were female and 85% had a higher degree. Nearly 70% of the respondents were in employment, and around 13% were retired. Up to 20% of the respondents were essential workers, and 10% of respondents indicated they were in receipt of the COVID-19 pandemic unemployment payment. Around 10% of the people who responded were living alone. The number of people talked to the previous day was on average 2.3 in the first survey; during the lockdown, this went up over time, and in the last survey, the mean was 3.9. The percentage of respondents who did not talk to anyone the previous day decreased from 40 to 22% over the waves. In the first wave, about 6% of respondents reported having had flu-like symptoms in the last 14 days, which declined to 3.3%, 2.5%, and 2.0% in waves 2, 3, and 4 respectively. Similarly, over the four waves, the respondents who indicated that someone they lived with had flu-like symptoms declined from 17 to 12%, 9%, and 11%. Throughout the four waves, nearly one third of people reported one or more underlying conditions. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of restrictive measures, in particular lockdown, were implemented in Ireland to protect populations and healthcare systems. To record some of the major impacts on society, we launched a Corona Citizens Science Project, with the aim to support decision-making.

We find that the incidence of infectious COVID-19 individuals has a concave effect on contagion, as would be expected if people have inter-related social networks. We also demonstrate that social distancing and population density have large effects on the rate of contagion. The social distancing in late March and April substantially reduced the number of COVID-19 cases. However, the concave contagion pattern means that when social distancing measures are lifted, the growth rate is considerable but will not be exponential as predicted by standard SIR models. Furthermore, counties with the lowest population density could likely avoid high levels of contagion even with no social distancing. We forecast rates of new cases for COVID-19 under different social distancing norms and find that if social distancing is eliminated there will be a massive increase in the cases of COVID-19, about double what would occur if the US only restored to 50% of the way to normalcy.","Liu, M.; Thomadsen, R.; Yao, S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.20113993; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.26.20113993v1?rss=1,366

Their convalescent plasma could be an inexpensive and widely available treatment for COVID-19. Methods The Convalescent-plasma-for-COVID (ConCOVID) study was a randomized trial comparing convalescent plasma with standard of care therapy in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Patients were randomized 1:1 and received 300ml of plasma with anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers of at least 1:80. The primary endpoint was day-60 mortality and key secondary endpoints were hospital stay and WHO 8-point disease severity scale improvement on day 15. Results The trial was halted prematurely after 86 patients were enrolled. Although symptomatic for only 10 days (IQR 6-15) at the time of inclusion, 53 of 66 patients tested had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at baseline. A SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test showed neutralizing antibodies in 44 of the 56 (79%) patients tested with median titers comparable to the 115 donors (1:160 vs 1:160, p=0.40). These observations caused concerns about the potential benefit of convalescent plasma in the study population and after discussion with the data safety monitoring board, the study was discontinued. No difference in mortality (p=0.95), hospital stay (p=0.68) or day-15 disease severity (p=0.58) was observed between plasma treated patients and patients on standard of care. Conclusion Most COVID-19 patients already have high neutralizing antibody titers at hospital admission. Screening for antibodies and prioritizing convalescent plasma to risk groups with recent symptom onset will be key to identify patients that may benefit from convalescent plasma.

For many years, conventional virus isolation was the mainstay of viral diagnosis since it was sensitive and “open-minded.” However, growth in conventional cell culture entails an inherent delay that limits its clinical impact. Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. Polymerase chain reaction has ushered in a new era in virology, especially in the diagnosis of neurologic diseases. Molecular amplification methods are rapid, highly sensitive, can be automated, quantitative, and detect viruses not amenable to routine culture. User-friendly, walk-away tests with results in an hour, as well as multiplex tests that can detect 20 viruses in a single reaction, are now a reality. As the variety of test methods and commercial products proliferate, the challenges for clinicians and laboratories are selecting which tests to utilize in which clinical scenarios, and understanding how to interpret the results.

The threat posed by the potential spread of the virus via an airborne transmission mode through ventilation systems in buildings and enclosed spaces has been recognized as a major concern. To mitigate this threat, researchers have explored different technologies and methods that can remove or decrease the concentration of the virus in ventilation systems and enclosed spaces. Although many technologies and methods have already been researched, some are currently available on the market, but their effectiveness and safety concerns have not been fully investigated. To acquire a broader view and collective perspective of the current research and development status, this paper discusses a comprehensive review of various workable technologies and methods to combat airborne viruses, e.g., COVID-19, in ventilation systems and enclosed spaces. These technologies and methods include an increase in ventilation, high-efficiency air filtration, ionization of the air, environmental condition control, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, non-thermal plasma and reactive oxygen species, filter coatings, chemical disinfectants, and heat inactivation.

Overall, 99 different serotypes were detected (47% HRV-A, 12% HRV-B, 39% HRV-C). Patients with HRV had more underlying pulmonary illness compared with patients with no virus (p 0.01), or patients with another respiratory virus besides HRV (p 0.007). Furthermore, cough, shortness of breath and a need for oxygen were significantly more present in patients with HRV infection. Particularly, patients with HRV-B required extra oxygen. No respiratory symptom, except for oxygen need, was predictive of the presence of HRV. In 22% of HRV-positive disease episodes, HRV infection was hospital acquired. Phylogenetic analysis revealed several clusters of HRV; in more than 25% of these clusters epidemiological information was suggestive of transmission within specific wards. In conclusion, the detection of HRV may help in explaining respiratory illness, particular in patients with pulmonary co-morbidities. Identifying HRV provides opportunities for timely implementation of infection control measures to prevent intra-hospital transmission.","Rahamat-Langendoen, J.C.; Riezebos-Brilman, A.; Hak, E.; Schölvinck, E.H.; Niesters, H.G.M.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14629906; https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-0691.12242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663244/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14629906,366
639999,Alcohol and COVID-19,2020-05-13,"OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a major risk factor for becoming seriously ill with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). One difficulty faced by clinicians and by patients is the unknown time frame of hospitalization until discharge of symptomatic patients. METHODS: We followed 34 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who recovered from the infection. All diagnoses were given using semi-quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. Envelope protein gene (E), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRP), and nucleocapsid gene (N) were measured by RT-PCR. Weight was measured and height was self-reported. RESULTS: Mean ± SD age was 51.8 ± 16.7 years. Mean ± SD body mass index (BMI) was 27.4 ± 4.7 kg/m2. 26% (9/34) had obesity, with BMI above 30 kg/m2. Fifteen patients had BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2. The mean length of hospital stay was longer for those with a BMI >25 kg/m2 (n = 24) than for those with a normal BMI (19.2 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.08). Comparing people with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2 or above) to those without obesity, the difference was larger (20.6 vs. 16.0 days, p = 0.06). A trend for correlation between body weight and the time to negative detection of RdRp gene was found (r = 0.33, p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the need for priority of early detection and testing, and early therapy for people with obesity and COVID-19 infections.","Dicker, Dror; Lev, Shaul; Gottesman, Tamar; Kournos, Tatiana; Dotan, Maya; Ashorov, Nina; Marcoviciu, Dana; Golan, Rachel",Obes Facts,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992323/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000511738,366
640491,Early COVID‐19 testing is critical to end the pandemic,2021-01-28,"BACKGROUND: As the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the United States, policy makers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of web-based crowdfunding to defray these costs. OBJECTIVE: We examined the web-based crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States to understand the incidence of initiation of COVID-19–related campaigns and compare them to non–COVID-19–related campaigns. METHODS: On May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns that contained narratives and were created between January 1 and May 10, 2020, on GoFundMe. We identified the subset of COVID-19–related campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored the incidence of COVID-19–related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time, and we compared the characteristics of the campaigns to those of non–COVID-19–related campaigns after March 11, when the pandemic was declared. We then used a natural language processing algorithm to cluster campaigns by narrative content using overlapping keywords. RESULTS: We found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe web-based crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-19–related campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 case declined more than tenfold across all states. The states with the earliest disease burden had the fewest campaigns per case, indicating a lack of a case-dependent response. COVID-19–related campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based crowdfunding appears to be a stopgap for only a minority of campaigners. The novelty of an emergency likely impacts both campaign initiation and crowdfunding success, as it reflects the affective response of a community. Crowdfunding activity likely serves as an early signal for emerging needs and societal sentiment for communities in acute distress that could be used by governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.","Saleh, Sameh Nagui; Lehmann, Christoph U; Medford, Richard J",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/25429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33523826/,366

La escasa bibliografía sobre cuidados enfermeros en esta pandemia motivó la realización de un protocolo de uso hospitalario que resultara útil para atender al cada vez mayor número de pacientes adultos que ingresaban en Unidades de Hospitalización adaptadas para atender a pacientes con COVID-19. Por esa razón, el objetivo del documento es aportar recomendaciones para la práctica clínica que ayuden a protocolizar cuidados en pacientes adultos ingresados en Unidades de Hospitalización por COVID-19, atendiendo a estándares basados en la literatura o a la experiencia más actual en esta nueva pandemia. ABSTRACT Since the SARS-CoV-2 was announced on March 11 in 2020, most of people, professional healthcare, scientists, technical personnel and managers included, have been developing protocols, procedures, guides, technical reports to orient an adequate attention in this health emergency due to the COVID-19. The shortage bibliography about nursing care in this pandemic is the reason to develop a useful clinical protocol to attend to the higher number of adult patients who were admitted at Hospitalization Units adapted to patient with COVID-19. For that reason, the aim of this document is to provide recommendations to the clinical practice and that way, helping to protocolize the care in adult patients admitted in COVID-19 Hospitalization Units, based in standards of the literature or the most current experience in front of this new pandemic.","de Andrés-Gimeno, Begoña; Solís-Muñoz, Montserrat; Revuelta-Zamorano, Manuel; Sánchez-Herrero, Héctor; Santano-Magariño, Almudena",Enferm Clin,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1130862120303132?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1130862120303132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732015/,366

We conducted a cross-sectional survey with directors of Oklahoma-licensed ECE programs to assess policies and practices related to asthma control and to evaluate potential differences between Centers and Family Childcare Homes (FCCHs). Surveyed ECEs (n = 476) included Centers (56.7%), FCCHs (40.6%), and other program types (2.7%). Almost half (47.2%) of directors reported never receiving any asthma training. More Center directors were asthma-trained than FCCH directors (61.0% versus 42.0%, p < 0.0001). Most ECEs used asthma triggers, including bleach (88.5%) and air fresheners (73.6%). Centers were more likely to use bleach daily than were FCCHs (75.6% versus 66.8%, p = 0.04). FCCHs used air fresheners more than did Centers (79.0% versus 61.0%, p < 0.0001). The majority of ECEs (74.8%) used pesticides indoors. Centers applied indoor pesticides more frequently (i.e., monthly or more often) than did FCCHs (86.0% versus 58.0%, p < 0.0001). Policy, educational, and technical assistance interventions are needed to reduce asthma triggers and improve asthma control in Oklahoma ECEs.","Querdibitty, Cassandra D.; Williams, Bethany; Wetherill, Marianna S.; Sisson, Susan B.; Campbell, Janis; Gowin, Mary; Stephens, Lancer; Salvatore, Alicia L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444242/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168491,366

641426,Information Needs of Pregnant Women in the COVID-19 Pandemic from Experts’ Point of View: A Qualitative Study,2021-04-11,"Our recent genomic studies identified a complex kidney‐specific enhancer module located within the introns of adjacent Mettl1 (M1) and Mettl21b (M21) genes that mediate basal and PTH induction of Cyp27b1, as well as suppression by FGF23 and 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. The tissue specificity for this regulatory module appears to be localized exclusively to renal proximal tubules. Gross deletion of these segments in mice has severe consequences on skeletal health, and directly affects Cyp27b1 expression in the kidney. Deletion of both the M1 and M21 submodules together almost completely eliminates basal Cyp27b1 expression in the kidney, creating a renal specific pseudo‐null mouse, resulting in a systemic and skeletal phenotype similar to that of the Cyp27b1‐KO mouse caused by high levels of both 25‐hydroxyvitamin D(3) [25(OH)D(3)] and PTH and depletion of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Cyp24a1 levels in the double KO mouse also decrease because of compensatory downregulation of the gene by elevated PTH and reduced FGF23 that is mediated by an intergenic module located downstream of the Cyp24a1 gene. Outside of the kidney in nonrenal target cells (NRTCs), expression of Cyp27b1 in these mutant mice was unaffected. Dietary normalization of calcium, phosphate, PTH, and FGF23 rescues the aberrant phenotype of this mouse and normalizes the skeleton. In addition, both the high levels of 25(OH)D(3) were reduced and the low levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) were fully eliminated in these mutant mice as a result of the rescue‐induced normalization of renal Cyp24a1. Thus, these hormone‐regulated enhancers for both Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 in the kidney are responsible for the circulating levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in the blood. The retention of Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1 expression in NRTCs of these endocrine 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)‐deficient mice suggests that this Cyp27b1 pseudo‐null mouse will provide a model for the future exploration of the role of NRTC‐produced 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in the hormone's diverse noncalcemic actions in both health and disease. © 2020 The Authors.

642084,Surgical and endoscopy protocols for general surgeons during the COVID‐19 pandemic: an institutional experience in Singapore,2020-05-17,"BACKGROUND: There is sufficient epidemiological and biological evidence of increased human susceptibility to viral pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and influenza virus, in cold weather. The pattern of outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China during the flu season is further proof that meteorological conditions may potentially influence the susceptibility of human populations to coronaviruses, a situation that may become increasingly evident as the current global pandemic of COVID-19 unfolds. MAIN BODY: A very rapid spread and high mortality rates have characterized the COVID-19 pandemic in countries north of the equator where air temperatures have been seasonally low. It is unclear if the currently high rates of COVID-19 infections in countries of the northern hemisphere will wane during the summer months, or if fewer people overall will become infected with COVID-19 in countries south of the equator where warmer weather conditions prevail through most of the year. However, apart from the influence of seasons, evidence based on the structural biology and biochemical properties of many enveloped viruses similar to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 (aetiology of COVID-19), support the higher likelihood of the latter of the two outcomes. Other factors that may potentially impact the rate of virus spread include the effectiveness of infection control practices, individual and herd immunity, and emergency preparedness levels of countries. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the potential influence of weather conditions, seasons and non-climatological factors on the geographical spread of cases of COVID-19 across the globe.","Adedokun, Kamoru A.; Olarinmoye, Ayodeji O.; Mustapha, Jelili O.; Kamorudeen, Ramat T.",Infect Dis Poverty,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00688-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32586369/,366

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes embedded in RT practice in the COVID-19 era and to recommend proactive measures to protect RT practice in future pandemics. Materials and Methods The study was initiated by the ESTRO Radiation Oncology Safety and Quality Committee (ROSQC). A survey consisting of multiple choice, open ended and Likert scale questions was created to analyse the extent of changes embedded in RT practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic under the four domains: patient care, RTT workflow, remote working and RT practice. This online survey was distributed globally in May 2020. Results 229 respondents across 27 countries completed the survey. 60% of respondents reported continuing/commencing RT in COVID-19 patients. Routine testing of patients and RTTs was not common. Split teams' procedures, hot linacs and separate entrances were implemented by 50% of respondents. Remote working was implemented for RT team members where face to face patient contact was not essential. Lack of staff, connectivity issues and lack of confirmed positive cases in the department were the main reasons cited for not implementing recommended measures. Conclusion It is suggested that RT departments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and implemented certain changes in RT practice. RT departments should act now to implement recommended proactive measures to protect patients and RTTs – frontline healthcare workers.","Kearney, Maeve; Coffey, Mary; Rossi, Maddalena; Tsang, Yat",Tech Innov Patient Support Radiat Oncol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405632421000068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564723/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tipsro.2021.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405632421000068?v=s5,366

Quad bike accidental crashes result mostly due to the unique ecosystem of uneven terrain, where these unstable vehicles are commonly driven, in addition to numerous distinctive sociodemographic characteristics related to drivers. This is a protocol for a systematic review of observational studies from all geographical regions and demographic groups in the world to summarise the common risk factors relating to quad bike crashes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search for the literature on quad bike crashes and related injuries will be conducted in six electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE and PsycINFO. Proquest Dissertation and Thesis, OpenGrey and BASE will be searched for grey literature. Five researchers will be involved in the screening, and the review of full text articles, using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements between reviewers will be resolved by discourse. Three researchers will help resolving conflicts that may arise during the screening process and will resolve eventual conflicts identified in the process with the help of the systematic review software 'Covidence' for automatic deduplication and blinded screening. Information on crashes leading to injuries and death, target population characteristics and risk factors involved will be extracted from eligible articles in addition to the assessment of the quality of the researched articles. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Since this is a systematic review of published literature, a formal ethical approval is not needed. Results of the review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and reports to the concerned authorities.

Current researches on COVID-19 continue to highlight the necessity for further understanding the virus-host synergies. In this study, we have highlighted the key cytokines induced by coronavirus infections. We have demonstrated that genes coding interleukins (Il-1α, Il-1β, Il-6, Il-10), chemokine (Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl5, Ccl10), and interferon (Ifn-α2, Ifn-β1, Ifn2) upsurge significantly which in line with the elevated infiltration of T cells, NK cells and monocytes in SARS-Cov treated group at 24 hours. Also, interleukins (IL-6, IL-23α, IL-10, IL-7, IL-1α, IL-1β) and interferon (IFN-α2, IFN2, IFN-γ) have increased dramatically in MERS-Cov at 24 hours. A similar cytokine profile showed the cytokine storm served a critical role in the infection process. Subsequent investigation of 463 patients with COVID-19 disease revealed the decreased amount of total lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the severe type patients which indicated COVID-19 can impose hard blows on human lymphocyte resulting in lethal pneumonia.

METHODS: Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 clinicians and telemedicine experts during July-September 2020. We obtained data on 12 Level I/II and both Level IV hospitals. RESULTS: Less than half of Level I/II hospitals currently offer obstetric services through telemedicine, and both Level IV hospitals have interest and technical capacity to support implementation of a PTM network in Maryland. The Covid-19 related shift to telehealth and telemedicine was identified as a facilitator for such PTM programs. Perceived barriers to provider adoption of PTM services and network in Maryland included hospital leadership buy-in, information technology (IT) literacy, and patient triage complexities. Perceived barriers to patient adoption of PTM were access to technology, IT literacy, and language. Key benefits of PTM services included overall improved patient access, convenience, cost-savings, and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Influential factors for implementing a PTM network in Maryland included buy-in and approval from hospital and health system administration, a streamlined telehealth platform allowing for electronic medical record integration and interoperability, program funding, and sustainability.

HPVs are oncogenic small double-stranded DNA viruses that are the primary causal agent of cervical cancer and other types of cancers, including in the anus, oropharynx, vagina, vulva, and penis. Prophylactic vaccination against HPV is an attractive strategy for preventing cervical cancer and some other types of cancers. However, there are few safe and effective vaccines against HPV infections. Current first-generation commercial HPV vaccines are expensive to produce and deliver. The goal of this study was to develop an alternate potent HPV recombinant L1-based vaccines by producing HPV virus-like particles into a vaccine that is currently used worldwide. Live attenuated measles virus (MV) vaccines have a well-established safety and efficacy record, and recombinant MV (rMV) produced by reverse genetics may be useful for generating candidate HPV vaccines to meet the needs of the developing world. We studied in non-human primate rMV-vectored HPV vaccine in parallel with a classical alum adjuvant recombinant HPV16L1 and 18L1 protein vaccine produced in Pichia pastoris. A combined prime-boost approach using both vaccines was evaluated, as well as immune interference due to pre-existing immunity against the MV. The humoral immune response induced by the MV, Pichia-expressed vaccine, and their combination as priming and boosting approaches was found to elicit HPV16L1 and 18L1 specific total IgG and neutralizing antibody titres.

This study conducted a national online survey of 1843 adults at the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. to examine age disparities in preventive behaviors against the virus. The results show that older generations, motivated by a higher perceived severity of the disease, were more likely to take the precautionary actions recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) than younger generations. This thus suggests that persuasive health messages addressing the severity of COVID-19 might reduce the generational gap and promote preventive behaviors among young people, to protect themselves and the elderly.","Luo, Yunjuan; Cheng, Yang; Sui, Mingxiao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18042011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33669713/,366
644708,"The Burden of Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among People Living with HIV (PLHIV) in Pune, India",2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: A key purpose of the IHR is to prevent unwarranted interruptions to trade and travel during large and/or transnational infectious disease outbreaks. Nevertheless, such outbreaks continue to disrupt the travel industry. This aspect of the IHR has received little attention in the academic literature despite its considerable impact on affected States and commercial activity. This paper outlines the challenges and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between outbreaks and the travel sector and discusses the opportunities for further research and policy work to overcome these challenges. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a literature review on the relationship between outbreaks and travel restrictions, with a particular focus on the 2014–16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. This review was complemented by an expert roundtable at Chatham House and further supported by case studies and qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Numerous travel stakeholders are affected by, and affect, large-scale infectious disease outbreaks. These stakeholders react in different ways: peer pressure plays an important role for both governments and the travel sector, and the reactions of the media and public influence and are influenced by these stakeholders. While various data sources on travel are available, and WHO is mandated to work with States, there is no recognised coordinating body to disseminate timely, consistent, reliable and authoritative information and best practices to all stakeholders. CONCLUSION: This article highlights the interdependent relationship between various travel stakeholders. The reasons for interruption of travel during the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak were complex, with decisions by States only partly contributing to the cessation. Decisions by non-state actors, particularly the travel industry itself, contributed significantly and were based on a variety of factors.

Méthodes Nous rapportons une série de 3 cas de DRESS certains, selon le score REGISCAR, chez des patients atteints de pneumonies COVID-19 sévères. Résultats Le premier patient a 58 ans, est diabétique, hypertendu et obèse. Il présente à J20 du début des symptômes de COVID-19 un exanthème maculo papuleux diffus, œdème du visage, adénomégalies supra centimétriques et une hyperéosinophilie à 0,74 G/L ; à J15 d’un traitement par ceftriaxone (CTX), AZM et HCQ. La deuxième patiente a 76 ans, est diabétique, hypertendue et atteinte d’une SEP. Elle présente à 1 mois du début de sa pneumonie COVID-19 ; et à 21jours post-prises de CTX, AZM et HCQ une éruption cutanée sévère compatible avec un DRESS. Elle a présenté une hyperéosinophilie concomitante à 0,65 G/L avant traitement par dermocorticoides. Le troisième patient a 56 ans et aucune comorbidité. Il présente à J3 du début des symptômes de COVID-19 un volumineux œdème du visage et des lésions érythémateuses maculopapuleuses purpuriques ; à J8 d’un traitement antipaludéens et AINS. Pour chacun d’entre eux, la biopsie cutanée appuie le diagnostic de DRESS ; les PCR sanguines HHV6, EBV, CMV, VIH, VHB, VHC, parvovirus B19 sont négatives ; et l’évolution a été lentement favorable avec un blanchiement complet de la peau en plus de 15jours d’application de Clobetasol. Discussion Le DRESS syndrome est une toxidermie rare qui peut-être fatale. Aucun cas de toxidermie type DRESS n’avait été rapportée jusqu’à ce jour dans un contexte de COVID-19. Moins d’une dizaine de cas de DRESS ont été rapportés dans la littérature avec l’un ou l’autre des traitements par HCQ ou AZM. Les réactivations virales sont classiquement décrites avec HHV6 ou d’autres herpes virus (EBV, CMV), mais aucune de ces réplications virales classiques n’ont été objectivées chez nos patients qui étaient atteints de formes actives sévères d’infections par le SARS-CoV-2, probablement réplicatif.

ILI can be caused by numerous pathogens, however; there is limited information on the etiology and epidemiology of ILI in China. METHODS: We performed a one-year surveillance study (2010) of viral etiology causing ILI and investigated the influence of climate on outbreaks of ILI attributed to viruses at the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People’s Hospital in Zhuhai, China. RESULTS: Of the 337,272 outpatients who sought attention in the Outpatient Department of Zhuhai Municipal People’s Hospital in 2010, 3,747 (1.11%) presented with ILI. Of these patients presenting with ILI, 24.66% (924/3,747) had available samples and were enrolled in this study. At least one respiratory virus was identified in 411 patients (44.48%) and 42 (4.55%) were co-infected with two viruses. In patients co-infected with two viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected in 50% (21/42). Among common viral pathogens detected, significant differences in age distributions were observed in seasonal influenza virus A (sFulA, H3N2) and B (sFluB), pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses (H1N1pdm09), RSV, and adenovirus (ADV). Infections with sFluA (H3N2), sFluB, RSV, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) had characteristic seasonal patterns. The incidences of sFluA (H3N2), ADV, and RSV correlated with air temperature. Alternatively, the incidence of sFluB correlated with relative air humidity. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a wide range of respiratory viral pathogens are circulating in Zhuhai city. This information needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients presenting with ILI.","Li, Hongxia; Wei, Quande; Tan, Aijun; Wang, Leyi",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-10-143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651577/,366
645432,Reflecting on the challenges of sustaining emergency care research during the Covid-19 pandemic,2020-07-13,"Resume Les symptômes liés au COVID-19 sont principalement caractérisés par la triade fièvre, toux sèche et dyspnée. Toutefois, des symptômes digestifs ont également été rapportés dont la fréquence initialement considérée comme faible semble toucher plus de la moitié des patients à des degrés divers. Ceux-ci se manifestent principalement par une anorexie, une diarrhée, des nausées et ou vomissements et des douleurs abdominales. Bien que le pronostic soit lié à l’atteinte pulmonaire, les troubles digestifs semblent significativement plus fréquents chez les patients ayant une infection sévère à COVID-19. Des formes digestives isolées ou pouvant précéder les symptômes pulmonaires sont désormais bien décrites avec de la diarrhée au premier plan clinique. Les principales anomalies biologiques pouvant orienter précocement vers une infection à COVID-19 sont la lymphopénie, une CRP augmentée et une augmentation des transaminases prédominant sur les ASAT. Le scanner thoraco-abdominal semble utile dans ce cas pour éliminer une pathologie digestive non liée au coronavirus et pour rechercher des images pulmonaires compatibles avec une infection à COVID-19. Il n’existe pas de données sur l’intérêt de l’endoscopie digestive en cas de symptômes digestifs persistants. Le risque de contamination de l’endoscopiste semble par ailleurs significatif. Un mode de transmission oro-fécale de l’infection est possible ce d’autant que l’excrétion virale dans les selles semblent fréquente et durer plus longtemps qu’au niveau ORL, y compris chez des patients avec prélèvement pharyngé négatif ou sans symptômes digestifs. Ainsi, dans certains cas douteux, une analyse virologique des selles peut permettre de porter un diagnostic de certitude. La contagiosité persistante d’un patient en cas d’excrétion virale prolongée dans les selles est possible mais pas parfaitement établi. L’avènement proche de la sérologie devrait permettre d’identifier les malades ayant été infectés par l’épidémie de COVID-19 notamment les sujets pauci-symptomatiques non détectés au sein du personnel de santé. La reprise de l’activité médico-chirurgicale devra faire l’objet d’une stratégie dédiée en amont du déconfinement. Abstract The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are mainly characterized by a triad composed of fever, dry cough and dyspnea. However, digestive symptoms have also been reported; at first considered as infrequent, they in fact seem to affect (to some extent) more than half of patients. The symptoms are mainly manifested by anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal pain. Even though prognosis is associated with lung injury, digestive symptoms seem significantly more frequent in patients presenting with severe COVID-19 infection. Digestive forms, which may be isolated or which can precede pulmonary symptoms, have indeed been reported, with diarrhea as a leading clinical sign. The main biological abnormalities that can suggest COVID-19 infection at an early stage are lymphopenia, elevated CRP and heightened ASAT transaminases. Thoraco-abdominal scan seems useful as a means of on the one hand ruling out digestive pathology not connected with coronavirus and on the other hand searching for pulmonary images compatible with COVID-19 infection. No data exist on the interest of digestive endoscopy in cases of persistent digestive symptoms. Moreover, the endoscopic surgeons may themselves be at significant risk of contamination. Fecal-oral transmission of the infection is possible, especially insofar as viral shedding in stools seems frequent and of longer duration than at the ENT level, including in patients with negative throat swab and without digestive symptoms. In some doubtful cases, virologic assessment of stool samples can yield definitive diagnosis. In the event of prolonged viral shedding in stools, a patient’s persistent contagiousness is conceivable but not conclusively established. Upcoming serology should enable identification of the patients having been infected by the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly among previously undetected pauci-symptomatic members of a health care staff. Resumption of medico-surgical activity should be the object of a dedicated strategy preceding deconfinement.","Gornet, Jean-Marc; My, Linh Tran Minh; Leleu, Florian; Hassid, Deborah",Journal de chirurgie viscerale,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878786X20301017?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchirv.2020.04.013; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1878786X20301017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32341722/,366
645486,Measuring the missing: greater racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 burden after accounting for missing race/ethnicity data,2020-10-02,"OBJECTIVES: To understand how surgical services have been reorganised during and following public health emergencies, particularly the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequences for patients, healthcare providers and healthcare systems. DESIGN: A rapid scoping review. SETTING: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase and grey literature sources for documents and press releases from governments and surgical organisations or associations. PARTICIPANTS: Studies examining surgical service delivery during public health emergencies including COVID-19, and the impact on patients, providers and healthcare systems were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were strategies implemented for the reorganisation of surgical services. Secondary were the impacts of reorganisation and resuming surgical services, such as: adverse events (including morbidity and mortality), primary care and emergency department visits, length of hospital and ICU stay, and changes to surgical waitlists. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two studies were included in this review; 111 described reorganisation of surgical services, 55 described the consequences of reorganising surgical services; and 6 reported actions taken to rebuild surgical capacity in public health emergencies. Reorganisations of surgical services were grouped under six domains: case selection/triage, personal protective equipment (PPE) regulations and practice, workforce composition and deployment, outpatient and inpatient patient care, resident and fellow education, and the hospital or clinical environment. Service reorganisations led to large reductions in non-urgent surgical volumes, increases in surgical wait times and impacted medical training (ie, reduced case involvement) and patient outcomes (eg, increases in pain). Strategies for rebuilding surgical capacity were scarce but focused on the availability of staff, PPE and patient readiness for surgery as key factors to consider before resuming services. CONCLUSIONS: Reorganisation of surgical services in response to public health emergencies appears to be context dependent and has far-reaching consequences that must be better understood in order to optimise future health system responses to public health emergencies.","O'Rielly, Connor; Ng-Kamstra, Joshua; Kania-Richmond, Ania; Dort, Joseph; White, Jonathan; Robert, Jill; Brindle, Mary; Sauro, Khara",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34130956/,366

Cependant, ces résultats proviennent de l’analyse de bandelettes urinaires. Description Nous quantifions et caractérisons la protéinurie et nous investiguons son association potentielle avec la mortalité. Méthodes Cette étude rétrospective, observationnelle et monocentrique inclut 153 patients atteints de la COVID-19 (PCR+) hospitalisés entre le 28 mars et le 30 avril 2020 et ayant bénéficié d’une quantification systématique de leur protéinurie totale ainsi que d’un dosage de l’α1-microglobuline urinaire. Nous testons l’association entre ces paramètres urinaires et la mortalité (fin du suivi en date du 7 mai 2020). Résultats Selon la classification KDIGO, 14 % (n =21) des patients avaient une protéinurie normale ou de stade 1 (<150mg/g de créatinine urinaire), 42 % (n =64) une protéinurie de stade 2 (entre 150 et 500mg/g) et 44 % (n =68) une protéinurie de stade 3 (>500mg/g). La concentration urinaire en α1-microglobuline était supérieure à 10 et 15mg/g de créatinine urinaire chez 94 % et 89 % des patients, respectivement. Après un suivi médian de 27 [14 ; 30] jours, le taux de mortalité était de 18 %. La protéinurie totale et l’α1-microglobuline urinaire (en tant que variables continues et/ou catégorielles) sont associées à la mortalité dans les modèles non ajustés (courbes de survie selon Kaplan–Meier en Fig. 1) et ajustés. Cette association est encore plus significative dans les sous-groupes de patients avec une fonction rénale initialement normale ou sans sondage urinaire durant l’hospitalisation.

Less attention has been paid to the spread of respiratory droplets in outdoor environments under microclimatologic turbulent wind and which is of growing importance given the current COVID19 epidemic. We implement a computational model describing a sneezing person in an urban scenario under a medium intensity climatological wind. Turbulence was described with a wall-modeled Large Eddy Simulation model and the spread of respiratory droplets by using a lagrangian approach. Results show the spread of respiratory droplets is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: larger droplets (400 – 900 μm) are spread between 2–5 m during 2.3 s while smaller (100 – 200 μm) droplets are transported a larger range between 8–11 m by the action of the turbulent wind in 14.1 s average. Given the uncertainty of potential contagion over this way and with this reach, these efforts are an intent to contribute to shine a light on the possibility of adopting stricter self-care and distancing measures.","Guerrero, Nicolas; Brito, Jose; Cornejo, Pablo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20064394; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20064394v1?rss=1,366

646945,Front‐line nurses' responses to organisational changes during the COVID‐19 in Spain: A qualitative rapid appraisal,2021-06-01,"Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and other metabolic diseases. Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation in white adipose tissues, which is thought to play an essential role in developing insulin resistance. Many lines of evidence indicate that toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their downstream signaling pathways are involved in development of chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance, which are associated with obesity. Mice lacking molecules positively involved in the TLR signaling pathways are generally protected from high-fat diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. In this study, we have determined the effects of genetic deficiency of toll/interleukin-1 receptor-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) on food intake, bodyweight, glucose metabolism, adipose tissue macrophage polarization, and insulin signaling in normal chow diet-fed mice to investigate the role of the TRIF-dependent TLR signaling in adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation. TRIF deficiency (TRIF(−/−)) increased food intake and bodyweight. The significant increase in bodyweight in TRIF(−/−) mice was discernible as early as 24 weeks of age and sustained thereafter. TRIF(−/−) mice showed impaired glucose tolerance in glucose tolerance tests, but their insulin tolerance tests were similar to those in TRIF(+/+) mice. Although no difference was found in the epididymal adipose mass between the two groups, the percentage of CD206(+) M2 macrophages in epididymal adipose tissue decreased in TRIF(−/−) mice compared with those in TRIF(+/+) mice. Furthermore, activation of epididymal adipose AKT in response to insulin stimulation was remarkably diminished in TRIF(−/−) mice compared with TRIF(+/+) mice. Our results indicate that the TRIF-dependent TLR signaling contributes to maintaining insulin/AKT signaling and M2 macrophages in epididymal adipose tissue under a normal chow diet and provide new evidence that TLR4-targeted therapies for type 2 diabetes require caution.","Yang, Junling; Fukuchi, Ken-Ichiro",Int J Endocrinol,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6942307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33376487/,366

Therefore, in these facilities, there is a high demand in the maintenance of strict hygiene rules. Lately, the new SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation has brought new challenges in the meat industry, as this sector has to maintain its operability to supply the meat and meat products demanded by the consumers. In this challenging period, the safety of the workers is as important as keeping the high demands for the safety of the meat and meat products along with consumer confidence. This paper aims to give an overview of the risks associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission between the workers in slaughterhouses and to evaluate the stability and infectivity in the working environment of these facilities. Considering the persistence of this virus on different surfaces and the environmental conditions affecting its stability (temperature, relative humidity, and natural light), in the study we proposed several short-, medium-, and long-term preventive measures for minimizing the potential threats of the actual pandemic.","Ursachi, Claudiu Ștefan; Munteanu, Florentina-Daniela; Cioca, Gabriela",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807936/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052633,366

We analysed data from regional surveillance networks and the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network, both for human and animal West Nile virus (WNV) infection. During the 2020 season, a total of 77 human cases of WNV infection (median age 65 years; 60% males) were detected in the south-west of Spain; 72 (94%) of these cases developed WNND, presenting as meningoencephalitis, seven of which were fatal. In the previous two decades, only six human cases of WNND were detected in Spain. Reduced activities for vector control this season, together with other factors, might have contributed to the massive increase. Public health measures including vector control, campaigns to raise awareness among physicians and the general population, and interventions to ensure the safety of donations of blood products, organs, cells and tissues were effective to reduce transmission. Going forward, maintenance of vector control activities and an update of the vector-borne diseases response plan in Spain is needed.","García San Miguel Rodríguez-Alarcón, Lucía; Fernández-Martínez, Beatriz; Sierra Moros, María José; Vázquez, Ana; Julián Pachés, Paula; García Villacieros, Elena; Gómez Martín, María Belén; Figuerola Borras, Jordi; Lorusso, Nicola; Ramos Aceitero, Julian Mauro; Moro, Elena; de Celis, Aránzazu; Oyonarte, Salvador; Mahillo, Beatriz; Romero González, Luis José; Sánchez-Seco, María Paz; Suárez Rodríguez, Berta; Ameyugo Catalán, Ulises; Ruiz Contreras, Santiago; Pérez-Olmeda, Mayte; Simón Soria, , Fernando",Euro Surveill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33988123/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2021.26.19.2002010,366

648676,Responding to COVID-19: Resilience in Occupational Therapy.,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Movement disorders are increasingly described in hospitalized and milder cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite a very low prevalence compared to the total patients. METHODS: We reviewed the scientific literature published in English, spanning from the initial descriptions of COVID-19 until January 25, 2021, in the PubMed/MEDLINE database. RESULTS: We identified 93 new-onset movement disorders cases (44 articles) from 200 papers screened in the database or reference lists. Myoclonus was present in 63.4% (n = 59), ataxia in 38.7% (n = 36), action/postural tremor in 10.8% (n = 10), rigid-akinetic syndrome in 5.38% (n = 5), oculomotor abnormalities in 20.4% (n = 19), catatonia in 2.1% (n = 2), dystonia in 1.1% (n = 1), chorea in 1.1% (n = 1), functional (psychogenic) movement disorders in 3.2% (n = 3) of the reported COVID-19 cases with any movement disorder. Encephalopathy was a common association (n = 37, 39.78%). DISCUSSION: Comprehensive neurophysiological, clinical, and neuroimaging descriptions of movement disorders in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still lacking, and their pathophysiology may be related to inflammatory, postinfectious, or even indirect mechanisms not specific to SARS-CoV-2, such as ischemic-hypoxic brain insults, drug effects, sepsis, kidney failure. Cortical/subcortical myoclonus, which the cited secondary mechanisms can largely cause, seems to be the most common hyperkinetic abnormal movement, and it might occur in association with encephalopathy and ataxia. CONCLUSION: This brief review contributes to the clinical description of SARS-CoV-2 potential neurological manifestations, assisting clinical neurologists in identifying features of these uncommon syndromes as a part of COVID-19 symptomatology. HIGHLIGHTS: – Movement disorders are probably uncommon neurological manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 infection; – Myoclonus is the most reported movement disorder associated with COVID-19, its clinical complications or pharmacological management; – The pathophysiology is yet not well-understood but can include systemic inflammation, autoimmune mechanisms, or hypoxia.","Brandão, Pedro Renato P.; Grippe, Talyta C.; Pereira, Danilo A.; Munhoz, Renato P.; Cardoso, Francisco",Tremor and other hyperkinetic movements,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277139/; https://doi.org/10.5334/tohm.595,366

651427,Modifications to Dermatology Residency Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-06-01,"Biosocial Medicine, with its emphasis on the full integration of the person's biology and biography, proposes a strategy for clinical research and the practice of medicine that is transformative for the care of individual patients. In this paper, we argue that Biology is one component of what makes a person unique, but it does not do so alone. Biography, the lived experience of the person, integrates with biology to create a unique signature for each individual and is the foundational concept on which Biosocial Medicine is based. Biosocial Medicine starts with the premise that the individual patient is the focus of clinical care, and that average results for “ideal” patients in population level research cannot substitute for the “real” patient for whom clinical decisions are needed. The paper begins with a description of the case-based method of clinical reasoning, considers the strengths and limitations of Randomized Controlled Trials and Evidence Based Medicine, reviews the increasing focus on precision medicine and then explores the neglected role of biography as part of a new approach to the tailored care of patients. After a review of the analytical challenges in Biosocial Medicine, the paper concludes by linking the physician's commitment to understanding the patient's biography as a critical element in developing trust with the patient.","Horwitz, Ralph I.; Lobitz, Gabriella; Mawn, McKayla; Conroy, Allison Hayes; Cullen, Mark R.; Sim, Ida; Singer, Burton H.",SSM Popul Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34430699/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100863,366

Methods: COVID-19 deaths in all US counties nationwide were analyzed to estimate COVID-19 mortality rate ratios by county-level proportions of Black/Hispanic residents, using mixed-effects Poisson regression. Excess COVID-19 mortality counts, relative to predicted under a counterfactual scenario of no racial/ethnic disparity gradient, were estimated. Results: County-level COVID-19 mortality rates increased monotonically with county-level proportions of Black and Hispanic residents, up to 5.4-fold (≥43% Black) and 11.6-fold (≥55% Hispanic) higher compared to counties with <5% Black and <15% Hispanic residents, respectively, controlling for county-level poverty, age, and urbanization level. Had this disparity gradient not existed, the US COVID-19 death count would have been 92.1% lower (177,672 fewer deaths), making the rate comparable to other high-income countries with substantially lower COVID-19 death counts. Conclusion: During the first 8 months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the US experienced the highest number of COVID-19 deaths. This COVID-19 mortality burden is strongly associated with county-level racial/ethnic diversity, explaining most US COVID-19 deaths.","Im, Cindy; Munasinghe, Lalani L.; Martínez, José M.; Letsou, William; Bagherzadeh-Khiabani, Farideh; Marin, Soudabeh; Yasui, Yutaka",Int J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630005/; https://doi.org/10.3389/ijph.2021.1604004,366

653439,Increase in admissions for anorexia nervosa after lockdown measures: Focus on a children's neuropsychiatry unit.,2021-06-17,"The COVID-19 crisis led to a flurry of clinical trials activity. The COVID-Evidence database shows 2,814 COVID-19 randomized trials registered as of February 16, 2021. Most were small (only 18% have a planned sample size >500) and the rare completed ones have not provided published results promptly (only 283 trial publications as of 2/2021). Small randomized trials and observational, non-randomized analyses have not had a successful track record and have generated misleading expectations. Different large trials on the same intervention have generally been far more efficient in producing timely and consistent evidence. The rapid generation of evidence and accelerated dissemination of results have led to new challenges for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (e.g. rapid, living, and scoping reviews). Pressure to regulatory agencies has also mounted with massive emergency authorizations, but some of them have had to be revoked. Pandemic circumstances have disrupted the way trials are conducted; therefore, new methods have been developed and adopted more widely to facilitate recruitment, consent, and overall trial conduct. Based on the COVID-19 experience and its challenges, planning of several large, efficient trials, and wider use of adaptive designs may change the future of clinical research. Pragmatism, integration in clinical care, efficient administration, promotion of collaborative structures, and enhanced integration of existing data and facilities may be several of the legacies of COVID-19 on future randomized trials.","Janiaud, Perrine; Hemkens, Lars G.; Ioannidis, John P.A.",Can J Cardiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X21002853?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077789/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2021.05.009; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X21002853,366

DESIGN: Two parallel matched cohort studies using linked routinely collected health data. SETTING: England (general practices and hospitals using linked Clinical Practice Research Datalink, Hospital Episode Statistics, and Office of National Statistics) and Denmark (hospitals and community pharmacies using the Danish National Patient, Prescription and Education Registries and the Civil Registration System). PARTICIPANTS: Bereaved people with reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60mL/min/1.73m(2) (England) or hospital-coded chronic kidney disease (Denmark)) and non-bereaved people with reduced kidney function similarly defined, matched on age, sex, general practice (England), and county of residence (Denmark) and followed-up from the bereavement date of the exposed person. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) hospitalization, or death. RESULTS: In people with reduced kidney function, we identified 19,820 (England) and 5,408 (Denmark) bereaved individuals and matched them with 134,828 (England) and 35,741 (Denmark) non-bereaved individuals. Among the bereaved, the rates of hospitalizations (per 1000 person-years) with CVD were 31.7 (95%-CI: 30.5–32.9) in England and 78.8 (95%-CI: 74.9–82.9) in Denmark; the rates of hospitalizations with AKI were 13.2 (95%-CI: 12.5–14.0) in England and 11.2 (95%-CI: 9.9–12.7) in Denmark; and the rates of death were 70.2 (95%-CI: 68.5–72.0) in England and 126.4 (95%-CI: 121.8–131.1) in Denmark. After adjusting for confounders, we found increased rates of CVD (England, HR 1.06 [95%-CI: 1.01–1.12]; Denmark, HR 1.10 [95%-CI: 1.04–1.17]), of AKI (England, HR 1.20 [95%-CI: 1.10–1.31]; Denmark HR 1.36 [95%-CI: 1.17–1.58]), and of death (England, HR 1.10 [95%-CI: 1.05–1.14]; Denmark HR 1.20 [95%-CI: 1.15–1.25]) in bereaved compared with non-bereaved people. CONCLUSIONS: Partner bereavement is associated with an increased rate of CVD and AKI hospitalization, and death in people with reduced kidney function. Additional supportive care for this at-risk population may help prevent serious adverse events.","Bidulka, Patrick; Vestergaard, Søren Viborg; Hlupeni, Admire; Kjærsgaard, Anders; Wong, Angel Y.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we collected data from 121 COVID-19 cases confirmed by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 30, 2019, to March 23, 2020, and conducted statistical analysis. Results: A total of 121 patients were included in our study, the median age was 65 years (IQR, 55.0–71.5 years), and 54.5% cases were men. Among those cases, 52 (43.0%) cases progressed to severe, and 14 (11.6%) died. Overall, the most common manifestations were fever (78.5%) and respiratory symptoms (77.7%), while neurological symptoms were found in only 9.9% of the patients. 70.2% of all the cases had comorbidities, including hypertension (40.5%) and diabetes (20.7%). On admission, cases usually show elevated levels of neutrophils (27.3%), D-dimer (72.6%), Interleukin-6 (35.2%), Interleukin-10 (64.4%), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (82.6%), and lactate dehydrogenase (62.0%), and decreased levels of lymphocytes (66.9%), CD3 cells (67.2%), and CD4 cells (63.0%). The proportional hazard Cox models showed that the risk factors for severity progression and death included comorbidities (HR: 4.53, 95% CI: 1.78–11.55 and HR: 7.81, 95% CI: 1.02–59.86), leukocytosis (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.05–1.22 and HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.10–1.42), neutrophilia (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.07–1.13 and HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.13–1.46, and elevated LDH (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.12–1.15 and HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.10–1.12). Elevated D-dimer (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03), IL-6 (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00–1.02) and IL-10 levels (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07) were also risk factors for the progression of disease severity. Meanwhile, lymphopenia and wake immune responses [e.g., lower CD3, CD4, or CD19 counts (all HR < 1)] were associated with disease deterioration and death. Conclusions: Severe cases and death of COVID-19 are associated with older age, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, lymphopenia, high cytokines, and weak immune responses.","Zou, Li; Dai, Lijun; Zhang, Yangyang; Fu, Wenning; Gao, Yan; Zhang, Zhaohui; Zhang, Zhentao",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00532; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32903644/,366

The aim of this study was to determine if PEDV can be shed in semen from SPF (specific pathogens free) boars infected by a French S-InDel PEDV strain (PEDV/FR/001/2014) and in case of positive semen to determine the infectivity of that semen. Both infected boars had diarrhea after inoculation and shed virus in feces. PEDV genome was also detected by RT-qPCR in the sperm-rich fraction of semen (6.94 × 10(3) and 4.73 × 10(3) genomic copies/mL) from the two boars infected with the S-InDel PEDV strain but only once at 7DPI. In addition, PEDV RNA in Peyer’s patches and in mesenteric lymph nodes was also present for the two inoculated boars. The PEDV positive semen (S-non-InDel and S-InDel) sampled during a previous trial and in this boar trial were inoculated to six SPF weaned pigs. The inoculated piglets did not seroconvert and did not shed virus throughout the duration of the study except for one pig at 18 DPI. But, PEDV could be detected in intestinal tissues such as duodenum, jejunum and jejunum Peyer’s patches by RT-qPCR except for one pig.

656513,Care of the critically ill patient,2020-12-16,"A polymorphism in the LZTFL1 gene located in the chemokine-receptor gene cluster (chromosome 3p) has been associated with the risk of developing COVID-19. The chemokine receptor-5 (CCR5) maps to this region, and the common 32 bp deletion variant ({Delta}32) has been associated with the extent of inflammatory disease and the outcome in several viral diseases. Several studies have also suggested that the pharmacological targeting of CCR5 could reduce the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19. We sought to investigate whether this polymorphism was associated with the risk of moderate-severe COVID-19. We genotyped 294 patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19 (85 were severe cases) and 460 controls. We found a significantly lower frequency of CCR5-{Delta}32 among the COVID-19 patients (0.10 vs 0.18 in controls; p=0.002, OR=0.48, 95%CI=0.29-0.76). The difference was mainly due to the reduced frequency of CCR5-{Delta}32 carriers in the severe, significantly lower than in the non-severe patients (p=0.036). Of note, we did not find deletion-homozygotes among the patients compared to 1% among controls. We also confirmed the association between a LZTFL1 variant and COVID-19. Our study points to CCR5 as a promising target for treatment of COVID-19, but requires validation in additional large cohorts. In confirmed by others, the genetic analysis of CCR5-variants (such as {Delta}32) might help to identify patients with a higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19.","GOMEZ, J.; CUESTA-LLAVONA, E.; ALBAICETA, G.

The objective of this study was to examine the global association between lifestyle-related factors and COVID-19 mortality using data from each individual country. METHODS: The association between prevalence of seven lifestyle-related factors (overweight, insufficient physical activity, smoking, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and age over 65) and COVID-19 mortality was assessed by linear and multivariable regression among 186 countries. The cumulative effect of lifestyle-related factors on COVID-19 mortality was assessed by dividing countries into four categories according to the number of lifestyle-related factors in the upper half range and comparing the mean mortality between groups. RESULTS: In linear regression, COVID-19 mortality was significantly associated with overweight, insufficient physical activity, hyperlipidaemia, and age ≥65. In multivariable regression, overweight and age ≥65 demonstrated significant association with COVID-19 mortality (p = .0039, .0094). Countries with more risk factors demonstrated greater COVID-19 mortality (P for trend <.001). CONCLUSION: Lifestyle-related factors, especially overweight and elderly population, were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality on a global scale.

We consider preventive measures such as implementation of social distancing and lockdown in a city, as well as the effect of protective gears or practices. The chance of travelling to another city and within the city during lockdown, and initial percentage of exposed and infected individuals on both cities influence the increase in the number of newly-infected individuals on both models. Our simulations show that (i) increase in exposed individuals results in increase in number of new infections, hence the need for increased testing-isolation efforts; (ii) protection level of 75-100% effectiveness impedes disease transmission; (iii) travelling within city or to other city can be an option given that strict preventive measures (e.g., non-pharmaceutical interventions) are observed; and (iv) the ideal set-up for neighboring cities is to implement lockdown when there is high risk of disease local transmission while individuals observe social distancing, maximizing protective measures, and isolating those that are exposed. The results of the agent-based and compartmental models show similar qualitative dynamics; the differences are due to different spatio-temporal heterogeneity and stochasticity.

OBJECTIVE: To study the diagnostic modalities used in the evaluation and management of drug allergy/drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) among member societies of the Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (APAAACI). METHODS: A questionnaire comprising 41 questions was circulated electronically to member societies and individual members of APAAACI between January 23, 2020 and March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty-six respondents from 15 member societies and 1 individual member responded. European DHR guidelines were most commonly used. Skin prick and intradermal testing was used by 100%, with only 60% having access to commercial penicillin skin test reagents. In vitro-speciﬁc IgE tests were used by 75%, and basophil activation test by 56.3% for immediate DHR. Patch tests were used by 75% in contrast to lymphocyte transformation tests by 25% for nonimmediate DHR. Drug provocation tests were used by 68.8%, the most common indication being to exclude hypersensitivity where history/symptoms were not suggestive of drug hypersensitivity/allergy (93.3%). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype testing was mandatory among 25% respondents before new carbamazepine prescriptions, and 8.3% for allopurinol prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: There was increased use of skin testing for iodinated contrast media hypersensitivity and patch testing for nonimmediate DHR. HLA genotype testing prior to new carbamazepine, allopurinol and abacavir prescriptions remain variable despite strong associations for severe cutaneous adverse reactions with Asian ethnicity. Results of this survey form a useful framework for developing educational and training needs and for improving access to drug allergy diagnostic and treatment modalities across APAAACI member societies.","Tang, Min-Moon; Fok, Jie Shen; Thong, Bernard Yu-Hor; Yun, James; Li, Philip Hei; Kang, Hye-Ryun; Thien, Francis; Yamaguchi, Masao; Lucas, Michaela; Chang, Yoon-Seok; Kim, Byung-Keun; Nagao, Mizuho; Rengganis, Iris; Tsai, Yi-Giien; Chung, Wen-Hung; Rerkpattanapipat, Ticha; Kamchaisatian, Wasu; Leung, Ting Fan; Ho, Joo-Yoon; Zhang, Luo; Latiff, Amir Hamzah Abdul; Fujisawa, Takao; Castells, Mariana C; Demoly, Pascal; Wang, Jiu Yao; Pawankar, Ruby",Asia Pac Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178561/; https://doi.org/10.5415/apallergy.2020.10.e36,366

It is imperative to investigate whether the cases with re-detectable positive (RP) SARS-CoV-2 might cause severe infection to the vulnerable population. In this work, we conducted a systematic review of recent literature to investigate reactivation and reinfection among the discharged COVID-19 patients that are found positive again. Our study, consisting more than a total of 113,715 patients, indicates that the RP-SARS-CoV-2 scenario occurs plausibly due to reactivation, reinfection, viral shedding, or testing errors. Nonetheless, we observe that previously infected individuals have significantly lower risk of being infected for the second time, indicating that reactivation or reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 likely have relatively less impact in the general population than the primary infection.","Tang, Xiujuan; Musa, Salihu S.; Zhao, Shi; He, Daihai",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.663045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178920/,366
659682,Lessons Learned in Preventing COVID-19 within a Skilled Nursing Facility during the Early Pandemic,2021-09-20,"The role of viruses in Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) needs further elucidation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of viral pathogens in AECOPD. Patients presenting to the Emergency Room with AECOPD needing hospitalization were recruited. Oropharyngeal and sputum samples were collected in order to perform microarrays-based viral testing for the detection of respiratory viruses. A total of 200 (100%) patients were analyzed and from them in 107 (53.5%) a virus was detected. The commonest identified viruses were the human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (subtypes A and B) (40.5%), influenza virus (subtypes A, B, C) (11%), rhinovirus (8%) and human Parainfluenza Virus (subtypes A and B) (7.5%). A bacterial pathogen was isolated in 27 (14%) patients and a dual infection due to a bacterial and a viral pathogen was recognised in 14/107 patients. Patients with AECOPD and a viral infection had a lengthier hospital stay (9.2 ± 4.6 vs 7.6 ± 4.3, p < 0.01) while the severity of the disease was no related with significant differences among the groups of the study population. In conclusion, the isolation of a virus was strongly associated with AECOPD in the examined population. The stage of COPD appeared to have no relation with the frequency of the isolated viruses while dual infection with a viral and a bacterial pathogen was not rare.","Dimopoulos, G.; Lerikou, M.; Tsiodras, S.; Chranioti, Aik; Perros, E.; Anagnostopoulou, U.; Armaganidis, A.; Karakitsos, P.",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553911001428; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553911001428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983132/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2011.08.004,366

Methods: This retrospective multicenter analysis focuses on patients affected by renal bleedings detected by contrast-enhanced CT and treated with superselective endovascular embolization. CT findings were compared to DSA. Embolization procedural data were analyzed and renal function was evaluated before and after the intervention. Results: Twenty-seven patients were retrospectively evaluated in one year. Compared to DSA, CT showed 96.3% diagnostic accuracy in terms of hemorrhage recognition; concerning the type of vascular lesion, there was discrepancy between CT and DSA in five cases. The technical success rate of embolization was 100%, while primary clinical success was 88.9%. The inferior parenchymal third was the most frequent site of renal injury. Microcoils were the most adopted embolics. Renal function did not change significantly before and after embolization. Conclusions: CT has elevated diagnostic accuracy in detecting post-traumatic intraparenchymal renal hemorrhages; in a small percentage, the type of vascular lesion may differ from the findings observed at DSA. In this scenario, superselective embolization presents high clinical success with a low complication rate.","Giurazza, Francesco; Contegiacomo, Andrea; Corvino, Fabio; Rebonato, Alberto; Castiglione, Davide; Palmucci, Stefano; Niola, Raffaella; Basile, Antonio",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359339/; https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11071256,366
661060,COVID-19 Outbreak in International Airport – Where the Incidence Case Occurs?,2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND: There is mounting evidence on the existence of a Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome-temporally associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS), sharing similarities with Kawasaki Disease (KD). The main outcome of the study were to better characterize the clinical features and the treatment response of PIMS-TS and to explore its relationship with KD determining whether KD and PIMS are two distinct entities. METHODS: The Rheumatology Study Group of the Italian Pediatric Society launched a survey to enroll patients diagnosed with KD (Kawasaki Disease Group – KDG) or KD-like (Kawacovid Group - KCG) disease between February 1st 2020, and May 31st 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, treatment information, and patients’ outcome were collected in an online anonymized database (RedCAP®). Relationship between clinical presentation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was also taken into account. Moreover, clinical characteristics of KDG during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (KDG-CoV2) were compared to Kawasaki Disease patients (KDG-Historical) seen in three different Italian tertiary pediatric hospitals (Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS “Burlo Garofolo”, Trieste; AOU Meyer, Florence; IRCCS Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa) from January 1st 2000 to December 31st 2019. Chi square test or exact Fisher test and non-parametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test were used to study differences between two groups. RESULTS: One-hundred-forty-nine cases were enrolled, (96 KDG and 53 KCG). KCG children were significantly older and presented more frequently from gastrointestinal and respiratory involvement. Cardiac involvement was more common in KCG, with 60,4% of patients with myocarditis. 37,8% of patients among KCG presented hypotension/non-cardiogenic shock. Coronary artery abnormalities (CAA) were more common in the KDG. The risk of ICU admission were higher in KCG. Lymphopenia, higher CRP levels, elevated ferritin and troponin-T characterized KCG. KDG received more frequently immunoglobulins (IVIG) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (81,3% vs 66%; p = 0.04 and 71,9% vs 43,4%; p = 0.001 respectively) as KCG more often received glucocorticoids (56,6% vs 14,6%; p < 0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 assay more often resulted positive in KCG than in KDG (75,5% vs 20%; p < 0.0001). Short-term follow data showed minor complications. Comparing KDG with a KD-Historical Italian cohort (598 patients), no statistical difference was found in terms of clinical manifestations and laboratory data. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection might determine two distinct inflammatory diseases in children: KD and PIMS-TS. Older age at onset and clinical peculiarities like the occurrence of myocarditis characterize this multi-inflammatory syndrome. Our patients had an optimal response to treatments and a good outcome, with few complications and no deaths.

Several countries in South-east Asia have already developed their national pandemic preparedness plans. However, these plans have focused on surveillance for and response to the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1), including the rapid containment of H5N1. The newly emerged pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is different from H5N1 in terms of severity and requires different approaches. There are several factors that can potentially affect the severity of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, including a population's vulnerability and response capacity. The pattern of severity appears to be changing with the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which can be conceptualized in a step-wise manner based on observation of the current situation. The overall impact of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 remains unknown and it is difficult to assess its severity.

However, only about 75% of people in Canada plan to receive one of the vaccines. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine the reasons why people in Canada feel hesitant toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: We screened 3915 tweets from public Twitter profiles in Canada by using the search words “vaccine” and “COVID.” The tweets that met the inclusion criteria (ie, those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy) were coded via content analysis. Codes were then organized into themes and interpreted by using the Theoretical Domains Framework. RESULTS: Overall, 605 tweets were identified as those about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy stemmed from the following themes: concerns over safety, suspicion about political or economic forces driving the COVID-19 pandemic or vaccine development, a lack of knowledge about the vaccine, antivaccine or confusing messages from authority figures, and a lack of legal liability from vaccine companies. This study also examined mistrust toward the medical industry not due to hesitancy, but due to the legacy of communities marginalized by health care institutions. These themes were categorized into the following five Theoretical Domains Framework constructs: knowledge, beliefs about consequences, environmental context and resources, social influence, and emotion. CONCLUSIONS: With the World Health Organization stating that one of the worst threats to global health is vaccine hesitancy, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind this reluctance. By using a behavioral science framework, this study adds to the emerging knowledge about vaccine hesitancy in relation to COVID-19 vaccines by analyzing public discourse in tweets in real time.

While efforts have been devoted to curtailing the disease, a major concern has been its potential effects on the delivery and utilization of reproductive health care services in the country. The objective of the study was to investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns had affected the provision of essential reproductive, maternal, child, and adolescent health (RMCAH) services in primary health care facilities across the Nigerian States. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 307 primary health centres (PHCs) in 30 Local Government Areas in 10 States, representing the six geopolitical regions of the country. A semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain data on issues relating to access and provision of RMCAH services before, during and after COVID-19 lockdowns from the head nurses/midwives in the facilities. The questionnaire was entered into Open Data Kit mounted on smartphones. Data were analysed using frequency and percentage, summary statistics, and Kruskal–Wallis test. RESULTS: Between 76 and 97% of the PHCS offered RMCAH services before the lockdown. Except in antenatal, delivery and adolescent care, there was a decline of between 2 and 6% in all the services during the lockdown and up to 10% decline after the lockdown with variation across and within States. During the lockdown. Full-service delivery was reported by 75.2% whereas 24.8% delivered partial services. There was a significant reduction in clients’ utilization of the services during the lockdown, and the difference between States before the pandemic, during, and after the lockdown. Reported difficulties during the lockdown included stock-out of drugs (25.7%), stock-out of contraceptives (25.1%), harassment by the law enforcement agents (76.9%), and transportation difficulties (55.8%). Only 2% of the PHCs reported the availability of gowns, 18% had gloves, 90.1% had hand sanitizers, and a temperature checker was available in 94.1%. Slightly above 10% identified clients with symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The large proportion of PHCs who provided RMCAH services despite the lockdown demonstrates resilience. Considering the several difficulties reported, and the limited provision of primary protective equipment more effort by the government and non-governmental agencies is recommended to strengthen delivery of sexual and reproductive health in primary health centres in Nigeria during the pandemic.

665010,Patient satisfaction with telemedicine in rhinology during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-01-09,"PURPOSE: This study investigated why some clinicians switched growth hormone (GH) brands in pediatric patients with GH-related disorders to Norditropin(®) since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the clinicians’ perceptions of the results, and whether observations from this period of disruption could inform clinical practice in the future. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinicians (N=106) from the UK, France, Italy, and Japan who had switched at least one patient to Norditropin(®) from a GH therapy manufactured by a different pharmaceutical company between February and November 2020 participated. They completed an online survey and submitted patient report forms for up to three switched patients. RESULTS: Since the start of COVID-19, 39–54% of the reported consultations were virtual (ie, via telephone or online means) in the UK, France, and Italy. Overall, 17% of patients seen by respondents in the survey were switched to a different GH brand; approximately two-thirds of switches were to Norditropin(®). Clinicians’ top considerations in choosing a GH brand were patient/carer feedback, patient support programs, and the need for easy-to-use therapies in the context of virtual consultations. The top reasons for switching patients to Norditropin(®) included ease of use, device features and benefits, better patient/carer feedback, and ease of training in device use via virtual consultations. Norditropin(®) was considered suitable for use in virtual or in-person consultations or a mixture of both. Based on patient/carer feedback, 66% of clinicians believed that patients preferred Norditropin(®) to their previous therapy in terms of overall satisfaction. CONCLUSION: In this survey, key considerations in prescribing GH therapy were ease of use and acceptability to patients and carers. If virtual consultations increasingly replace in-person ones, ease in training patients/carers in device use will be particularly important. A majority of clinicians considered that their patients preferred Norditropin(®) to their previous therapy.","Blair, Joanne; Warth, Kelly; Suvarna, Yashasvi; Cappa, Marco",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s325914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584405/,366
666168,Family Caregiving for Acute-Critically Ill Older Adults in the Time of COVID-19,2020-10-21,"The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and the other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources. However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging. Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake.","Li, Qian; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong",Math Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556420300638?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425244/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556420300638,366

This analysis compared duration of RV shedding as detected by culture and PCR among patients in a high-risk oncology setting (adult patients with haematological malignancy and/or stem cell transplant and all paediatric oncology patients) and determined risk factors for extended shedding. RV infections due to influenza virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from two study periods—January 2009–September 2011 (culture-based testing) and September 2011–April 2013 (PCR-based testing)—were reviewed retrospectively. Data were collected from patients in whom re-testing for viral clearance was carried out within 5–30 days after the most recent test. During the study period 456 patients were diagnosed with RV infection, 265 by PCR and 191 by culture. The median range for duration of shedding (days) by culture and PCR, respectively, were as follows—influenza virus: 13 days (5–38 days) versus 14 days (5–58 days), p 0.5; RSV: 11 days (5–35 days) versus 16 days (5–50 days), p 0.001; PIV: 9 days (5–41 days) versus 17 days (5–45 days), p ≤0.0001; HMPV 10.5 days (5–29 days) versus 14 days (5–42 days), p 0.2. In multivariable analysis, age and underlying disease or transplant were not independently associated with extended shedding regardless of testing method. In high-risk oncology settings for respiratory illness due to RSV and PIV, the virus is detectable by PCR for a longer period of time than by culture and extended shedding is observed.","Richardson, L.; Brite, J.; Del Castillo, M.; Childers, T.; Sheahan, A.; Huang, Y-T.; Dougherty, E.; Babady, NE.; Sepkowitz, K.; Kamboj, M.",Clinical Microbiology and Infection,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15010381; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X15010381; http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198743X15010381/pdf; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2015.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711433/,366

Then by the pairwise comparison of the numbers of mutation sites among all SARS-CoV-2s, the least mutated clade was identified, which is the basal clade under parsimony principle. In our first analysis, we used 168 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/04) to identify the basal clade which contains 33 identical viral sequences from seven countries. To our surprise, in our second analysis with 367 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (GISAID dataset till 2020/03/17), the basal clade has 51 viral sequences, 18 more sequences added. The much larger NCBI dataset shows that this clade has expanded with 85 unique sequences by 2020/04/04. The expanding basal clade tells a chilling fact that the least mutated SARS-CoV-2 sequence was replicating and spreading for at least four months. It is known that coronaviruses have the RNA proofreading capability to ensure their genome replication fidelity. Interestingly, we found that the SARS-CoV-2 without its nonstructural proteins 13 to 16 (Nsp13-Nsp16) exhibits an unusually high mutation rate. Our result suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has an unprecedented RNA proofreading capability which can intactly preserve its genome even after a long period of transmission. Our selection analyses also indicate that the positive selection event enabling SARS-CoV-2 to cross species and adapt to human hosts might have been achieved before its outbreak.","Shen, Libing; Zhang, Zhao; He, Funan",Mol Phylogenet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242581/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105579032030289X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2020.107017; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S105579032030289X,366
667124,Innovative educational approaches to house calls in the time of COVID‐19,2021-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction and a major healthcare burden worldwide. Although sepsis is a medical emergency that requires immediate management, screening for the occurrence of sepsis is difficult. Herein, we propose a deep learning-based model (DLM) for screening sepsis using electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 46,017 patients who were admitted to two hospitals. A total of 1,548 and 639 patients had sepsis and septic shock, respectively. The DLM was developed using 73,727 ECGs from 18,142 patients, and internal validation was conducted using 7774 ECGs from 7,774 patients. Furthermore, we conducted an external validation with 20,101 ECGs from 20,101 patients from another hospital to verify the applicability of the DLM across centers. RESULTS: During the internal and external validations, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the DLM using 12-lead ECG was 0.901 (95% confidence interval, 0.882–0.920) and 0.863 (0.846–0.879), respectively, for screening sepsis and 0.906 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.877–0.936) and 0.899 (95% CI, 0.872–0.925), respectively, for detecting septic shock. The AUC of the DLM for detecting sepsis using 6-lead and single-lead ECGs was 0.845–0.882. A sensitivity map revealed that the QRS complex and T waves were associated with sepsis. Subgroup analysis was conducted using ECGs from 4,609 patients who were admitted with an infectious disease, and the AUC of the DLM for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.817 (0.793–0.840). There was a significant difference in the prediction score of DLM using ECG according to the presence of infection in the validation dataset (0.277 vs. 0.574, p < 0.001), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (0.260 vs. 0.725, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: The DLM delivered reasonable performance for sepsis screening using 12-, 6-, and single-lead ECGs. The results suggest that sepsis can be screened using not only conventional ECG devices but also diverse life-type ECG machines employing the DLM, thereby preventing irreversible disease progression and mortality.","Kwon, Joon-myoung; Lee, Ye Rang; Jung, Min-Seung; Lee, Yoon-Ji; Jo, Yong-Yeon; Kang, Da-Young; Lee, Soo Youn; Cho, Yong-Hyeon; Shin, Jae-Hyun; Ban, Jang-Hyeon; Kim, Kyung-Hee",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-021-00953-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602084/,366

METHODS: This is a mixed method exploratory survey. A questionnaire exploring expectations of doctors from administration and seniors as well as their fears while working during pandemic, was developed on Google survey Forms. It included eight closed ended questions and four open ended questions. Data was collected through online Google survey Forms during month of March and April 2020. Doctors were approached through email and WhatsApp group. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 33.58±4.21 years. Female 150(67.5%) and Male 72(32.4%) participated. 29(13.1%) Associate Professor, 34(15.3%) Assistant Professor, 56(25.2%) Senior Residents and 103(46.3%) residents, medical officers and house officers responded to the survey. 134(60.3%) doctors were working in hospitals which were not dealing with Covid-19. Fear included, infecting family members 177(79.7%), rapid spread of disease 140(63%), complications of disease 134(60.3%), becoming a carrier in 64(28.8%) and 62(27.9%) feared missing the diagnosis. More than 80% expected from seniors and administration, of providing PPE, facilitation, continue chain of supply of essential items, ensuring doctor safety, avoiding exposure of all doctors and keeping reserve workforce, limiting routine checkups, avoid panic and 20% had no expectations. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that doctors had their fears and perceptions regarding pandemic which need to be addressed while policy making. They fear wellbeing of their families and contacting Covid-19, if not provided proper PPE. Our study provides insight of expectations, fears and perceptions of our frontline which invariably gives insight of the views of healthcare workers.","Urooj, Uzma; Ansari, Asma; Siraj, Asifa; Khan, Sumaira; Tariq, Humaira",Pak J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.36.covid19-s4.2643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32582312/,366

Currently, the World Health Organization recommends artemisinin-based combination therapy as the first-line treatment for multi-drug-resistant malaria. Due to the various research articles on the use of antimalarial drugs to treat coronaviruses, a question is raised: do A. annua and its compounds provide anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) properties. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed articles that investigated the antiviral effects and mechanisms of A. annua and its phytochemicals against SARS-CoVs. Particularly, articles that studied the herb’s role in inhibiting the coronavirus-host proteins were favored. Nineteen studies were retrieved. From these, fourteen in silico molecular docking studies demonstrated potential inhibitory properties of artemisinins against coronavirus-host proteins, including 3CL(PRO), S protein, N protein, E protein, cathepsin-L, helicase protein, nsp3, nsp10, nsp14, nsp15, and GRP78 receptor. Collectively, A. annua constituents may impede the SARS-CoV-2 attachment, membrane fusion, and internalization into the host cells, and hinder the viral replication and transcription process. This is the first comprehensive overview of the application of compounds from A. annua against SARS-CoV-2/coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) describing all target proteins. A. annua’s biological properties, the signaling pathways implicated in the COVID-19, and the advantages and disadvantages for repurposing of A. annua compounds are discussed. The combination of A. annua’s biological properties, action on different signaling pathways and target proteins, and a multi-drug combined-therapy approach may synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and assist in the COVID-19 treatment. Also, A. annua may modulate the host immune response to better fight the infection.","Fuzimoto, Andréa D.",J Integr Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2021.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34479848/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095496421000637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095496421000637?v=s5,366

This interconnectivity is a key enabler of accessibility; on the other hand, it results in vulnerability, i.e. reduced performance, in case any specific part is subject to disruptions. We analyse how railway systems are vulnerable to delay, and how delays propagate in railway networks, studying real-life delay propagation phenomena on empirical data, determining real-life impact and delay propagation for the uncommon case of railway disruptions. We take a unique approach by looking at the same system, in two different operating conditions, to disentangle processes and dynamics that are normally present and co-occurring in railway operations. We exploit the unique chance to observe a systematic change in railway operations conditions, without a correspondent system change of infrastructure or timetable, coming from the occurrence of the large-scale disruption at Rastatt, Germany, in 2017. We define new statistical methods able to detect weak signals in the noisy dataset of recorded punctuality for passenger traffic in Switzerland, in the disrupted and undisrupted state, along a period of 1 year. We determine how delay propagation changed, and quantify the heterogeneous, large-scale cascading effects of the Rastatt disruption towards the Swiss network, hundreds of kilometers away. Operational measures of transport performance (i.e. punctuality and delays), while globally being very decreased, had a statistically relevant positive increase (though very geographically heterogeneous) on the Swiss passenger traffic during the disruption period. We identify two factors for this: (1) the reduced delay propagation at an international scale; and (2) to a minor extent, rerouted railway freight traffic; which show to combine linearly in the observed outcomes.","Büchel, Beda; Spanninger, Thomas; Corman, Francesco",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33122669/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75538-z,366

669402,Has the COVID 19 Virus Changed Adherence to Hand Washing among Healthcare Workers?,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: There is an international interest in whether improved primary care can lead to a more rational use of health resources. There is evidence that educational interventions can lead to improvements in the quality of rational prescribing and test ordering. A new national platform for shared medical records in Australia, My Health Record (MHR), poses new opportunities and challenges for system-wide implementation. This trial (CHIME-GP) will investigate whether components of a multifaceted education intervention in an Australian general practice setting on rational prescribing and investigation ordering leads to reductions in health-service utilisation and costs in the context of the use of a national digital health record system. METHODS: The trial will be undertaken in Australian general practices. The aim of the research is to evaluate the effectiveness of components of a web-based educational intervention for general practitioners, regarding rational use of medicines, pathology and imaging in the context of the use of the MHR system. Our target is to recruit 120 general practitioners from urban and regional regions across Australia. We will use a mixed methods approach incorporating a three-arm pragmatic cluster randomised parallel trial and a prospective qualitative inquiry. The effect of each education component in each arm will be assessed, using the other two arms as controls. The evaluation will synthesise the results embedding qualitative pre/post interviews in the quantitative results to investigate implementation of the intervention, clinical behaviour change and mechanisms such as attitudes, that may influence change. The primary outcome will be an economic analysis of the cost per 100 consultations of selected prescriptions, pathology and radiology test ordering in the 6 months following the intervention compared with 6 months prior to the intervention. Secondary outcome measures include the rates per 100 consultations of selected prescriptions, pathology and radiology test ordering 6 months pre- and post-intervention, and comparison of knowledge assessment tests pre- and post-intervention. DISCUSSION: The trial will produce robust health economic analyses on the evidence on educational intervention in reducing unnecessary prescribing, pathology and imaging ordering, in the context of MHR. In addition, the study will contribute to the evidence-base concerning the implementation of interventions to improve the quality of care in primary care practice.

Seasonal variation driven by responses to changing environment has been shown to affect the transmission intensity of several coronaviruses. However, the impact of the environment on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains largely unknown, and thus seasonal variation remains a source of uncertainty in forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we address this issue by assessing the association of temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation, and population density with estimates of transmission rate (R). Using data from the United States, we explore correlates of transmission across US states using comparative regression and integrative epidemiological modeling. We find that policy intervention (“lockdown”) and reductions in individuals’ mobility are the major predictors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates, but, in their absence, lower temperatures and higher population densities are correlated with increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that summer weather cannot be considered a substitute for mitigation policies, but that lower autumn and winter temperatures may lead to an increase in transmission intensity in the absence of policy interventions or behavioral changes. We outline how this information may improve the forecasting of COVID-19, reveal its future seasonal dynamics, and inform intervention policies.","Smith, Thomas P.; Flaxman, Seth; Gallinat, Amanda S.; Kinosian, Sylvia P.; Stemkovski, Michael; Unwin, H.

In contrast to these advancements, the development of human disease models is still in its infancy. Although major advances have recently been made, efforts still need to be intensified. Human disease models have proven valuable for their ability to closely mimic disease patterns in vitro, permitting the study of pathophysiological features and new treatment options. Although animal studies remain the gold standard for preclinical testing, they have major drawbacks such as high cost and ongoing controversy over their predictive value for several human conditions. Moreover, there is growing political and social pressure to develop alternatives to animal models, clearly promoting the search for valid, cost-efficient and easy-to-handle systems lacking interspecies-related differences.

673601,Effect of Increased Alcohol Consumption During COVID-19 Pandemic on Alcohol-related Liver Disease: A Modelling Study,2021-03-20,"BACKGROUND: In 2008 a nosocomial outbreak of five cases of viral hemorrhagic fever due to a novel arenavirus, Lujo virus, occurred in Johannesburg, South Africa. Lujo virus is only the second pathogenic arenavirus, after Lassa virus, to be recognized in Africa and the first in over 40 years. Because of the remote, resource-poor, and often politically unstable regions where Lassa fever and other viral hemorrhagic fevers typically occur, there have been few opportunities to undertake in-depth study of their clinical manifestations, transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, or response to treatment options typically available in industrialized countries. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We describe the clinical features of five cases of Lujo hemorrhagic fever and summarize their clinical management, as well as providing additional epidemiologic detail regarding the 2008 outbreak. Illness typically began with the abrupt onset of fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias followed successively by sore throat, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, minor hemorrhage, subconjunctival injection, and neck and facial swelling over the first week of illness. No major hemorrhage was noted. Neurological signs were sometimes seen in the late stages. Shock and multi-organ system failure, often with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, ensued in the second week, with death in four of the five cases. Distinctive treatment components of the one surviving patient included rapid commencement of the antiviral drug ribavirin and administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), N-acetylcysteine, and recombinant factor VIIa. CONCLUSIONS: Lujo virus causes a clinical syndrome remarkably similar to Lassa fever. Considering the high case-fatality and significant logistical impediments to controlled treatment efficacy trials for viral hemorrhagic fever, it is both logical and ethical to explore the use of the various compounds used in the treatment of the surviving case reported here in future outbreaks. Clinical observations should be systematically recorded to facilitate objective evaluation of treatment efficacy. Due to the risk of secondary transmission, viral hemorrhagic fever precautions should be implemented for all cases of Lujo virus infection, with specialized precautions to protect against aerosols when performing enhanced-risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation.","Sewlall, Nivesh H.; Richards, Guy; Duse, Adriano; Swanepoel, Robert; Paweska, Janusz; Blumberg, Lucille; Dinh, Thu Ha; Bausch, Daniel",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393244/,366

Previous studies have investigated the relationship of air pollutant levels and meteorological factors with respiratory disease risk and hospital admission rates. However, associations between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors with COVID-19 infection have been equivocal. This study aimed to assess the association between core air pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore. Data on air pollutant levels (particulate matter [PM(2.5), PM(10)], ozone [O(3)], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO(2)], sulphur dioxide [SO(2)], pollutant standard index [PSI]) and meteorological factors (rainfall, humidity, temperature) was obtained from the Singapore National Environmental Agency (NEA) from 23 January 2020 to 6 April 2020. The daily reported COVID-19 case numbers were retrieved from the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH). Generalized linear models with Poisson family distribution and log-link were used to estimate the model coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for the association between air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors (8-day and 15-day moving averages (MA)) with COVID-19 case numbers, adjusting for humidity, rainfall and day of week.

Therefore, this Meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the outcome in patients who take PPIs. Methods: We carried out a systematic search to identify potential studies until November 2020. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I-squared statistic. Odds ratios (ORs) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by fixed-effects or random-effects models according to the heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses and tests for publication bias were also performed. Results: Eight articles with more than 268,683 subjects were included. PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95%CI = 0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11).

This study examined the prevalence of and temporal changes in CPD, its early and follow-up predictors and the extent to which it was predictive of mental health problems. METHODS: The study took a two-wave design approach and was conducted during and 3-4 months after the nationwide lockdown in France. Baseline participants were 1,123 (79.5% women; M age = 33.82; range: 18-80). They completed validated measures assessing CPD, posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Descriptive, correlational, and path model analyses were used. FINDINGS: Both baseline and follow-up groups presented similar psychosocial profiles. Overall, 35.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 32.7-38.4) baseline participants and 17.2% (95% CI: 12.6-22.7) follow-up participants developed clinical cases of CPD. The baseline CPD levels predicted 14 to 20% of the variances of PTS (b = 0.55), depression (b = 0.16) and anxiety symptoms (b = 0.16). After accounting for the effect of the baseline CPD levels, the current CPD levels predicted the three investigated mental health outcomes in high proportions (43 to 47%). Further findings revealed important temporal changes in baseline predictors of CPD. However, the chronic CPD and PTS symptoms were prevalent among students and individuals developing worries about the COVID-19 crisis while depression and anxiety symptoms were prevalent among single people and those with pre-existing mental health problems. LIMITATIONS: Data from self-report measures of mental health were used. The dropout rate between the two time assessments was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS: These longitudinal findings call for clinical efforts in assessment of and intervention in trauma-related distress.

To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.","Sungnak, Waradon; Huang, Ni; Bécavin, Christophe; Berg, Marijn",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550242/,366

They can be identified from combinatorial libraries of DNA or RNA oligonucleotides by SELEX technology, an in vitro iterative selection procedure consisting of binding (capture), partitioning and amplification steps. Remarkably, many of the aptamers selected against biologically relevant protein targets are G-rich sequences that can fold into stable G-quadruplex (G4) structures. Aiming at disseminating novel inspiring ideas within the scientific community in the field of G4-structures, the emphasis of this review is placed on: 1) recent advancements in SELEX technology for the efficient and rapid identification of new candidate aptamers (introduction of microfluidic systems and next generation sequencing); 2) recurrence of G4 structures in aptamers selected by SELEX against biologically relevant protein targets; 3) discovery of several G4-forming motifs in important regulatory regions of the human or viral genome bound by endogenous proteins, which per se can result into potential aptamers; 4) an updated overview of G4-based aptamers with therapeutic potential and 5) a discussion on the most attractive G4-based aptamers for diagnostic applications.

However, the use of different testing methods under various heat-inactivation conditions might affect the COVID-19 detection results. Methods: Seven different antibody detection kits produced by four manufacturers for detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and total antibody were tested at Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, China. Most of the kits used the indirect immunity, capture, and double-antigen sandwich methods. The effects of various heat-inactivation conditions on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, IgM, and total antibody detection were analyzed for the different test methods. Results: Using the indirect immunity method, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody significantly increased and those for IgM antibody decreased with increasing temperature of heat-inactivation using indirect immunity method. However, values for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and total antibody showed no change when the capture and double-antigen sandwich methods were used. The changes in IgG and IgM antibody values with the indirect immunity method indicated that heat-inactivation could affect COVID-19 detection results obtained using this method. In particular, 18 (22.2%) SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive samples were detected as negative with heat-inactivation at 65°C for 30 min, and one (25%) IgG negative sample was detected as positive after heat-inactivation at 56°C for 60 min and 60°C for 30 min. Conclusions: Heat-inactivation could increase SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody values, and decrease IgM antibody values, causing potential false-positive or false-negative results for COVID-19 antibody detection using the indirect immunity method. Thus, before conducting antibody testing, the testing platforms should be evaluated in accordance with the relevant requirements to ensure accurate COVID-19 detection results.","Lin, Jie; Dai, Wei; Li, Weiwei; Xiao, Li; Luo, Tao; Guo, Yanju; Yang, Yang; Han, Ying; Zhu, Peiran; Wu, Qiuyue; He, Bangshun; Wu, Jian; Xia, Xinyi",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537325/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.589080,366

The aim of this study was to evaluate which PPE gown was less contaminating during doffing procedures in an EMS setting. Six well-trained healthcare worker (HCW) subjects tested 4 different gowns: (1) surgical gowns (SG), (2) full body coveralls (FBC), (3) self-made alternative PPEs (SMP), and (4) non-surgical isolation gowns (NSIG). An invisible tracer was sprayed on the gown after donning each subject. After doffing, each HCW was photographed under UV lights to show areas of fluorescent “contamination” on their clothes. The number, size, and intensity level of contaminated areas were noted, as well as observational deviation from the procedure and doffing time. In addition, the subjects were asked to take a questionnaire about their perception of the level of comfort, ease of doffing, and overall safety for each gown. RESULTS: Despite a well-trained team of HCW subjects, contamination while doffing was observed with every type of PPE gown, and with each HCW subject. All body areas were contaminated at least once, except the face. Contamination was more frequent while doffing FBCs. On the other hand, the removal of SG was found to be the least contaminating. The mean doffing time was significantly shorter with SG 1:29 and longer with FBC 2:26 (p=0.005). CONCLUSION: Results of this study converge towards the selection of surgical gowns over other types of PPE gowns, which met both contamination criteria as well as staff appreciation in this context. Specific attention should be paid to the legs and abdomino-pelvic areas. Additional protection such as protective trousers or aprons could be added.","Pottier, Fabrice; Groizard, Charles; Briche, Grégory; Haraczaj, Nicolas; Garnier, Maxime; Loones, Vinciane; Ozguler, Anna; Baer, Michel; Baer, Géraldine; Loeb, Thomas",Int J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256703/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12245-021-00362-9,366

The first lockdown modified daily living and could have led to a decrease in the frequency of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the present study, we compared the frequency and severity of severe TBI before and during the first containment in Normandy. METHODS: We included all patients admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe TBI in the two tertiary neurosurgical trauma centres of Normandy during the first lockdown. The year before the containment served as control. The primary outcome was the number of patients admitted per week in ICU. We compared the demographic characteristics, TBI mechanisms, CT scan, surgical procedure, and mortality rate. RESULTS: The incidence of admissions for severe TBI in Normandy decreased by 33% during the containment. The aetiology of TBI significantly changed during the containment: there were less traffic road accidents and more TBI related to alcohol consumption. Patients with severe TBI during the containment had a better prognosis according to the impact score (p=0.04). We observed a significant decrease in the rate of short-term mortality related to severe TBI during the period of lockdown (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Containment related to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a modification of the mechanisms of severe TBI in Normandy, which was associated with a decline in the rate of short-term death in intensive unit care.","Rault, Frederick; Terrier, Laura; Leclerc, Arthur; Gilard, Vianney; Emery, Evelyne; Derrey, Stéphane; Briant, Anaïs R.; Gakuba, Clément; Gaberel, Thomas",Acta Neurochir (Wien),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-021-04831-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813617/,366

Genetic analysis of the HPAI A(H5N8) viruses isolated from the eastern and central European countries indicates that this is a reassortant between HPAI A(H5N8) viruses from Africa and LPAI viruses from Eurasia. Two distict subtypes were identified in Bulgaria, a novel reassortant A(H5N2) and A(H5N8) that is persisting in the country since 2016. There could be several reasons why only very few HPAI cases were detected in wild birds in this 2019‐2020 epidemic season and a better knowledge of wild bird movements and virus‐host interaction (e.g. susceptibility of the hosts to this virus) could help to understand the reasons for poor detection of HPAI infected wild birds. In comparison with the last reporting period, a decreasing number of HPAI A(H5)‐affected countries and outbreaks were reported from outside Europe. However, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the current epidemiological situation in many countries out of Europe. Four human cases due to A(H9N2) virus infection were reported during the reporting period from China.","Adlhoch, Cornelia; Fusaro, Alice; Kuiken, Thijs; Niqueux, Eric; Staubach, Christoph; Terregino, Calogero; Guajardo, Irene Muñoz; Baldinelli, Francesca",EFSA J,https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2020.6194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32874346/,366

To evaluate the mechanisms behind this event, we investigated the roles of SARS-CoV proteins in the regulation of IL-6. Results showed that the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein activated IL-6 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Promoter analyses suggested that NF-κB binding element was required for IL-6 expression regulated by N protein. Further studies demonstrated that N protein bound directly to NF-κB element on the promoter. We also showed that N protein activated IL-6 expression through NF-κB by facilitating the translocation of NF-κB from cytosol to nucleus. Mutational analyses revealed that two regions of N protein were essential for its function in the activation of IL-6.

We measured the electromyographic activities of 26 muscles, including bilateral trunk and lower limb muscles, during 24 locomotion, dynamic and static stability tasks, and we extracted the muscle synergies using non-negative matrix factorization. Our results show that 13 muscle synergies that may have unique functional roles accounted for almost all 24 tasks by combinations of single and/or merging of synergies. Therefore, our results may support the notion of the low dimensionality in motor outputs, in which the central nervous system flexibly recruits fundamental muscle synergies to execute diverse human behaviors.

Here, a plant-based haemagglutinin protein (H5.c2) of A/H5N1 virus was conjugated with detonation NDs (DND) of 3.7 nm in diameter (ND4), and high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) oxidative NDs of ~40–70 nm (ND40) and ~100–250 nm (ND100) in diameter. Our results revealed that the surface charge, but not the size of NDs, is crucial to the protein conjugation, as well as the in vitro and in vivo behaviors of H5.c2:ND conjugates. Positively charged ND4 does not effectively form stable conjugates with H5.c2, and has no impact on the immunogenicity of the protein both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the negatively oxidized NDs (ND40 and ND100) are excellent protein antigen carriers. When compared to free H5.c2, H5.c2:ND40, and H5.c2:ND100 conjugates are highly immunogenic with hemagglutination titers that are both 16 times higher than that of the free H5.c2 protein. Notably, H5.c2:ND40 and H5.c2:ND100 conjugates induce over 3-folds stronger production of both H5.c2-specific-IgG and neutralizing antibodies against A/H5N1 than free H5.c2 in mice.

Formation of catalytically active Co(2)P nanoparticles and growth of carbon nanotubes were monitored in open and closed sintering environment at different sintering exposure times. Higher porosity, important in the catalytic reaction for easier penetration of electrolyte into the CFs, was achieved by mixing two immiscible polymers with natrium dodecyl sulfate and subsequent heat treatment process. Structure and morphology of the prepared modified carbon fibers were characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. The time of heat exposure at the sintering temperature of 1200 °C and closure of the sintering space showed distinct effect on the growth and shape of carbon nanotubes. SEM and Raman spectroscopy revealed that closure of the system led to the formation of carbon nanotubes with smaller diameters and less structural disorder. Comparing of as-prepared CFs revealed that CFs with Co(2)P sintered in the closed system exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction due to lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope in acidic solution.

Consequently, many of them decided to close their educational institutions as a way of preventing the spread of this virus. For many of them, though, the closure made them unable to deliver learning materials to students owing to their inability to provide the right technology for the purpose. To assist with the digitalizing of learning during this time, this study reviews the most common technologies used in the delivery of learning materials, with the experience of most infected countries being considered. Major challenges in online learning are discussed in this study as well. Further, Saudi Arabia was considered as a case study for the effectiveness of distance learning during the 2020 spring semester, where 300 undergraduate students were surveyed on their opinions of distance learning. The responses to the survey indicated that distance learning was effective in providing the required knowledge to the students during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings showed that although the lack of interaction and poor internet connections were factors affecting comfortable and successful learning of physics and mathematics, 63% of students were satisfied with learning management systems, 75% of students found it easy to understand course materials, and 67% of students found it easy to understand assignments and could deal with them comfortably.

We report the management of a national CCP collection and distribution program in Israel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1 April 2020 to 15 January 2021, 4020 volunteer donors donated 5221 CCP units and 837 (20.8%) donors donated more than once. Anti‐nucleocapsid IgG antibodies were determined using chemiluminescent immunoassay method (Abbott). A statistical model based on repeated IgG tests in sequential donations was created to predict the time of antibody decline below sample/cut‐off (S/CO) level of 4.0. RESULTS: Ninety‐six percent of CCP donors suffered a mild disease or were asymptomatic. Older donors had higher antibody levels. Higher antibody levels (S/CO ≥4) were detected in 35.2% of the donors. Low positive (S/CO ≥1.4–3.99) were found in 37%, and 27.8% had undetectable antibodies (S/CO ≤1.4). The model predicted decrease antibody thresholds of 0.55%/day since the first CCP donation, providing guidance for the effective timing of future collections from donors with high antibody levels.

Various game-theoretic approaches have also addressed disease spread, many of which consider [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] as strategies rather than as states. Remarkably, most studies from the above approaches do not account for the distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic aspect of the disease.

Herein, we consider the adoption of such precautions as strategies and treat [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] as states. We also attempt to capture the differences in epidemic spreading arising from symptomatic and asymptomatic diseases on various network topologies. Through extensive computer simulations, we examine that the cost of maintaining precautionary measures as well as the extent of mass testing in a population affects the final fraction of socially responsible individuals. We observe that the lack of mass testing could potentially lead to a pandemic in case of asymptomatic diseases. Network topology also seems to play an important role. We further observe that the final fraction of proactive individuals depends on the initial fraction of both infected as well as proactive individuals.

AIM OF THE STUDY Allergic asthma is a chronic respiratory disease caused by an inappropriate immune response. Due to the recent spread of coronavirus disease 2019, interest in the treatment of pulmonary disorders has rapidly increased. In this study, we investigated the anti-asthmatic effects of G. gecko extract (GGE) using an established mouse model of ovalbumin-induced asthma. MATERIALS AND METHODS To evaluate the anti-asthmatic effects of GGE, we evaluated histological changes and the responses of inflammatory mediators related to allergic airway inflammation. Furthermore, we investigated the regulatory effects of GGE on type 2 helper T (Th2) cell activation. RESULTS Administration of GGE attenuated asthmatic phenotypes, including inflammatory cell infiltration, mucus production, and expression of Th2 cytokines. Furthermore, GGE treatment reduced Th2 cell activation and differentiation. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that GGE alleviates allergic airway inflammation by regulating Th2 cell activation and differentiation.","Nam, Hyeon Hwa; Lee, Ji Hye; Ryu, Seung Mok; Lee, Sueun; Yang, Sungyu; Noh, Pureum; Moon, Byung Cheol; Kim, Joong-Sun; Seo, Yun-Soo",Journal of ethnopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.114574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461187/,366

Since then, human cases have been accumulating. Given the public health importance of this virus, we performed a pathogenicity study of the H7N9 virus in the cynomolgus macaque model, focusing on clinical aspects of disease, radiographic, histological, and gene expression profile changes in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and changes in systemic cytokine and chemokine profiles during infection. Cynomolgus macaques developed transient, mild to severe disease with radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltration. Virus replicated in the upper as well as lower respiratory tract, with sustained replication in the upper respiratory tract until the end of the experiment at 6 days after inoculation. Virus shedding occurred mainly via the throat. Histopathological changes in the lungs were similar to those observed in humans, albeit less severe, with diffuse alveolar damage, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, formation of hyaline membranes, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and fibroproliferative changes. Analysis of gene expression profiles in lung lesions identified pathways involved in tissue damage during H7N9 infection as well as leads for development of therapeutics targeting host responses rather than virus replication. Overall, H7N9 infection was not as severe in cynomolgus macaques as in humans, supporting the possible role of underlying medical complications in disease severity as discussed for human H7N9 infection (H.

Pharmaceutical research against COVID-19 and the most frequently used tests for SARS-CoV-2 both depend on the genomic and peptide sequences of the virus for their robustness. Therefore, understanding the mutation rates and content of the virus is critical. Two key proteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication are the S protein, responsible for viral entry into the cells, and RdRp, the RNA polymerase responsible for replicating the viral genome. Due to their roles in the viral cycle, these proteins are crucial for the fitness and infectiousness of the virus. Our previous findings had shown that the two most frequently observed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, 14408C > T in the RdRp coding region, and 23403A > G in the S gene, are correlated with higher mutation density over time. In this study, we further detail the selection dynamics and the mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 genes, comparing them between isolates carrying both mutations, and isolates carrying neither. We find that the S gene and the RdRp coding region show the highest variance between the genotypes, and their selection dynamics contrast each other over time. The S gene displays higher tolerance for positive selection in mutant isolates early during the appearance of the double mutant genotype, and undergoes increasing negative selection over time, whereas the RdRp region in the mutant isolates shows strong negative selection throughout the pandemic.","Koçhan, Necla; Eskier, Doğa; Suner, Aslı; Karakülah, Gökhan; Oktay, Yavuz",Infect Genet Evol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33667722/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134821000939; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134821000939?v=s5,366

Rapidly deployable production strategies that are robust to environmental and socioeconomic upheaval(7,8) are needed. Here, we engineered baker’s yeast to produce the medicinal TAs hyoscyamine and scopolamine starting from simple sugars and amino acids. We combined functional genomics to identify a missing pathway enzyme, protein engineering to enable functional acyltransferase expression via trafficking to the vacuole, heterologous transporters to facilitate intracellular routing, and strain optimization to improve titers. Our integrated system positions >20 proteins adapted from yeast, bacteria, plants, and animals across six sub-cellular locations to recapitulate the spatial organization of TA biosynthesis in plants.

We explored the small, cheap and transparent zebrafish larva as a potential host for SARS-CoV-2. Bath exposure, as well as microinjection in the coelom, pericardium, brain ventricle, bloodstream, or yolk, did not result in detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in wild-type larvae. However, when the virus was inoculated in the swim bladder, a modest increase in viral RNA was observed after 24 hours, suggesting a successful infection in some animals. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, with cells positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein observed in the swim bladder. Several variants of concern were also tested with no evidence of increased infectivity in our model. Low infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in zebrafish larvae was not due to the host type I interferon response, as comparable viral loads were detected in type I interferon-deficient animals. Mosaic overexpression of human ACE2 was not sufficient to increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in zebrafish embryos or in fish cells in vitro. In conclusion, wild-type zebrafish larvae appear mostly non-permissive to SARS-CoV-2, except in the swim bladder, an aerial organ sharing similarities with the mammalian lung.","Laghi, Valerio; Rezelj, Veronica; Boucontet, Laurent; Frétaud, Maxence; Costa, Bruno da; Boudinot, Pierre; Salinas, Irene; Lutfalla, Georges; Vignuzzi, Marco; Levraud, Jean-Pierre",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.08.439059,366

However, the host innate immune system provides defenses that restrict IAV replication and infection. Likewise, IAV have evolved to develop efficient mechanisms to counteract host antiviral responses to efficiently replicate in their hosts. The IAV PA-X and NS1 non-structural proteins are key virulence factors that modulate innate immune responses and virus pathogenicity during infection. To study the determinants of IAV pathogenicity and their functional co-evolution, we evaluated amino acid differences in the PA-X and NS1 proteins of early (1996–1997) and more recent (since 2016) H5N1 IAV. H5N1 IAV have zoonotic and pandemic potential and represent an important challenge both in poultry farming and human health. The results indicate that amino acid changes occurred over time, affecting the ability of these two non-structural H5N1 IAV proteins to inhibit gene expression and affecting virus pathogenicity. These results highlight the importance to monitor the evolution of these two virulence factors of IAV, which could result in enhanced viral replication and virulence.","Nogales, Aitor; Villamayor, Laura; Utrilla-Trigo, Sergio; Ortego, Javier; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; DeDiego, Marta L.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578340/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091760,366

SARS-CoV-2 is known to enter host cells via the ACE-2 receptors, competitively occupying their binding sites. In theory, viral invasion can lead to a reduction in available ACE-2 receptors and consequently an unbalanced regulation between the ACE-AngII-AT1 axis and the ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-MAS axis, thus enhancing pathological vasoconstriction, fibrosis, inflammation and thrombotic processes. We hypothesize that the normal pregnant state of highly expressed ACE-2 receptors leads to higher Ang-(1-7) levels and consequently more vasodilation and anti-inflammatory response to SARS-COV-2 infection. We suggest that this up-regulation of ACE-2 receptors in human gestation may actually be clinically protective and propose a potential research line to investigate this hypothesis, which may lead to future novel therapeutics.","Figueiro-Filho, Ernesto Antonio; Hobson, Sebastian R.; Farine, Dan; Yudin, Mark H.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987721001602?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34256245/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987721001602; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2021.110641,366

Such metabolic changes provide potential targets for therapeutic approaches that could reduce the impact of infection. Several examples are discussed in this review, which include effects on energy metabolism, glutaminolysis and fatty acid metabolism. The response of the immune system also involves metabolic changes and manipulating these may change the outcome of infection. This could include changing the status of herpesviruses infections from productive to latency. The consequences of viral infections which include coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may also differ in patients with metabolic problems, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, and endocrine diseases. Nutrition status may also affect the pattern of events following viral infection and examples that impact on the pattern of human and experimental animal viral diseases and the mechanisms involved are discussed. Finally, we discuss the so far few published reports that have manipulated metabolic events in-vivo to change the outcome of virus infection.

METHODS: Internet search query data from January 2011 to December 2019 in China were retrieved from the Baidu Index (BI). Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used to detect the correlation among the search volumes of AH, rhinosinusitis, and AR. We also collected search data from the first 5 months of 2020, when quarantine was implemented in China due to the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. Then, we compared the search data to those obtained during the same period in 2019 to assess the effects of isolation on AH and AR. RESULTS: Statistically significant relevance was found between the search variations of AH and rhinosinusitis during 2011–2019 (R = 0.643, P < 0.05). However, the relationship between AH and AR was weak (R = − 0.239, P < 0.05) and that between rhinosinusitis and AR (R = − 0.022, P > 0.05) was not relevant. The average monthly search volume of AH and rhinosinusitis had a strong correlation (R = 0.846, P < 0.01), but AH and AR and rhinosinusitis and AR were not correlated (R = – 0.350, P > 0.05; R = – 0.042, P > 0.05, respectively). AH and rhinosinusitis search volumes decreased consistently during the first 5 months of 2020 (isolation), whereas that for AR increased during January–February.

In addition, it explored the factors associated with the increased levels of mental health burden among the study population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed using two online-administered questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), which were distributed in parallel to HCPs and HSCUs in Kuwait. These instruments are validated assessment scales to assess mental health status: depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS- version 25. Results: A total of 857 individuals (559 HCPs and 298 HSCUs) participated in this study. The prevalence of moderately severe depression or severe depression (PHQ-9 total score of ≥15) among respondents was 66.6%. The median (interquartile range, IQR) PHQ-9 score was significantly higher among HSCUs (20 {11.5}) compared to HCPs (17 {8}). The prevalence of severe anxiety (GAD-7 total score of ≥15) among respondents was 36.7%. There were no significant differences between the median (IQR) GAD-7 scores among the HCPs (14 {7}) and HSCUs (13 {8}). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that three variables were significantly and independently associated with severe depression among HCPs. The prevalence of severe depression was found to be greater among females compared to males. In addition, it was significantly lower among those who were aged ≥50 years, and those who reported that they were not in direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Among HSCUs, females showed greater depression than males. In contrast, those aged >29 years and who had no history of chronic disease showed lower depression compared to their counterparts in the 18–29 years age group and who had a chronic disease history. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on the mental health of HCPs and HSCUs in Kuwait.

SARS-CoV-2 infection caused striking expression of chemokines, as also seen in primary human COVID-19 pulmonary autopsy samples. hPSC-derived cells/organoids provide valuable models for understanding the cellular responses of human tissues to SARS-CoV-2 infection and for disease modeling of COVID-19.","Yang, Liuliu; Han, Yuling; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E.; Gupta, Vikas; Wang, Pengfei; Duan, Xiaohua; Tang, Xuming; Zhu, Jiajun; Zhao, Zeping; Jaffré, Fabrice; Zhang, Tuo; Kim, Tae Wan; Harschnitz, Oliver; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Liu, Chengyang; Naji, Ali; Ciceri, Gabriele; Guttikonda, Sudha; Bram, Yaron; Nguyen, Duc-Huy T.; Cioffi, Michele; Chandar, Vasuretha; Hoagland, Daisy A.; Huang, Yaoxing; Xiang, Jenny; Wang, Hui; Lyden, David; Borczuk, Alain; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Studer, Lorenz; Pan, Fong Cheng; Ho, David D.; tenOever, Benjamin R.; Evans, Todd; Schwartz, Robert E.; Chen, Shuibing",Cell Stem Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1934590920302824; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.06.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590920302824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579880/,366
690295,Changes in Tobacco Use During the 2020 COVID-19 Lockdown in New Zealand,2021-01-30,"Vesicular skin rashes have been associated to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19), but there is little information about this cutaneous manifestation. We designed a prospective observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 and vesicular lesions. Clinical characterization of skin findings was conducted by dermatologists. When possible, histological analysis and detection of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) in the content of the vesicles was performed. A total of 24 patients were included. A disseminated pattern was found in 18 patients (75%), and a localized pattern was found in 6 patients (25%). The median duration of the skin rash was of 10 days. Out of all, 19 patients (79.2%) presented the skin rash after the onset of COVID‐19 symptoms. Histologic examination in two patients was consistent with viral infection, SARS‐CoV‐2 was not detected in four patients. This monocentric study shows the clinical characteristics of vesicular skin rashes in COVID‐19 patients.","Fernandez‐Nieto, D.; Ortega‐Quijano, D.; Jimenez‐Cauhe, J.; Burgos‐Blasco, P.; de Perosanz‐Lobo, D.; Suarez‐Valle, A.; Cortes‐Cuevas, J.L.; Carretero, I.; Garcia Del Real, C.M.; Fernandez‐Guarino, M.",Clin Exp Dermatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384180/,366
690435,Letter to the editor: Headline stress disorder caused by Netnews during the outbreak of COVID‐19,2020-03-30,"OBJECTIVES: To provide recommendations regarding surgery, follow-up, and management of possible complications related to penile prostheses implantation, during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We designed a critical narrative review of the studies investigating the impact of COVID-19 on urology practice and on penile prosthetic implantology. A comprehensive search in the MEDLINE database was performed. Different combinations of the following keywords were used according to a free-text protocol:: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID19“, “COVID Urology”, “COVID19 surgery”, “penile prostheses”. Papers in English and Spanish language, published until September 2020 were included in the review. RESULTS: Penile prosthesis implantation is an elective surgery which should always be deferred when it cannot be performed in maximum safety conditions. However, it may lead to complications wich must be resolved urgently even within the COVID-19 Era. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, it is mandatory to develop shared strategies to avoid potential COVID-19-related complications for surgical patients. Penile prosthesis implantation should be deferred to avoid unnecessary risks and all preventive measures should be taken to minimize the risks in the event of non-delayable surgery.","Alonso-Isa, Manuel; García-Gómez, Borja; García-Rojo, Esther; Medina-Polo, José; Manfredi, Celeste; Rodríguez-Antolín, Alfredo; Romero-Otero, Javier",Rev Int Androl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1698031X21000145; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.androl.2020.10.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1698031X21000145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34303628/,366
690787,The evolving role of community pharmacists during COVID-19 in the UAE; assessing preparedness and knowledge,2020-12-10,"INTRODUCTION: The rising prevalence of diabetes shows high health and socio-economic burdens. Therefore, the development and evaluation of new diagnostic methods may improve the detection of disease and its complications in the early stages. This study aimed to analyze the scope of the studies related to diabetes diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Publications from January 2015 until December 2019 (5 years) were searched with keywords of (diabetes OR diabetic) AND (Iran) in Scopus and PubMed databases. All data were reviewed by two reviewers and the included publications were categorized based on the subjects, study design, and publication year. RESULTS: Based on the selected criteria, 103 articles were included. The highest number of publications was observed in 2019. The trend of publication was slightly increased during the study period (2015-2019). Case-control and cross-sectional studies were the most common type of study design used in the included documents. Publications in the field of diagnostic models, biomarkers, and biosensors from 2015 to 2019 showed an increasing trend compared to others subjects. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Studies about proper diabetes diagnostic procedures such as new diagnostic techniques, using diagnostic models, and evaluation of new diagnostic biomarkers in Iran are remarkably increased. However, more original and review studies are needed to improve scientific methods in the field of early detection of diabetes.

690790,Road to Tokyo 2020: has this atypical 5-year Olympic cycle represented an opportunity?,2021,"Background and Aims: The novel coronavirus infection COVID-19 is claiming thousands of lives around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on CVD is actively studied by scientific community. It was found that COVID-19 affects not only the lungs, but also has a direct effect on cardiomyocytes, causes microvascular inflammation, including cytokine storm, and blood clotting disorders. To understand whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus makes a direct contribution to the damage to the circulatory system, we created a mouse model for the differential assessment of its pathogenesis in hypercholesterolemia. Methods: We used a genetic construct based on the Cre-LoxP system, due to which tissue-specific expression of the human ACE2 gene occurs. This gene encodes the Ace2 receptor that SARS-CoV-2 binds to when infected. After breeding mice with inducible human ACE2 gene super-expression with tissue-specific Cre-recomibinase expressing mice, we will get mice in which the ACE2 receptor will be produced only in certain body tissues, namely in endothelium, cardiomyocytes, macrophages. Results: A mouse strain for tissue-specific expression of human ACE2 gene was created. Conclusions: The model animals we have created with the expression of human ACE2 gene can be used in fundamental studies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pathogenesis in various tissues against a background of hypercholesterolemia after breeding with ApoE-/- mice.
