The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is based on their ability to utilize multiple neural network layers, and big data, to learn how to convert simple input representations into richer internal representations that are effective for learning. However, these internal representations are sub-symbolic and difficult to explain. In many scientific problems explainable models are required, and the input data is semantically complex and unsuitable for DNNs. This is true in the fundamental problem of understanding the mechanism of cancer drugs, which requires complex background knowledge about the functions of genes/proteins, their cells, and the molecular structure of the drugs. This background knowledge cannot be compactly expressed propositionally, and requires at least the expressive power of Datalog. Here we demonstrate the use of relational learning to generate new data descriptors in such semantically complex background knowledge. These new descriptors are effective: adding them to standard propositional learning methods significantly improves prediction accuracy. They are also explainable, and add to our understanding of cancer. Our approach can readily be expanded to include other complex forms of background knowledge, and combines the generality of relational learning with the efficiency of standard propositional learning.","Orhobor, Oghenejokpeme I.; French, Joseph; Soldatova, Larisa N.; King, Ross D.",Discovery Science,799,1

I outline an approach to the work which accounts for the life‐changing impact of the pandemic, which I call ‘The COVID Third’.

In this study, we investigated the molecular characteristics, evolution, and potential source of DENV from Xishuangbanna. The C (capsid), prM (premembrane), and E (envelope) genes of DENV isolated from 87 serum samples obtained from local patients were amplified and sequenced, and the sequences were evaluated by identification of mutations, phylogenetic and homologous recombination analysis, and secondary structure prediction. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all of the epidemic DENV strains from Xishuangbanna could be grouped in a branch with DENV-1 isolates, and were most similar to the Fujian 2005 (China, DQ193572) and Singapore 2016 (MF314188) strains. When compared with DENV-1SS (the standard strain), there were 31 non-synonymous mutations, but no obvious homologous recombination signal was found. Secondary structure prediction showed that some changes had occurred in a helical region in proteins of the MN123849 and MN123854 strains, but there were few changes in the disordered region. This study reveals the molecular characteristics of the structural genes of the Xishuangbanna epidemic strains in 2018 and provides a reference for molecular epidemiology, infection, and pathogenicity research and vaccine development.","Lan, Qingping; Shu, Yun; Li, Linhao; Shan, Xiyun; Ma, Dehong; Li, Tingting; Wang, Xiaodan; Pan, Yue; Chen, Junying; Zhang, Juan; Liu, Pinghua; Sun, Qiangming",Arch Virol,799,22

Inflammatory bowel disease potentially elevates the risk of infections, independently from the age, while disease activity and medical treatment(s) can increase the risk as well. Based on international data, in total, 4% receives the infection. Furthermore, 1.8% of the patients on biologic therapy needs intensive therapeutic care and 1% passes away. METHODS: This was an observational, questionnaire based study, carried out in Hungary, between February and March 2021. Our questionnaire consisted of 45 questions, that surveyed the impact of the pandemic among IBD patients, and the severity and outcome of the infection. Participants were on biologic therapy. Our aim was to determine the frequency and outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease on different biological therapy. RESULTS: In total, 387 respondents completed the questionnaire, and 47 participants (12%) developed COVID-19 infection. 66.9% of them were receiving anti-TNF inhibitor, 16.8% vedolizumab, 12.1% ustekinumab, and 4.1% tofacitinib. Based on our cohort, different biologic therapies didn’t elevate the risk of infection (p=0.3486), nor the hospitalization rate (p=0.277). No one was in ICU or ventilator, and nobody passed away. Furthermore, 38.3% suspended the current biologic therapy, but it didn’t decrease the rate of hospitalization (p=0.533), however, it didn’t cause flare-ups either in the primary disease (p=0.415). Based on our cohort, neither vitamin supplementations meant protection against the infection (p=0.117), only regular mask wearing seems to protect patients with IBD (p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Based on our cohort, more IBD patients develop the infection in Hungary, compared to international data, however, the outcome of the infection is more favourable. It seems, that the different biological treatments don’t affect the infection rate, and neither elevates the hospitalization rate. In generally, there is no need to suspend the current biologic therapy, however, it should be a matter of individual judgment. After all, we claim that mask-wearing still seems to be the most effective form of prevention.","Resál, T; Farkas, K; Molnár, T",J Crohns Colitis,799,21

Disordered intercellular cascades play a vital role in diabetic systemic vasculopathy. Exosomes participate in the abnormal signal transduction of local vascular cells and mediate the transmission of metabolic disorder signal molecules in distant organs and cells through the blood circulation. They can store different signaling molecules in the membrane structure and release them into the blood, urine, and tears. In recent years, the carrier value and therapeutic effect of exosomes derived from stem cells have garnered attention. Exosomes are not only a promising biomarker but also a potential target and tool for the treatment of DVC. This review explored changes in the production process of exosomes in the diabetic microenvironment and exosomes’ early warning role in DVC from different systems and their pathological processes. On the basis of these findings, we discussed the future direction of exosomes in the treatment of DVC, and the current limitations of exosomes in DVC research.","Chen, Anqi; Wang, Hailing; Su, Ying; Zhang, Chunlin; Qiu, Yanmei; Zhou, Yifan; Wan, Yan; Hu, Bo; Li, Yanan",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),799,8

STUDY DESIGN: Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. SETTINGS: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 µm. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. RESULTS: The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols &#8804;3.30 µm, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols &#8804;14.1 µm. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols &#8804;14.1 µm, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares. CONCLUSION: Given the findings regarding aerosol risk reduction, we strongly recommend that physicians use a suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during endonasal surgery in the COVID-19 era.","Dharmarajan, Harish; Freiser, Monika E; Sim, Edward; Boorgu, Devi Sai Sri Kavya; Corcoran, Timothy E; Wang, Eric W; Gardner, Paul A; Snyderman, Carl H",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,799,3

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In the absence of effective treatment, off-label drug use, in lieu of evidence from published randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, is common in COVID-19. Although it is vital to treat affected patients with antiviral drugs, there is a knowledge gap regarding the use of anti-inflammatory drugs in these patients. Recent Findings: Colchicine trials to combat inflammation in COVID-19 patients have not received much attention. We await the results of ongoing colchicine randomized controlled trials in COVID-19, evaluating colchicine's efficacy in treating COVID-19. Summary: This review gives a spotlight on colchicine's anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties and why colchicine may help fight COVID-19. This review summarizes colchicine's mechanism of action via the tubulin-colchicine complex. Furthermore, it discussed how colchicine interferes with several inflammatory pathways, including inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and mobilization; disruption of superoxide production, inflammasome inhibition, and tumor necrosis factor reduction; and its possible antiviral properties. In addition, colchicine dosing and pharmacokinetics, as well as drug interactions and how they relate to ongoing, colchicine in COVID-19 clinical trials, are examined.","Schlesinger, Naomi; Firestein, Bonnie L; Brunetti, Luigi",Curr Pharmacol Rep,799,16

There is less evidence on effectiveness in real-world settings, especially for older people. The rapid roll-out of the NHS vaccination programme in England based on age thresholds offers an opportunity to make unbiased comparisons of outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. Methods and Findings We matched older (aged 80-83 years) vaccine recipients with younger (aged 76-79 years) persons not yet eligible to receive the vaccine on gender, area of residence, area deprivation, health status, living arrangements, acute illness, and history of seasonal flu vaccination. We also adjusted for the over-representation of Covid-19 positive individuals in the control population because eligibility for vaccination required no Covid-19 symptoms in the previous two weeks. The study population included 170,226 individuals between the ages of 80 and 83 years from community settings outside care homes who received one dose of BNT162b2 mRNA between the 15th and 20th December 2020 and were scheduled a second dose 21 days later. We found emergency hospital admissions were 51.0% (95% confidence interval: 19.9% to 69.5%) lower and positive Covid-19 tests were 55.2% (40.8% to 66.8%) lower for vaccinated individuals compared to matched controls 21 to 27 days after first vaccination. Emergency admissions were 75.6% (52.8% to 87.6%) lower and positive Covid-19 tests were 70.1% (55.1% to 80.1%) lower 35 to 41 days after first vaccination when 79% of participants had received a second dose within 26 days of their first dose. Conclusions Receipt of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective at reducing Covid-19 hospitalisations and infections. The nationwide vaccination of older adults in England with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine reduced the burden of Covid-19.","Mason, T. F. D.; Whitston, M.; Hodgson, J.; Watkinson, R.

Public elementary school students in Yunlin County, which was severely affected by river-dust, were selected as the participants. Study 1 consisted of three-wave follow-up data (801 person-times) in high-/low-dust exposure regions to examine pulmonary function. Study 2 used 147 and 73 students in the high-/low-dust exposure regions, respectively, to establish our health education intervention. Paired t tests, repeated measures ANOVA, and generalized estimating equation were used to analyze the short- and long-term effects. The results showed that the students’ pulmonary function in schools that installed protective equipment was improved. The health education (such as the usage of correct masks and our designed PM(2.5) full-cover sand-proof clothing) improved the students’ cognition and behaviors related to river-dust episodes and yielded both short- and long-term effects.

Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were assessed. Differences in the presence of symptoms and the relationship of coexistence and domestic violence were evaluated from a gender perspective. RESULTS: Men showed significant lower mean (SD) in anxiety, depression, and acute stress levels than women [HARS, 14.1 (9.8) versus. 18.4 (10.2), F = 56.2, p < .001; BDI 3.4 (3.9) versus 4.5 (4.3), F = 16.6, p < .001, and ASDI 3.6 (2.9) versus 4.7 (3.1), F = 39.0, p < .001, respectively), as well as a weaker depressive syndrome (28.1% males versus 39.9% females, χ(2) = 25.5, p < .001).

Zone 1 supraceliac aortic occlusion improves coronary and cerebral blood flow. It is unknown if Zone 3 occlusion distal to the renal arteries offers a similar physiologic benefit while maintaining blood flow to organs above the point of occlusion. METHODS: Fifteen swine were anesthetized, instrumented, and placed into ventricular fibrillation. Mechanical CPR was immediately initiated. After 5 min of CPR, Zone 1 REBOA, Zone 3 REBOA, or no intervention (control) was initiated. Hemodynamic variables were continuously recorded for 30 min. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups before REBOA deployment. Once REBOA was deployed, Zone 1 animals had statistically greater diastolic blood pressure compared to control (median [IQR]: 19.9 mmHg [9.5–20.5] vs 3.9 mmHg [2.4–4.8], p = .006). There were no differences in diastolic blood pressure between Zone 1 and Zone 3 (8.6 mmHg [5.1–13.1], p = .10) or between Zone 3 and control (p = .10). There were no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, or time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) between groups. CONCLUSION: In our swine model of cardiac arrest, Zone 1 REBOA improved diastolic blood pressure when compared to control. Zone 3 does not offer a hemodynamic benefit when compared to no occlusion. Unlike prior studies, immediate use of REBOA after arrest did not result in an increase in ROSC rate, suggesting REBOA may be more beneficial in patients with prolonged no-flow time.
