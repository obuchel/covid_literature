1927,Upstream Disaster Management to Support People Experiencing Homelessness,2015-08-18,"The unique context of day-to-day living for people who are chronically homeless or living with housing insecurity puts them at high risk during community disasters. The impacts of extreme events, such as flooding, storms, riots, and other sources of community disruption, underscore the importance of preparedness efforts and fostering community resilience. This study is part of larger initiative focused on enhancing resilience and preparedness among high risk populations. The purpose of this study was to explore critical issues and strategies to promote resilience and disaster preparedness among people who are homeless in Canada. A sample of interviews (n=21) from key informants across Canada was analyzed to explore existing programs and supports for homeless populations. The data was selected from a larger sample of (n=43) interviews focused on programs and supports for people who are at heightened risk for negative impacts during disasters. Qualitative content analysis was used to extract emergent themes and develop a model of multi-level collaboration to support disaster resilience among people who are homeless. The results indicate there is a need for more upstream continuity planning, collaboration and communication between the emergency management sector and community service organizations that support people who are homeless. Prioritization and investment in the social determinants of health and community supports is necessary to promote resilience among this high-risk population. The findings from this study highlight the importance of acknowledging community support organizations as assets in disaster preparedness. Day-to-day resilience is an ongoing theme for people who are chronically homeless or living with housing insecurity. Upstream investment to build adaptive capacity and collaborate with community organizations is an important strategy to enhance community resilience.","Sundareswaran, Madura; Ghazzawi, Andrea; O'Sullivan, Tracey L.",PLoS Curr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552382/,328
4333,Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs in Community Health Systems Perceived by Physicians and Pharmacists: A Qualitative Study with Gap Analysis,2019-12-05,"Antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is one of the most important strategies for managing infectious disease treatment and preventing antimicrobial resistance. The successful implementation of ASP in the community health system (CHS) has been challenging. We evaluated perceptions of current ASP, potential setbacks of ASP implementation, and future demands on ASP services among physicians and pharmacists in the CHS. The qualitative research was conducted through in-depth individual interviews and focus group discussions with 11 physicians and 11 pharmacists. In addition, a quantitative gap analysis was conducted to assess the different awareness and demands on services of ASP and preferred antimicrobial-related problems (ARP). In overall, perceptions of ASP varied by profession. The identified setbacks were unorganized institutional leadership, the undefined roles of healthcare professionals, a lack of reimbursement, the hierarchical structure of the health system, and the labor-intensive working environment of pharmacy services. Although demands for ASP improvement were similar among professionals, they had different preferences in prioritizing each service item of ASP/ARP development and the profession responsible for each service. Continuous administrative and financial investments, understanding ASP contents, ASP-specific information technology, and interdisciplinary collaboration with good communication among healthcare professions are needed to continue the progression of ASP.","Park, Sohyun; Kang, Ji Eun; Choi, Hee Jung; Kim, Chung-Jong; Chung, Eun Kyoung; Kim, Sun Ah; Rhie, Sandy Jeong",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6963390/,328
9558,Learnings for Health Economics from the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-04-10,"Type I interferons (IFNs) are soluble molecules that exert potent antiviral activity and are currently used for the treatment of a panel of viral infections. In the case of HIV, the use of type I IFN has had limited success, and has almost been abandoned. During the last decade, a series of studies has highlighted how HIV infection may cause overactivation of type I IFN production, which contributes to the exhaustion of the immune system and to disease progression. This review describes the transition from the proposed use of type I IFN as antiviral drugs in HIV infection, to the idea that blocking their activity or production may provide an immunologic benefit of much greater importance than their antiviral activity.","Boasso, Adriano",HIV Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147345/,328

In Study One 2424 (primarily non-autistic) people completed a survey on autism-related knowledge and attitudes; identifying a number of misperceptions and knowledge gaps in the general community. In Study Two 1353 people (primarily parents and carers of autistic people) completed a survey on autism-related experiences; identifying that the community’s awareness of autism does not appear to extend to understanding how to support autistic people. There is a need for more research which integrates the perspectives of both autistic people and the broader community; and the development of communication and education interventions, with rather than about autistic people.

16599,Editorial: Psychological Distress Among University Students,2021-03-22,"Increasing patient loyalty through improved health care quality and patient–provider relationships becomes the key factor in medical providers’ successes. This study explored the mediated relationship of patients’ perceived value, patient commitment, and patient loyalty and the moderating effect of patient trust on the mediated relationship. A cross-sectional research design was adopted. Mediation and moderated mediation were tested using the PROCESS macro v3.5 for the SPSS supplement. Convenience sampling was used for the distribution of questionnaires to members of the public with experience of seeking medical attention in Taiwan. Among the 254 valid questionnaires recovered, 59.4% of the respondents were male, 38.6% were married, 90.2% were in the 20 to 49 year age range, and 54.7% had a bachelor’s degree or above. This study indicated a significant mediated relationship among patients’ perceived value of medical services, commitment to the patient–provider relationship, and patient loyalty. Furthermore, when the patient demonstrated higher levels of trust in a healthcare provider, the relationship of perceived value, commitment, and patient loyalty was also enhanced. This study discussed and demonstrated the effect of perceived value, trust, and commitment on patient loyalty. The research suggests that improving patient loyalty benefits sustainable operation of medical providers and the treatment effects for patients.","Huang, Ing-Chung; Du, Pey-Lan; Lin, Long-Sheng; Liu, Ting-Yu; Lin, Tsai-Fei; Huang, Wei-Chang",Inquiry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020221/,328
18885,Strategies for the implementation of best practice guidelines in operating theatres: An integrative literature review,2021-06-29,"The Western Cape is a dynamic province that is disaster-prone, particularly the vulnerable urban communities in and around its environs. Such communities are more vulnerable to wildfire, flooding, pandemic, natural and human-made hazards because of poverty and, consequently, poor living conditions such as overcrowding and non-understanding of community resilience. The inability of these communities to understand community resilience and withstand adversities affects the sustainability of initiatives to develop them. This study aims to identify the mechanisms influencing the level of understanding of community resilience in a vulnerable community and to contribute to the understanding of community resilience to disaster risk. Fieldwork was conducted in an informal settlement in South Africa. The research study was conducted in two cycles of data collection and analysis. Data in the form of observation notes, document analysis and interviews were analysed using grounded-theory principles. Ten inter-related variables or mechanisms emerged from the analysis. The theoretical model consists of four reinforcing (R) feedback loops (R1, R2, R3 and R4), respectively, which explain how the understanding of community resilience in the informal settlement maps on to the relative achievement systems archetype. Negative reinforcing behaviour would explain the lack of understanding of community resilience, while positive reinforcing behaviour indicates how an understanding of community resilience develops. In addition, the variable with the leverage to improve the mechanisms influencing the understanding of community resilience was found to be the ‘level of public education and awareness’. The theory of how these variables behave in context was represented as a qualitative system dynamics model.","Onyeagoziri, Onyekachi J.; Shaw, Corrinne; Ryan, Tom",Jamba,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252161/,328

22115,Protecting refugees during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). CVD risk scores underestimate risk in this population as CVD is driven by clustering of traditional and non-traditional risk factors, which lead to prognostic pathological changes in cardiovascular structure and function. While exercise may mitigate CVD in this population, evidence is limited, and physical activity levels and patient activation towards exercise and self-management are low. This pilot study will assess the feasibility of delivering a structured, home-based exercise intervention in a population of KTRs at increased cardiometabolic risk and evaluate the putative effects on cardiovascular structural and functional changes, cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, patient activation, healthcare utilisation and engagement with the prescribed exercise programme. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Fifty KTRs will be randomised 1:1 to: (1) the intervention; a 12week, home-based combined resistance and aerobic exercise intervention; or (2) the control; usual care. Intervention participants will have one introductory session for instruction and practice of the recommended exercises prior to receiving an exercise diary, dumbbells, resistance bands and access to instructional videos. The study will evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomisation, retention, assessment procedures and the intervention implementation. Outcomes, to be assessed prior to randomisation and postintervention, include: cardiac structure and function with stress perfusion cardiac MRI, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic health, quality of life and patient activation. These data will be used to inform the power calculations for future definitive trials. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol was reviewed and given favourable opinion by the East Midlands-Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee (reference: 19/EM/0209; 14 October 2019). Results will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals and will be disseminated to the patient and public community via social media, newsletter articles and presentations at conferences.

25412,Epidemiology and Etiology of Mental Retardation,2007,"The claim that it is possible to rationally design a structure-based HIV-1 vaccine is based on misconceptions regarding the nature of protein epitopes and of immunological specificity. Attempts to use reverse vaccinology to generate an HIV-1 vaccine on the basis of the structure of viral epitopes bound to monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have failed so far because it was not possible to extrapolate from an observed antigenic structure to the immunogenic structure required in a vaccine. Vaccine immunogenicity depends on numerous extrinsic factors such as the host immunoglobulin gene repertoire, the presence of various cellular and regulatory mechanisms in the immunized host and the process of antibody affinity maturation. All these factors played a role in the appearance of the neutralizing antibody used to select the epitope to be investigated as potential vaccine immunogen, but they cannot be expected to be present in identical form in the host to be vaccinated. It is possible to rationally design and optimize an epitope to fit one particular antibody molecule or to improve the paratope binding efficacy of a monoclonal antibody intended for passive immunotherapy. What is not possible is to rationally design an HIV-1 vaccine immunogen that will elicit a protective polyclonal antibody response of predetermined efficacy. An effective vaccine immunogen can only be discovered by investigating experimentally the immunogenicity of a candidate molecule and demonstrating its ability to induce a protective immune response. It cannot be discovered by determining which epitopes of an engineered antigen molecule are recognized by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody. This means that empirical immunogenicity trials rather than structural analyses of antigens offer the best hope of discovering an HIV-1 vaccine.","Van Regenmortel, Marc H V","HIV/AIDS: Immunochemistry, Reductionism and Vaccine Design",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122000/,328

36722,Closing Time! Examining the Impact of Gender and Executive Branch Policy Makers on the Timing of Stay-at-Home Orders,2020-05-29,"The British Society of Echocardiography has previously outlined a minimum dataset for a standard transthoracic echocardiogram, and this remains the basis on which an echocardiographic study should be performed. The importance of ultrasound in excluding critical conditions that may require urgent treatment is well known. Several point-of-care echo protocols have been developed for use by non-echocardiography specialists. However, these protocols are often only used in specific circumstances and are usually limited to 2D echocardiography. Furthermore, although the uptake in training for these protocols has been reasonable, there is little in the way of structured support available from accredited sonographers in the ongoing training and re-accreditation of those undertaking these point-of-care scans. In addition, it is well recognised that the provision of echocardiography on a 24/7 basis is extremely challenging, particularly outside of tertiary cardiac centres. Consequently, following discussions with NHS England, the British Society of Echocardiography has developed the Level 1 echocardiogram in order to support the rapid identification of critical cardiac pathology that may require emergency treatment. It is intended that these scans will be performed by non-specialists in echocardiography and crucially are not designed to replace a full standard transthoracic echocardiogram. Indeed, it is expected that a significant number of patients, in whom a Level 1 echocardiogram is required, will need to have a full echocardiogram performed as soon as is practically possible. This document outlines the minimum dataset for a Level 1 echocardiogram. The accreditation process for Level 1 echo is described separately.","Hindocha, Rakhee; Garry, David; Short, Nadia; Ingram, Tom E; Steeds, Richard P; Colebourn, Claire L; Pearce, Keith; Sharma, Vishal",Echo Res Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354713/,328

43325,Living Alone During COVID-19: Social Contact and Emotional Well-Being among Older Adults,2020-12-16,"Domestic mallards (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) are traditionally used as a model to investigate infection dynamics and immune responses to low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) in free-living mallards. However, it is unclear whether the immune response of domestic birds reflects the response of their free-living counterparts naturally exposed to these viruses. We investigated the extent to which the innate humoral immune response was similar among (i) wild-type domestic mallards in primary and secondary infection with LPAIV H4N6 in a laboratory setting (laboratory mallards), (ii) wild-type domestic mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs in a semi-natural setting (sentinel mallards), and (iii) free-living mallards naturally exposed to LPAIVs. We quantified innate humoral immune function by measuring non-specific natural antibodies (agglutination), complement activity (lysis), and the acute phase protein haptoglobin. We demonstrate that complement activity in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure was higher in primary-exposed laboratory mallards than in sentinel and free-living mallards. LPAIV H4N6 likely activated the complement system and the acute phase response in primary-exposed laboratory mallards, as lysis was higher and haptoglobin lower at day 3 and 7 post-exposure compared to baseline immune function measured prior to exposure. There were no differences observed in natural antibody and haptoglobin concentrations among laboratory, sentinel, and free-living mallards in the first 3 days after LPAIV exposure. Our study demonstrates that, based on the three innate humoral immune parameters measured, domestic mallards seem an appropriate model to investigate innate immunology of their free-living counterparts, albeit the innate immune response of secondary-LPAIV exposed mallards is a better proxy for the innate immune response in pre-exposed free-living mallards than that of immunologically naïve mallards.","van Dijk, Jacintha G.

52399,Incidence of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Hospitalized COVID19 Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread effects on healthcare and society at large. There are limited data on the impact of the pandemic on the long-term recovery of the burn survivor. This study aims to compare physical and psychosocial outcomes of the burn survivor population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data from the Burn Model System National Database (2015-present) were analyzed. Data were divided into pre- and during-pandemic groups (before and after March 1st, 2020). Outcomes were compared at four cross-sectional time points: 6, 12, 24, and 60 months after burn injury. The following patient reported outcome measures were examined: SF-12 Health Survey, PROMIS-29, Post-Traumatic Growth Indicator, Community Integration Questionnaire, Patient Civilian Checklist, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Burn Specific Health Scale, NeuroQOL Stigma, 4-D Itch, and CAGE Questionnaire (drug/alcohol misuse). Given the cross-sectional design, potential differences in clinical and demographic characteristics were examined for each group at each time point. Adjusted mean outcome scores at each time point were compared between groups using a two stage multi-variable regression model with propensity score matching. For each time point, subjects from each group were matched. The propensity score was calculated using the following matching variables: gender, age, race, ethnicity, etiology, length of stay, and burn size. The mean score difference of outcomes within each matched sample was examined. RESULTS: Sample sizes varied by time point with a range from 420 at 6 months to 94 at 60 months. The during-COVID group comprised 10% of the total sample size. There were no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the groups at any time point. There were no significant differences between the groups in adjusted mean outcome scores across the different time points. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary examination showed no differences in myriad long-term outcomes at multiple time points after injury among burn survivors before and during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results may suggest an element of resilience, however given the sample size and cross-sectional limitations further investigation is required to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the burn population.","Kelter, Brian M; Wolfe, Audrey E; Abouzeid, Callie; Gibran, Nicole S; Holavanahalli, Radha K; Kowalske, Karen J; Ni, Pengsheng; Kazis, Lewis E; Ryan, Colleen M; Schneider, Jeffrey C",J Burn Care Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083690/,328

The aim of this prospective clinical study was to evaluate the nutritional status in MRONJ patients scheduled for surgical treatment (intraoral soft tissue closure). The following parameters were evaluated: body weight, body height, BMI, nutritional risk index (NRI), bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA), vitamins A, B12, D3, E, K1, folic acid, iron, total protein, transferrin, ferritin, prealbumin, albumin, and zinc. All subjects were admitted to hospital four to five days before surgery and sip-fed with Nutritia Fortimel Compact Protein in addition to regular oral food intake. During surgery, a nasogastric tube was inserted and only removed on hospital discharge five days postoperatively. A total of 58 patients could be included. Half of the MRONJ patients were identified to be at risk for malnutrition. Deficiencies regarding protein levels were revealed, whereas hardly any relevant deficits of micronutrients were noted. The intraoral wound healing four weeks post-surgery was highly satisfactory with a low dehiscence rate of intraoral mucosal sites. Of all parameters analyzed, the dehiscence rate at the last follow-up four weeks post-surgery was significantly influenced by vitamin K, transferrin, and ferritin levels (p = 0.030, p = 0.004, and p = 0.023, respectively). In conclusion, perioperative dietary counselling and appropriate nutritional therapy are important supportive measures in MRONJ patients scheduled for intraoral soft tissue closure.","Laimer, Johannes; Höller, Alexander; Pichler, Ute; Engel, Raphael; Neururer, Sabrina B.; Egger, Alexander; Griesmacher, Andrea; Bruckmoser, Emanuel",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8151518/,328

Even though Covid-19 has been a global pandemic, this emergency can reveal some cultural and historical characteristics of European anxiety in the geo-cultural map of emotions.","Rebughini, Paola",Int Sociol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8180663/,328

54064,Evaluation of Fluid Intake in College Students During the Initial Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-07,"A vast majority of the countries are under economic and health crises due to the current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study analyzes the COVID-19 using time series, an essential gizmo for knowing the enlargement of infection and its changing behavior, especially the trending model. We consider an autoregressive model with a non-linear time trend component that approximately converts into the linear trend using the spline function. The spline function splits the series of COVID-19 into different piecewise segments between respective knots in the form of various growth stages and fits the linear time trend. First, we obtain the number of knots with their locations in the COVID-19 series to identify the transmission stages of COVID-19 infection. Then, the estimation of the model parameters is obtained under the Bayesian setup for the best-fitted model. The results advocate that the proposed model appropriately determines the location of knots based on different transmission stages and know the current transmission situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in a country.","Kumar, Jitendra; Agiwal, Varun; Yau, Chun Yip",Jpn J Stat Data Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8183329/,328
54344,Iraq’s popular mobilisation units: intra-sectarian rivalry and Arab Shi’a mobilisation from the 2003 invasion to Covid-19 pandemic,2021-06-12,"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine applied to surgery is called telementorization (TM). It allows remote assistance by expert surgeons to others with less experience in certain techniques, thus guaranteeing learning that overcomes the barriers of time and location without being associated with a higher rate of complications. The objective is to publicize the use of this type of technology in our surgical department, particularly needed with the current restrictions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our center, the Proximie platform (www.proximie.com) is used as a tool for TM. It allows to remotely broadcast live procedures performed by expert surgeons, as well as to create a virtual library of our own procedures that can be used as study and teaching tool by residents. This platform transmits not only bidirectional image and sound, but it also allows the active participation of a remote assistant with interactive features that are projected directly on the screen of the local surgeon. RESULTS: The Proximie platform is being used frequently (and more intensively during this time of greatest restrictions) in advanced colorectal surgeries, with TM by remote experts and in our department for the continuing training program for residents. It also offers the possibility of conducting multidisciplinary sessions and webinars with subsequent availability control online. CONCLUSIONS: TM and digital platforms such as Proximie provide important benefits in the practical learning and training of surgeons, especially with the current restrictions, being a safe technique and a teaching tool to be exploited.","Suárez Sánchez, A; Diaz Vico, T; Fernández Hevia, M; García Munar, M; Ramos Montes, C; Rodríguez García, I; Otero Diez, J l; García Florez, l J",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194550/,328

55141,Rural Community Health: Keeping Michigan's Upper Peninsula Informed During the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2021-05-14,"Obstetricians and gynecologists are likely to be at risk of occupational distress because their quality of life is affected as a result of their experiences of assisting with traumatic births and/or providing abortions, among others. Nevertheless, there have been few studies of this group of doctors’ compassion fatigue. This study aimed to examine obstetricians and gynecologists’ compassion fatigue. This survey-based quantitative study examined 107 obstetricians and gynecologists’ compassion fatigue. Data were collected using a demographic information form and the Compassion Fatigue Short Scale. This established that had low levels of compassion fatigue related to secondary trauma and job burnout, but moderate levels of it overall. Among female obstetricians and gynecologists, compassion fatigue was higher than among their male counterparts, and respondents who worked at private hospitals had higher compassion fatigue related to secondary trauma than those who worked in state-run hospitals. The data also revealed that obstetricians and gynecologists with 11–15 years’ seniority scored higher on the job-burnout subdimension of compassion fatigue, and overall, than their more senior counterparts. Interestingly, however, no statistically significant differences in the participants’ compassion fatigue were found to be associated with their ages, marital statuses, numbers of children, number of patients seen per day, or number of daily operations performed. Professional sharing groups that allow doctors to share their experiences and to gain awareness about their colleagues’ traumas should be organized. Teamwork should also be encouraged; and various prevention strategies should also be considered.","Dirik, Deniz; Sak, Ramazan; Şahin-Sak, İkbal Tuba",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234766/,328

The AM method selective laser melting (SLM) was used to manufacture at lower cost, but had seemingly lower erosion resistance. The cavitation erosion properties of Inconel 625 and 718 are studied as a function of hardness and surface roughness with the ASTM G134 cavitating jet. The samples were studied 3 surface conditions, as deposited/as used in applications, machined and polished, for both forged and AM manufacturing. Indentation reveals slight surface hardening for machined samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows similar polycrystalline (γ)-Ni-based microstructure for all samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the cut cross-sections reveal the fractures and pits, as well as some porosity in the case of SLM samples. Images of the surfaces during erosion reveal some fracture mechanisms: machined samples erosion start quickly on pits and scratches. The SLM718 samples were found to have good cavitation erosion resistance if machined, while the SLM625 samples have comparatively poorer resistance. As-deposited samples have the lowest resistance, and surprisingly machined samples are more resistant than polished.","Taillon, Gabriel; Miyagawa, Kazuyoshi",J Fail,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8491451/,328

This gives rise to a quasi-experimental situation to assess the impact of mobility reduction on Dengue Fever in Brazilian cities using propensity score matching. METHODS: We match weeks during the peak pandemic period for 37 cities in São Paulo state with comparable prior periods based on instruments for mosquito population size and human susceptibility. By matching within cities, we also control for city-level characteristics, such as landscape or population density. We compute propensity scores using logistic regression and Random Forests and implement both one-to-one and one-to-many matching with calipers. RESULTS: We compare the Sample Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (SATT) across models and find variation in the direction of the causal effect. In 12 cities, mobility reductions are linked to more Dengue cases, while fewer cases are reported in 9 cities. The remaining cities are sensitive to the model chosen. CONCLUSIONS: The SATT of mobility on Dengue varies across the cities in our sample, with more cities experiencing an increase in cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. KEY MESSAGES: A quasi-experimental analysis suggests that there is a a causal effect of mobility on Dengue that varies across cities in São Paulo state.","Roster, Kirstin; Connaughton, Colm; Rodrigues, Francisco A",Int J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499880/,328
58961,The Potential Benefits of Non-skills Training (Mental Toughness) for Elite Athletes: Coping With the Negative Psychological Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-09-24,"This paper is mainly aimed at the decomposition of image quality assessment study by using Three Parameter Logistic Mixture Model and k-means clustering (TPLMM-k). This method is mainly used for the analysis of various images which were related to several real time applications and for medical disease detection and diagnosis with the help of the digital images which were generated by digital microscopic camera. Several algorithms and distribution models had been developed and proposed for the segmentation of the images. Among several methods developed and proposed, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) was one of the highly used models. One can say that almost the GMM was playing the key role in most of the image segmentation research works so far noticed in the literature. The main drawback with the distribution model was that this GMM model will be best fitted with a kind of data in the dataset. To overcome this problem, the TPLMM-k algorithm is proposed. The image decomposition process used in the proposed algorithm had been analyzed and its performance was analyzed with the help of various performance metrics like the Variance of Information (VOI), Global Consistency Error (GCE) and Probabilistic Rand Index (PRI). According to the results, it is shown that the proposed algorithm achieves the better performance when compared with the previous results of the previous techniques. In addition, the decomposition of the images had been improved in the proposed algorithm.","Satyanarayana, K. V.; Rao, N.

The CEO/HPCD composite was characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometry and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and the changes in the principal components of CEO upon encapsulation by HPCD were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The physicochemical properties, release kinetics and antimicrobial activity of the fabricated gels were investigated. The hardness of the KC gels increased with composite concentration in the range of 1.0-3.0% (w/v) and thereafter decreased. A similar trend was observed for the gumminess and chewiness, whereas the gel springiness remained essentially constant. The CEO/HPCD composite also enhanced the fluidity of the system, and the syneresis was positively correlated with the composite concentration. The controlled release of CEO from the gels was affected by the relative humidity (RH) and CEO content. The Ritger-Peppas model indicated that the CEO release kinetics from the gels proceeded through a combination of diffusion and framework erosion. The KC gel containing 5% CEO/HPCD composite displayed effective antimicrobial activity, prolonging the shelf life of sliced bread by at least two days. The reported gels may have potential applications as a promising material for food preservation.","Wang, Yanli; Yuan, Chao; Liu, Yawei; Cui, Bo",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385448/,328

MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 200 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to University Hospital in Krakow, Poland. In 164 patients, a detailed questionnaire concerning neurological symptoms and signs was performed prospectively within 14 days of hospitalisation. In the remaining 36 patients, such questionnaires were completed retrospectively based on daily observations in the Department of Neurology. RESULTS During hospitalisation, 169 patients (84.5%) experienced neurological symptoms; the most common were: fatigue (62.5%), decreased mood (45.5%), myalgia (43.5%), and muscle weakness (42.5%). Patients who died during hospitalisation compared to the remainder were older (79 [70.5-88.5] vs. 63.5 [51-77] years, p = 0.001), and more often had decreased level of consciousness (50.0% vs. 9.3%, p < 0.001), delirium (33.3% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.001), arterial hypotension (50.0% vs. 19.6%, p = 0.005) or stroke during (18.8% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.026) or before hospitalisation (50.0% vs. 7.1, p < 0.001), whereas those who survived more often suffered from headache (42.1% vs. 0%, p = 0.012) or decreased mood (51.7% vs. 0%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Most hospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience neurological symptoms. Decreased level of consciousness, delirium, arterial hypotension, and stroke during or before hospitalisation increase the risk of in-hospital mortality.","Wnuk, Marcin; Sawczyńska, Katarzyna; Kęsek, Tomasz; Wrona, Paweł; Chatys-Bogacka, Żaneta; Mazurkiewicz, Iwona; Drabik, Leszek; Jagiełła, Jeremiasz; Szaleniec, Joanna; Czepiel, Jacek; Pawliński, Łukasz; Bień, Artur Igor; Kania, Michał; Fiema, Mateusz; Zięba-Parkitny, Joanna; Hajek, Agnes; Ucieklak, Damian; Wilk, Magdalena; Pośpiech, Kamila; Lechowicz, Patrycja; Kasprzycki, Karol; Kopka, Marianna; Hohendorff, Jerzy; Katra, Barbara; Kostrzycka, Małgorzata; Adamczyk, Michalina; Surowiec, Paulina; Rybicka, Monika; Walczewska, Jolanta; Kamińska, Barbara; Piętak, Ewelina; Bryniarski, Paweł; Marona, Monika; Motyl, Maciej; Kępińska-Wnuk, Alicja; Włodarczyk, Małgorzata; Nowak, Klaudia; Gradek-Kwinta, Elżbieta; Czyżycki, Mateusz; Dwojak, Mateusz; Rzemińska, Agnieszka; Wężyk, Kamil; Koźmiński, Wojciech; Pułyk, Agnieszka; Garlicki, Aleksander; Grodzicki, Tomasz; Małecki, Maciej; Słowik, Agnieszka",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,https://doi.org/10.5603/pjnns.a2021.0039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037979/,328

The requirement for valid quality measurement to gauge improvements and monitor performance is echoed in the Australian prehospital care setting. The aim of this study was to use an evidence-informed expert consensus process to identify valid quality indicators (QIs) for Australian prehospital care provided by ambulance services. METHODS A modified RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was conducted with a panel of Australian prehospital care experts from February to May 2019. The proposed QIs stemmed from a scoping review and were systematically prepared within a clinical and non-clinical classification system, and a structure/process/outcome and access/safety/effectiveness taxonomy. Rapid reviews were performed for each QI to produce evidence summaries for consideration by the panellists. QIs were deemed valid if the median score by the panel was 7-9 without disagreement. RESULTS Of 117 QIs, the expert panel rated 84 (72%) as valid. This included 26 organisational/system QIs across 7 subdomains and 58 clinical QIs within 10 subdomains.Most QIs were process indicators (n=62; 74%) while QIs describing structural elements and desired outcomes were less common (n=13; 15% and n=9; 11%, respectively). Non-exclusively, 18 (21%) QIs addressed access to healthcare, 21 (25%) described safety aspects and 64 (76%) specified elements contributing to effective services and care. QIs on general time intervals, such as response time, were not considered valid by the panel. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that with consideration of best available evidence a substantial proportion of QIs scoped and synthesised from the international literature are valid for use in the Australian prehospital care context.","Pap, Robin; Lockwood, Craig; Stephenson, Matthew; Simpson, Paul",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34289963/,328

We investigated whether adolescents in Oslo reported compliance with the Norwegian infection control rules during the pandemic and whether compliance with the rules was associated with sociodemographic characteristics, trust in the authorities and acceptance of the infection control rules. MATERIAL AND METHOD Students in lower and upper secondary schools completed an electronic questionnaire (N = 12 686, 37 % response rate) during a period with strict infection control measures in force. We used self-reporting of compliance with the infection control rules, sociodemographic characteristics, trust in the authorities and people in general, and acceptance of the infection control rules. We used logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The majority reported that they always or to a large extent complied with the rules for hand washing (n = 9 915, 84 %), refrained from shaking hands/hugging (n = 8 730, 74 %) and avoided large groups (n = 8 565, 73 %). Fewer reported to maintain physical distance (n = 5 859, 50 %). The level of trust in the government (n = 8 742, 80 %) and health authorities (n = 9 962, 92 %) was high. The highest compliance with the rules was among girls, adolescents from immigrant backgrounds, those with a high level of trust in the authorities and people in general, and those who showed acceptance of the infection control rules.

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Electronical medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were extracted and analysed. RESULTS An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases was not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) were the most common signs of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r=0.486, p<0.001) and non-severe (r=0.469, p<0.001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe patients (all p<0.001). CONCLUSION Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggest eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

LEARNING POINTS Our case report and review of the literature highlight the multifaceted response in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients to COVID-19 (respiratory symptoms, pancytopenia, severe haemolytic anaemia and haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, disseminated erythematous papular skin rash).The rates of intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation support, and lengths of hospital stay were lower in COVID-19 patients with CML receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) compared with an age, gender and comorbidity-matched control group.Our case report and review of the literature suggest a possible protective effect of TKI therapy against COVID-19 in patients with CML.","Singh, Balraj; Ayad, Sarah; Kaur, Parminder; Kumar, Vinod; Gupta, Sachin; Maroules, Michael",European journal of case reports in internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.12890/2021_002233; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585346/,328
68998,Increasing risks of domestic violence in India during COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND Accurate pre-operative or intra-operative labeling of the skin is often necessary to mark exactly the surgical excision lines. Pre-operative ""unsterile"" permanent skin labeling systems are needed for example for vein and sentinel lymph node surgery; here the dyes must resist two surgical skin disinfection procedures. In contrast, excision borders are labeled during surgery using a ""sterile"" skin marking system. METHODS Many commercial and non-commercial pre- and intra-operative skin labeling systems are available, such as autologous patient blood, fluorescence triphenylmethane dyes and commercial skin markers. The available skin marking systems have specific advantages and disadvantages. We review the different labeling systems, offering guidelines to help choose a cost-effective system appropriate for a given surgical procedure. RESULTS The Edding permanent markers 400 und 3000 are well suited for preoperative skin labeling and less expensive than commercial skin labeling systems. Autologous patient blood and eosin are well suited for intra-operative labeling and are most cost effective. Eosin Y is widely used and well suited for labeling of dark skin, bone, cartilage, and muscle tissue and spares the expense of expensive commercial skin markers. CONCLUSION Knowledge of the many commercial and non-commercial pre- and intra-operative skin labeling systems and their advantages and disadvantages helps to reduce the use of relatively expensive commercial skin markers.","Kneilling, Manfred; Breuninger, Helmut; Kastl, Andrea; Heeg, Peter; Häfner, Hans Martin; Röcken, Martin; Möhrle, Matthias",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1610-0387.2009.07039.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19298546/,328

This also holds true for the case of 2-propionylthiophene (2PT) where a propionyl group is attached at the second position of the planar, aromatic thiophene ring. Results from quantum chemistry at the MP2 level of theory, showing that in the two conformers syn- and anti-2PT the ethyl group of the propionyl moiety is slightly tilted out of the thiophene ring plane, conflict with those from the other methods, stating that the ethyl group is in-plane with the thiophene ring. In the microwave spectrum, both syn- and anti-2PT were observed, and their geometry parameters such as the rotational and quartic centrifugal distortion constants were precisely determined. The experimental heavy atom skeleton obtained by isotopic substitutions revealed a tiny, but non-zero tilt angle of the ethyl group out of the thiophene plane, thereby convincingly confirming the non-planarity of 2-propionylthiophene. This conclusion was further supported by the inertial defects calculated from the experimental rotational constants. Finally, splittings arising from the internal rotation of the terminal methyl group were analysed, yielding torsional barriers of 806.94(54) cm-1 and 864.5(88) cm-1 for the two observed conformers, respectively.","Dindić, Christina; Stahl, Wolfgang; Nguyen, Ha Vinh Lam",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0cp02749a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839806/,328

The Chinese Government has been taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing. This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies of international concern in the future.","Wang, Xu; Zhang, Xiaoxi; He, Jiangjiang",Bioscience trends,https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.01043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062645/,328

Technology aimed to improve elder care and quality of life needs to focus in the early detection of decline, monitoring the functional evolution of the individuals and providing ways to foster physical activity, to recommend adequate nutritional habits and to control polypharmacy. But apart from all these core features, some other elements or modules covering disease-specific needs should be added to complement care. In the case of diabetes these functionalities could include control mechanisms for blood glucose and cardiovascular risk factors, specific nutritional recommendations, suited physical activity programs, diabetes-specific educational contents, and self-care recommendations. This research work focuses on those core aspects of the technology, leaving out disease-specific modules. These central technological components have been developed within the scope of two research and innovation projects (FACET and POSITIVE, funded by the EIT-Health), that revolve around the provision of integrated, continuous and coordinated care to frail older population, who are at a high risk of functional decline. Obtained results indicate that a geriatric multimodal intervention is effective for preventing functional decline and for reducing the use of healthcare resources if administered to diabetic pre-frail and frail older persons.

73128,A timely piece that resonates with the South African experience: Commentary on Stockwell et al.,2020-10-07,"Finger enslaving is defined as the inability of the fingers to move or to produce force independently. Such finger enslaving has predominantly been investigated for isometric force tasks. The aim of this study was to assess whether the extent of force enslaving is dependent on relative finger movements. Ten right-handed subjects (22-30 years) flexed the index finger while counteracting constant resistance forces (4, 6 and 8 N) orthogonal to the fingertip. The other, non-instructed fingers were held in extension. EMG activities of the mm. flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) and extensor digitorum (ED) in the regions corresponding to the index, middle and ring fingers were measured. Forces exerted by the non-instructed fingers increased substantially (by 0.2 to 1.4 N) with flexion of the index finger, increasing the enslaving effect with respect to the static, pre-movement phase. Such changes in force were found 260-370 ms after the initiation of index flexion. The estimated MCP joint angle of the index finger at which forces exerted by the non-instructed fingers started to increase varied between 4° and 6°. In contrast to the finger forces, no significant changes in EMG activity of the FDS regions corresponding to the non-instructed fingers upon index finger flexion were found. This mismatch between forces and EMG of the non-instructed fingers, as well as the delay in force development are in agreement with connective tissue linkages being slack when the positions of the fingers are similar, but pulled taut when one finger moves relative to the others. Although neural factors cannot be excluded, our results suggest that mechanical connections between muscle-tendon structures were (at least partly) responsible for the observed increase in force enslaving during index finger flexion.","Mirakhorlo, Mojtaba; Maas, Huub; Veeger, DirkJan H E J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0183145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28817708/,328

METHODOLOGY Doctors working in different parts of Pakistan were approached online through snowball sampling technique. Those with history of psychiatric disorders were excluded. They were administered a questionnaire including Seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Reasons why they felt anxious were also explored. RESULTS Responses from 431 doctors, including 238 (55.2%) males, were evaluated. Most of them were younger than 30 years (286; 66.4%), in training (335; 77.7%), and working in public hospitals (347; 80.5%). Mild, moderate and severe anxiety was seen in 120 (27.8%), 103 (23.9%) and 42 (9.7%) doctors, respectively. Median score on GAD-7 was 6 (interquartile range = 3 - 11).

Motivational Interviewing (MI), as a person-centered complex intervention, aimed to empower and motivate, and could be a resource to improve rehabilitation outcomes for older stroke survivors. The IMAGINE project aims to assess the impact of MI, as a complement to standard geriatric rehabilitation, on functional improvement at 30 days after admission, compared to standard geriatric rehabilitation alone, in persons admitted to geriatric rehabilitation after a stroke. Secondary objectives include assessing the impact of MI on physical activity and performance, self-efficacy, safety, cost-utility, participants' experiences and functional status at 3 months. METHODS We will conduct a multicenter randomized clinical trial in three geriatric rehabilitation hospitals in Spain. Older adults after mild-moderate stroke without previous severe cognitive impairment or disability will be randomized into the control or intervention group (136 per group, total N = 272). The intervention group will receive 4 sessions of MI by trained nurses, including the design of a personalized rehabilitation plan agreed between stroke survivors and nurses based on stroke survivors´ goals, needs, preferences and capabilities. Main outcome will be the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). In-hospital physical activity will be measured through accelerometers and secondary outcomes using validated scales. The study includes a process evaluation and cost-utility analysis. DISCUSSION Final results are expected by end of 2020. This study will provide relevant information on the implementation of MI as a rehabilitation reinforcement tool in older stroke survivors. A potential reduction in post-stroke disability and dependence would increase person's health-related quality of life and well-being and reduce health and social care costs.

Results showed that B2 in fermented soymilk was notably increased from 0.2 to 3.8 μg/mL for Lactobacillus fermentum UFG169 and to 1.9 μg/mL for Lactobacillus plantarum UFG10. The apparent viscosity significantly changed with rising acidity and agglutination of protein.

The main objectives of this study were to compare different comorbidity scores and functional tests with respect to their impact on survival (overall survival [OS] and progression-free survival [PFS]); develop a time-efficient, MM-specific functional assessment (FA); and evaluate changes in patients' FA during treatment. METHODS The authors performed a prospective FA in 266 consecutive patients with MM at their initial diagnosis. This included 5 comorbidity scores and 12 commonly used geriatric functional tests. To evaluate changes in the course of treatment, the authors reassessed these 17 tests after ≥6 months. The entire analysis included 7327 FA tests. RESULTS On the basis of univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, the authors identified 4 of the 17 evaluated scores and functional tests as most relevant: the Revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index (R-MCI), Activity of Daily Living (ADL), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the quality-of-life 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Composite Scale (SF-12 PCS). These showed precise group differences for fit, (intermediate-fit), and frail patients in OS and PFS: the 3-year OS rates were 90%, 74%, and 43% via the R-MCI for fit, intermediate-fit, and frail patients, respectively (P = .0006); 80% and 66% via the ADL for fit and frail patients, respectively (P = .0159); 78% and 48% via the MMSE for fit and frail patients, respectively (P = .0001); and 86% and 66% via the SF-12 PCS for fit and frail patients, respectively (P = .0091). In follow-up analyses, 16 of 17 FA tests improved, mostly in younger patients (<70 years old) and responding patients (partial remission or better). CONCLUSIONS Patients may recover from functional and physical limitations under applied MM therapy. The newly established MM-specific FA (via the R-MCI, ADL, MMSE, and SF-12 PCS) allows a precise evaluation of the prognosis and risk status in MM. Its use may improve treatment tolerability and should be validated to individualize MM treatment decisions in the future.

The authors checked the stability of the final model by applying forward and stepwise selection. To evaluate changes in the course of treatment, they reassessed these 17 tests in 165 patients after ≥6 months: 16 of the 17 FA tests improved, mostly in younger patients (<70 years old) and responding patients (partial remission or better).","Scheubeck, Sophia; Ihorst, Gabriele; Schoeller, Katja; Holler, Maximilian; Möller, Mandy-Deborah; Reinhardt, Heike; Wäsch, Ralph; Engelhardt, Monika",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061991/,328
78731,The Impact of COVID-19 on Heart Transplantations and Waitlist Additions in the United States.,2021-05-04,"The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a powerful reporter protein that allows labeling of specific proteins or entire cells. However, as GFP is a small soluble protein, it easily crosses membranes if cell integrity is disrupted, and GFP signal is lost or diffuse if the specimen is not fixed beforehand. While pre-fixation is often feasible for histological analyses, many molecular biology procedures and new imaging techniques, such as imaging mass spectrometry, require unfixed specimens. To be able to use GFP labeling in tissues prepared for such applications, we have tested various protocols to minimize the loss of GFP signal. Here we show that, in cryocut sections of snap-frozen brain tissue from two GFP reporter mouse lines, leaking of the GFP signal is prevented by omitting the commonly performed drying of the cryosections, and by direct post-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde pre-warmed at 30-37 °C. Although the GFP staining does not reach the same quality as obtained with pre-fixed tissue, GFP localization within the cells that express it is preserved with this method. This protocol can thus be used to identify GFP positive cells on sections originating from unfixed, cryosectioned tissue.","Scandella, Valentina; Paolicelli, Rosa Chiara; Knobloch, Marlen",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-71493-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887893/,328

We previously reported that it is also associated with a reduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and an increase in a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) activity in experimental hypertension. In addition, while multiple cells within the central nervous system have been involved in the development of neurogenic hypertension, the contribution of ADAM17 has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE To assess the clinical relevance of this ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in hypertensive patients and further identify the cell types and signaling pathways involved in this process. METHODS AND RESULTS Using a mass spectrometry-based assay, we identified ACE2 as the main enzyme converting angiotensin II into angiotensin-(1-7) in human cerebrospinal fluid. We also observed an increase in ACE2 activity in the cerebrospinal fluid of hypertensive patients, which was correlated with systolic blood pressure. Moreover, the increased level of tumor necrosis factor-α in those cerebrospinal fluid samples confirmed that ADAM17 was upregulated in the brain of hypertensive patients. To further assess the interaction between brain renin-angiotensin system and ADAM17, we generated mice lacking angiotensin II type 1 receptors specifically on neurons. Our data reveal that despite expression on astrocytes and other cells types in the brain, ADAM17 upregulation during deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertension occurs selectively on neurons, and neuronal angiotensin II type 1 receptors are indispensable to this process. Mechanistically, reactive oxygen species and extracellular signal-regulated kinase were found to mediate ADAM17 activation. CONCLUSIONS Our data demonstrate that angiotensin II type 1 receptors promote ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding in the brain of hypertensive patients, leading to a loss in compensatory activity during neurogenic hypertension.","Xu, Jiaxi; Sriramula, Srinivas; Xia, Huijing; Moreno-Walton, Lisa; Culicchia, Frank; Domenig, Oliver; Poglitsch, Marko; Lazartigues, Eric",Circulation research,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.116.310509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28512108/,328

To do this effectively, ICU directors must possess a detailed understanding of the entire disaster response, including organization, triage, staffing, and treatment. This article provides a comprehensive review of each of these topics, as well as a framework on specific elements of critical care and treatment based on published literature and expert opinion to assist the clinician in directing care to where it is most appropriate.","Mahoney, Eric J; Biffl, Walter L; Cioffi, William G",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066608315677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18504261/,328

They are also frequent after completion of treatment, and nutritional interventions in community-based post-treatment rehabilitation services are important. The first step towards initiating any nutritional intervention is to identify the individual in need hereof, but evidence is limited on the applicability of different nutrition screening and assessment tools in the post-treatment rehabilitation services. The aim is to systematically review and identify nutrition screening and assessment tools appropriate for use in patients with cancer and survivors of cancer in hospital or community-based healthcare settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS In this systematic review, the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL Complete and Embase were searched systematically using comprehensive search strategies. Primary searches were carried out in August 2018 with updated searches performed in November 2019. Clinicaltrials.gov and PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews will be searched for additional relevant studies. Studies will be included if they validate a nutrition screening or assessment tool in adult patients with cancer or survivors of cancer. No restriction on publication date will be applied, and full-text articles in English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish are eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers will independently conduct screening of search results, study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. Data will be synthesised narratively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is required. Results will be reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and published in an international peer-reviewed journal. Furthermore, results will be presented in relevant research and clinical fora to facilitate transfer of results to clinical practice in benefit of patients.

81327,The COVID-19 Pandemic: Critical Care Allocated in Extremis.,2020-04-24,"Inflammation and neovascularization are key pathological events in human age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Activated microglia/macrophages (mi/ma) and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) play an active role in every stage of disease progression. Systemic therapies that can target these cells and address both inflammation and neovascularization will broaden the impact of existing therapies and potentially open new avenues for early AMD where there are no viable therapies. Utilizing a clinically relevant rat model of AMD that mirrors many aspects that of human AMD pathological events, we show that systemic hydroxyl-terminated polyamidoamine dendrimer-triamcinolone acetonide conjugate (D-TA) is selectively taken up by the injured mi/ma and RPE (without the need for targeting ligands). D-TA suppresses choroidal neovascularization significantly (by >80%, >50-fold better than free drug), attenuates inflammation in the choroid and retina, by limiting macrophage infiltration in the pathological area, significantly suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors, with minimal side effects to healthy ocular tissue and other organs. In ex vivo studies on human postmortem diabetic eyes, the dendrimer is also taken up into choroidal macrophages. These results suggest that the systemic hydroxyl dendrimer-drugs can offer new avenues for therapies in treating early/dry AMD and late/neovascular AMD alone, or in combination with current anti-VEGF therapies. This hydroxyl dendrimer platform but conjugated to a different drug is undergoing clinical trials for severe COVID-19, potentially paving the way for faster clinical translation of similar compounds for ocular and retinal disorders.","Kambhampati, Siva P; Bhutto, Imran A; Wu, Tony; Ho, Katie; McLeod, D Scott; Lutty, Gerard A; Kannan, Rangaramanujam M",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.05.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058271/,328
81648,COVID-19 and violence against children: A review of early studies.,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND Maternal depression in pregnancy increases the risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. The reason for this is unknown, however, one plausible mechanism may include the impact of maternal antenatal depression on infant brain. Nevertheless, relatively few studies have examined the brain anatomy of infants born to clinically diagnosed mothers. METHODS A legacy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset was used to compare regional brain volumes in 3-to-6-month-old infants born to women with a clinically confirmed diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) during pregnancy (n = 31) and a reference sample of infants born to women without a current or past psychiatric diagnosis (n = 33). A method designed for analysis of low-resolution scans enabled examination of subcortical and midbrain regions previously found to be sensitive to the parent-child environment. RESULTS Compared with infants of non-depressed mothers, infants exposed to maternal antenatal depression had significantly larger subcortical grey matter volumes and smaller midbrain volumes. There was no association between gestational medication exposure and the infant regional brain volumes examined in our sample. LIMITATIONS Our scanning approach did not allow for an examination of fine-grained structural differences, and without repeated measures of brain volume, it is unknown whether the direction of reported associations are dependent on developmental stage. CONCLUSIONS Maternal antenatal depression is associated with an alteration in infant brain anatomy in early postnatal life; and that this is not accounted for by medication exposure. However, our study cannot address whether anatomical differences impact on future outcomes of the offspring.","Sethna, Vaheshta; Siew, Jasmine; Gudbrandsen, Maria; Pote, Inês; Wang, Siying; Daly, Eileen; Deprez, Maria; Pariante, Carmine M; Seneviratne, Gertrude; Murphy, Declan G M; Craig, Michael C; McAlonan, Grainne",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.05.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34038833/,328

In this study, we assessed the serum levels of IFN-λs in new coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Sixty-four COVID-19 patients were enrolled in this study. All cases were divided into the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU groups according to their symptoms. Fourteen samples of healthy controls were also included. The serum levels of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 were analyzed by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The concentrations of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 induced in the serum of non-ICU patients (836.7 ± 284.6 and 798.8 ± 301.5 pg/mL, respectively) were higher than found in ICU patients (81.57 ± 34.25 and 48.32 ± 28.13 pg/mL, respectively) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.006, respectively) and healthy controls (85.57 ± 33.63 and 65.82 ± 21.26 pg/mL, respectively) (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively). Meanwhile, no significant differences were found in the concentration of both cytokines between the ICU patients and healthy controls. We conclude that higher levels of IFN-λs are associated with decreased clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. These cytokines could be a promising therapeutic agent to avoid the overwhelming consequences of COVID-19.","Shahbazi, Mehdi; Amri Maleh, Parviz; Bagherzadeh, Mojgan; Moulana, Zahra; Sepidarkish, Mahdi; Rezanejad, Maryam; Mirzakhani, Mohammad; Ebrahimpour, Soheil; Ghorbani, Hosein; Ahmadnia, Zahra; Javanian, Mostafa; Bayani, Masomeh; Mohammadnia-Afrouzi, Mousa",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,https://doi.org/10.1089/jir.2020.0187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885337/,328
83259,Surgical control of obesity and diabetes: the role of intestinal vs. gastric mechanisms in the regulation of body weight and glucose homeostasis.,2014,"OBJECTIVES Ingestion of radiopaque markers (ROMs) is a common means of assessing colonic transit time in chronic constipation. Because anorectal manometry (ARM) testing for pelvic floor dysfunction is mostly limited to academic centers, clinicians frequently use rectosigmoid accumulation of markers as a surrogate for pelvic floor dysfunction. We sought to determine whether rectosigmoid localization of markers on a ROM study correlated with measures of pelvic floor dysfunction by ARM and balloon expulsion testing. METHODS We assembled a multicenter, retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with chronic constipation who underwent both transit testing by ROM transit testing and ARM with balloon expulsion testing. We compared the proportion of patients with outlet obstruction by rectoanal pressure gradient or prolonged balloon expulsion stratified by marker location. RESULTS There were 610 patients with both ROM testing and ARM with balloon expulsion testing. The mean age was 44 years and 526 were women (86%). Eighty-one (13%) patients had markers confined to the rectosigmoid area alone and were compared with 529 patients with markers elsewhere (51%) or no retained markers (49%). Of those with markers confined to the rectosigmoid colon, 48 (59%) had a prolonged balloon expulsion compared with 276 (52%) who did not have rectosigmoid markers (P=0.28). The mean rectoanal gradient for patients with markers in the rectosigmoid colon was -29±46 mm Hg compared with -34±59 mm Hg for all others (P=0.59). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with chronic constipation undergoing ROM transit testing, there is no association between rectosigmoid location of markers and rectoanal gradient or prolonged balloon expulsion.","Staller, Kyle; Barshop, Kenneth; Ananthakrishnan, Ashwin N; Kuo, Braden",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2015.140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964224/,328
83384,Promoting Safety: Behavioural Emergency Response during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-04-01,"Late-stage breast cancer usually presents with locally advanced disease, with or without metastasis. The primary tumor is typically large with skin infiltration which affects quality of life. Surgical resection will result in an extensive defect which potentially deteriorates patients' quality of life if not properly managed. Keystone perforator island flap (KPIF) is a local advancement flap based on multiple perforators which can be a reliable reconstructive method to close an extensive defect. Methods This is a case series of 11 patients with symptomatic late-stage breast cancers indicated for neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent mastectomy at Dharmais Cancer Hospital. The postmastectomy defect was closed with KPIF and clinical evaluation included flap success rate, percentage of flap necrotic area, and quality of life. There are modifications of the KPIF consisting of the more rounded shape and additional flap movement of the flap's distal lateral ends to the center resembling an ""omega"" conformation. Results Mean percentage of flap necrosis area was 9.7% and none of the patients needed additional surgery. The patients' quality of life evaluated using Patient-reported Aesthetic European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life, Questionnaire-Core 30-questions (QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life, Questionnaire-Breast Cancer-23-questions (QLQ-BR23) was fair, with sufficiently good scores for global health status and functional scale, and minimal symptomatology burden. The lowest score was for fatigue and financial difficulties parameters from QLQ-C30 and sexual functioning and future perspective from QLQ-BR23. Conclusion This is a preliminary study to show that a KPIF could be considered as a method for defect-resurfacing reconstruction after mastectomy.","Rini, Irena Sakura; Krisna, Made Ananda; Kamayana, Jenisa; Djarot, Kasih Rahardjo; Gunardi, Alberta Jesslyn",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

However, a main limitation of ARMS-PCR is the false positive results obtained due to non-specific priming that can take place with WT DNA, which often precludes detection of low-level mutations. To improve the analytical specificity of ARMS we present here a new technology, NAPA: NaME-PrO-assisted ARMS that overcomes the ARMS deficiency by adding a brief enzymatic step that reduces wild-type alleles just prior to ARMS. We performed this technology for the simultaneous detection of two hot-spot PIK3CA mutations (E545K and H1047R) in CTCs and cfDNA. The developed protocol could simultaneously detect mutation-allelic-frequency of 0.5% for PIK3CA exon 9 (E545K) and 0.1% for PIK3CA exon 20 (H1047R), with high specificity. We further compared the developed NAPA assay with a) ddPCR considered as the gold standard and b) our previous assay based on the combination of allele-specific, asymmetric rapid PCR and melting analysis. Our data show that the newly developed NAPA assay gives consistent results with both these assays (p=0.001). The developed assay resolves the false positive signals issue derived through classic ARMS-PCR and provides an ideal combination of speed, accuracy and versatility, and should be easily applicable in routine diagnostic labs.","Markou, Athina; Tzanikou, Elena; Ladas, Ioannis; Makrigiorgos, G Mike; Lianidou, Evi S",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b03325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31538770/,328

Higher rates occurred among older adults, Black/Mixed skin color/race patients, and those with lower schooling. In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, CD4 count, viral load and number of comorbidities, skin color/race, and schooling remained significantly associated with higher mortality. Although tenofovir use was more frequent among survivors in the univariable analysis, we failed to find a statistically significant association between tenofovir use and survival in the multivariable analysis.

A new compound - the so called C6O4 (perfluoro ([5-methoxy-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]oxy) acetic acid) - was recently introduced as one of the alternative to traditional PFOA, however this was done without any scientific evidence of the effects of C6O4 when dispersed into the environment. Recently, the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment of Veneto (Italy) detected high levels of C6O4 in groundwater and in the Po river, increasing the alarm for the potential effects of this chemical into the natural environment. The present study investigates for the first time the effects of C6O4 on the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to environmental realistic concentrations of C6O4 (0.1 µg/L and 1 µg/L) for 7 and 21 days. Furthermore, in order to better understand if C6O4 is a valid and less hazardous alternative to its substitute, microbial and transcriptomic alterations were also investigated in clams exposed to 1 µg/L ofPFOA. Results indicate that C6O4 may cause significant perturbations to the digestive gland microbiota, likely determining the impairment of host physiological homeostasis. Despite chemical analyses suggest a 5 times lower accumulation potential of C604 as compared to PFOA in clam soft tissues, transcriptional analyses reveal several alterations of gene expression profile. A large part of the altered pathways, including immune response, apoptosis regulation, nervous system development, lipid metabolism and cell membrane is the same in C6O4 and PFOA exposed clams. In addition, clams exposed to C6O4 showed dose-dependent responses as well as possible narcotic or neurotoxic effects and reduced activation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Overall, the present study suggests that the potential risks for marine organism following environmental contamination are not reduced by replacing PFOA with C6O4. In addition, the detection of both C6O4 and PFOA into tissues of clams inhabiting the Lagoon of Venice - where there are no point sources of either compounds - recommends a similar capacity to spread throughout the environment. These results prompt the urgent need to re-evaluate the use of C6O4 as it may represent not only an environmental hazard but also a potential risk for human health.","Bernardini, Ilaria; Matozzo, Valerio; Valsecchi, Sara; Peruzza, Luca; Rovere, Giulia Dalla; Polesello, Stefano; Iori, Silvia; Marin, Maria Gabriella; Fabrello, Jacopo; Ciscato, Maria; Masiero, Luciano; Bonato, Marco; Santovito, Gianfranco; Boffo, Luciano; Bargelloni, Luca; Milan, Massimo; Patarnello, Tomaso",Environment international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2021.106484; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740673/,328

While guidelines are in place, high-quality evidence to inform mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions in conflict settings is lacking. This systematic review aimed to synthesise existing information on the delivery, coverage and effectiveness of MHPSS for conflict-affected women and children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods We searched Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO)databases for indexed literature published from January 1990 to March 2018. Grey literature was searched on the websites of 10 major humanitarian organisations. Eligible publications reported on an MHPSS intervention delivered to conflict-affected women or children in LMICs. We extracted and synthesised information on intervention delivery characteristics, including delivery site and personnel involved, as well as delivery barriers and facilitators, and we tabulated reported intervention coverage and effectiveness data. Results The search yielded 37 854 unique records, of which 157 were included in the review. Most publications were situated in Sub-Saharan Africa (n=65) and Middle East and North Africa (n=36), and many reported on observational research studies (n=57) or were non-research reports (n=53). Almost half described MHPSS interventions targeted at children and adolescents (n=68). Psychosocial support was the most frequently reported intervention delivered, followed by training interventions and screening for referral or treatment.

Prevalence of IgAN was 16.5% in India. Age of affected persons was ranging from 27.2±16.7 to 48.6±21.3 years . Male female ratio was 1.8:1. Clinical features of Primary IgAN, IgAVN, IgADN & Secondary IgAN were microscopic hematuria (49.6%, 44.4%, 15.6% & 59.5%), macroscopic hematuria (5.1%, 0.4%,40.9%,& 35.7%), Subnephrotic proteinuria (42.1%, 29.4%, 23.2%, & 52.3%), nephrotic proteinuria (16.0%, 4.4%, 76.8%,& 47.6%), and hypertension (25.8%,18.3%, 35.5%,& 47.6%).. The 24 hours proteinuria was ranging from 2.6±1.5 to 4.7±2.3 gm/day and serum creatinine (mg/dl) was ranging from 0.9±0 to 3.5±3.9 mg/dl. Histolomorphologically, all type of IgAN showed mesangial hypercellularity and Immunofluorescence revealed IgA deposition.. Conclusion The overall prevalence of primary IgAN in India was 16.5%. The subnephrotic proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were common clinical features.","Khairwa, Anju",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394293/,328

89530,Who Gets Scarce Medical Resources during a COVID-19 Pandemic? Let's not beat about the Bush.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Peritonization of mesh during sacrohysteropexy is generally advocated to prevent adhesions to the viscera; however, randomized clinical trials are lacking, and peritonization may not be completely possible in a laparoscopic hysteropexy procedure. Our main objective was to describe a basic experimental rat sacrohysteropexy model. We hypothesized that even when peritoneal closure was omitted, using composite mesh would result in less adhesions to the viscera. METHODS Twenty in-bred female virgin Wistar Hannover rats were used in this study. Standardized hysteropexy procedure and adhesion model is described step by step with two different mesh materials: polypropylene and a composite polyester. Mesh was anchored between the posterior cervix and anterior longitudinal ligament of the lumbar vertebrae. Macroscopic adhesion scores and histopathological tissue reaction was investigated. RESULTS Macroscopically, the surface area involved in adhesions was similar between groups. However, adhesions in the polypropylene group were more dense, required sharp dissection for lysis, and yielded higher total macroscopic adhesion scores (p < 0.001). Histologically, a more pronounced host inflammatory response was encountered in the polyester group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS We describe a rat hysteropexy model and a previously established uterine adhesion model. Adhesion scores in the composite mesh group were lower, and bowel involvement was not seen. Our findings are promising, and further research investigating antiadhesive composite mesh use for hysterosacropexy would be appropriate, especially when peritoneal closure is omitted.","Gokmen-Karasu, Ayse Filiz; Aydin, Serdar; Sonmez, Fatma Cavide; Adanir, Ilknur; Ilhan, Gulsah; Ates, Seda",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-017-3328-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28439632/,328

DESIGN A descriptive, retrospective report from a single-center PICU. SETTING Twenty-three bed, quaternary PICU, within an 862-bed hospital. PATIENTS Critically ill adults, with coronavirus disease 2019-related disease. INTERVENTIONS ICU care provided by pediatric intensivists with training and support from medical intensivists. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Within the context of the institution's comprehensive effort to centralize and systematize care for adults with severe coronavirus disease 2019 disease, the PICU was transitioned to an adult coronavirus disease 2019 critical care unit. Nurses and physicians underwent just-in-time training over 3 days and 2 weeks, respectively. Medical ICU physicians and nurses provided oversight for care and designated hospital-based teams were available for procedures and common adult emergencies. Over a 7-week period, the PICU cared for 60 adults with coronavirus disease 2019-related critical illness. Fifty-three required intubation and mechanical ventilation for a median of 18 days. Eighteen required renal replacement therapy and 17 died. CONCLUSIONS During the current and potentially in future pandemics, where critical care resources are limited, pediatric intensivists and staff can be readily utilized to meaningfully contribute to the care of critically ill adults.","Wasserman, Emily; Toal, Megan; Nellis, Marianne E; Traube, Chani; Joyce, Christine; Finkelstein, Robert; Killinger, James S; Joashi, Umesh; Harrington, John S; Torres, Lisa K; Greenwald, Bruce M; Howell, Joy",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031350/,328

The recent range expansion of RVFV and the potential for its intentional release into naïve populations pose a significant threat to public health and agriculture. Studies modeling disease in rodents and nonhuman primates have shown that PTV and RVFV are highly sensitive to the antiviral effects of alpha interferon (IFN-α), an important component of the innate antiviral host response. While recombinant IFN-α has high therapeutic value, its utility for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases is hindered by its short in vivo half-life and costly production of longer-lasting pegylated IFNs. Here, we demonstrate extended preexposure protection against lethal PTV challenge following a single intranasal administration of DEF201, which is a replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 vector engineered to constitutively express consensus IFN-α (cIFN-α) from transduced host cells. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered within 24 h as a postexposure countermeasure. Serum concentrations of cIFN-α could be detected as early as 8 h following treatment and persisted for more than 1 week. The prolonged antiphlebovirus prophylactic effect, low production costs, and ease of administration make DEF201 a promising agent for intervention during natural disease outbreaks and for countering possible bioterrorist acts.","Gowen, Brian B; Ennis, Jane; Sefing, Eric J; Wong, Min-Hui; Jung, Kie-Hoon; Turner, Jeffrey D",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00376-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615273/,328

This kind of selectivity in electrocyclic reactions is mostly due to strong orbital interactions, particularly when they involve powerful electron donors and acceptors, which also combine with usually milder steric effects. Orbital interactions are established between the cleaving C-C bond and the HOMO/LUMO of the EDG/EWG substituent. This implies that the larger torquoselectivity-featuring substrates may also suffer stronger solvation effects due to the higher polarity imposed by the substituent.

Progress in biomedical science and technology has expanded the public health arsenal against infectious diseases. Specifically, vaccination has reduced the burden of infectious pathogens. Engineering systemic immunity by harnessing the cutaneous immune network has been particularly attractive since the skin is an easily-accessible immune-responsive organ. Recent advances in skin-targeted drug delivery strategies have enabled safe, patient-friendly, and controlled deployment of vaccines to cutaneous microenvironments for inducing long-lived pathogen-specific immunity to mitigate infectious diseases, including COVID-19. AREAS COVERED This review briefly discusses the basics of cutaneous immunomodulation and provides a concise overview of emerging skin-targeted drug delivery systems that enable safe, minimally-invasive, and effective intracutaneous administration of vaccines for engineering systemic immune responses to combat infectious diseases. EXPERT OPINION In-situ engineering of the cutaneous microenvironment using emerging skin-targeted vaccine delivery systems offers remarkable potential to develop diverse immunization strategies against pathogens. Mechanistic studies with standard correlates of vaccine efficacy will be important to compare innovative intracutaneous drug delivery strategies to each other and to existing clinical approaches. Cost-benefit analyses will be necessary for developing effective commercialization strategies. Significant involvement of industry and/or government will be imperative for successfully bringing novel skin-targeted vaccine delivery methods to market for their widespread use.","Korkmaz, Emrullah; Balmert, Stephen C; Carey, Cara Donahue; Erdos, Geza; Falo, Louis D",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2021.1823964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32924651/,328

Colonic inflammation was evaluated with the colonic Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) (excluding the score of the terminal ileum). Small bowel inflammation was evaluated with the Lewis score and/or Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CECDAI). A Lewis score <135 was defined as small bowel inactive. A colonic SES-CD of 0 (colonic inactive group) was observed in 22/42 procedures (52.4%), and active small bowel lesions were observed in 11/22 procedures (50.0%). The Lewis score was lower in the colonic inactive group compared to the colonic active group. Correlations between the colonic SES-CD, the Lewis score and CECDAI were weak. The Lewis score and CECDAI in the colonic inactive group had significant correlation with fecal calprotectin levels. We suggest that Crohn's disease patients without both colonic active lesions and elevation of fecal calprotectin levels may not need to receive small bowel capsule endoscopy due to low incidence of lesions in small bowel.","Okuhira, Takeru; Yoden, Atsushi; Aomatsu, Tomoki; Akamatsu, Masano; Inoue, Keisuke; Kaji, Emiri; Takitani, Kimitaka; Tamai, Hiroshi",Journal of clinical biochemistry and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.3164/jcbn.18-83; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138961/,328

This study discusses the results and complications of this new flow diverter device. METHODS 40 patients (30 women, 10 men) with 50 cerebral aneurysms treated in six Italian neurointerventional centers with the p64 Flow Modulation Device between April 2013 and September 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Complete occlusion was obtained in 44/50 aneurysms (88%) and partial occlusion in 3 (6%). In the other three aneurysms (6%), two cases of asymptomatic in-stent thrombosis and one intraprocedural occlusion of the parent vessel occurred. Technical complications were observed in eight procedures (16%). Permanent morbidity due to acute in-stent thrombosis and consequent ischemic stroke occurred in one patient (2.5%). No delayed aneurysm rupture, subarachnoid or intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or ischemic complications occurred and there were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment with the p64 Flow Modulation Device is a safe treatment for unruptured cerebral aneurysms, resulting in a high rate of occlusion. As with other flow diverter devices, we recommend this treatment mainly for large-necked aneurysms of the internal carotid artery siphon. However, endovascular treatment with the p64 device should also be encouraged in difficult cases such as aneurysms of the posterior circulation and beyond the circle of Willis.","Briganti, Francesco; Leone, Giuseppe; Ugga, Lorenzo; Marseglia, Mariano; Macera, Antonio; Manto, Andrea; Delehaye, Luigi; Resta, Maurizio; Resta, Mariachiara; Burdi, Nicola; Nuzzi, Nunzio Paolo; Divenuto, Ignazio; Caranci, Ferdinando; Muto, Mario; Solari, Domenico; Cappabianca, Paolo; Maiuri, Francesco",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27439887/,328

We studied the effects of antithrombotic agents, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and age on risk of non-GI AEs after colonoscopy. METHODS We performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis to assess the diagnosis, procedure, and prescription drug codes in a United States commercial claims database (March 2010-March 2012). Data from patients at increased risk (n = 82,025; defined as patients with pulmonary comorbidities or cardiovascular disease requiring antithrombotic medications) were compared with data from 398,663 average-risk patients. In a 1:1 matched analysis, 51,932 patients at increased risk, examined by colonoscopy, were compared with 51,932 matched (on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities) patients at increased risk who did not undergo colonoscopy. We tracked cardiac, pulmonary, and neurovascular events 1-30 days after colonoscopy. RESULTS Thirty days after outpatient colonoscopy, non-GI AEs were significantly higher in patients taking antithrombotic medications (7.3%; odds ratio [OR], 10.75; 95% confidence interval, 10.13-11.42) or those with pulmonary comorbidities (1.8%; OR, 2.44; 95% confidence interval, 2.27-2.62) vs average-risk patients (0.7%) and in patients 60-69 years old (OR, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 2.01-2.42) or 70 years or older (OR, 6.45; 95% confidence interval, 5.89-7.06), compared with patients younger than 50 years. The 30-day incidence of non-GI AEs in patients at increased risk who underwent colonoscopy was also significantly higher than in matched patients at increased risk who did not undergo colonoscopy in the anticoagulant group (OR, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 2.01-2.65) and in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group (OR, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.56). CONCLUSIONS Increased number of comorbidities and older age (older than 60 years) are associated with increased risk of non-GI AEs after colonoscopy.

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy of psychological interventions in reducing depression and improving quality of life and clinical outcomes (mortality, hospitalization) among adults with CHF. METHODS This study performed a systematic review involving searches of 6 databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, and SSCI), the Cochrane library, and gray literature, completed in January 2020. Experimental and nonexperimental quantitative studies of psychological interventions for adults with CHF were included. Each study was quality appraised, and key data were extracted and tabled. Overall findings are presented as a narrative synthesis. RESULTS Nine studies met eligibility. Study authors sampled 757 participants and evaluated 4 psychological interventions: cognitive behavioral therapy alone or combined with exercise, mindfulness-based psychoeducation, coping skills training, and innovative holistic meditation. Cognitive behavioral therapy was significantly associated with improved depression and quality of life, and reduced hospitalization risk. Mindfulness-based psychoeducation, holistic meditation, and coping skills training positively impacted depression and quality of life. Coping skills training also reduced hospitalization and mortality risks. CONCLUSION Although this review indicates that psychological interventions can be beneficial to adults with CHF who have depression, the overall weight of evidence contains a number of biases. Larger, higher-powered studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings and to better understand how specific intervention and sample characteristics relate to outcomes.","Helal, Sameera I; Lee, Geraldine; Evans, Catherine; Grealish, Annmarie",The Journal of cardiovascular nursing,https://doi.org/10.1097/jcn.0000000000000779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394624/,328

This has historically been accomplished with patient contact and bureaucratic aggregation, which tends to be slow and expensive. Recent internet-based approaches promise to be real-time and cheap, with few parameters. However, the question of when and how these approaches work remains open. We addressed this question using Wikipedia access logs and category links. Our experiments, replicable and extensible using our open source code and data, test the effect of semantic article filtering, amount of training data, forecast horizon, and model staleness by comparing across 6 diseases and 4 countries using thousands of individual models. We found that our minimal-configuration, language-agnostic article selection process based on semantic relatedness is effective for improving predictions, and that our approach is relatively insensitive to the amount and age of training data. We also found, in contrast to prior work, very little forecasting value, and we argue that this is consistent with theoretical considerations about the nature of forecasting. These mixed results lead us to propose that the currently observational field of internet-based disease surveillance must pivot to include theoretical models of information flow as well as controlled experiments based on simulations of disease.","Priedhorsky, Reid; Osthus, Dave; Daughton, Ashlynn R; Moran, Kelly R; Generous, Nicholas; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Deshpande, Alina; Del Valle, Sara Y",CSCW : proceedings of the Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work.

Fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended for recurrent CDI, but emerging data support use for FCDI. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a sequential FMT (sFMT) protocol for FCDI compared to current standard therapy. METHODS A Markov model simulated patients with FCDI in a 1-year time horizon. The treatment algorithm for up to 3 sFMTs, clinical probabilities, and direct costs were used from published sources. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. The healthcare sector perspective was used with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. RESULTS sFMT for FCDI was associated with lower overall cost ($28,309 vs $33,980) and higher QALY (0.765 vs 0.686) compared to standard therapy. sFMT is cost-effective in 100% of iterations. sFMT remained cost-effective at cure rates >44.8% for the first FMT and at stool preparation cost <$6,944 per instillation. We find a wide range of efficacies for first versus second FMT at which sFMT is still preferred. Value of information analysis estimates the expected value of perfect information to be low at $1.89 per person, quantified with net monetary benefit. CONCLUSIONS An sFMT strategy strongly dominates standard therapy, with lower cost and higher QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates benefit even if FMT cure rates are lower than expected, and when multiple FMTs are required. FMT material in 2020 was priced at $1695 per treatment but remains cost-effective at a much higher cost.","Gupta, Sanchit; Zhu, Jinyi; McCarty, Thomas R; Pruce, Jordan; Kassam, Zain; Kelly, Colleen; Fischer, Monika; Allegretti, Jessica R",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682170/,328

Despite its popularity, limited studies have examined relationships between brain concentrations of methylone, its metabolites, and pharmacodynamic effects. The goal of the present study was two-fold: 1) to determine pharmacokinetics of methylone and its major metabolites, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylcathinone (HMMC), 3,4-dihydroxy-N-methylcathinone (HHMC), and 3,4-methylenedioxycathinone (MDC) in rat brain and plasma; 2) to relate brain pharmacokinetic parameters to pharmacodynamic effects including locomotor behavior and post-mortem neurochemistry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received s.c. methylone (6, 12, or 24 mg/kg) or saline vehicle (n=16/dose), and subgroups were decapitated after 40 or 120 min. Plasma and prefrontal cortex were analyzed for concentrations of methylone and its metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Frontal cortex and dorsal striatum were analyzed for dopamine, 5-HT, and their metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection. Brain and plasma concentrations of methylone and its metabolites rose with increasing methylone dose, but brain methylone and MDC concentrations were greater than dose-proportional. Brain-to-plasma ratios for methylone and MDC were >3 (range 3-12), whereas those for HHMC and HMMC were <0.2 (range 0.01-0.2). Locomotor activity score was positively correlated with brain methylone and MDC, whereas cortical 5-HT was negatively correlated with these analytes at 120 min. Our findings show that brain concentrations of methylone and MDC display non-linear accumulation. Behavioral and neurochemical effects of systemically administered methylone are related to brain concentrations of methylone and MDC, but not its hydroxylated metabolites, which do not effectively penetrate into the brain. Significance Statement Behavioral and neurochemical effects of methylone are related to brain concentrations of methylone and its metabolite MDC, but not its hydroxylated metabolites, HMMC and HHMC, which do not effectively penetrate into the brain. Methylone and MDC display non-linear accumulation in the brain, which could cause untoward effects on 5-HT neurons in vulnerable brain regions, including the frontal cortex.","Centazzo, Nicole; Chojnacki, Michel R; Elmore, Joshua S; Rodriguez, Raider; Acosta, Teeshavi; Suzuki, Masaki; Rice, Kenner C; Baumann, Michael H; Concheiro, Marta",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.121.000531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785525/,328

Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) is the major cause of preterm delivery. The key risk factors for SPTB are women who have a short cervix and women who have had previous preterm birth. Cervical cerclage has been used for several decades and has shown to decrease rates of preterm birth. The most commonly used cerclage techniques were described by Shirodkar and McDonald, with no current consensus on the preferred technique. The objective of this review is to determine and compare the effectiveness of both techniques. METHODS Studies will be sourced from six electronic databases, as well as from experts in the field, reference lists, and grey literature. Eligible studies will include pregnant women, with a singleton or twin pregnancy, requiring a cervical cerclage, using either the Shirodkar or McDonald technique and run comparative analyses between the two techniques. Randomized control trials (RCT)s, non-randomized control trials, and cohort studies will be eligible. Two independent reviewers will conduct study screening at abstract and full-text level, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Discrepancies will be resolved by a consensus third reviewer if required. Fixed-effects or random-effects models will be used where appropriate to synthesize results. Alternative synthesis methods will be investigated in instances where a meta-analysis is not appropriate, such as summarizing effect estimates, combining P values, vote counting based on direction of effect, or synthesis in narrative form. DISCUSSION This review will synthesize the evidence on both the Shirodkar and McDonald cerclage method, and will help clinicians and health services to determine and deliver best practice antenatal care that has the potential to make an impact on preterm birth.

She has a long-standing interest in mechanisms of tumour suppression and cellular plasticity, centred on studies of p53 and the ASPP family of proteins (apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53; ankyrin repeats, SH3 domain and proline-rich sequence-containing proteins). Her laboratory's discovery of ASPPs, regulators or 'molecular switches' of the apoptotic function of p53 led to key insights into the role of cell plasticity in cancer and other diseases, and these could pave the way to new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Xin has received many awards and honours in recognition of her significant contributions to cancer biology, including being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2020. Here, she outlines how her breakthrough discovery of ASPPs came about and its impact on the cancer field, as well as highlighting the importance of mentors including Min Wu, Birgit Lane and Sir David Lane in shaping her early career and helping her to navigate a new research world, having moved to the UK from China in the 80s.","Howe, Françoise S; Lu, Xin",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197146/,328

Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can also infect tissues besides the respiratory system, such as the ocular tissues, remains unclear. Objective To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 exists intracellularly in the ocular tissues of a patient previously infected with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This case study analyzed a patient previously infected with COVID-19 who had an acute glaucoma attack during her rehabilitation. Plasma samples and tissue specimens, including ones from the conjunctiva, anterior lens capsular, trabecular meshwork, and iris, were collected during phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy surgery. Specimens from another patient who had glaucoma but not COVID-19 were used as a negative control. Main Outcomes and Measures Specimens were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The nucleocapsid protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was measured in the conjunctiva, trabecular meshwork, and iris using immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the conjunctiva was measured using immunohistochemistry. Results The patient with a previous COVID-19 infection was female and 64 years old, and the control patient without a COVID-19 infection history was male and 61 years old. The nucleocapsid protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 was detected on the cells of the conjunctiva, trabecular, and iris of the patient infected with COVID-19 but not in the control participant, while angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor proteins were detected on the conjunctiva of both patients. Conclusions and Relevance The nucleocapsid protein antigen of SARS-CoV-2 existed intracellularly in the ocular tissues of a patient previously infected with COVID-19. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can also infect ocular tissues in addition to the respiratory system.","Yan, Ying; Diao, Bo; Liu, Yueping; Zhang, Wenqiang; Wang, Gang; Chen, Xiao",JAMA ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.3962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33034620/,328
97009,Incarceration And COVID-19.,2021-01-01,"Importance Clinicians are increasingly adopting telemedicine in an effort to expand patient access and efficiently deliver care. However, the extent to which otolaryngologists provide telemedicine services is unclear. Objective To characterize recent trends in the use of telemedicine by otolaryngologists to deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was conducted between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, using publicly available Medicare Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary data on physicians practicing in the field of otolaryngology and benchmark specialties (dermatology and psychiatry) that provided telemedicine services to Medicare beneficiaries. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were the mean annual number of telemedicine services delivered per active physician and mean annual payment per active physician for these services. Secondary outcomes included the number, setting, and complexity of telemedicine services. Results Between 2010 and 2018, otolaryngologists provided 2127 total telemedicine services (7 unique service types) to Medicare beneficiaries and received $88 574 in total payment for these services. During this period, the mean number of telemedicine services increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.0%, and the mean Medicare payment per otolaryngologist increased at a CAGR of 21.8%. In comparison, telemedicine use during this period generally increased at a higher rate in the fields of dermatology (mean number of services per active physician at CAGR of 13.0%; mean Medicare payment per active physician at CAGR of 12.5%) and psychiatry (mean number of services per active physician at CAGR of 25.8%; mean Medicare payment per active physician at CAGR of 26.6%). In 2018, outpatient evaluation and management visits accounted for most telemedicine services provided (337 of 353 [95.5%]) and the payments received ($17 542.13 of $18 470.47 [95.0%]) by otolaryngologists. In contrast, physicians in other specialties also provided substantial portions of telemedicine services in the inpatient (psychiatry, 18 403 of 198 478 [9.3%]; dermatology, 231 of 1034 [22.3%]) and skilled nursing facility settings (psychiatry, 14 690 of 198 478 [7.4%]; dermatology, 46 of 1034 [4.4%]). Conclusions and Relevance This study suggests that the extent to which otolaryngologists used telemedicine to deliver care to Medicare beneficiaries between 2010 and 2018 was rare. Although there was relative growth in the use of telemedicine by otolaryngologists during this period, absolute growth remained low. Policy makers and provider organizations should support otolaryngologists in the adoption of telemedicine technologies, especially while coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral suppression efforts necessitate prolonged restriction of physical clinic throughput.","Miller, Lauren E; Rathi, Vinay K; Kozin, Elliott D; Naunheim, Matthew R; Xiao, Roy; Gray, Stacey T",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.1911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701120/,328

METHODS Nondemented older adults (N = 1175) underwent annual testing with 17 cognitive tests summarized as a global cognitive score. A composite sarcopenia score was constructed based on muscle mass measured with bioelectrical impedance and muscle function based on grip strength. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine associations of sarcopenia with incident Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Linear mixed-effect models determined the association of sarcopenia with cognitive decline. All models controlled for age, sex, education, race, and height squared. RESULTS Average follow-up was 5.6 years. More severe sarcopenia at baseline was associated with a higher risk of incident AD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% confidence interval 1.20-1.86]; p < 0.001) and of MCI (1.21 [1.01-1.45]; 0.04) and a faster rate of cognitive decline (estimate = -0.013; p = 0.01). Analyses of the individual components of sarcopenia showed that muscle function was associated with incident AD, incident MCI, and cognitive decline with and without a term for lean muscle mass in the model. In contrast, lean muscle mass was not associated with incident cognitive impairment or cognitive decline when a term for muscle function was included in the model. CONCLUSIONS Poor muscle function, but not reduced lean muscle mass, drives the association of sarcopenia with late-life cognitive impairment. Further work is needed to identify features of muscle structure, which may increase the specificity of sarcopenia for identifying older adults at risk for late-life cognitive impairment.","Beeri, Michal S; Leugrans, Sue E; Delbono, Osvaldo; Bennett, David A; Buchman, Aron S",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954985/,328
97555,Beyond the Nurses and Doctors: Structural Racism and the Unseen Frontline Service Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-02-09,"cis- and trans-Platinum(iv) complexes with diaminetetracarboxylate coordination spheres possess the highly desirable property of exhibiting unusual resistance to reduction by blood serum components and endogenous reductants such as ascorbate. At the same time they are rapidly reduced in the intracellular environment of cancer cells. Consequently, they can potentially be tuned to remain intact in vivo until arrival at the tumour target where they are rapidly reduced to yield the active platinum(ii) species. However, in order to achieve this, uptake must be largely restricted to tumour cells and therefore uptake by healthy cells including red blood cells must be prevented. In this proof of concept study, we report on the effect of net charge as a means of controlling the uptake by red blood cells. Using 1H NMR spectroscopy we found that modifying the net charge of the complex does not influence the rate of reduction of the complexes by an excess of ascorbate. Using XANES spectroscopy we found that modifying the net charge of the platinum(iv) complexes decreased the extent of reduction in whole blood, although probably not to the degree needed for the optimal delivery to tumours. Therefore, it is likely to be necessary to adopt higher charges and/or additional strategies to keep platinum(iv) prodrugs out of blood cells.","Chen, Catherine K J; Gui, Xiao; Kappen, Peter; Renfrew, Anna K; Hambley, Trevor W",Metallomics : integrated biometal science,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0mt00157k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084707/,328
98237,Testing for COVID-19 regulates behavior in the general population: A qualitative study of experiences of awaiting test result for COVID-19.,2021-03-15,"Debio-025 is a synthetic cyclosporine with no immunosuppressive capacity but a high inhibitory potency against cyclophilin A (CypA)-associated cis-trans prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. A lack of immunosuppressive effects compared to that of cyclosporine was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. For three cyclosporines, the inhibitory potential against PPIase activity was quantitatively correlated with that against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Debio-025 selectively inhibited the replication of HIV-1 in a CD4+ cell line and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells: potent activity was demonstrated against clinical isolates of various HIV-1 subtypes, including isolates with multidrug resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. Simian immunodeficiency virus and HIV-2 strains were generally resistant to inhibition by Debio-025; however, some notable exceptions of sensitive HIV-2 clinical isolates were detected. In two-drug combination studies, additive inhibitory effects were found between Debio-025 and 19 clinically used drugs of different classes. Clinical HIV-1 isolates that are naturally resistant to Debio-025 and that do not depend on CypA for infection were identified. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the CypA binding domain of the capsid (CA) protein from Debio-025-sensitive and -resistant HIV-1 isolates indicated that resistance was mostly associated with an H87Q/P exchange. Mechanistically, cyclosporines competitively inhibit the binding of CypA to the HIV-1 CA protein, which is an essential interaction required for early steps in HIV-1 replication. By real-time PCR we demonstrated that early reverse transcription is reduced in the presence of Debio-025 and that late reverse transcription is almost completely blocked. Thus, Debio-025 seems to interfere with the function of CypA during the progression/completion of HIV-1 reverse transcription.","Ptak, Roger G; Gallay, Philippe A; Jochmans, Dirk; Halestrap, Andrew P; Ruegg, Urs T; Pallansch, Luke A; Bobardt, Michael D; de Béthune, Marie-Pierre; Neyts, Johan; De Clercq, Erik; Dumont, Jean-Maurice; Scalfaro, Pietro; Besseghir, Kamel; Wenger, Roland M; Rosenwirth, Brigitte",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01324-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18212100/,328

We used radiofrequency ablation to treat the vascular pedicle of exophytic AML with low R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score and investigated its feasibility for hilar off-clamping nephron-sparing surgery. METHODS Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed enhanced, well-defined lipomatous tumors with a maximum diameter of 4-8 cm in the kidney of 15 patients. Results indicated that the exophytic tumors featured in the enlarged tumor vasculatures extended into the parenchyma of the involved kidney. The patients underwent radiofrequency ablation by using a Cool-tip™ probe placed into the root of the AML mass from different directions under laparoscopic ultrasonography guidance. After sealing the vascular pedicle of the tumor, the bloodless tumors were resected en bloc without renal hilar clamping or suturing the resection defect of the kidney. RESULTS All patients underwent the procedure smoothly, and no perioperative complications occurred. The contrast-enhanced CT scan showed small defects in the contrast-enhanced renal parenchyma at third month after the procedure, and the decrease in function of the treated kidneys was <10% during the 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience suggests that sealing the tumor vessels by radiofrequency ablation based on the tumor vasculature features of a renal mass is an alternative to hilar clamping in laparoscopic nephron-sparing surgery. Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation and tumor excision are a definitive and safe minimally invasive procedure that allows the successful removal of exophytic sporadic AML mass with low R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score.","Xiong, Wei; Ran, Qing; Du, Yangchun; Lv, Ji; Chen, Fang; Zhong, Shan; Guo, Pu; Dou, Ke; Sun, Minghan",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

99825,COVID and the Caregiver.,2020-10-26,"BACKGROUND Recent innovations in technology and operative techniques have enabled safe performance of robot-assisted zero-ischaemia partial nephrectomy (PN), thus preventing the deleterious effect of warm ischaemia time. OBJECTIVE To describe a novel technique of occlusion angiography using intraoperative contrast-enhanced ultrasound scan (CEUS) for zero-ischaemia robot-assisted PN (RAPN). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a prospective cohort evaluation of five patients who had imaging suspicious of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated at a single centre. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We used computed tomography with three-dimensional reconstruction to identify renal arterial anatomy and its relationship to the tumour. Then, RAPN was performed with selective clamping and demonstration of a nonperfused segment of kidney (occlusion angiography) using intraoperative CEUS. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS We prospectively collected data on baseline, perioperative, and postoperative parameters. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS We describe the effects seen on ultrasound contrast administration. Contrast flare is seen in the segment of the kidney that is perfused. When selective clamping is performed, a watershed (line of demarcation) between the perfused and nonperfused segments of the kidney is clearly seen, allowing excision of the tumour in a relatively avascular plane and ensuring an adequate oncologic margin, when feasible. The mean age was 68.2 yr of age (range: 36-85), and the mean tumour size was 29.6mm (range: 20-42). The mean intraparenchymal extension of the tumour was 22.6mm (range: 12-30). Three tumours were located on the right kidney and two on the left. The mean blood loss was 420ml (range: 200-1000). The histology revealed clear cell RCC in two patients, oncocytoma in two patients, and type 1 papillary RCC in one patient. All the surgical specimens had negative surgical margins. The mean decrease in glomerular filtration rate was 8.4ml (range: 0-24). The mean follow-up was 6.4 mo (range: 5-8), with no evidence of recurrence in any patient. The only limitation in adopting this technique is the need for an intraoperative ultrasound probe with a CEUS mode. However, most specialists who perform minimally invasive surgery for small renal tumours believe that intraoperative ultrasound scan imaging is essential to achieving adequate resection margins. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative CEUS can be a useful adjunct in determining whether zero-ischaemia RAPN is feasible by delineating the area of nonperfusion. This technique has several advantages over the currently available techniques, such as indigo carmine green and Doppler probes.","Rao, Amrith Raj; Gray, Robert; Mayer, Erik; Motiwala, Hanif; Laniado, Marc; Karim, Omer",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2012.10.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23116657/,328
101405,Violence against women in the covid-19 pandemic: we need upstream approaches to break the intergenerational cycle.,2020-06-15,"The adaption of pathogens to their host(s) is a major factor in the emergence of infectious disease and the persistent survival of many of the infectious diseases within the population. Since many of the smaller viral pathogens are entirely dependent upon host machinery, it has been postulated that they are under selection for a composition similar to that of their host. Analyses of sequence composition have been conducted for numerous small viral species including the Flavivirus genus. Examination of the species within this particular genus that infect vertebrate hosts revealed that sequence composition proclivities do not correspond with vector transmission as the evolutionary history of this species suggests. Recent sequencing efforts have generated complete genomes for many viral species including members of the Flavivirus genus. A thorough comparison of the sequence composition was conducted for all of the available Flaviviruses for which the complete genome is publicly available. This effort expands the work of previous studies to include new vector-borne species as well as members of the insect-specific group which previously have not been explored. Metrics, including mono-, di-, and tri-nucleotide abundances as well as N(C) values and codon usage preferences, were explored both for the entire polyprotein sequence as well as for each individual coding region. Preferences for compositions correspond to host-range rather than evolutionary history; species which infect vertebrate hosts exhibited particular preferences similar to each other as well as in correspondence with their host's preferences. Flaviviruses which do not infect vertebrate hosts, however, did not show these proclivities, with the exception of the Kamiti River virus suggesting its recent (either past or present) infectivity of an unknown vertebrate host.","Schubert, Alyxandria M; Putonti, Catherine","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2009.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19914402/,328

To address the challenge of finding druggable sites, we developed a machine-learning algorithm called TACTICS (trajectory-based analysis of conformations to identify cryptic sites), which uses an ensemble of molecular structures (such as molecular dynamics simulation data) as input. First, TACTICS uses k-means clustering to select a small number of conformations that represent the overall conformational heterogeneity of the data. Then, TACTICS uses a random forest model to identify potentially bindable residues in each selected conformation, based on protein motion and geometry. Lastly, residues in possible binding pockets are scored using fragment docking. As proof-of-principle, TACTICS was applied to the analysis of simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and methyltransferase and the Yersinia pestis aryl carrier protein. Our approach recapitulates known small-molecule binding sites and predicts the locations of sites not previously observed in experimentally determined structures.

102771,Neurohospitalist Practice and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-10-01,"Nuclear medicine technologists and investigators who perform imaging procedures in clinical trials often have not received training on clinical research regulations, such as Title 21, part 312, of the Code of Federal Regulations or Good Clinical Practices. These regulations directly affect implementation of the therapeutic or imaging protocol. Lack of understanding of the regulatory expectations in clinical research can lead to unintended errors or omissions in critical data that are needed for development of a new drug. One common error is not following the protocol exactly as written, or modifying the imaging parameters in some way as to make the data nonstandard from site to site. These errors and omissions are a source of delay in the development of new imaging and therapeutic products. Although not following the protocol does not result in criminal penalties per se, errors and omissions can lead to regulatory consequences such as warning letters to the investigator or sponsor, which if not resolved can lead to barring a site or investigator from participation in any future research trials. Pharmaceutical sponsors, device sponsors, and federal granting agencies such as the National Cancer Institute enter into contracts with imaging sites under the expectation that the investigator and all research staff know and understand clinical research regulations. This article is intended to teach imaging personnel what any sponsor (pharmaceutical, device, or federal agency) is expecting from research imaging and how lack of understanding of Good Clinical Practices and federal regulations can impede the optimal success of a research study.

105186,Prescription Fill Patterns for Commonly Used Drugs During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States.,2020-05-28,"PURPOSE Vascular encasement or infiltration of the portomesenteric veins can compromise resectability and local tumour control in pancreatic resections. So far, there is no consensus on how vascular reconstruction should be performed. Bovine pericardium has shown promising results, particularly in infected arterial vascular reconstructions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and technical success of portomesenteric venous vascular reconstruction using bovine pericardium in pancreatic resections. METHODS Retrospective analysis of portomesenteric reconstruction using bovine pericardium (patches, self-made tube grafts) in pancreatic resections between 2014 and 2019. The primary endpoint examined was the technical success rate and short-term patency of vascular reconstruction. In addition to clinical surveillance and laboratory routine testing, patency was tested with duplex scans (4 h postoperatively) and computed tomography imaging in case of an abnormal clinical course and as part of the oncological follow-up. RESULTS In 15 surgical procedures (pancreaticoduodenectomy (12, 80%), pancreatic left resection (3, 20%)), vascular reconstruction was performed with superior mesenteric vein (6/15), portal vein (7/15) and the junction between superior mesenteric and splenic vein (2/15). Eighty percent of the reconstructions were tube grafts (12/15), and the remaining were patch plasties. In 13/15 (87%) of the cases, the vascular reconstruction was patent; in 2/15 (13%), there was one stenosis without reintervention need and one graft failure with complete thrombosis. Out of 15 patients, 4 major complications according to Clavien-Dindo classification (IIIa n = 2, 13%; IIIb n = 1, 7%; V n = 1, 7%) were documented. Latest re-imaging after surgery among the 10 patients with imaging follow-up more than 1 month postoperatively was after 6.5 months ((median, interquartile range 4-12 months), and clinical follow-up was at 6.7 months (median, 3.3-13 months)). CONCLUSION Due to its off-the-shelf availability, portomesenteric reconstruction using bovine pericardium seems to be a feasible and safe method in pancreatic resection with vascular encasement. Xenopericardial grafts can be crafted to any size and are applicable in potentially infected environment.","Burla, Laurin; Schwegler, Igor; Weibel, Pascal; Weber, Markus; Zientara, Alicja; Attigah, Nicolas",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-020-01920-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32607839/,328

However, whether it is involved in the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. We explored the expression, biological role, and associated mechanisms of C5AR1 in HBV-related hepatoma cells. Materials and Methods The expression of C5ΑR1 mediated by HBV and HBV core protein (HBc) was detected in hepatoma cells. The function of nuclear factor кB (NF-κB) pathway in HBc-induced C5AR1 expression was assessed. The roles of C5ΑR1 in the activation of intracellular signal pathways, the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, and the growth and migration of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc, were investigated. The effect of C5α in the development of HCC mediated by C5AR1 was also measured. Results C5ΑR1 expression was increased in HBV-positive hepatoma cells. Dependent on HBc, HBV enhanced the expression of C5ΑR1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Besides, HBc could promote C5ΑR1 expression via the NF-κB pathway. Based on the C5ΑR1, HBc facilitated the activation of JNK and ERK pathways and the expression and secretion of interleukin-6 in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, C5ΑR1 was responsible for enhancing the growth and migration of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc. Except these, C5α could promote the malignant development of HBc-positive HCC via C5AR1. Conclusion We provide new insight into the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis mediated by HBc. C5ΑR1 has a significant role in the functional abnormality of hepatoma cells mediated by HBc, and might be utilized as a potential therapeutic target for HBV-related HCC.","Kong, Fanyun; Tao, Yukai; Yuan, Dongchen; Zhang, Ning; Li, Qi; Yu, Tong; Yang, Xiaoying; Kong, Delong; Ding, Xiaohui; Liu, Xiangye; You, Hongjuan; Zheng, Kuiyang; Tang, Renxian",Cancer research and treatment : official journal of Korean Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.4143/crt.2020.397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197304/,328

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included data from 248 ablation sessions for lung tumors in 164 patients (92 men; mean age, 59.7 y ± 9.8): 200 RF ablations (80.6%) and 48 MW ablations (19.4%). Pneumothorax was classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Twelve patients developed mild pneumothorax and were observed for further complications, and 33 developed moderate or severe pneumothorax and were managed with percutaneous aspiration of the pneumothorax. The decision to abort or continue ablation was determined based on clinical response to percutaneous aspiration, clinical distress, and feasibility of applying the applicator within the lesion. RESULTS Incidence of pneumothorax was 18.1% (45 of 248 sessions), with four (8.9%) occurrences during MW ablation and 41 (91.1%) during RF ablation. Pneumothoraces were mild in 12 sessions (26.7%), moderate in 27 (60%), and severe in six (13.3%). Complete evacuation of the pneumothorax was achieved in 25 of 33 sessions (75.8%). Intercostal tube drainage was indicated in eight sessions (24.2%), including six severe and two moderate pneumothoraces. Pneumothorax evolved immediately after thoracic puncture in 10 patients. Ablation therapy was aborted in two sessions in which severe pneumothorax occurred, and an intercostal chest tube was inserted. CONCLUSIONS Mild pneumothorax can be managed by close observation without interruption of ablation therapy. Manual evacuation was an effective strategy for management of moderate pneumothorax and allowed for adequate positioning of the electrode, but did not suffice for severe and progressive pneumothorax, which required placement of an intercostal chest tube.","Nour-Eldin, Nour-Eldin; Naguib, Nagy N N; Tawfik, Ahmed M; Koitka, Karen; Saeed, Ahmed S; Vogl, Thomas J",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2011.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21856506/,328
106988,Communication for Awareness and Action on Inequitable Impacts of COVID-19 on Latinos.,2020-08-07,"Paramylon is a novel β-glucan that is stored by Euglena gracilis Z, which is a unicellular photosynthesizing green alga with characteristics of both animals and plants. Recent studies have indicated that paramylon functions as an immunomodulator or a dietary fiber. Currently, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem, and there is no effective preventive treatment for CKD progression. However, paramylon may suppress the progression of CKD via the elimination of uremic toxins or modulation of gut microbiota, leading to the alleviation of inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of paramylon in CKD rat model. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats with a 5/6 nephrectomy were given either a normal diet or a diet containing 5% paramylon for 8 weeks. Proteinuria was measured intermittently. Serum and kidney tissues were harvested after sacrifice. We performed a renal molecular and histopathological investigation, serum metabolome analysis, and gut microbiome analysis. The results showed that paramylon attenuated renal function, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, and podocyte injury in the CKD rat model. Renal fibrosis, tubulointerstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression levels tended to be suppressed with paramylon treatment. Further, paramylon inhibited the accumulation of uremic toxins, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-related metabolites and modulated a part of CKD-related gut microbiota in the CKD rat model. In conclusion, we suggest that paramylon mainly inhibited the absorption of non-microbiota-derived uremic solutes, leading to protect renal injury via anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. Paramylon may be a novel compound that can act against CKD progression.","Nagayama, Yoshikuni; Isoo, Naoyuki; Nakashima, Ayaka; Suzuki, Kengo; Yamano, Mizuki; Nariyama, Tomoyuki; Yagame, Motoka; Matsui, Katsuyuki",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764782/,328
108061,Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic in Nigeria: Preventive and Control Challenges within the First Two Months of Outbreak.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND The history of discovery of analgesic drugs has followed a trajectory from original serendipitous discovery of plant-derived substances to laboratory creation of customized molecules that are intentionally designed to interact with specific receptors of neurotransmitters involved in either the transmission of the pain signal or the attenuation of such a signal. The drugs most recently developed have been designed to provide incremental greater separation between pain relief and adverse effects. The result has been drugs that have individualized pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics that represent specific advances in basic science and translate into unique clinical profiles. Several of the drugs include non-opioid components. They retain some of the features of opioids, but have distinct clinical characteristics that differentiate them from traditional opioids. Thus they defy simple classification as opioids. SCOPE A summary is provided of the development of the modern view of multi-mechanistic pain and its treatment using analgesics that have multi-mechanisms of action (consisting of both opioid and non-opioid components). Descriptions of examples of such current analgesics and of those that have pharmacokinetic characteristics that result in atypical opioid clinical profiles are given. FINDINGS By serendipity or design, several current strong analgesics have opioid components of action, but have an additional non-opioid mechanism of action or some pharmacokinetic feature that gives them an atypical opioid clinical profile and renders them not easily classified as classical opioids. CONCLUSION An appreciation that there are now opioid analgesics that differentiate from classical opioids in ways that defy their simplistic classification as opioids suggests that recognition of subclasses of opioid analgesics would be more accurate scientifically and would be more informative for healthcare providers and regulators. This would likely lead to positive outcomes for the clinical use and regulatory control of the current drugs, and provide direction/strategy for the discovery of new drugs.","Raffa, Robert B",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1185/03007995.2014.952717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105308/,328
108396,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Vulnerable Older Adults in the United States.,2020-06-05,"INTRODUCTION Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is safely used for treatment of psychosomatic disorders. Despite being associated with a low side effect profile, it has been reported to cause hematological side effects including vaginal bleeding, epistaxis, purpura, hematuria, intracranial bleeding, and rectal bleeding. Isolated breast ecchymosis is one of exceedingly rare SSRI-induced hematological abnormalities. PRESENTATION OF CASE In this case study, we report a case of left breast ecchymosis in a 75-year-old woman that developed in conjunction with use of the SSRI fluoxetine. DISCUSSION The use of SSRIs has surged over the past decades due to increased diagnosis and focus on clinical management of depression and anxiety disorders, especially in developed nations. The low side effect profiles of the eight currently marketed SSRI agents has further promoted their use in the general population. While the most commonly reported side effects are mild and relatively tolerable, a risk of SSRI-related abnormal bleeding exists and may represent a life-threatening side effect. The most frequent SSRI-related bleeding manifestation is ecchymosis, but cases of isolated breast ecchymosis are exceedingly rare and to date only one report of SSRI-induced breast ecchymosis is included in the publicly available literature. CONCLUSION Three factors may have played a role in lack of reports describing SSRI-induced breast ecchymosis in literature. First, SSRIs indeed very seldom cause breast ecchymosis; second, physicians are not aware of such a causal relationship; and third, physicians find this side effect not worth to publish.","Akbulut, Sami; Yagmur, Yusuf; Gumus, Serdar; Babur, Mehmet",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2014.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548990/,328

108841,Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak: How Did Educated Brazilians Behave?,2021-04-27,"Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses have genomes that are potentially capable of forming complex secondary structures through Watson-Crick base pairing between their constituent nucleotides. A few of the structural elements formed by such base pairings are, in fact, known to have important functions during the replication of many ssDNA viruses. Unknown, however, are (i) whether numerous additional ssDNA virus genomic structural elements predicted to exist by computational DNA folding methods actually exist and (ii) whether those structures that do exist have any biological relevance. We therefore computationally inferred lists of the most evolutionarily conserved structures within a diverse selection of animal- and plant-infecting ssDNA viruses drawn from the families Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Parvoviridae, Nanoviridae, and Geminiviridae and analyzed these for evidence of natural selection favoring the maintenance of these structures. While we find evidence that is consistent with purifying selection being stronger at nucleotide sites that are predicted to be base paired than at sites predicted to be unpaired, we also find strong associations between sites that are predicted to pair with one another and site pairs that are apparently coevolving in a complementary fashion. Collectively, these results indicate that natural selection actively preserves much of the pervasive secondary structure that is evident within eukaryote-infecting ssDNA virus genomes and, therefore, that much of this structure is biologically functional. Lastly, we provide examples of various highly conserved but completely uncharacterized structural elements that likely have important functions within some of the ssDNA virus genomes analyzed here.","Muhire, Brejnev Muhizi; Golden, Michael; Murrell, Ben; Lefeuvre, Pierre; Lett, Jean-Michel; Gray, Alistair; Poon, Art Y F; Ngandu, Nobubelo Kwanele; Semegni, Yves; Tanov, Emil Pavlov; Monjane, Adérito Luis; Harkins, Gordon William; Varsani, Arvind; Shepherd, Dionne Natalie; Martin, Darren Patrick",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03031-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24284329/,328

We investigated the therapeutic potential of (186)ReO(4)(-) in NIS-transfected neuroendocrine tumour tissue. METHODS For experiments, the stably NIS-transfected pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer cell line Bon1C was used. NIS-mediated internalization and externalization experiments in vitro and a biodistribution study in nude mice bearing Bon1C xenografts were performed. A therapy study was also conducted consecutively in nude mice xenografted with Bon1C in which the mice were injected intravenously with Na(186)ReO(4). RESULTS In vitro studies showed exponential internalization and efflux kinetics of (186)ReO(4)(-) in the cell line. The biodistribution study showed high uptake of (186)ReO(4)(-) in NIS-expressing tumours. Tumour growth inhibition was significant after injection of (186)ReO(4) in two groups of animals treated with activity levels below the determined maximum tolerable activity as compared to controls.

109192,Personal journey and perspective from psychiatric nurse and medical student to intern doctor during COVID-19 - CORRIGENDUM.,2021-06-07,"Coronavirus (CoV) transcription requires a high-frequency recombination process that links newly synthesized minus-strand subgenomic RNA copies to the leader region, which is present only once, at the 5' end of the genome. This discontinuous RNA synthesis step is based on the complementarity between the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) at the leader region and those preceding each gene in the nascent minus-strand RNA. Furthermore, the template switch requires the physical proximity of RNA genome domains located between 20,000 and 30,000 nucleotides apart. In this report, it is shown that the efficacy of this recombination step is promoted by novel additional long-distance RNA-RNA interactions between RNA motifs located close to the TRSs controlling the expression of each gene and their complementary sequences mapping close to the 5' end of the genome. These interactions would bring together the motifs involved in the recombination process. This finding indicates that the formation of high-order RNA structures in the CoV genome is necessary to control the expression of at least the viral N gene. The requirement of these long-distance interactions for transcription was shown by the engineering of CoV replicons in which the complementarity between the newly identified sequences was disrupted. Furthermore, disruption of complementarity in mutant viruses led to mutations that restored complementarity, wild-type transcription levels, and viral titers by passage in cell cultures. The relevance of these high-order structures for virus transcription is reinforced by the phylogenetic conservation of the involved RNA motifs in CoVs.","Mateos-Gomez, Pedro A; Morales, Lucia; Zuñiga, Sonia; Enjuanes, Luis; Sola, Isabel",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01782-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23055566/,328

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia may improve outcomes, but optimal methods to ensure implementation of guidelines in the intensive care unit are unclear. Hence, we determined the effect of educational sessions augmented with reminders, and led by local opinion leaders, as strategies to implement evidence-based ventilator-associated pneumonia guidelines on guideline concordance and ventilator-associated pneumonia rates. DESIGN Two-year prospective, multicenter, time-series study conducted between June 2007 and December 2009. SETTING Eleven ICUs (ten in Canada, one in the United States); five academic and six community ICUs. PATIENTS At each site, 30 adult patients mechanically ventilated >48 hrs were enrolled during four data collection periods (baseline, 6, 15, and 24 months). INTERVENTION Guideline recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia were implemented using a multifaceted intervention (education, reminders, local opinion leaders, and implementation teams) directed toward the entire multidisciplinary ICU team. Clinician exposure to the intervention was assessed at 6, 15, and 24 months after the introduction of this intervention. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The main outcome measure was aggregate concordance with the 14 ventilator-associated pneumonia guideline recommendations. One thousand three hundred twenty patients were enrolled (330 in each study period). Clinician exposure to the multifaceted intervention was high and increased during the study: 86.7%, 93.3%, 95.8%, (p < .001), as did aggregate concordance (mean [SD]): 50.7% (6.1), 54.4% (7.1), 56.2% (5.9), 58.7% (6.7) (p = .007). Over the study period, ventilator-associated pneumonia rates decreased (events/330 patients): 47 (14.2%), 34 (10.3%), 38 (11.5%), 29 (8.8%) (p = .03).

Clinically, COVID-19 shows a broad range of manifestations: from asymptomatic to severe and possibly lethal interstitial pneumonia. Several studies suggested the involvement of Vitamin-D (VitD) in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infections/severity. However, most of them are based on circumstantial evidences, like the association between latitude-related sunlight exposure and mortality rate, while studies based on patients' VitD measurements are still scarce. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the VitD levels (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin-D) from a cohort of 347 patients admitted to a northern Italian Hospital as suspected COVID-19s. Of them, 128 were positive (83 males, aged 62.7 ± 14.2 and 45 females, aged 69.3 ± 15.6) and 219 were negative (107 males, aged 62.8 ± 19.5 and 112 females, aged 54.3 ± 20.1). The averaged VitD levels were similar in the two groups: 21.8 ± 16.1 ng/mL and 22.8 ± 14.0 ng/mL for the COVID-19 positive and negative group respectively (p-value: 0.39), as well as the percentage of individuals having VitD levels below 30 ng/mL: 78.9% and 73.5% for the COVID-19 positive and negative group respectively. Because a large portion of patients were below the suggested 30 ng/mL threshold, we can't exclude that VitD supplementation, restoring normal levels, might be beneficial in reducing the risk of infection.","Ferrari, Davide; Locatelli, Massimo",International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Our project assessed the uptake of proposed interventions to mitigate absenteeism in hospital workers during a pandemic. METHODS Focus groups were followed by an Internet-based survey of a convenience sample frame of 17,000 hospital workers across 5 large urban facilities. Employees were asked to select their top barrier to reporting for duty and to score their willingness to work before and after a series of interventions were offered to mitigate it. RESULTS Overall, 2864 responses were analyzed. Safety concerns were the most frequently cited top barrier to reporting for work, followed by issues of dependent care and transportation. Significant increases in employee willingness to work scores were observed from mitigation strategies that included preferential access to antiviral medication or personal protective equipment for the employee as well as their immediate family. CONCLUSIONS The knowledge base on workforce absenteeism during disasters is growing, although in general this issue is underrepresented in emergency planning efforts. Our data suggest that a mitigation strategy that includes options for preferential access to either antiviral therapy, protective equipment, or both for the employee as well as his or her immediate family will have the greatest impact. These findings likely have import for other disasters involving contamination or contagion, and in critical infrastructure sectors beyond health care.","Garrett, Andrew L; Park, Yoon Soo; Redlener, Irwin",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1097/dmp.0b013e3181c12959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19952885/,328

115784,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Use of Telemedicine Services in an Academic Medical Center.,2021-05-27,"We examined flow characteristics and recirculation of a novel dialysis catheter with helically contoured lumens, which optimize the vectors of blood entering and leaving the device. Computational flow dynamics were used to measure shear stress, residence time (RT), Platelet Lysis Index (PLI), and recirculation of the study catheter, termed the VectorFlow catheter, compared with the Palindrome catheter. Bench and animal models were used to measure recirculation compared with other dialysis catheter designs. The VectorFlow catheter was associated with an 18% reduction in mean shear stress compared with the Palindrome catheter, at 13.6 and 16.6 Pa, respectively. Low PLI was seen with the VectorFlow (PLI = 0.019) and Palindrome (PLI = 0.015) catheters. The VectorFlow catheter was associated with a % RT >0.030 seconds of 1.2%, compared to 0.9% for the Palindrome. Calculated recirculation of the VectorFlow, Palindrome, and step-tip catheter designs in reversed position were 1.2 × 10(-4) %, 0.039%, and 13.6%, respectively. In vitro, the VectorFlow catheter had no detectable recirculation (0%) compared to 7.3-9.5% with the Palindrome at flow rates of 400-600 ml/minute. In vivo, the VectorFlow catheter had no detectable recirculation, compared to 6.7-12% for the Palindrome. The VectorFlow catheter was associated with an absence of detectable recirculation with favorable flow dynamics.","Clark, Timothy W I; Van Canneyt, Koen; Verdonck, Pascal",Seminars in dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1525-139x.2012.01052.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22353667/,328

Low-dose computed tomography screening can reduce lung cancer-specific mortality by 20%. METHOD The American Association for Thoracic Surgery created a multispecialty task force to create screening guidelines for groups at high risk of developing lung cancer and survivors of previous lung cancer. RESULTS The American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines call for annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography screening for North Americans from age 55 to 79 years with a 30 pack-year history of smoking. Long-term lung cancer survivors should have annual low-dose computed tomography to detect second primary lung cancer until the age of 79 years. Annual low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening should be offered starting at age 50 years with a 20 pack-year history if there is an additional cumulative risk of developing lung cancer of 5% or greater over the following 5 years. Lung cancer screening requires participation by a subspecialty-qualified team. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery will continue engagement with other specialty societies to refine future screening guidelines.

116705,COVID-19 and the Urgent Need for New Therapies for Obesity.,2021-03-30,"Measurement of peripheral venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is currently performed using invasive catheters or direct blood draw. The purpose of this study was to non-invasively determine SvO2 using a variation of pulse oximetry techniques. Artificial respiration-like modulations applied to the peripheral vascular system were used to infer regional SvO2 using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. To achieve this modulation, an artificial pulse generating system (APG) was developed to generate controlled, superficial perturbations on the finger using a pneumatic digit cuff. These low pressure and low frequency modulations affect blood volumes in veins to a much greater extent than arteries due to significant arterial-venous compliance differences. Ten healthy human volunteers were recruited for proof-ofconcept testing. The APG was set at a modulation frequency of 0.2 Hz (12 bpm) and 45-50 mmHg compression pressure. Initial analysis showed that induced blood volume changes in the venous compartment could be detected by PPG. Estimated arterial oxygen saturation (97% [IQR=96.1%-97.4%]) matches published values (95%-99%). Estimated venous oxygen saturation (93.2% [IQR=91.-93.9%]) agrees with reported ranges (92%-95%) measured in peripheral regions. The median difference between the two saturations was 3.6%, while the difference between paired measurements in each subject was statistically significant (p=0.002). These results demonstrate the feasibility of this method for real-time, low cost, non-invasive estimation of SvO2. Further validation of this method is warranted.","Khan, Musabbir; Pretty, Christopher G; Amies, Alexander C; Elliott, Rodney B; Suhaimi, Fatanah M; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Chase, J Geoffrey",Conference proceedings : ...

Indeed, over the past two decades, several outbreaks and pandemics, from SARS to Ebola, have tested our ability to respond to a disease threat and provided the opportunity to refine our preparedness systems. However, when a novel coronavirus with human-to-human transmissibility emerged in China in 2019, many of these systems were found lacking. From international disputes over data and resources to individual disagreements over the effectiveness of facemasks, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed several vulnerabilities. As of early November 2020, the WHO has confirmed over 46 million cases and 1.2 million deaths worldwide. While the world will likely be reeling from the effects of COVID-19 for months, and perhaps years, to come, one key question must be asked, How can we do better next time?

118990,The psychological effects of COVID-19 spread in young Canadian adults.,2021-02-21,"Proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is a widespread temperature-dependent disease in salmonids caused by the myxozoan parasite, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae (Canning, Curry, Feist, Longshaw et Okamura, 1999) (Tb). Tb has a two-host life cycle, involving fish as an intermediate host and freshwater bryozoans as the definitive host. Although salmonids are acknowledged as hosts for the parasite, it is less clear which fish species are active hosts in the life cycle of Tb. Differences in infection dynamics have been observed between some fish species, which are thought to be related to the existence of two main Tb-strains, the American and European. Iceland, having three species of indigenous salmonids and positioned geographically between Europe and North America, is an ideal location to study the natural development of Tb in wild fish. The main aim of this study was to determine the genetic origin of Tb in Iceland and confirm whether mature spores are produced in Icelandic salmonids. In this study, Icelandic salmonids were infected with the European Tb-strain. In situ hybridisation revealed that intraluminal sporogonic stages, including mature spores, were commonly observed in all three salmonid species. The presence of intraluminal stages has previously been confirmed in brown trout Salmo trutta Linnaeus and Atlantic salmon S. salar Linnaeus in Europe, but they have only been observed in Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus) in North America, infected by the local strain. This is, therefore, the first time that sporogonic stages have been observed in Arctic charr in Europe, where fish are infected with the European Tb-strain. Our data strongly suggest that all the three salmonid species inhabiting Icelandic waters serve as active hosts in the life cycle of Tb. However, for full confirmation, transmission trials are needed.","Svavarsdottir, Fjola Rut; Freeman, Mark A; Antonsson, Thorolfur; Arnason, Fridhthjofur; Kristmundsson, Arni",Folia parasitologica,https://doi.org/10.14411/fp.2021.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400591/,328

However, no prevalence estimates of multimorbid LSS and knee and/or hip OA are currently available. The primary objective of this systematic review is therefore to estimate the prevalence of multimorbid LSS with knee and/or hip OA using radiological, clinical, and combined case definitions. METHODS This systematic review protocol has been designed according to the guidelines from the Cochrane Collaboration and is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols. A comprehensive search will be performed in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL. Forward citation tracking will be performed in Web of Science. No restriction for publication date and language will be applied in the literature search, but only articles in English will be included. The search strategy will include the following domains: LSS, knee OA, and hip OA. Retrieved citations will be screened by two authors independently. Disagreements will be discussed until consensus, and a third reviewer will be consulted if consensus cannot be reached. Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias assessment will be done by two authors independently, using a standardized data extraction form and a modified risk of bias tool for prevalence studies. Meta-analysis estimating prevalence with 95% CI will be performed using a random effects model. Meta-regression analyses will be performed to investigate the impact of the following covariates: LSS clinical presentations, sample population, healthcare setting, risk of bias, and other patient characteristics on prevalence estimates for multimorbid LSS and knee and/or hip OA. DISCUSSION The results of this review will provide the first estimates of the prevalence of multimorbid LSS and hip and knee OA based on various case definitions.

METHODS We performed RFA using a 3D navigation system on 32 patients with clinically and radiologically diagnosed OO. This study included 25 males and 7 females with a median age of 20 years (range, 10-39 years). The median duration of follow-up was 18 months (range, 1-65 months). We investigated technical specifications, tumor localization, technical success, clinical success, biopsy success, complications, incomplete treatment, and recurrences. RESULTS Eighteen tumors were located in the femur, seven in the tibia, two in the humerus, and one each in the fibula, scapula, patella, lumbar vertebra, and acetabula. All procedures were technically successful, and pain relief was achieved in all patients. However, local recurrence developed in one patient, needing additional RFA. The clinical success rate was 96.8%. Biopsy showed OO in 12 patients (37%). Complications occurred in three patients (9%), two cases of fractures and one of osteomyelitis. CONCLUSIONS A 3D navigation provides real-time imaging and enables us to set the RFA needle in the correct position, particularly in case of OO-aroused complex anatomical structures. Our initial results indicated that radiofrequency ablation using a 3D navigation system is feasible and safe for patients with OO.","Outani, Hidetatsu; Hamada, Kenichiro; Takenaka, Satoshi; Imura, Yoshinori; Oshima, Kazuya; Sotobori, Tsukasa; Naka, Norifumi; Araki, Nobuhito; Yoshikawa, Hideki; Myoui, Akira",Journal of orthopaedic science : official journal of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jos.2016.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27320819/,328

AIM To explore the relationship between biopsy location, histological disease activity, proinflammatory gene expression and the presence of inflammatory cells. METHODS Fifty-one patients with Crohn's disease and ulcers >0.5 cm diameter in the colon and/or ileum were prospectively enrolled at three centres. Biopsies were obtained from 0 mm, 7 to 8 mm and 21 to 24 mm from the edge of the largest ulcer. Histological activity was blindly assessed with the Global Histological Disease Activity Score, the Robarts Histopathology and Nancy Histological indices. Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels for interleukins-6, -8 and -23 (p19 and p40 subunits), CD31 and S100A9 were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The number of CD3+, CD68+ and myeloperoxidase-positive cells was quantified by immunohistochemistry. Data were analysed using mixed models with location and segment as fixed effects and patients as random effect to account for correlation among segments within a patient. RESULTS Histological disease activity scores (P < 0.0001), proinflammatory gene expression levels (P < 0.005) and numbers of myeloperoxidase-positive cells (P < 0.0001) were highest in biopsies from the ulcer edge in the colon and ileum, with decreasing gradients observed with distance from the edge (P < 0.05). No differences between colonic and ileal samples were detected for the parameters measured at any location. CONCLUSIONS Biopsies from the ulcer edge in patients with Crohn's disease yielded the greatest histological disease activity and mRNA levels and had similar readouts in the colon and ileum.

This was a retrospective cohort study based on administrative data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 2016 and 2017. Patients with a primary (first-listed) diagnosis of acute PE who were not in shock and not on a ventilator who did not have acute cor pulmonale were defined as low-risk. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases-10-Clinical Modification Codes. Mortality was assessed according to treatment with catheter-directed thrombolysis, intravenous thrombolytic therapy, or anticoagulants alone. Mortality with inferior vena cava (IVC) filters was also assessed. Mortality was lowest in low-risk patients treated with anticoagulants alone, 6,765 of 331,430 (2.0%). Mortality was somewhat higher with catheter-directed thrombolysis, 195 of 6915 (2.8%)(p<0.0001), and highest with intravenous thrombolysis 510 of 5,200 (9.8%)(p<0.0001). Matched patients showed similar results. Inferior vena cava filters did not reduce mortality in patients treated with anticoagulants alone. Mortality was only 0.5% higher in patients treated with anticoagulants who had saddle PE than in patients with non-saddle PE, 450 of 17,935 (2.5%) vs 6,315 of 313,495 (2.0%)(p<0.0001). However, a larger proportion of low-risk patients with saddle PE received catheter-directed thrombolysis than patients who had non-saddle PE, 2,330 of 21,760 (11%) vs 4,585 of 321,785 (1.4%)(p<0.0001).

127500,"Trust, efficacy and ethicacy when testing prisoners for COVID-19.",2021-03-10,"BACKGROUND We previously reported the use of an inverted T-shaped method to obtain a suitable view for hand sewing to close the common entry hole when the linear stapler was fired for esophagojejunostomy after laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG). This conventional method involved insertion of the fixed cartridge fork to the Roux limb and the fine movable anvil fork to the esophagus to avoid perforation of the jejunum. However, insertion of the movable anvil fork to the esophagus during this procedure often requires us to strongly push down the main body of the stapler with the fixed cartridge fork to bring the direction of the anvil fork in line with the direction of the long axis of the esophagus while controlling the opening of the movable anvil fork. We therefore modified this complicated inverted T-shaped method using a linear stapler with a movable cartridge fork. This modified method involved insertion of the movable cartridge fork into the Roux limb followed by natural, easy insertion of the fixed anvil fork into the esophagus without controlling the opening of the movable cartridge fork. METHODS We performed LTG in a total of 155 consecutive patients with gastric cancer from November 2007 to December 2015 in Kyushu University Hospital. After LTG, we performed the conventional inverted T-shaped method using a linear stapler with a fixed cartridge fork in 61 patients from November 2007 to July 2011 (fixed cartridge group). From August 2011, we used a linear stapler with a movable cartridge fork and performed the modified inverted T-shaped method in 94 patients (movable cartridge group). We herein compare the short-term outcomes in 94 cases of LTG using the modified method (movable cartridge fork) with those in 61 cases using the conventional method (fixed cartridge fork). RESULTS We found no significant differences in the perioperative or postoperative events between the movable and fixed cartridge groups. One case of anastomotic leakage occurred in the fixed cartridge group, but no anastomotic leakage occurred in the movable cartridge group. CONCLUSIONS Although there were no remarkable differences in the short-term outcomes between the movable and fixed cartridge groups, we believe that the modified inverted T-shaped method is technically more feasible and reliable than the conventional method and will contribute to the improved safety of LTG.","Ohuchida, Kenoki; Nagai, Eishi; Moriyama, Taiki; Shindo, Koji; Manabe, Tatsuya; Ohtsuka, Takao; Shimizu, Shuji; Nakamura, Masafumi",Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,https://doi.org/10.21037/tgh.2017.04.08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28616606/,328

METHODS All patients enrolled in this study were diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 21, 2020 to April 14, 2020 in Wuhan. We retrospectively analyzed the patients admitted to the ICU (137 patients) and general wards (114 patients) of Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital in China. The population characteristics, symptoms, and laboratory examination results between the patients in the ICU and those in the general wards were compared. Furthermore, the differences between the deceased patients in the ICU and those discharged from the ICU were compared. RESULTS There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, no presence of complications, presence of 1 complication, and presence of 3 or more complications (P<0.05). There were also significant differences between the patients in terms of the laboratory examination results including elevated urea nitrogen, creatinine, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-α, troponin I, phosphokinase isoenzyme-MB, and B-type natriuretic peptide; and decreased platelets, lymphocyte absolute value, and eosinophil absolute value (<0.05). There were 45 patients who died in ICU and 57 improved and discharged patients. There were significant differences between the two groups in the number of patients that had 1 complication and 3 or more complications (P<0.05). There were also significant differences in the laboratory examination results between the patients including elevated urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, procalcitonin, white blood cells, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, phosphokinase isoenzyme-MB, and B-type natriuretic peptide; and decreased platelets and eosinophil absolute value (P<0.05).

129415,Urban to rural COVID-19 progression in India: The role of massive migration and the challenge to India's traditional labour force policies.,2021-09-14,"BACKGROUND Keloids represent a challenging problem. Surgical excision remains the definitive treatment for immediate lesion debulking, but recurrence rates are reported to be 45 to 100 percent. The authors present a staged reconstructive approach using a dermal regeneration substrate and epidermal grafting to minimize recurrence and donor-site morbidity. METHODS Keloids were completely excised down to normal subcutaneous tissue or perichondrium. A bilaminar dermal regeneration matrix was approximated to the entire wound, with the silicone lamina oriented superficially. Reconstruction was delayed for at least 21 days to allow for neodermal ingrowth. The silicone lamina was then removed, and an epidermal skin graft was harvested from the thigh and secured to the neodermis with nonocclusive dressing. Reconstructed defects and donor sites were assessed for recurrence of keloids and scar appearance. RESULTS Five patients underwent treatment; two had keloids involving the superior helix of the ear (average area, 2.6 cm), two had keloids involving the chest (average area, 28 cm), and one had a keloid in the pubic region (area, 10 cm). All had failed at least one previous treatment with direct excision and steroid injections. Mean follow-up was 48.8 weeks (range, 38 to 60 weeks). Average time to complete wound epithelialization was 5.5 weeks. There were no infections or cellulitis. All reconstructed defects were aesthetically acceptable and remained flat without significant widening. There were no long-term complaints of pruritus or pain and there was no evidence of donor-site scarring. CONCLUSIONS Epidermal grafting provides significant advantages when used with a dermal regeneration matrix. This approach obviates reliance on skin creep and flap undermining to achieve primary closure. Exclusion of dermis and significant extracellular matrix components limits contracture, further facilitating tension-free wound healing. Scarring response within the donor site and graft is also minimized.

We review here the current treatment options for non-influenza respiratory viruses and promising candidate antiviral agents currently in development. RECENT FINDINGS Small molecule antiviral agents active against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), such as ALS-8176 and GS-5806, show considerable promise in challenge studies and are undergoing late-phase clinical trials in hospitalised adults and children. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) active against non-influenza respiratory viruses are broadly at a preclinical stage. Broad-spectrum antivirals, such as favipiravir and nitrazoxanide, have potential utility in treating illness caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses but further definitive clinical trials are needed. SUMMARY Severe non-influenza respiratory virus infection is common and current treatment is largely supportive. Ribavirin is used in immunocompromised patients but its use is limited by toxicity and the evidence for its efficacy is weak. Effective antiviral treatment for RSV may shortly become available, pending the results of ongoing clinical trials. For other non-influenza viruses, effective treatments may become available in the medium term. Early detection of respiratory viruses with rapid molecular test platforms will be crucial in differentiating virus types and directing the prompt initiation of novel treatments when available.","Brendish, Nathan J; Clark, Tristan W",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29095723/,328

Most (20,411) cases are from the state of Victoria. In response to rising infections and community transmission in July 2020, on 2nd August several restrictions were imposed for the following 111 days, including an 8pm curfew, a travel restriction to 5km from home, and closure of non-essential services. It is unknown how this affected people living with HIV (PLHIV), who already experience disproportionate levels of mental health issues, comorbidity and stigma. An online survey was designed with HIV community-based organisations to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Victorian PLHIV. Participants were recruited voluntarily both through social media and Infectious Diseases clinics at participating hospitals. There were 153 respondents. Most were male (77%), aged between 30 and 60 years (77%), and Australian-born (63%). Forty-three percent, 31%, and 25% reported negative impacts upon personal relationships, employment, and income, respectively. HIV care continued with 95% and 98% being able to access their HIV provider and antiretroviral therapy (ART), respectively. Telehealth was used by 92% and was largely well received. PLHIV reported worry about physical health (68%), mental health (66%), finances (50%) and accommodation (25%). Fifty percent of participants reported weight gain and 27% increased alcohol intake. This study demonstrated the widespread negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PLHIV in Victoria, although provision of HIV care and ART continued uninterrupted. This highlighted the importance of mental health support and social welfare programs during times of healthcare and societal strain.","Weerasuria, Mihiri; Ko, Christy; Ehm, Adam; O'Bryan, Jessica; McMahon, James H; Woolley, Ian; Hoy, Jennifer; Lau, Jillian",AIDS research and human retroviruses,https://doi.org/10.1089/aid.2021.0007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33586997/,328
131149,Family- and Person-Centered Interdisciplinary Telehealth: Policy and Practice Implications Following Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-01,"Dysfunction in T-cell antitumor activity contributes to the tumorigenesis, progression, and poor outcome of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), with this dysfunction resulting from high expression of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) in T cells. However, the molecular mechanisms maintaining high PD-1 expression in T cells have not been fully investigated in ccRCC. Here, we describe a mechanism underlying the regulation of PD-1 at the mRNA level and demonstrated its impact on T-cell dysfunction. Transcriptomic analysis identified a correlation between transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and PDCD1 in ccRCC samples. The mechanism underlying the regulation of PD-1 mRNA was then investigated in vitro and in vivo using syngeneic tumor models. We also observed that TGFβ1 had prognostic significance in ccRCC patients, and its expression was associated with PD-1 mRNA expression. CcRCC-derived TGFβ1 activated P38 and induced the phosphorylation of Ser10 on H3, which recruited p65 to increase SRSF3 and SRSF5 expression in T cells. As a result, the half-life of PD-1 mRNA in T cells was prolonged. SRSF3 coordinated with NXF1 to induce PD-1 mRNA extranuclear transport in T cells. We then demonstrated that TGFβ1 could induce SRSF3 expression to restrict the antitumor activity of T cells, which influenced immunotherapy outcomes in ccRCC mouse models. Our findings highlight that tumor-derived TGFβ1 mediates immune evasion and has potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in ccRCC.","Wu, Pengfei; Geng, Bo; Chen, Qun; Zhao, Enyang; Liu, Jiang; Sun, Chen; Zha, Caijun; Shao, Yong; You, Bosen; Zhang, Wenfu; Li, Lulu; Meng, Xiangqi; Cai, Jinquan; Li, Xuedong",Cancer immunology research,https://doi.org/10.1158/2326-6066.cir-20-0113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32999004/,328
131663,Parents' experiences of accessing respite care for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) at the acute and primary care interface: a systematic review.,2020-05-22,"BACKGROUND Depression and anxiety occur frequently postpartum, calling for early detection and treatment. Evidence on risk factors may support early detection, but is inconclusive. Our aim was to identify risk factors for postpartum depression and anxiety, before, during and after pregnancy. METHODS We used data from 1406 mothers of the intervention arm of the Post-Up study. Risk factors were collected at 3 weeks and 12 months postpartum. Depression and anxiety symptoms were measured in the first month postpartum by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and 6-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), respectively. We used stepwise logistic regression to identify relevant risk factors. RESULTS Of the mothers, 8.0% had EPDS-scores ≥9 and 14.7% STAI-6-scores ≥42. Factors associated with higher risk of depression were: foreign language spoken at home, history of depression, low maternal self-efficacy and poor current health of the mother. No initiation of breastfeeding was associated with lower risk of depression, no breastfeeding at 3 weeks postpartum increased the risk. Factors associated with higher risk of anxiety were: higher educational level, history of depression, preterm birth, negative experience of delivery and first week postpartum, excessive infant crying, low maternal self-efficacy, low partner support and poor current maternal health. LIMITATIONS Use of a self-report instrument, potential bias by postpartum mood status, and no inclusion of emerging depression cases after one month postpartum. CONCLUSIONS The shared and separate risk factors for postpartum depression and anxiety may help professionals in identifying mothers at increased risk and provide opportunities for preventive interventions and treatment.","van der Zee-van den Berg, Angarath I; Boere-Boonekamp, Magda M; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G M; Reijneveld, Sijmen A",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33725615/,328

The aim of this study was to assess the 5-year follow-up after bariatric surgery in a nationwide cohort of patients. METHODS All adult obese patients who had undergone primary bariatric surgery in 2009 in France were included. Data were extracted from the French national health insurance database. Medical follow-up (medical visits, micronutrient supplementation and blood tests) during the first 5 years after bariatric surgery was assessed, and compared with national and international guidelines. RESULTS Some 16 620 patients were included in the study. The percentage of patients with at least one reimbursement for micronutrient supplements decreased between the first and fifth years for iron (from 27.7 to 24.5 per cent; P < 0.001) and calcium (from 14·4 to 7·7 per cent; P < 0·001), but increased for vitamin D (from 33·1 to 34·7 per cent; P < 0·001). The percentage of patients with one or more visits to a surgeon decreased between the first and fifth years, from 87·1 to 29·6 per cent (P < 0·001); similar decreases were observed for visits to a nutritionist/endocrinologist (from 22·8 to 12·4 per cent; P < 0·001) or general practitioner (from 92·6 to 83·4 per cent; P < 0·001). The mean number of visits to a general practitioner was 7·0 and 6·1 in the first and the fifth years respectively. In multivariable analyses, male sex, younger age, absence of type 2 diabetes and poor 1-year follow-up were predictors of poor 5-year follow-up. CONCLUSION Despite clear national and international guidelines, long-term follow-up after bariatric surgery is poor, especially for young men with poor early follow-up.","Thereaux, J; Lesuffleur, T; Païta, M; Czernichow, S; Basdevant, A; Msika, S; Millat, B; Fagot-Campagna, A",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28657109/,328

There is a crucial demand for rapid techniques such as antigen detection test. Considering the different diagnostic accuracy of tests with other respiratory viruses in adults and children, SARS-CoV-2 antigen test must be evaluated specifically in children. METHODS The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott) as a point-of-care test for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to RT-qPCR in a pediatric population. RESULTS Four hundred forty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 18 positive RT-qPCR samples, 14 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 77.7%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION The sensitivity of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is lower in children than in adults.

SOURCES A systemic search using the PubMed MEDLINE database was performed for all Predominantly Antibody Deficiencies (PADs) described in the 2020 IUIS Expert Committee for PID classification system, combined with terms for hypogammaglobulinemia. Search terms for PADs were based on the listed names and affected genes as classified by the IUIS 2020. Abstracts of the results were reviewed to find relevant case series, review articles of PADs associated with infection, opportunistic infection, autoimmunity, cytopenias, malignancies, inflammatory diseases, neurological and respiratory diseases. References from relevant articles were further reviewed for additional references. Relevant findings were grouped in accordance with the IUIS 2020 classification system. Clinical and genetic features, if known, were described. DATA SYNTHESIS PADs refer to impaired antibody production due to molecular defects intrinsic to B cells or a failure of interaction between B and T cells. The patients develop recurrent or chronic infection or respond to the antigens with dysregulation of the immune function, causing severe allergy, autoimmunity, inflammation, lymphoproliferation and malignancy. The diagnosis is a combined exercise of clinical and laboratory investigation similar to that performed by Bruton (1952). In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the experience of XLA and CVID patients has been surprising. Variants in 39 genes were reported as causing PADs, but the clinical heterogeneity within each variant is not clear. CONCLUSION Bruton (1952) used clinical expertise and protein electrophoresis to identify XLA. The IUIS (2020) committee used immunoglobulins and B lymphocyte to characterize PADs. Pediatricians should suspect it to detect it and prevent morbidities that can have an astonishing and irreversible impact on the child's life.","Vilela, Maria Marluce Dos Santos",Jornal de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.10.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245895/,328

METHODS Forty patients (10 females, mean age 72 years), referred to CTA prior to endovascular treatment of PAD, were prospectively included and underwent peripheral CT angiography. A semiautomated toolbox was used to render mpCPRs. Twenty-one arterial segments were defined in each leg; for each segment, the presence of stenosis > 70% was assessed on mpCPRs and axial images by two readers, independently, with digital subtraction angiography as gold standard. RESULTS Both readers reached lower sensitivity (Reader 1: 91 vs. 94%, p = 0.08; Reader 2: 89 vs. 93%, p = 0.03) but significantly higher specificity (Reader 1: 94 vs. 89%, p < 0.01; Reader 2: 96 vs. 95%, p = 0.01) with mpCPRs than with axial images. Reader 1 achieved significantly higher accuracy with mpCPRs (93 vs. 91%, p = 0.02), and Reader 2 had similar overall accuracy in both evaluations (94 vs. 94%, p = 0.96). Both readers read mpCPRs significantly faster than axial images (Reader 1: 5'45″ based on mpCPRs vs. 7'40″ based on axial images; Reader 2: 4'41″ based on mpCPRs vs. 6'57″ based on axial images; p < 0.01).

Washington: The National Academies Press; 2020.",2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND It is known that Vitamin D can increase the body's immunity against some viral infections. Many people around the world have vitamin D deficiency and, therefore, this has become a public concern whether vitamin D is an important factor protecting against COVID-19 infection. In this paper, the data about the roles of vitamin D on immunity and recovery from viral infections, especially novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is reviewed. METHODS The electronic databases of Pubmed, Google Scholar, Research Gate, Excerpta Media Database (EMBASE) and Medical and Health Education (Medrix) were searched. RESULTS Vitamin D is considered an important factor in immune homeostasis. Various effects have been considered for this nutrient on the immune system, particularly because of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and Cytochrome P450 Family 27 Subfamily B Member 1 (CYP27B1) expression in most of the immune cells. Vitamin D can raise cellular immunity, reduce cytokine storm and enhance antioxidants production. It also has modulatory effects on Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and might have protective functions against acute lung injuries, including COVID-19 infection. However, there are some articles against this positive effect. CONCLUSION Vitamin D supplementation is reported to be effective in the enhancement of the immune system and might be effective in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection, especially in those with its deficiency. However, it should be considered that vitamin D deficiency shows the overall health status of the patients and cannot be considered specific for COVID-19 infection.Recent Advances in Anti-Infective Drug Discovery.","Aleebrahim-Dehkordi, Elahe; Deravi, Niloofar; Yaghoobpoor, Shirin; Hooshyar, Dariush; Rafieian-Kopaei, Mahmoud",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612827666210608145236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102962/,328

DESIGN Discussion Paper. DATA SOURCES Scoping reviews that exemplify best practice are explored with reference to the recently updated JBI scoping review guide (2020) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Scoping Review extension (PRISMA-ScR). IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND MIDWIFERY Scoping reviews are an increasingly common form of evidence synthesis. They are used to address broad research questions and to map evidence from a variety of sources. Scoping reviews are a useful form of evidence synthesis for those in nursing and midwifery and present opportunities for researchers to review a broad array of evidence and resources. However, scoping reviews still need to be conducted with rigour and transparency. CONCLUSION This study provides guidance and advice for researchers and clinicians who are preparing to undertake an evidence synthesis and are considering a scoping review methodology in the field of nursing and midwifery. IMPACT With the increasing popularity of scoping reviews, criticism of the rigour, transparency, and appropriateness of the methodology have been raised across multiple academic and clinical disciplines, including nursing and midwifery. This discussion paper provides a unique contribution by discussing each component of a scoping review, including: developing research questions and objectives; protocol development; developing eligibility criteria and the planned search approach; searching and selecting the evidence; extracting and analysing evidence; presenting results; and summarizing the evidence specifically for the fields of nursing and midwifery. Considerations for when to select this methodology and how to prepare a review for publication are also discussed. This approach is applied to the disciplines of nursing and midwifery to assist nursing and/or midwifery students, clinicians, researchers, and academics.","Pollock, Danielle; Davies, Ellen L; Peters, Micah D J; Tricco, Andrea C; Alexander, Lyndsay; McInerney, Patricia; Godfrey, Christina M; Khalil, Hanan; Munn, Zachary",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33543511/,328

Here we report on the use of purified β-glucan (Lentinan) extracts from Lentinus edodes (Shiitake) mushroom that can reduce infection by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate of K. pneumoniae in a rodent pneumonia model, likely through immunomodulation. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to intra-tracheal administration of K. pneumoniae to induce pulmonary sepsis and randomised to three groups; Vehicle control (Vehicle, n=12), Commercial Lentinan (CL, n=8), or in-house extracted Lentinan (IHL, n=8) was administered intravenously 1h post infection. Physiological parameters and blood gas analysis were measured, bacterial counts from bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) were determined, along with differential staining of white cells and measurement of protein concentration in BAL 48h after pneumonia induction. Use of IHL extract significantly decreased bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) CFU counts. Both CL and IHL extractions reduced protein concentration in BAL. Use of IHL resulted in an improvement in physiological parameters compared to controls and CL. In conclusion administration of Lentinan to treat sepsis-induced lung injury appears safe and effective and may exert its effects in an immunomodulatory manner.","Masterson, C H; Murphy, E J; Gonzalez, H; Major, I; McCarthy, S D; O'Toole, D; Laffey, J G; Rowan, N J",Letters in applied microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/lam.13358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706908/,328

DATA SOURCES The PubMed database was used to search for relevant articles. STUDY Selections Peer-reviewed prospective and retrospective studies involving the assessment of allergy using human birth cohorts between 2014-2021 were examined. RESULTS Parental history of allergic diseases, especially in cases involving both parents, is associated with increased risk of allergy. Exposure to prenatal and postnatal smoking and limited diet diversity were associated with increased allergic burden. The impact of early life infections and antibiotics on disease development may be associated with the onset of asthma, though this remains debated. Cohort studies also revealed that the mode of delivery and breastfeeding duration impacts the odds ratio of asthma and eczema development. Household exposures, including pets, house dust mites, and scented aeroallergens may confer protective effects, while high air pollution exposure and low socioeconomic status may be risk-enhancing. Exposure to antibiotics during early-life may be associated with increased asthma risk while viral infections may lead to disease protection, though the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on allergic risk is yet to be understood. CONCLUSION While assessing risk of allergic disease development is complex, clinicians can apply these insights on the multi-factorial nature of atopy to better understand and potentially mitigate disease development.","Hossenbaccus, Lubnaa; Linton, Sophia; Ramchandani, Rashi; Gallant, Mallory; Ellis, Anne K","Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2021.04.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971362/,328

TB is being routinely used in various operative procedures, however, less is known about its utility in liver resection. We, herein, report our early experience of using TB in open liver resection particularly in patients with normal or near-normal liver parenchyma. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics, and evaluated the perioperative outcome of twenty-eight patients who underwent liver resection with TB, and twenty-four patients who underwent liver resection with basic procedure in our institution. The resection type was stratified into: major hepatectomy; resection of 3 or more than 3 Couinauds segments, and minor hepatectomy; resection of less than 3 Couinauds segments. RESULTS Liver resection time (mean ± SD) in TB group with major hepatectomy was significantly shorter: 16.7 ± 8.8 compared to 62.8 ± 39.4 min in basic procedure group (P < 0.0001). Accordingly, the liver resection time (mean ± SD) in TB group with minor hepatectomy was also significantly shorter, 8.3 ± 2.9 min compared to 45.2 ± 23.9 min in liver resection with basic procedure (P < 0.001). No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of intraoperative blood transfusion ratio, postoperative complication and postoperative liver dysfunction. CONCLUSION TB as a new energy device can offer a safe, reliable and substantially rapid liver resection particularly in patients with normal or near-normal liver parenchyma.","Aryal, Bibek; Komokata, Teruo; Yasumura, Hiroto; Kamiimabeppu, Daisaku; Inoue, Maki; Yoshikawa, Kota; Kaieda, Mamoru; Imoto, Yutaka",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-018-0423-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30326866/,328

139876,COVID-19 and the Well-being of Children and Families.,2020-09-01,"OBJECTIVE To retrospectively investigate safety and efficacy of nusinersen in a large cohort of adult Italian patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). METHODS Inclusion criteria were: (1) clinical and molecular diagnosis of SMA2 or SMA3; (2) nusinersen treatment started in adult age (>18 years); (3) clinical data available at least at baseline (T0-beginning of treatment) and 6 months (T6). RESULTS We included 116 patients (13 SMA2 and 103 SMA3) with median age at first administration of 34 years (range 18-72). The Hammersmith Functional Rating Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in patients with SMA3 increased significantly from baseline to T6 (median change +1 point, p<0.0001), T10 (+2, p<0.0001) and T14 (+3, p<0.0001). HFMSE changes were independently significant in SMA3 sitter and walker subgroups. The Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) in SMA3 significantly improved between T0 and T14 (median +0.5, p=0.012), with most of the benefit observed in sitters (+2, p=0.018). Conversely, patients with SMA2 had no significant changes of median HFMSE and RULM between T0 and the following time points, although a trend for improvement of RULM was observed in those with some residual baseline function. The rate of patients showing clinically meaningful improvements (as defined during clinical trials) increased from 53% to 69% from T6 to T14. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide further evidence of nusinersen safety and efficacy in adult SMA2 and SMA3, with the latter appearing to be cumulative over time. In patients with extremely advanced disease, effects on residual motor function are less clear.","Maggi, Lorenzo; Bello, Luca; Bonanno, Silvia; Govoni, Alessandra; Caponnetto, Claudia; Passamano, Luigia; Grandis, Marina; Trojsi, Francesca; Cerri, Federica; Ferraro, Manfredi; Bozzoni, Virginia; Caumo, Luca; Piras, Rachele; Tanel, Raffaella; Saccani, Elena; Meneri, Megi; Vacchiano, Veria; Ricci, Giulia; Soraru', Gianni; D'Errico, Eustachio; Tramacere, Irene; Bortolani, Sara; Pavesi, Giovanni; Zanin, Riccardo; Silvestrini, Mauro; Politano, Luisa; Schenone, Angelo; Previtali, Stefano Carlo; Berardinelli, Angela; Turri, Mara; Verriello, Lorenzo; Coccia, Michela; Mantegazza, Renato; Liguori, Rocco; Filosto, Massimiliano; Marrosu, Gianni; Siciliano, Gabriele; Simone, Isabella Laura; Mongini, Tiziana; Comi, Giacomo; Pegoraro, Elena","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-323822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917822/,328

DESIGN AND SUBJECTS The RBC aggregation and kinetics of the red blood cell aggregation were performed by the Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyser (LORCA). Before the LSG and 6 and 12 months after the LSG, we evaluated the aggregation index (AI), amplitude (AMP) and aggregation half-time (t1/2), plasma viscosity, fibrinogen, glucose and lipids patterns in 15 non-diabetic obese subjects. RESULTS The static and kinetic parameters of aggregation in obese patients at each time point after bariatric weight loss surgery were calculated and significant differences were observed at 12 months after surgery. AI and AMP decreased from 69.81±5.12% and 27.43±2.9 a.u. at baseline to 64.91±5.94% and 22.15±4.3 a.u. 12 months after surgery, respectively. The t1/2 increased from 1.7 (1.32-2.24) s at baseline compared with 2.02 (1.68-2.42) s at 12 months after the surgery. Plasma viscosity and fibrinogen decreased from 1.50±0.093 mPa s and 3.0±0.41 g l(-1) at baseline to 1.407±0.062 mPa s and to 2.66±0.25 g l(-1) 12 months after surgery, respectively. AI correlated positively with BMI (r=0.74, P=0.001), waist circumference (r=0.68, P=0.005), fibrinogen (r=0.52, P=0.045) and plasma viscosity (r=0.76, P=0.001) and negatively with percentages of weight lost after surgery (r=-0.54, P=0.034). Multivariate analyses found that the BMI, fibrinogen and plasma viscosity independently influenced the AI. CONCLUSION The study demonstrated that weight loss due to restrictive bariatric surgery can beneficially affect red cell aggregation parameters. The improvement of the RBC aggregation behaviours among obese subjects with weight loss due to LSG was associated with changes in plasmatic factors, especially fibrinogen.","Wiewiora, M; Piecuch, J; Glück, M; Slowinska-Lozynska, L; Sosada, K",International journal of obesity,https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2014.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480861/,328

Relative to average, a one-standard-deviation increase in social connections with China and Italy - the first countries with major outbreaks of the virus - is associated with a nearly 50% increase in the estimated effect of mobility restrictions. Our results are not driven by traveler risk, as areas at higher risk from COVID-19 generally comply with restrictions more and are less affected by social connections. Social connections with counties with a less educated population, higher Trump vote share, and higher fraction of climate change deniers are associated with increased effects of mobility restrictions.

STUDY DESIGN Multi-institutional retrospective study. ANIMALS Forty-two cats. METHODS A wound retractor was inserted into the abdomen on the ventral midline through a 2-4 cm incision at the level of the umbilicus. Short segments (6-10 cm long) of intestinal tract were sequentially exteriorized and explored through the WRD. Full thickness, small intestinal biopsies were obtained extracorporeally via the WRD. A commercially available single-port device was inserted through the WRD for laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen. RESULTS The majority of the small intestine could be exteriorized and explored through the WRD. In all cases, full thickness biopsies of the small intestine of diagnostic quality were obtained. The most common histological findings were inflammatory bowel disease (n = 16), intestinal lymphoma (n = 14), and eosinophilic enteritis (n = 7). Two cases required conversion to a traditional open laparotomy due to abdominal pathology diagnosed after placement of the WRD (abdominal adhesions and need for a splenectomy). Postoperative complications occurred in 4 of 39 cats (10.3%), leading to 2 deaths after discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE MISIETB with a WRD alone or combined with laparoscopy is a safe technique for small intestinal exploration and targeted abdominal organ biopsy in cats. Single-port laparoscopy can effectively be performed through the WRD for complete abdominal exploration and biopsy of abdominal organs.","Baron, Jessica; Giuffrida, Michelle; Mayhew, Philipp D; Singh, Ameet; Case, J Brad; Culp, William T N; Holt, David E; Mayhew, Kelli N; Runge, Jeffrey J",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28906566/,328

Ongoing globalisation of food systems, characterised by trading interdependencies, means that agricultural production can be disrupted by climate change, affecting food availability. This study investigated Sweden's food security by identifying major food import categories and associated trade partners (using the World Integrated Trade System database) and vulnerability to frictions in trade deriving from climate change. Vulnerability was assessed through three indicators: exposure based on diversity of sources, dominance and direct trade from supplying countries; sensitivity, assessed using the Climate Risk Index, and adaptive capacity, assessed using the Fragile State Index. The results revealed that Sweden's grain imports may be most vulnerable, and animal products least vulnerable, to climate change. Management strategies based on this preliminary assessment can be developed by integrating climate vulnerability deriving from food trading into the 'Gravity' model, to improve prediction of trade flows.","Horn, Blaze; Ferreira, Carla; Kalantari, Zahra",Ambio,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01623-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34561835/,328

142167,Pandemic proofing dental education.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND During quarantine, both physical and mental health are a concern. To the same extent that physicians are a scarce resource during this crisis, psychiatrists and psychologists are also limited in number. To help practitioners and public managers decide where to invest their resources, the present research investigated the relationships of stress, depression and state anxiety levels with sociodemographic and behavioural variables. METHODS Data were collected in Brazil between March, 18 and 22, 2020 in 1,468 volunteers during quarantine. Participants with a history of or current mental health illnesses were excluded leaving 1,460 individuals in the final sample. The online assessment included instruments for psychological stress, depression and state anxiety. A sociodemographic and behavioural questionnaire with 15 items was used to assess other factors. Multiple linear regression was performed for each psychological outcome to determine a hierarchy of significant predictors. FINDINGS Stress, depression and state anxiety levels were all predicted by gender (women higher than men), quality of nutrition, attendance in tele-psychotherapy, exercise frequency, presence of elderly persons in quarantine with the person, obligation to work outside the home, level of education (more educated, lesser risk for mental illness) and age (younger age, greater risk). Having a perceived risk factor for COVID-19 predicted depression and state anxiety, but not stress. Finally, the presence of children in quarantine with the participant was a protective factor for depression. INTERPRETATION Even though this research is limited by its cross-sectional design, it is possible to infer that mental health varies by demographic attributes, obligations and health behaviours. Those who report higher distress must work outside the home during quarantine, live with an elderly person and carry a risk factor for COVID-19, among other factors. Identifying those who are most vulnerable would help to prioritize those who may need the greatest psychological aid and assist public health practitioners in developing support strategies.","Filgueiras, Alberto; Stults-Kolehmainen, Matthew",Psychological reports,https://doi.org/10.1177/0033294120976628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567978/,328
142559,Challenges to neonatal care in Cambodia amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND Large sheet-type surgical materials (e.g., absorbable hemostat, adhesion barrier membranes, and flat surgical mesh) are difficult to introduce into a corporeal cavity using a 5-mm trocar; however, laparoscopic surgeries that use mainly 5-mm trocars are increasing. Furthermore, it is necessary not only to introduce but also to secure the applied surgical material and expand it from the original surgical site. To address these challenges, we developed a novel procedure for introducing such surgical materials into a corporeal cavity using a 5-mm trocar and a self-expanding origami structure, called the ""chevron pleats procedure (CPP)"". METHODS We used CPP in 114 cases of laparoscopic surgery for gastrointestinal diseases. The chevron folding pattern is an excellent origami structure and compactly folds a large sheet of material for use with a slim trocar. Surgical materials were folded using a chevron pleats pattern and inserted into a novel, slim, long syringe-type device, which was made from a specially ordered precision polypropylene tube, for introduction into a corporeal cavity. When the surgical material was used, the end of the device was placed above the surgical site and the inner rod was pushed. The surgical material was securely injected and expanded over the surgical site. RESULTS Surgical materials were introduced smoothly and securely using a 5-mm trocar to a site of intraoperative bleeding, the incisional surface of the liver, and defects of the abdominal wall or peritoneum. Efficient hemostasis was attained, the introduction and expansion of surgical mesh was made simpler, and the covering of defects of the peritoneum with adhesion barrier membranes, which is typically difficult during laparoscopic surgery, was easily performed. CONCLUSIONS CPP is a basic utility procedure for introducing several sheet-type surgical materials into a corporeal cavity with a 5-mm trocar and might help ensure efficient and safe laparoscopic surgery.","Nakase, Yuen; Nakamura, Kei; Sougawa, Akira; Nagata, Tomoyuki; Mochizuki, Satoshi; Kitai, Shouzo; Inaba, Seishirou",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5389-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28039639/,328
143277,COVID-19 outbreak and suicides in Nepal: Urgency of immediate action.,2020-09-28,"UNLABELLED The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East since 2012 has caused more than 900 human infections with ∼40% mortality to date. Animal models are needed for studying pathogenesis and for development of preventive and therapeutic agents against MERS-CoV infection. Nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques and marmosets) are expensive models of limited availability. Although a mouse lung infection model has been described using adenovirus vectors expressing human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), it is believed that a transgenic mouse model is needed for MERS-CoV research. We have developed this transgenic mouse model as indicated in this study. We show that transgenic mice globally expressing hCD26/DPP4 were fully permissive to MERS-CoV infection, resulting in relentless weight loss and death within days postinfection. High infectious virus titers were recovered primarily from the lungs and brains of mice at 2 and 4 days postinfection, respectively, whereas viral RNAs were also detected in the heart, spleen, and intestine, indicating a disseminating viral infection. Infected Tg(+) mice developed a progressive pneumonia, characterized by extensive inflammatory infiltration. In contrast, an inconsistent mild perivascular cuffing was the only pathological change associated with the infected brains. Moreover, infected Tg(+) mice were able to activate genes encoding for many antiviral and inflammatory mediators within the lungs and brains, coinciding with the high levels of viral replication. This new and unique transgenic mouse model will be useful for furthering knowledge of MERS pathogenesis and for the development of vaccine and treatments against MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Small and economical animal models are required for the controlled and extensive studies needed for elucidating pathogenesis and development of vaccines and antivirals against MERS. Mice are the most desirable small-animal species for this purpose because of availability and the existence of a thorough knowledge base, particularly of genetics and immunology. The standard small animals, mice, hamsters, and ferrets, all lack the functional MERS-CoV receptor and are not susceptible to infection. So, initial studies were done with nonhuman primates, expensive models of limited availability. A mouse lung infection model was described where a mouse adenovirus was used to transfect lung cells for receptor expression. Nevertheless, all generally agree that a transgenic mouse model expressing the DPP4 receptor is needed for MERS-CoV research. We have developed this transgenic mouse model as indicated in this study. This new and unique transgenic mouse model will be useful for furthering MERS research.","Agrawal, Anurodh Shankar; Garron, Tania; Tao, Xinrong; Peng, Bi-Hung; Wakamiya, Maki; Chan, Teh-Sheng; Couch, Robert B; Tseng, Chien-Te K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03427-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589660/,328

Due to the similarity of symptoms with those of common gastrointestinal disorders, this infection is often underestimated, and the need for new specific diagnostic tools is becoming crucial. Given the remarkable impact that MALDI-TOF MS biotyping had in the last decade in clinical routine practice for the recognition of bacterial and fungi strains, a similar scenario could be foreseen for the identification of parasites, such as nematodes. In this work, a MALDI-TOF MS profiling of Anisakis proteome was pursued with a view to constructing a first spectral library for the diagnosis of Anisakis infections. At the same time, a shotgun proteomics approach by LC-ESI-MS/MS was performed on the two main fractions obtained from protein extraction, to evaluate the protein species enriched by the protocol. A set of MALDI-TOF MS signals associated with proteins originating in the ribosomal fraction of the nematode extract was selected as a potential diagnostic tool for the identification of Anisakis spp.","Marzano, Valeria; Pane, Stefania; Foglietta, Gianluca; Levi Mortera, Stefano; Vernocchi, Pamela; Onetti Muda, Andrea; Putignani, Lorenza",Genes,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11060693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32599802/,328

Winter shooting events had a higher percentage of injuries (6.9%) compared to summer (2.3%). In summer, females demonstrated a higher percentage of injuries (6.9%) compared to males (1.7%). In winter, males had a higher percentage of injuries (8.6%) versus females (5.1%). Conclusion Injury incidence and prevalence was low for athletes in shooting sports in the Olympics. Injury rate was higher in the winter Olympic shooting events likely from increased physiological demand. With injury surveillance focusing on acute injuries rather than chronic, the number of injuries may be underestimated. Females had higher injury rates than males in the summer Olympics while the opposite was observed in the winter Olympics, likely from sex differences and differences in physiological demand for each event.

Methods Between 2010 and 2018, 47 cases underwent proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy (n = 23) or double-tract reconstruction (n = 24) at our institution for the treatment of clinical T1N0 adenocarcinoma located in the upper third of the stomach. Patient clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, nutrition status, and skeletal muscle index were compared among the two groups. Results There was no significant difference between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in terms of operation time, blood loss, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Reflux symptoms and anastomotic stenosis were significantly higher in the esophagogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). There was no significant difference in anastomotic leakage, surgical site infection, and pancreatic fistula. For the nutritional status, the decrease rate of cholinesterase was significantly higher in the esophagogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group at 6 months (P = 0.008) There was no significant difference in the decrease rate of skeletal muscle mass index at 1 year after surgery. Conclusion Compared with esophagogastrostomy, double-tract reconstruction tends to have better short-term nutritional status and postoperative outcomes in terms of preventing the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and anastomosis stenosis. These findings suggest that double-tract reconstruction may be a useful method in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.","Miyauchi, Wataru; Matsunaga, Tomoyuki; Shishido, Yuji; Miyatani, Kozo; Hanaki, Takehiko; Kihara, Kyoichi; Yamamoto, Manabu; Tokuyasu, Naruo; Takano, Shuichi; Sakamoto, Teruhisa; Honjo, Soichiro; Saito, Hiroaki; Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki",Yonago acta medica,https://doi.org/10.33160/yam.2020.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253340/,328
146822,The COVID-19 Shadow Pandemic: Meeting Social Needs For A City In Lockdown.,2020-07-16,"Background: Across Southeast Asia, declining malaria incidence poses a challenge for healthcare providers, in how best to manage the vast majority of patients with febrile illnesses who have a negative malaria test. In rural regions, where the majority of the population reside, empirical treatment guidelines derived from central urban hospitals are often of limited relevance. In these settings, health workers with limited training deliver care, often without any laboratory diagnostic support. In this paper, we model the impact of point-of-care C-reactive protein testing to inform the decision to prescribe antibiotics and regional surveillance data to inform antibiotic selection, and then simulate the subsequent impact on mortality from febrile illnesses, rooted in the real-world context of rural Savannakhet province, southern Laos. Methods: Our model simulates 100 scenarios with varying quarterly incidence of six key pathogens known to be prevalent in rural Laos. In the simulations, community health workers either prescribe antibiotics in-line with current practice as documented in health facilities in rural Laos, or with the aid of the two interventions. We provide cost-effectiveness estimates for each strategy alone and then for an integrated approach using both interventions. Results: We find that each strategy is predicted to be highly cost-effective, and that the combined approach is predicted to result in the biggest reduction in mortality (averting a predicted 510 deaths per year in rural Savannakhet, a 28% reduction compared to standard practice) and is highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of just $66 per disability-adjusted life year averted. Conclusions: Substantial seasonal variation in the predicted optimal empirical antibiotic treatment for febrile illness highlights the benefits of up-to-date information on regional causes of fever. In this modelling analysis, an integrated system incorporating point-of-care host biomarker testing and regional surveillance data appears highly cost-effective, and may warrant piloting in a real-life setting.","Chandna, Arjun; White, Lisa J; Pongvongsa, Tiengkham; Mayxay, Mayfong; Newton, Paul N; Day, Nicholas P J; Lubell, Yoel",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.14976.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31245630/,328
147430,Developmental pathway of Orthorexia Nervosa: factors contributing to progression from healthy eating to excessive preoccupation with healthy eating. Experiences of Dutch Health Professionals.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND Reducing meat consumption may improve human health, curb environmental damage and greenhouse gas emissions, and limit the large-scale suffering of animals raised in factory farms. Previous work has begun to develop interventions to reduce individual meat consumption, often by appealing directly to individual health motivations. However, research on nutritional behavior change suggests that interventions additionally linking behavior to ethical values, identity formation, and existing social movements may be particularly effective and longer-lasting. Regarding meat consumption, preliminary evidence and psychological theory suggest that appeals related to animal welfare may have considerable potential to effectively leverage these elements of human psychology. We aim to conduct a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of animal welfare-related appeals on actual or intended meat consumption or purchasing. Our investigation will critically synthesize the current state of knowledge regarding psychological mechanisms of intervening on individual meat consumption and empirically identify the psychological characteristics underlying the most effective animal welfare-based interventions. METHODS We will systematically search eight academic databases and extensively search unpublished grey literature. We will include studies that assess interventions intended to reduce meat consumption or purchase through the mention or portrayal of animal welfare, that measure outcomes related to meat consumption or purchase, and that have a control condition. Eligible studies may recruit from any human population, be written in any language, and be published or released any time. We will meta-analyze the studies, reporting the pooled point estimate and additional metrics that describe the distribution of potentially heterogeneous effects. We will assess studies' risk of bias and conduct sensitivity analyses for publication bias. We describe possible follow-up analyses to investigate hypothesized moderators of intervention effectiveness. DISCUSSION The findings of the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis, including any identified methodological limitations of the existing literature, could inform the design of successful evidence-based interventions with broad potential to improve human, animal, and environmental well-being.

147952,Reducing Financial Barriers for Households Due to COVID-19: The Case in India.,2021-01-01,"Curcumin is the effective ingredient of turmeric, sometimes used as a painkiller in traditional medicine. It has extensive biological properties such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus developing severe pneumonitis. Inflammasome is one of the most important components of innate immunity, which exacerbates inflammation by increasing IL-1β and IL-18 production. Studies on viral infections have shown overactivity of inflammasome and thus the occurrence of destructive and systemic inflammation in patients. NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. The proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in a wide range of cells can be combined with numerous observations of direct and indirect activation of inflammasome by other coronaviruses. Activation of the inflammasome is likely to be involved in the formation of cytokine storm. Curcumin regulates several molecules in the intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in inflammation, including IBB, NF-kBERK1,2, AP-1, TGF-β, TXNIP, STAT3, PPARγ, JAK2-STAT3, NLRP3, p38MAPK, Nrf2, Notch-1, AMPK, TLR-4 and MyD-88. Due to anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammasome properties without any special side effects, curcumin can potentially play a role in the treatment of COVID-19 infection along with other drug regimens.","Saeedi-Boroujeni, Ali; Mahmoudian-Sani, Mohammad-Reza; Bahadoram, Mohammad; Alghasi, Arash",Basic & clinical pharmacology & toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcpt.13503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33099890/,328

Eight of 54 (14.8%) were immediately treated with mechanical thrombectomy, 6/54 (11.1%) after early neurologic deterioration, and the rest were treated with standard thrombolysis only. Rates of successful recanalization were similar between the 2 mechanical thrombectomy groups (75% versus 100%). Rates of excellent outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) were higher in patients with immediate thrombectomy (75%) compared with patients with delayed thrombectomy (33.3%) and thrombolysis only (55%). No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in either group. These descriptive data are encouraging, and further analysis of large registries or even randomized controlled trials in this patient subgroup should be performed.","Messer, M P; Schönenberger, S; Möhlenbruch, M A; Pfaff, J; Herweh, C; Ringleb, P A; Nagel, S",AJNR.

However, such contact network data are often unobserved. Such missing data can be accounted for in a Bayesian data augmented framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Unfortunately, fitting models in such a framework can be highly computationally intensive. We investigate the fitting of network-based infectious disease models with completely unknown contact networks using approximate Bayesian computation population Monte Carlo (ABC-PMC) methods. This is done in the context of both simulated data, and data from the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic. We show that ABC-PMC is able to obtain reasonable approximations of the underlying infectious disease model with huge savings in computation time when compared to a full Bayesian MCMC analysis.","Almutiry, Waleed; Deardon, Rob",The international journal of biostatistics,https://doi.org/10.1515/ijb-2017-0092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31812945/,328

Equally important, we wish to correct several important misunderstandings that were made by Kruse and Beitzke (2020) on behalf of the European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) that possibly contributed to their concerns about the validity of our data, toxicological assessment and conclusions regarding regulatory status of cannabidiol (CBD) products. First and foremost, our study did only assess the risk of psychotropic Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) without inclusion of non-psychotropic Δ 9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). Secondly, as this article will discuss in more detail, there is ample evidence for side effects of CBD products, not only in paediatric patients, but also in adult users of over-the-counter CBD products (including inadvertent ""high"" effects). Thirdly, the exposure and risk assessment was conducted using up-to-date guidelines according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). And finally, the current legal situation in the European Union, without approval of any hemp extract-containing product according to the Novel Food regulation, actually allows blanket statements that all such products are illegal on the market, and this indeed would imply a general ban on the use and marketing of such products as food or food ingredients until such an approval has been granted. We hope that this reassures the F1000Research readership regarding the validity of our results and conclusions. We are pleased, though, that the EIHA has acknowledged the fact that there are non-compliant CBD products available, but according to our data these are a substantial fraction of the market.","Lachenmeier, Dirk W; Walch, Stephan G",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26045.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082934/,328

METHODS Thirty-seven SSc patients were included. Patients with SSc were allocated into 2 groups as supervised and home exercise. Breathing, aerobic and resistance exercises were performed with a physiotherapist for 12 weeks in the supervised exercise group. Breathing, posture and aerobic exercises were given to the home exercise group as a home program for 12 weeks. All patients were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks later in terms of functional capacity, pulmonary functions, respiratory-peripheral muscle strength, dyspnea severity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and fatigue level. RESULTS Significant improvements were observed in the functional capacity, measured by 6 minute walking test in the supervised exercise group (before = 376.21 ± 65.50, after = 518.78 ± 75.84 m) and home exercise group (before = 384.44 ± 68.14, after = 432.7 ± 70.8 m; (P < .05). Respiratory-peripheral muscle strength (with the exception of inspiratory muscle strength and upper limb strength in the home exercise group) and HRQoL were significantly increased and fatigue level was significantly decreased in the supervised exercise and home exercise groups (P < .05). However, pulmonary functions and dyspnea severity were significantly improved only in the supervised exercise group (P < .05). The supervised exercise program was found superior to the home exercise program for change in all parameters (P < .05). CONCLUSION This study suggests that exercise interventions should be applied in addition to the medical treatments of patients with SSc as supervised and home exercise programs play an important role in the functionality and health status of these patients.","Yakut, Hazal; Özalevli, Sevgi; Aktan, Ridvan; Özgen Alpaydın, Aylin; Merih Birlik, Ahmet; Can, Gerçek",International journal of rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.14177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268887/,328

BACKGROUND National, regional and local audits in England consistently show inappropriate use of all blood components; around 15%-20% of red blood cells (RBC) and 20%-30% of platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Hospital transfusion guidelines may be difficult to locate and not agree with national guidelines. We developed and tested a dedicated app providing national evidence-based guidelines for use at the point of care to help clinicians make better decisions when authorising blood. METHODS/MATERIALS We identified areas of blood authorisation with high frequency of component use and evidence of widespread unnecessary authorisation. We developed seven representative clinical scenarios where the transfusion of blood components may or may not benefit the adult patient. Responding doctors were invited to select their authorisation choice via an online questionnaire, initially without and then with access to the app. Adherence to guidelines was assessed with and without aid of the app. RESULTS Using the app, doctors were much more likely to select the correct decision, in accordance with national guidance. Compared with baseline measurements, decisions improved by 67% for RBC, 58% for platelets and 73% for FFP. These improvements were statistically significant. CONCLUSION Apps such as ""Blood Components"" can help doctors do ""the right thing rather than the wrong thing"". Further studies are required to assess the impact of using the app in clinical practice and the effect on blood component management and financial savings.","Watson, Paul; Watson, Denise; Dhesi, Amanpreet; New, Helen V; Davidson, Anne; Armstrong, Richard; Birchall, Janet",Transfusion medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/tme.12736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184992/,328

Less is known, however, about the underlying processes. The present study addressed this gap in the literature by examining how mindfulness would mitigate self-stigma and, in turn, alleviate affective symptoms among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals. METHODS A total of 401 LGB individuals from Hong Kong, China, provided cross-sectional questionnaire data on mindfulness, positive reappraisal, negative rumination, self-stigma content, self-stigma process, disempowerment, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Structural equation modeling and Bootstrap analyses were conducted to analyze the relations among the variables. RESULTS Structural equation modeling showed that mindfulness was associated with increased positive reappraisal and reduced negative rumination, which were, in turn, associated with lower levels of self-stigma content and process, respectively. Moreover, lower levels of self-stigma content and process were associated with a reduced sense of disempowerment, which was, in turn, associated with lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Bootstrap analyses further demonstrated that mindfulness had significant indirect effects on depressive and anxiety symptoms via positive reappraisal, self-stigma content, and disempowerment and via negative rumination, self-stigma process, and disempowerment. CONCLUSIONS Theoretically, this study revealed the potential pathways through which mindfulness could enable LGB individuals to mitigate self-stigma content and process and thereby alleviate depressive and anxiety symptoms. Practically, this study pointed to the potential utility of mindfulness training in facilitating LGB individuals to resist societal stigma, reduce internalized stigma, and lessen emotional distress.","Chan, Kevin Ka Shing; Leung, Donald Chi Kin",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740638/,328

In 2014, approximately 6,000,000 people in the United States could benefit from PC, and this number is expected to increase over the next 25 years. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this review is to shed light on the significance of PC and provide a holistic view outlining both the benefits and existing barriers. METHODS A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify articles published in journals from 1948 to 2019. A narrative approach was used to search the grey literature. DISCUSSION Traditionally, the philosophy behind PC was based on alleviating suffering associated with terminal illnesses; PC was recommended only after other treatment options had been exhausted. However, the tenets of PC are applicable to anyone with a life-threatening illness as it is beneficial in conjunction with traditional treatments. It is now recognized that PC services are valuable when initiated alongside disease-modifying therapy early in the disease course. Studies have shown that PC decreased total symptom burden, reduced hospitalizations, and enabled patients to remain safely at home. CONCLUSION As the population ages and chronic illnesses become more widespread, there continues to be a growing need for PC programs. The importance of PC should not be overlooked despite existing barriers such as the lack of professional training and the cost of implementation. Education and open discussion play essential roles in the successful early integration of PC.","Senderovich, Helen; McFadyen, Kristen",Rambam Maimonides medical journal,https://doi.org/10.5041/rmmj.10394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213278/,328

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 outbreak pose a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses is limited. DESIGN A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. METHODS An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS The score of SAS, SOS and GSES are range from 20 - 80, 22 - 110 and 10 - 40 respectively, the SAS (31.79±7.32) and SOS (40.19±12.92) and GSES scores (24.83±6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (r=0.679, P<0.001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r=-0.326, p<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress, and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (p=0.006, <0.001, <0.001, 0.039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 were under a low level of anxiety.

Although, this method has already been used in clinical practice, however, the optimal parameters of LES electrical stimulation are still unknown. Aims: The goals of this study were to get clinical data regarding the effects of different types of electrical stimulation on LES and to elaborate and test the prototype on laboratory animals. Material and Methods: In the Department of Surgery no 4, during 4 years (2015-2018), there has been achieved one clinical-experimental study of LES electrical stimulation. During the first stage, the electrical stimulation of the LES, using an external pulse generator, was assessed in 15 patients. These patients underwent an antireflux intervention, with an additional insertion of 2 temporary electrodes on the LES. During the second stage, there was created an experimental device which consisted of a re-insertable microstimulator using wireless energy transfer. During the third stage, it was tested in the experimental surgery center ""Pius Branzeu"", Timisoara, on laboratory animals (pigs). Results: Values of the LES resting pressure and integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) were significantly different during the prestimulation and poststimulation periods. Conclusions: There was successfully demonstrated the possibility to increase the LES tone. Modifications in the LES functionality and tone, during the electrical stimulation and in the period immediately after the stimulation, depend upon the pulse frequency and length.

However, data on such occupational incidents and their risk factors in healthcare settings are scarce and not systematically summarised in the Arab countries.The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to review published literature about sharps injuries and splash exposures of healthcare workers in Arab countries, with the objectives to determine the incidence and/or prevalence of these events, their identified risk factors and the applied preventive and postexposure prophylactic measures. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The protocol is developed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol guidelines. A comprehensive presearch developed in January to March 2021 in the database PubMed will be followed by a systematic search of six, core medical and health science databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science and Africa-Wide Information in May 2021. The search will be performed without any filters or restrictions for publication years. Covidence systematic review tool will be used for document management, blinded screening and study selection. Two reviewers will independently screen the records, extract data and conduct risk of bias assessment. Results will be synthesised narratively in summary tables, and, if findings allow, meta-analysis will be conducted on the incidence and/or prevalence of sharps injuries and splash exposures, and on the effect size of risk factors. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The systematic review methodology does not require ethics approval due to the nature of the study design based only on published studies. The results of the systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, disseminated to stakeholders and made publicly available.

STUDY DESIGN Preclinical rodent animal model. METHODS This prospective study assessed a single-stage 3D-printed auricular bioscaffold with or without porcine cartilage tissue inserts in an athymic rodent model. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine computed tomography images of a human auricle were segmented to create an external anatomic envelope filled with orthogonally interconnected spherical pores. Scaffolds with and without tissue inset sites were 3D printed by laser sintering bioresorbable polycaprolactone, then implanted subcutaneously in five rats for each group. RESULTS Ten athymic rats were studied to a goal of 24 weeks postoperatively. Precise anatomic similarity and scaffold integrity were maintained in both scaffold conditions throughout experimentation with grossly visible tissue ingrowth and angiogenesis upon explantation. Cartilage-seeded scaffolds had relatively lower rates of nonsurgical site complications compared to unseeded scaffolds with relatively increased surgical site ulceration, though neither met statistical significance. Histology revealed robust soft tissue infiltration and vascularization in both seeded and unseeded scaffolds, and demonstrated impressive maintenance of viable cartilage in cartilage-seeded scaffolds. Radiology confirmed soft tissue infiltration in all scaffolds, and biomechanical modeling suggested amelioration of stress in scaffolds implanted with cartilage. CONCLUSIONS A hybrid approach incorporating cartilage insets into 3D-printed bioscaffolds suggests enhanced clinical and histological outcomes. These data demonstrate the potential to integrate point-of-care tissue engineering techniques into 3D printing to generate alternatives to current reconstructive surgery techniques and avoid the demands of traditional tissue engineering.

157009,An Understaffed Hospital Battles COVID-19.,2020-08-01,"OBJECTIVE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted the standard management paradigms for care of patients with sinus and skull base presentations due to concern for patient and health care provider safety, given the high aerosol-generating potential of endonasal procedures. DATA SOURCES We reviewed the relevant literature complied from available sources, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and otolaryngology journals providing electronic manuscripts ahead of indexing or publication. REVIEW METHODS Incorporating available evidence and the projected infection control and resource limitations at our institution, we collectively authored a dynamic set of protocols guiding (1) case stratification, (2) preoperative assessment, (3) operative setup, and (4) postoperative care of patients with sinus or skull base presentations. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of COVID-19 publications, lack of rigorous data, and urgent necessity of standardized protocols, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were not employed. CONCLUSIONS As scarce hospital resources are diverted to COVID-19 care and staff are redeployed to forward-facing roles, endonasal procedures have largely ceased, leaving patients with ongoing sinonasal and skull base complaints untreated. Skull base teams now weigh the urgency of surgery in this population with the regional availability of resources. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The COVID-19 pandemic will have an enduring and unpredictable impact on hospital operations and surgical skull base practices and will require a dynamic set of management protocols responsive to new evidence and changing resources. In the current resource-limited environment, clinicians may utilize these protocols to assist with stratifying patients by acuity, performing preoperative assessment, and guiding peri- and postoperative care.","Spock, Todd; Kessler, Remi; Lerner, David; Filip, Peter; Del Signore, Anthony; Colley, Patrick; Morgenstern, Peter; Schaberg, Madeleine; Bederson, Joshua; Govindaraj, Satish; Iloreta, Alfred Marc; Shrivastava, Raj",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820931836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32452722/,328

Three-dimensional in vitro human distal lung culture systems would strongly facilitate investigation of pathologies including interstitial lung disease, cancer, and SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pneumonia. We generated long-term feeder-free, chemically defined culture of distal lung progenitors as organoids derived from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential while basal cell organoids developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Single cell analysis of basal organoid KRT5+ cells revealed a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation further segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction comprising ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells, residing in clusters within terminal bronchioles and exhibiting enriched clonogenic organoid growth activity. Distal lung organoids were created with apical-out polarity to display ACE2 on the exposed external surface, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection of AT2 and basal cultures and identifying club cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell functional heterogeneity and establishes a facile in vitro organoid model for human distal lung infections including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.","Salahudeen, Ameen A; Choi, Shannon S; Rustagi, Arjun; Zhu, Junjie; van Unen, Vincent; de la O, Sean M; Flynn, Ryan A; Margalef-Català, Mar; Santos, António J M; Ju, Jihang; Batish, Arpit; Usui, Tatsuya; Zheng, Grace X Y; Edwards, Caitlin E; Wagar, Lisa E; Luca, Vincent; Anchang, Benedict; Nagendran, Monica; Nguyen, Khanh; Hart, Daniel J; Terry, Jessica M; Belgrader, Phillip; Ziraldo, Solongo B; Mikkelsen, Tarjei S; Harbury, Pehr B; Glenn, Jeffrey S; Garcia, K Christopher; Davis, Mark M; Baric, Ralph S; Sabatti, Chiara; Amieva, Manuel R; Blish, Catherine A; Desai, Tushar J; Kuo, Calvin J",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-3014-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238290/,328

We sought to understand the feasibility of conducting virtual oral examinations as well as solicit opinions of vascular surgery program directors regarding the use of virtual platforms to conduct both low stakes mock oral examinations with their trainees and potentially ""real"" high stakes certifying examinations (CE) moving forward. METHODS Forty-four senior vascular surgery trainees from 17 institutions took part in a virtual mock oral examination conducted by 38 practicing vascular surgeons via Zoom. Each examination lasted 30 minutes with four clinical scenarios. An anonymous survey pertaining to the conduct of the examination and opinions on feasibility of using virtual examinations for the vascular surgery CE was sent to all examiners and examinees. A similar survey was sent to all vascular surgery program directors (PD). RESULTS The overall pass rate was 82% (36/44 participants) with no correlation with training paradigm. 32/44 (73%) of trainees, 29/38 (76%) of examiners and 49/103 (48%) of PDs completed the surveys. Examinees and examiners thought the experience was beneficial and PDs also thought the experience would be beneficial for their trainees. While the majority of trainees and examiners believed they were able to communicate and express (or evaluate) knowledge and confidence as easily virtually as in person, PDs were less likely to agree confidence could be assessed virtually. The majority of respondents thought the CE of the Vascular Surgery Board of the American Board of Surgery could be offered virtually, although no groups thought virtual exams were superior to in person exams. While cost benefit was perceived in virtual examinations, the security of the examination was a concern. CONCLUSIONS Performing virtual mock oral examinations for vascular surgery trainees is feasible. Both vascular surgery trainees as well as PDs feel that virtual CEs should be considered by the Vascular Surgery Board.","Zemela, Mark S; Malgor, Rafael D; Smith, Brigitte K; Smeds, Matthew R",Annals of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.avsg.2021.03.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838232/,328

Aim To assess the use of routine pulse oximetry in the delivery room and at 24 hours postpartum, and to study its feasibility as a screening test for CHD. Material and Methods In this prospective study, all infants born in ""Cuza Voda"" Maternity Hospital, Iasi, Romania, were enrolled over a thirteen-month period. Preductal oximetry was assessed during the first hour, and postductal oximetry was evaluated at twenty-four hours postpartum. Data were then analyzed to establish the sensitivity and specificity of pulse oximetry, as a screening test for CHD. Results 5406 infants were included in the study, with a mean gestational age of 38.2 weeks and a mean birth weight of 3175 grams. During the first minute, blood oxygen saturation varied between 40% and 90% and at 24 hours of life, it ranged between 90% and 100%. Following oximetry assessment, 14 infants with critical CHD were identified. Blood oxygen saturation values in infants with CHD were lower throughout the entire period of evaluation. Pulse oximetry had good sensitivity and specificity at 1 hour (Se=87.5%, Sp=95.5%) and 24 hours (Se=92.5%, Sp=97.4%) for the diagnosis of CHD. Blood oxygen saturation values at one minute, 1 hour and 24 hours are strong discriminative parameters for the early diagnosis of CHD. Conclusion Routine pulse oximetry during the first 24 hours postpartum represents an early indicator of CHD to facilitate timely intervention. Pulse oximetry provides excellent sensitivity and specificity and has tremendous potential as a standard screening test for CHD during the first 24 hours of life.","Patriciu, Mihaela; Avasiloaiei, Andreea; Moscalu, Mihaela; Stamatin, Maria",Journal of critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jccm-2017-0004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29967865/,328

As the search for effective and differentiated antiviral therapies continues, cellular targets are becoming more common, bringing with them a variety of challenges and concerns. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide a unique mechanism to induce an antiviral state in the host. In this review we introduce TLRs as targets for the pharmaceutical industry, including how they signal and thereby induce an antiviral state through the production of type I interferons. We examine how TLRs are being therapeutically targeted and discuss several clinically precedented agents for which efficacy and safety data are available. We describe some of the chemistries that have been applied to both small molecule and large molecule leads to tune agonist potency, and offer a differentiated safety profile through targeting certain compartments such as the gut or the lung, thereby limiting systemic drug exposure and affecting systemic cytokine levels. The application of low-dose agonists of TLRs as vaccine adjuvants or immunoprotective agents is also presented. Some of the challenges presented by this approach are then discussed, including viral evasion strategies and mechanism-linked inflammatory cytokine induction.","Horscroft, Nigel J; Pryde, David C; Bright, Helen",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/dkr588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22258929/,328
159307,Psychological crisis intervention response to the COVID 19 pandemic: A Tunisian centralised Protocol.,2020-04-30,"The aim was to determine the mechanisms facilitating exercise performance in hot conditions following heat training. In a counter-balanced order, seven males (V̇o2max 61.2 ± 4.4 ml·min(-1)·kg(-1)) were assigned to either 10 days of 90-min exercise training in 18 or 38°C ambient temperature (30% relative humidity) applying a cross-over design. Participants were tested for V̇o2max and 30-min time trial performance in 18 (T18) and 38°C (T38) before and after training. Blood volume parameters, sweat output, cardiac output (Q̇), cerebral perfusion (i.e., middle cerebral artery velocity [MCAvmean]), and other variables were determined. Before one set of exercise tests in T38, blood volume was acutely expanded by 538 ± 16 ml with an albumin solution (T38A) to determine the role of acclimatization induced hypervolemia on exercise performance. We furthermore hypothesized that heat training would restore MCAvmean and thereby limit centrally mediated fatigue. V̇o2max and time trial performance were equally reduced in T38 and T38A (7.2 ± 1.6 and 9.3 ± 2.5% for V̇o2max; 12.8 ± 2.8 and 12.9 ± 2.8% for time trial). Following heat training both were increased in T38 (9.6 ± 2.1 and 10.4 ± 3.1%, respectively), whereas both V̇o2max and time trial performance remained unchanged in T18. As expected, heat training augmented plasma volume (6 ± 2%) and mean sweat output (26 ± 6%), whereas sweat [Na(+)] became reduced by 19 ± 7%. In T38 Q̇max remained unchanged before (21.3 ± 0.6 l/min) to after (21.7 ± 0.5 l/min) training, whereas MCAvmean was increased by 13 ± 10%.

A person-centered perspective on death awareness during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent digestive malignancies, being the third cause of death by cancer, despite early diagnosis and therapeutic progress made over the past years. Standard treatment in these patients is to preserve the anal sphincter with restoration of intestinal function by mechanical colorectal anastomosis or coloanal anastomosis, and to maintain genitourinary function by preservation of hypogastric nerves. METHODS In order to emphasize the importance of this surgical technique in the Fourth Surgical Clinic of the CF Clinical Hospital Cluj-Napoca, we conducted a prospective observational interventional study over a 3-year period (2013-2016) in 165 patients hospitalized for rectal and rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma in various disease stages, who underwent Dixon surgery using the two techniques of manual and mechanical end-to-end anastomosis. For mechanical anastomosis, we used Covidien and Panther circular staplers. The patients were assigned to two groups, group A in which Dixon surgery with manual end-to-end anastomosis was performed (116 patients), and group B in which Dixon surgery with mechanical end-to-end anastomosis was carried out (49 patients). RESULTS Mechanical anastomosis allowed to restore intestinal continuity following low anterior resection in 21 patients with lower rectal adenocarcinoma compared to 2 patients in whom intestinal continuity was restored by manual anastomosis, with a statistically significant difference (p<0.000001). The double-row mechanical suture technique is associated with a reduced duration of surgery (121.67 minutes for Dixon surgery with mechanical anastomosis, compared to 165.931 minutes for Dixon surgery with manual anastomosis, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION The use of circular transanal staplers facilitates end-to-end anastomosis by double-row mechanical suture, allowing to perform low anterior resection in situations when the restoration of intestinal continuity by manual anastomosis is technically not possible, with the aim to preserve the anal sphincter, to restore intestinal function and maintain genitourinary function through preservation of hypogastric nerves.","Cheregi, Cornel Dragos; Simon, Ioan; Fabian, Ovidiu; Maghiar, Adrian",Clujul medical,https://doi.org/10.15386/cjmed-787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28781527/,328

More information is needed to understand TTS and evaluate the dynamic postural control better. The purpose is to develop a method estimating TTS, initial impact force (IIF) and landing leg stiffness (LLS) through fitting ground reaction force (GRF) decay in single leg landing with exponential vibration decay function (EVDF), and investigate effects of landing directions and GRF components on these parameters. Thirty-nine healthy participants were recruited. EVDF was used to fit GRF decays in different single-leg landings. TTS, IIF, and LLS were compared across landing directions and GRF components. The mean regression determinants of fitting GRF decays with EVDF were greater than 0.50. TTS was sensitive to GRF components (P = 0.041 females, P = 0.028 males). IIF was sensitive to GRF components (P = 0.001) for both genders. LLS was sensitive to GRF components (P = 0.023) for males. This method showed a moderate to strong feasibility for reporting GRF decay during landing, and provided movement characteristic information for better understanding of dynamic postural control together with TTS during landing.","Mao, Min; Yin, Yan; Luo, Dongmei; Liu, Hui; Yu, Bing",Sports biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14763141.2020.1833969; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594918/,328

The objective of this integrative review is to identify barriers to and facilitators of the implementation of robotic systems in nursing. METHODS Articles published from 2002 to 2019 reporting on projects to implement robotic devices in nursing care were searched on Medline (via PubMed), CINAHL and databases on funded research projects (Community Research and Development Information Services and Technische Informationsbibliothek) and in journals for robotic research in November 2017 and July 2019 for an update. No restrictions regarding study designs were imposed. All included articles underwent quality assessments with design-specific critical appraisal tools. Barriers to and facilitators of implementation were classified using the Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions framework. RESULTS After removing all duplicates, the search revealed 11 204 studies, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the synthesis. The majority of the studies dealt with the implementation of robots designed to support individuals, either living at home or in nursing homes (n=11). The studies were conducted in Europe, the USA and New Zealand and were carried out in nursing homes, individual living environments, hospital units and laboratories. The quality of reporting and quality of evidence were low in most studies. The most frequently reported barriers were in socioeconomic and ethical domains and were within the implementation outcomes domain. The most frequently reported facilitators were related to the sociocultural context, implementation process and implementation strategies.

It has been estimated that at least 6% of Italian children younger than 6 yr of age present recurrent respiratory infections (RRI). Children with RRI are not affected by severe alterations of the immune system. RRI represent essentially the consequence of an increased exposure to infectious agents during the first years of life, when immune functions are still largely immature. Several social and environmental factors, such as day-care attendance, family size, air pollution, parental smoking, and home dampness, represent important risk factors for airway diseases and may contribute in various degrees to determine the incidence of RRI. The main problem for the pediatrician is to discriminate normal children with high RI frequency related to an augmented exposure to environmental risk factors from children affected by other underlying pathological conditions (immunological or not), predisposing to infectious diseases. When RRI diagnosis has been formulated, removal of environmental risk factors (i.e. precocious day-care attendance, smoking in the household) must first be suggested.","de Martino, M; Ballotti, S",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3038.2007.00625.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17767600/,328

Symptoms consist of fever, cough and breathing difficulties. An increasing number of studies are focusing on neurological manifestations. In addition to the typical ageusia and anosmia, up to 30% of cases can present headache, nausea and vomiting. More serious neurological manifestations, such as encephalitis, thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage have been reported. Case description: We described the case of a 47-year-old man who tested positive for COVID-19 virus in early March 2020. After two negative nasopharyngeal swabs, 41 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, he developed intense headache with fever, and he was hospitalized. He had subsequent generalized epileptic seizures and intubation was necessary. Contrast Head MRI was negative for brain abscesses or tumours but detected severe vasogenic oedema of the white matter with 10 mm shift of the midline and compression of the right lateral ventricle. Massive cortisone support therapy was ineffective. We diagnosed brain death on day 43 from the infection diagnosis. Discussion: COVID-19 virus can reach the brain, penetrating into the neuronal cells through the interaction between the spike protein S1 and the host ACE-2 receptor, expressed in the capillary endothelium. We believe that in this infection, the pro-inflammatory state induced by the cytokine storm can cause a cerebral cell-mediated response, with subsequent vasodilatation and brain oedema. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first description of a delayed onset cell-mediated encephalitis caused by COVID-19 virus after more than 40 days from the diagnosis.","Zanin, Luca; Saraceno, Giorgio; Renisi, Giulia; Signorini, Liana; Battaglia, Luigi; Ferrara, Marco; Rasulo, Francesco Antonio; Panciani, Pier Paolo; Fontanella, Marco Maria",The International journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1886095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535011/,328

MATERIAL AND METHODS We searched Embase, Medline; Cochrane Library; Cinahl Plus, and Web-of-Science on 2/1/2020 for prospective and retrospective cohort studies with ≥50 women per gestational age group, published in English from 1995 onwards, that included women undergoing medical abortion and compared home expulsion of pregnancies of ≤9+0 weeks' gestational age to pregnancies of 9+1 -10+0 weeks or >10+1 weeks' gestational age, or that compared the latter two gestational age groups. We assessed risk-of-bias using the Newcastle-Ottowa scale. All outcomes were meta-analysed as risk ratios (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS Six studies (n=3381) were included. The 'need for emergency care/admission to hospital' (RR=0.79, 95% CI=0.45-1.4), 'haemorrhage requiring transfusion/≥ 500ml blood loss' (RR=0.62, 95% CI=0.11-3.55), patient satisfaction (RR=0.99, 95% CI=0.95-1.03), pain (RR=0.91, 95% CI=0.82-1.02), and 'complete abortion without the need for surgical intervention' (RR=1.03, 95% CI=1-1.05) did not differ statistically significantly between the ≤9+0 and >9+0 weeks gestation groups. The rates of vomiting (RR=0.8, 95% CI=0.69-0.93) and diarrhoea (RR=0.85, 95% CI 0.73-0.99) were statistically significantly lower in the ≤9+0 weeks group, but these differences were not considered clinically important. We found no studies comparing pregnancies of 9+1 -10+0 weeks to pregnancies of >10+0 weeks' gestation. The certainty of this evidence was predominantly low and mainly compromised by low event rates and loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Women who are having a medical abortion and will be taking the mifepristone up to and including 10+0 weeks' gestation should be offered the option of expulsion at home after they have taken the misoprostol. Further research needs to determine if the gestational limit for home expulsion can be extended beyond 10+0 weeks.","Schmidt-Hansen, Mia; Pandey, Anuja; Lohr, Patricia A; Nevill, Michael; Taylor, Peter; Hasler, Elise; Cameron, Sharon",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063314/,328

Air quality and hygrothermal comfort conditions were analysed before the pandemic and compared for different ventilation configurations in a post-COVID scenario. Ventilation strategies included the protocols issued by the Public Administration, while others were developed based on the typological configuration and use of the school. Results revealed that it is advisable to implement certain strategies that reduce the risk of infection among the occupants of the spaces, without a significant decrease in hygrothermal comfort. Given the importance of maintaining better IAQ in the future within classrooms, and regarding the pre-COVID situation, these strategies may be extended beyond this pandemic period, through a simple protocol and necessary didactic package to be assumed by both teachers and students of the centre.","Meiss, Alberto Jimeno-Merino Héctor Poza-Casado Irene Llorente-Álvarez Alfredo Padilla-Marcos Miguel Ángel",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158446,328
163244,"The Impact of COVID-19 Curfew on Food Security Status, Eating Habits, and Health among Adults Living in Saudi Arabia",2021,"Since the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qom, Iran, almost 19 months ago, the transmission dynamics across the country and the health burden of COVID-19 has remained largely unknown due to the scarcity of epidemiological analyses and lack of provincial data on the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. For the first time, we reconstruct the epidemic trajectory across the country and assess the level of under-reporting in infections and deaths using province-level age-stratified weekly all-cause mortality data. Our estimates suggest that as of 2021-09-17, only 48% (95% confidence interval 43-55%) of COVID-19 deaths in Iran have been reported. We find that in the most affected provinces such as Qazvin, Qom, and East Azerbaijan approximately 0.4% of the population have died of COVID-19 so far. We also find significant heterogeneity in the estimated attack rates across the country with 11 provinces reaching close to or higher than 100% attack rates. Despite a relatively young age structure in Iran, our analysis reveals that the infection fatality rate gradually increased over time in several provinces and reached levels that are comparable some of the high-income countries with a larger percentage of older adults, suggesting that limited access to medical services, coupled with undercounting of COVID-19-related deaths, can have a significant impact on COVID-19 fatalities. These results also show that despite several waves of infection and high attack rates in many provinces with largely unmitigated epidemics, herd immunity through natural infection has not been achieved.","Ghafari, M.; Karlinsky, A.; Watson, O.

Native American reservations, representing a unique geography, have been hit much harder than other parts of the country. This study seeks to understand the reasons for the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on Native American communities by focusing on the Navajo Nation – the largest Native American reservation in the US. I first reviewed the historical pandemics experienced by Native Americans. Guided by the literature review, an institutional analysis focusing on the Navajo Nation suggests a lack of both institutional resilience and healthcare preparation. The analysis further identified four factors that could help explain the Navajo’s slow response to the COVID-19 pandemic: prevalence of underlying chronic health conditions, lack of institutional resilience, the relationship between the federal government and tribal governments, and lack of social trust. Relevant policy implications are discussed. For instance, to better prepare Native American communities for shocking events like the COVID-19 pandemic in the future, policymaking should integrate informal institutions to build efficient formal institutions for self-governance. Promoting public health education and establishing collaborations between Native and non-Native communities are also necessary long-run strategies.","Wang, Haoying",Applied Geography,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.102526,328

Especially, medical appliances, medical implants and surgical operation tools for brain and bone invariably need small diameter-deep hole drilling for hard-to-machine metals such as stainless steel and Ti6Al4V. The authors newly designed and manufactured a small diameter-deep hole drilling machine by applying technological developments which consist of a direct drive servo spindle motor controlled more precisely, removable steady rests to prevent for a slender fluted hollow shaft of gun drill to be deflected and a highly pressure circulation system of cutting fluid to prevent being clogged with chips. By using the small diameter-deep hole drilling machine and a special gun drill (specially made to order in BOTEK) a drilling of ϕ1.0×400 mm (L/D=400) for Ti6Al4V was carried out. As a result, it was ascertained that the drilled hole has high accuracy in the items of hole diameter, concentricity, roundness and inner surface roughness.","Inada, Hidenori; Inada, Hiroshi; Yagishita, H.",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315183; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315183,328
163752,DHP Framework: Digital Health Passports Using Blockchain -- Use case on international tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-18,"Background: In-hospital mortality among patients with cancer (pts) and COVID-19 infection is high. The frequency of, and factors associated with, donot- resuscitate (DNR) or do-not-intubate (DNI) orders at hospital admission (HA), and their correlation with care, has not been well studied. In November 2020, we began collecting this information for pts who were hospitalized at initial presentation in the CCC19 registry (NCT04354701). Methods: We investigated: 1. the frequency of, and factors associated with, DNR/DNI orders at HA;2. change in code status during HA;and 3. the correlation between DNR/DNI orders and palliative care consultation (PC), mortality or length of stay (LOS). We included hospitalized, adult pts with cancer and COVID-19 from 57 participating sites. Reported characteristics include age, ECOG performance status (PS), and cancer status. Comparative statistics include 2-sided Wilcoxon rank sum and Fisher's exact tests. Results: 744 pts had known baseline and/or changed code status (CS);most (79%) maintained their baseline CS (Table). Those with DNR±DNI orders at HA were older (median age 79 vs 69 yrs, p&lt;0.001) and more likely to have: ECOG PS 2+ vs 0-1 (45% vs 22%, OR 3.95, p&lt;0.001), metastatic disease (45% vs 35%, OR 1.72, p=0.005) and progressing cancer (32% vs 16%, OR 2.69, p&lt;0.001), but equally likely to have received systemic anticancer therapy in the prior 3 months (38% vs 45%, p=0.15). N=192 pts with a change in CS from full to DNR±DNI were younger (median age 73), had better PS (37% ECOG PS 2+), and were less likely to have progressing cancer (23%) than those with DNR±DNI orders at baseline. However, their LOS was significantly longer, median 9 vs 6 days, p&lt;0.001. Compared to those with DNR±DNI orders at HA, pts whose CS changed to DNR±DNI were more likely to die, OR 2.94, 95% CI 1.76-4.97, p&lt;0.001. PC was obtained in 106 (14%) pts and associated with transition to DNR±DNI in 47 (44%), affirmation of admission CS in 58 (55%), and reversal in 1 (1%). Median LOS for pts receiving PC was 11 vs 6 days, p&lt;0.001. Conclusions: In our sample, the majority of patients with cancer and COVID-19 were full code at hospital admission. DNR±DNI status, whether at baseline or assigned during the hospital course, was associated with worse prognosis. Longer length of stay for patients changing code status and/or receiving palliative care consultation was observed likely suggesting earlier palliative care consultation is an important, but likely underutilized component in the care of patients with cancer and COVID-19.

To date, there was limited data regarding the effect of COVID-19 infection on the trend of RT-PCR Ct value, risk factors for disease, effect on liver enzymes, etc. This study aimed to assess the frequency of COVID-19 infection in different age groups and genders. Association of cycle threshold (Ct) values with disease severity and to describe the effect of COVID-19 infection on LFT, Deritis ratio, and CRP. That can be used as indicators for COVID-19 infection diagnosis, the guidance for treatment decisions, and prognosis in infected individuals. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the Molecular Biology and Chemical Pathology sections of the Pathology Department, Shalamar Teaching Hospital Lahore from November 2020 to March 2021. RESULTS: Males 51% were more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Most of the infected individuals 36.5% were in the age group 20-40. Age and underlying comorbidities are important factors that play a significant role in COVID-19 severity. The uppermost number of the patients had symptoms of fever 78.3%, cough 50.4%, and myalgias 50.1% RT-PCR low Ct value could be an important indicator related with the disease severity and mortality risk p value < 0.001 and 0.003 respectively. Bilirubin indirect, ALT, AST, and CRP were significantly associated with disease severity. Deritis ratio and CRP were found to be significantly associated with the risk of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Real-Time PCR results along with Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 may have benefits for clinicians in patient management decisions. Several risk factors e.g., age and comorbidities for developing severe disease and mortality risk have been identified. These biochemical laboratory parameters ALT, AST, Deritis ratio and CRP can be used as predictive biomarkers for progression towards severe disease and risk of mortality.","Khurshid, F.; Iqbal, S.; Mumtaz, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.29.21264304v1?rss=1,328

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 473 UK-based consumers (63% female) in March 2020. A cross-sectional online survey measured variables including food insecurity prevalence, self-reported food waste, food management behaviours, confidence and frequency of use of a range of cooking methods, type of food eaten (ultra-processed, semi-finished, unprocessed) and packaging type foods are purchased in. Findings 39% of participants have experienced some food insecurity in the last 12 months. Being younger, having a greater BMI and living in a smaller household were associated with food insecurity. Green leaves, carrots, potatoes and sliced bread are the most wasted of purchased foods. Polenta, green leaves and white rice are the most wasted cooked foods. Food secure participants reported wasting a smaller percentage of purchased and cooked foods compared to food insecure participants. Overall, participants were most confident about boiling, microwaving and stir-frying and least confident with using a pressure cooker or sous vide. Food secure participants were more confident with boiling, stir-frying, grilling and roasting than insecure food participants. Practical implications This has implications for post lockdown policy, including food policies and guidance for public-facing communications.

In work places/school/industries, the continuous monitoring of the temperature of an individual and ensuring the inhaling air quality of the environment will help us to assure wellness of any individual. The eco-friendly wellness monitor has a wide range of commercial viability as the setup can be employed in institutions, commercial spaces, hospitals, airports, etc., owing to the greater advantage it provides. The monitor simultaneously displays the temperature and helps maintain a clean sanitized environment automatically. The need for an individual's attention is also reduced. For a fearless new normal this eco-friendly monitor would be the apt solution which has a lot of scopes as it can be employed anywhere and everywhere having a greater commercial benefit.

Dysregulated hematopoiesis may compromise antiviral immunity and/or exacerbate immunopathogenesis. Herein, we report an essential role of UBXN3B in maintenance of hematopoietic homeostasis and restriction of immunopathogenesis during respiratory viral infection. Ubxn3b deficient (Ubxn3b−/−) mice are highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A infection, characterized by more severe lung immunopathology, lower virus-specific IgG, significantly fewer B cells, but more myeloid cells than Ubxn3b+/+ littermates. This aberrant immune compartmentalization is recapitulated in uninfected Ubxn3b−/− mice. Mechanistically, UBXN3B controls precursor B-I (pre-BI) transition to pre-BII and subsequent proliferation in a cell-intrinsic manner, by maintaining BLNK protein stability and pre-BCR signaling.

It is an enveloped virus with spike (S) protein attached that facilitates its receptor binding on the surface. Although it has brought about the global interest for the researchers and medical practitioner in the identification of potential targets that may be addressed in order to cope up with the situation. In the current study potential role of cytokines and related inflammatory markers have been identified that interplays in the progression of disease in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODSCurrent study substitutes hundred and fifty (n=150) patients with novel-COVID-19 and hundred (n=100) healthy controls. After getting informed consent serum samples of the participants were collected and analyzed for their significance in the disease progression. Levels of Interleukins i.e., (IL- 1,6,8,10,11) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) were determined with help of their specific spectrophotometric and ELISA methods. RESULTSFindings of study show significant increase in the levels of interleukins and TNF- that signifies the presence of ""cytokine storm"" in worsening the condition in respect to the exposure of COVID-19. Levels of IL-1 and 6 were significantly higher in patients (98.69{+/-}39.35pg/ml and 71.95{+/-}28.41 pg/ml) as compared to controls (30.06{+/-}14.19pg/ml and 9.46{+/-}3.43pg/ml) where, (p=0.001 and 0.007). It also suggests that IL-6 is most sensitive test with about (98%) sensitivity in comparison with 96%,95%, 95%,93% and 92% in case of IL-10,1,8,11 and TNF- respectively. CONCLUSIONCurrent study elucidate the effects of cytokines and respective inflammatory markers in the progression of the COVID-19.

Genomic surveillance for identifying variants would better inform resource allocation and hotspot control. Yet, the implementation of variant surveillance has been regionally variable and prohibitively slow. To improve the availability of variant surveillance, we describe a variant genotyping system that is rapid, accurate, adaptable, and able to detect new low-level variants built with existing hospital infrastructure. Methods: We use a tiered high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 screening program to characterizes variants in a supra-regional health system over 76 days. Combining targeted qPCR and selective sequencing, we screen positive SARS-CoV-2 samples from all hospitals within our health care system for genotyping dominant and emerging variants. Results: The median turn-around for genotyping was two days using the high-throughput qPCR-based screen, allowing us to rapidly characterize the emerging Delta variant. Consistent with prior work, in our population, the Delta variant is associated with a lower CT value (a surrogate for viral load), lower age at infection, and increased vaccine breakthrough cases. Detection of low-level and potentially emerging variants highlights the utility of a tiered approach. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for fast, low-cost, high-throughput monitoring of regional viral sequences as the pandemic unfolds and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants increases. Combing qPCR-based screening with selective sequencing allows for rapid genotyping of variants and dynamic system improvement.","Hubler, Z.; Song, X.; Norris, C.; Jani, M.; Alouani, D.; Atchley, M.; Stempak, L.

The study comprised: (i) presentation of an innovative recipe in the weekly menu of the school canteen;(ii) meal observations of children’s intake at school lunch during the week of the menu modification;(iii) collection of both parents’ and children’s reports on their choices of recipes from the modified weekly menu. The results are commented in light of two important changes that have recently affected Italian public school food procurement: the opening of school canteens to lunches brought from home and the measures adopted since 2020 to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

We quantified the relative protein levels from 12,627 genes across 32 normal human tissue types prepared by the GTEx project. Known and new tissue specific or enriched proteins (5,499) were identified and compared to transcriptome data. Many ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode highly tissue specific proteins. Discordance in the sites of RNA expression and protein detection also revealed potential sites of synthesis and action of protein signaling molecules. Overall, these results provide an extraordinary resource, and demonstrate that understanding protein levels can provide insights into metabolism, regulation, secretome, and human diseases.

170556,Emotional trauma and the risk of PTSD among healthcare workers,2021,"Background: Three SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, two based on mRNA, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, and one based on an adenovirus platform, Ad26.COV2.S, received emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2020/2021. These vaccines displayed clinical efficacy in initial studies against confirmed COVID-19 of 95.0%, 94.1%, and 66.9%, respectively. Methods: Individuals receiving one of these vaccines were invited to participate in a prospective longitudinal comparative study of immune responses elicited by the three vaccines. In this observational cohort study, humoral responses were evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) ELISA and a SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay at 21-32 days and again at 47-64 days following each initial vaccination. Results: The two mRNA-based platforms elicited similar RBD ELISA responses, but significantly higher neutralizing antibody responses were achieved by mRNA-1273. The adenovirus-based vaccine elicited significantly lower RBD ELISA and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization activity. IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays were conducted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained 47-64 days after each initial vaccination. The mRNA-1273 vaccine elicited significantly higher spike glycoprotein-specific T cell responses than either the BNT162b2 or the Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with published efficacy data for the three vaccines and support the use of neutralizing antibody titers as a correlate of protection against symptomatic COVID-19.","Barbeau, D.; Martin, J.; Carney, E.; Dougherty, E.; Doyle, J.; Dermody, T.; Hoberman, A.; Williams, J.; Michaels, M.; Alcorn, J.; Duprex, P.; McElroy, A.

Overnight, parents had to reconcile their professional activities, including teleworking, with the need to keep or even educate their children at home. Others found themselves unemployed, leading to increased financial stress. Children and adolescents were suddenly deprived of their usual activities and social contacts. All of this experienced in a potentially stressful atmosphere (e.g., fear of contamination) and in a context where access to the social support network and psychosocial services was considerably reduced. Several experts have expressed concerns about this situation (Cluver et al., 2020;Witt et al., 2020), fearing that it could push some families into the zone of psychosocial risk and psychological distress (Bérubé et al., 2020;Lawson et al., 2020). Indeed, social adversity can negatively affect children’s and parents’ adjustment, due to the pressure it exerts on family processes (Repetti et al., 2002).

173998,A study on patterns of use of mobile phone and nomophobia in medical undergraduate students during a COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,2021,"Backgrounds: The influenza season of 2020-21 was remarkably low, likely due to implementation of public health preventive measures such as social distancing, mask-wearing, and school closure and due to decreased international travel. This leads to a key public health question: what will happen in the 2021-22 influenza season? To answer this, we developed a multi-season influenza model that accounted for residual immunity from prior infection. Method: We built a multi-strain, non-age structured compartmental model that captures immunity over multiple influenza seasons. By the end of the influenza season, we sorted the population based on their experience of natural infection and/or vaccination, which determines the susceptibility to influenza infection in the following season. Because the exact parameters of transmission rates and immunity are unknown, we implemented Bayesian calibration against the observed influenza epidemics (influenza hospitalization rates from 2012 to 2020 in the US) to estimate those parameters. In forward projections, we simulated low influenza activity in 2020-21 season by lowering transmission rate by 20%. Compared to the counterfactual case, in which influenza activity remained at the normal level in 2020-21, we estimated the change in the number of hospitalizations in the following seasons with varying level of vaccine uptake and effectiveness. We measured the change in population immunity over time by varying the number of seasons with low influenza activity. Result: With the low influenza activity in 2020-21, the model estimated 102,000 [95% CI: 57,000-152,000] additional hospitalizations in 2021-22, without change in vaccine uptake and effectiveness. The expected change in hospitalization varied depending on the level of vaccine uptake and effectiveness in the following year. Achieving 50% increase in one of two measures (1.5X vaccine uptake with 1X vaccine efficacy or 1.5X vaccine efficacy with 1X vaccine uptake) was necessary to avert the expected increase in hospitalization in the next influenza season. Otherwise, increases in both measures by 25% averted the expected increase in influenza-hospitalization. If the low influenza activity seasons continue, population immunity would remain low during those seasons, with 48% the population susceptible to influneza infection. Conclusion: We predicted a large compensatory influenza season in 2021-2 due to a light season in 2020-21. However, higher influenza vaccine uptake would reduce this projected increase in influenza.","Lee, K.; Jalal, H.; Raviotta, J. M.; Krauland, M. G.; Zimmerman, R.; Burke, D. S.; Roberts, M.

We sought to analyze the treatment changes experienced by the prostate cancer patients in March, April and May 2020 and to compare these treatment decisions to the published guidelines. Methods: We focused on patients currently receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with leuprolide acetate, and/or oral anti-androgen agents (Androgen receptor axis targeted agent, ARAT), or chemotherapy. Electronic medical records were reviewed, and the oncologists and nurse practitioners were interviewed to understand the decision-making process. Results: Seventy-five patients were included, median age 72 years old (range 47- 95). All were taking ADT, and 21 were also taking ARAT, and 3 were also receiving chemotherapy. The incidence and indications for their ADT treatments and schedule changes are shown in the table below. Twenty-seven patients (36%) experienced delays in their ADT treatment, and the percentage of treatment change was similar in categories of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), metastatic castration resistant cancer (mCRPC), biochemical recurrence as well as stage IVA post surgery. Four patients were receiving neoadjuvant ADT planned prior to definitive radiation, and none had schedule change. One patient with mHSPC and 2 patients with mCRPC continued chemotherapy as planned. One patient declined recommended chemotherapy for mCRPC. Two patients were given q 3 months dose of ADT instead of q 1m, while all the rest were already receiving q3 months dosing. Among the 27 patients who had schedule change, 12 (44.4%) patients had a discussion with their providers first, and 15 patients (55.6%) did not keep their treatment appointment. Conclusions: About one third of patients changed ADT injection schedule with a similar percentage in patients with mHSPC, or mCRPC or Biochemical recurrence, or IVA after surgery. Every 3 months dosing of ADT recommended by NCCN significantly decreases exposure to COVID -19, delaying or skipping treatment was still encountered due to health concern or travel limitations. On the other hand, all patients receiving neoadjuvant ADT, or chemotherapy stayed on schedule. Although NCCN guideline recommended delaying myelosuppressive therapy, palliative chemotherapy for symptomatic, refractory patients may still be a priority.","Snyder, R.; Meghal, T.; Wood, A.; Schulman, A.; Becker, K.

We show that in-frame deletions (IFDs) also play a significant role in the evolution of viral genome. The percentage of genomes and lineages with IFDs is growing rapidly and they co-occur independently in multiple lineages, including emerging variants of concerns. IFDs distribution is correlated with spike mutations associated with immune escape and concentrated in proteins involved in interactions with the host immune system. Structural analysis suggests that IFDs remodel viral proteins’ surfaces at common epitopes and interaction interfaces, affecting the virus’ interactions with the immune system. We hypothesize that the increased frequency of IFDs is an adaptive response to elevated global population immunity. Summary Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution uncovers increased frequency and non-random distribution of in-frame deletions in recently emerged lineages.","Alisoltani, Arghavan; Jaroszewski, Lukasz; Iyer, Mallika; Iranzadeh, Arash; Godzik, Adam",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.04.451027,328

Computational methods bridge this sequence-annotation gap typically through homology-based annotation transfer by identifying sequence-similar proteins with known function or through prediction methods using evolutionary information. Here, we propose predicting GO terms through annotation transfer based on proximity of proteins in the SeqVec embedding rather than in sequence space. These embeddings originate from deep learned language models (LMs) for protein sequences (SeqVec) transferring the knowledge gained from predicting the next amino acid in 33 million protein sequences. Replicating the conditions of CAFA3, our method reaches an Fmax of 37±2%, 50±3%, and 57±2% for BPO, MFO, and CCO, respectively. Numerically, this appears close to the top ten CAFA3 methods. When restricting the annotation transfer to proteins with <20% pairwise sequence identity to the query, performance drops (Fmax BPO 33±2%, MFO 43±3%, CCO 53±2%); this still outperforms naïve sequence-based transfer. Preliminary results from CAFA4 appear to confirm these findings. Overall, this new concept is likely to change the annotation of proteins, in particular for proteins from smaller families or proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.","Littmann, Maria; Heinzinger, Michael; Dallago, Christian; Olenyi, Tobias; Rost, Burkhard",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.04.282814,328

Medical schools are increasingly using technology to deliver educational activities. No review currently exists to establish the variety of technologies and their uses in undergraduate medical education when patients and/or carers are involved. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and medRxiv were searched in October 2020 and reference lists of key articles were hand searched. Eligible studies reported technology-assisted education, in any setting, involving authentic patients and/or carers. Studies in foreign languages, or describing actors or non-authentic patients were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Levels of patient involvement were assessed using Towle et al (2010) taxonomy. Results: Twenty studies were included. The majority involved patients and/or carers via pre-recorded videos or online scenarios, with no student-interaction. Four studies evaluated remote consultations using telehealth technology, involving real-time interactions with authentic patients. Technology-supported teaching sessions involving patients and/or carers were found to be acceptable to students, educationally valuable (to students and educators), and enhanced student engagement, patient-centred attitudes, knowledge of specific patient groups, and communication and clinical skills. Two studies describing real-time remote interactions with authentic patients indicated potential barriers for students (reduced ability to build relationship with patients and examine them), educators (reduced ability to build rapport with students) and patients (issues with using or accessing telehealth). Conclusions: No studies directly measured the perspective of patients or carers involved in technology-delivered medical education. Future research should establish barriers and facilitators to patients and carers taking up a role in medical students education when technology is used, and evaluate PPI activities at Levels 3 and above as described by Towle et al taxonomy.","Lawes-Wickwar, S.; Lovat, E.; Alao, A.; Hamer-Hunt, J.; Yurtoglu, N.; Jensen, C.; Clarke, N.; Roberts, N.; Park, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.07.21256812v1?rss=1,328

179197,Domestic violence against women during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions,2021,"Bats are the only mammals with self-powered flight and account for 20% of all extant mammalian diversity. In addition, they harbor many emerging and reemerging viruses, including multiple coronaviruses, several of which are highly pathogenic in other mammals, but cause no disease in bats. How this relationship between bats and viruses exists is not yet fully understood. Existing evidence supports a specific role for the innate immune system, in particular type I interferon (IFN) responses, a major component of antiviral immunity. Previous studies in bats have shown that components of the IFN pathway are constitutively activated at the transcriptional level. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the type I IFN response in bats is also constitutively activated at the protein level. For this we utilized highly sensitive Single Molecule (Simoa) digital ELISA assays, previously developed for humans that we adapted to bat samples. We prospectively sampled four non-native chiroptera species from French zoos. We identified a constitutive expression of IFNα protein in the circulation of healthy bats, and concentrations that are physiologically active in humans. Expression levels differed according to the species examined, but was not associated with age, sex, or health status suggesting constitutive IFNα protein expression independent of disease. These results confirm a unique IFN response in bat species that may explain their ability to coexist with multiple viruses in the absence of pathology. These results may help to manage potential zoonotic viral reservoirs and potentially identify new anti-viral strategies.","Bondet, Vincent; Le Baut, Maxime; Le Poder, Sophie; Lécu, Alexis; Petit, Thierry; Wedlarski, Rudy; Duffy, Darragh; Le Roux, Delphine",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449208,328

The aim of this work is to present how the integration of machine learning approaches with mechanistic computational modelling could yield a reliable infrastructure to run probabilistic simulations where the entire organism is considered as a whole. Methods: We propose a general framework that composes advanced AI approaches and integrates mathematical modelling in order to provide a panoramic view over current and future physiological conditions. The proposed architecture is based on a graph neural network (GNNs) forecasting clinically relevant endpoints (such as blood pressure) and a generative adversarial network (GANs) providing a proof of concept of transcriptomic integrability. Results: We show the results of the investigation of pathological effects of overexpression of ACE2 across different signalling pathways in multiple tissues on cardiovascular functions. We provide a proof of concept of integrating a large set of composable clinical models using molecular data to drive local and global clinical parameters and derive future trajectories representing the evolution of the physiological state of the patient. Significance: We argue that the graph representation of a computational patient has potential to solve important technological challenges in integrating multiscale computational modelling with AI.

For these purposes, the authors conducted a quantitative research study based on a self-reported online survey submitted during the pandemic outbreak. Results revealed that the intention of reducing food wastage and implementing leftover management routines are related to the economic value of wasted food. In addition, in both countries, shopping lists are used as planning elements, and food purchases are influenced by on-sale products. Leftover management is also similar in both countries, and the expiration date on the label is the most commonly used criterion for consuming or discarding food items. Nevertheless, within the framework of the health and economic crisis generated, opportunities for change toward the adoption of smarter and more sustainable purchasing behaviors are emerging for both households and companies, in addition to giving equal importance to environmental, social, and economic benefits.

Biomedical scientists (BMSs) play an important role in any health care system. However, they are at high risk of exposure to LMSDs. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and the associated risk factors of LMSDs among this group of healthcare professionals. Methods: A cross sectional survey (Nordic musculoskeletal) was used to estimate the prevalence of LMSDs among BMSs. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science software version 25. Chi square was performed to find the significant association between LMSDs and different risk factors. Results: The study included 83 BMSs. Females represented 63.9% and 36.1% were in the age group of 35 to 44. The overall prevalence of LMSDs was 77.1%. The most prevalent LMSDs were neck, shoulders, and lower back with 50.6%, 49.4%, and 43.4%, respectively. Neck complaints and upper back complaints were found statistically significant with the female gender. Shoulders complaints were associated with pipetting and microscopy. Lower back complaints were associated with pipetting and heavy work at home. A total of 65.57% of BMSs had irregular symptoms of LMSDs, 54.10% experienced moderate pain due to these symptoms, and 44.26% had symptoms that persisted from hours to days. Conclusion: The study found that the prevalence of LMSDs among BMSs was high.

The rapid outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is largely due to its high transmission capacity. Studies implied that the cold chain logistics would be a potential route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The low temperature condition of the cold chain is conducive to survival and transmission of virus. Thus, the virus disinfection in cold chain should not be neglected for controlling COVID-19. However, due to the low temperature feature of the cold-chain, the virus disinfecting methods suitable in cold chain are limited. Here the high-energy electron beam irradiation is proposed to disinfect the SARS-CoV-2 in cold chain logistics. We evaluated the impact of high-energy electron beam irradiation on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped virus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and explored the possible mechanism of the action of high-energy electron beam irradiation on PEDV. The irradiation dose of 10 kGy inactivated 98.1 % PEDV on the both top and bottom surfaces of various packaging materials under cold chain frozen condition.

Despite so many government regulations and awareness measures, there is still a lacuna between the gravity of illness and the knowledge of the average person toward it. Objective: We aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude, and behavioral practice (KAP) of patients on immunosuppressive medication attending the dermatology department toward, COVID-19. Material and Methods: A self-designed printed/digital questionnaire consisting of 30 questions (Hindi and English) was supplied to patients being treated with any systemic immunosuppressives (for at least 3 weeks), for any dermatological ailment. The questionnaire consisted of 12 questions assessing the knowledge, 11 for attitude, and 7 for practices of patients toward COVID-19. Results: The study included 237 patients with a mean age of 44.57 ± 13.72 years. The correct knowledge toward COVID-19 was present in 126 (53.16%) patients with a mean score of 7.79 ± 3.08 out of 13. The mean attitude score was 8.35 ± 2.16 (out of 11) while the mean score of practice was 5.64 ± 2.03 (out of 8). Increased hygiene levels were seen in 220 (92.83%) patients. Sixty-six (27.85%) patients admitted to stopping their prescribed immunosuppressives by themselves during COVID-19 and a significant proportion agreed to the use of alternative medicines with questionable efficacy (n = 91;38.39%). A significant difference in KAP was found across various strata of society like gender, age, socioeconomic status, literacy, and residence (P < 0.001). Limitations: Our study was limited by small sample size, absence of a control group with healthy individuals, and short duration of the study. Conclusions: Most of the participants had poor knowledge, a positive attitude, and good practices toward COVID-19. Proper counseling of patients and the use of telemedicine could help combat the gap in KAP without compromising the healthcare facilities needed for the management of such patients.","Mohta, Alpana Mohta Achala Nai Radhe Arora Aakanksha Aggrawal Aditi Jain Suresh Mehta Rajesh Singh Arti",Indian Journal of Dermatology,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijd.ijd_92_21,328

Within 2 weeks, Manchester Central Convention Centre was converted into a potential 648 bed facility, capable of providing step-down care to patients from the north west.Junior doctors had the opportunity to witness the creation of a field hospital, shape systems and processes, and work with a diverse team coming together for a common cause. To capture their experiences, interviews were conducted using a semi-structured format and the responses summarised into transcripts. Consensus coding was performed using domains/themes.When exploring successes, there was consistent mention of a strong team;in particular the feeling of being individually valued within a flattened hierarchy. Staff wellbeing and education were also regularly mentioned and helped contribute to this overall feeling. When asked what they would take forward, doctors focussed on the importance of a strong team that values multi-disciplinary working.But the hospital was not without challenges, with processes changing from one shift to the next and leading to potential errors. In addition, system issues (such as with medication and documentation) lead to a sometimes-chaotic work environment. Staff identification was a significant challenge, and potentially contributed to communication breakdowns.To rectify this, doctors undertook QI projects which formed the basis for re-activation plans. Perhaps more important than material improvements were feelings of empowerment they identified to achieve actionable change within the hospital.Junior doctors were overwhelmingly positive about their NNW experience. Their power to act as agents of change was showcased at NNW, where senior management encouraged them to take ownership of challenges identified and seek ways to improve the system in which they worked.","Capper, Alice Baird Hannah Kelly Anthony Vernon Michaela",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.195,328

The object of this work was to obtain information on the cognitive-functional impact of social isolation, analyze the changes induced in daily routines and habits, and assess the cognitive adjustment of the adult population to the isolation requirements. We carried out an online adult population survey, that combined multiple choice or binary questions following a Likert ordinal scale, performing a percentage analysis as well as a principal component analysis of the results.

189625,COVID-19: Utilizing local experience to suggest optimal global strategies to prevent and control the pandemic.,2020,"Mouse hepatitis virus-A59 (MHV-A59), a murine coronavirus, can utilize as a cellular receptor MHVR, a murine glycoprotein in the biliary glycoprotein (BGP) subfamily of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family in the immunoglobulin superfamily (G.S. Dveksler, M. N. Pensiero, C. B. Cardellichio, R. K. Williams, G.-S. Jiang, K. V. Holmes, and C. W. Dieffenbach, J. Virol. 65:6881-6891, 1991). Several different BGP isoforms are expressed in tissues of different mouse strains, and we have explored which of these glycoproteins can serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59. cDNA cloning, RNA-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis, and Western immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, CC1, specific for the N-terminal domain of MHVR showed that the inbred mouse strains BALB/c, C3H, and C57BL/6 expressed transcripts and proteins of the MHVR isoform and/or its splice variants but not the mmCGM2 isoform. In contrast, adult SJL/J mice, which are resistant to infection with MHV-A59, express transcripts and proteins only of the mmCGM2-related isoforms, not MHVR. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that the MHVR and mmCGM2 glycoproteins may be encoded by different alleles of the same gene. We studied binding of anti-MHVR antibodies or MHV-A59 virions to proteins encoded by transcripts of MHVR and mmCGM2 and two splice variants of MHVR, one containing two immunoglobulin-like domains [MHVR(2d)] and the other with four domains as in MHVR but with a longer cytoplasmic domain [MHVR(4d)L]. We found that the three isoforms tested could serve as functional receptors for MHV-A59, although only isoforms that include the N-terminal domain of MHVR were recognized by monoclonal antibody CC1 in immunoblots or by MHV-A59 virions in virus overlay protein blot assays. Thus, in addition to MHVR, both the two-domain isoforms, mmCGM2 and MHVR(2d), and the MHVR(4d)L isoform served as functional virus receptors for MHV-A59. This is the first report of multiple related glycoprotein isoforms that can serve as functional receptors for a single enveloped virus.","Dveksler, G S; Dieffenbach, C W; Cardellichio, C B; McCuaig, K; Pensiero, M N; Jiang, G S; Beauchemin, N; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8380065/,328

A prospective database with perioperative data was created. RESULTS Ten appendectomies and 4 cholecystectomies were done in 13 patients, predominantly males (77%), with a mean age of 45 years and a mean BMI of 23 kg/m2. The mean operative time was 31 minutes and 75 minutes for appendectomy and cholecystectomy, respectively. One extra trocar was placed in the first two cholecystectomies, to improve exposure and allow cholangiography. All patients did well at a median follow-up of 5.8 months and no wound infections, nor incisional hernias were detected.

The systemic neglect in the Australian context has resulted in a rise in demand for the services provided by privately practising midwives (PPMs) that is not matched by systemic support for, nor recognition of, women choosing to birth at home. As a result, PPMs are unable to meet the rise in demand, which in itself reflects decades of limited State support for the choice to birth at home and opposition by incumbent stakeholders in the provision of maternity care to healthy women with low-risk pregnancies. We discuss the historical backdrop to these currently erupting issues, along with the real reasons for the opposition to PPMs in Australia.

196331,On Pause for the Pandemic: Health Issues Sidelined Amid COVID-19 Response.,2020-07-01,"During the 1918 influenza pandemic, the U.S., unlike Europe, put considerable effort into public health interventions. There was also more geographic variation in the autumn wave of the pandemic in the U.S. compared with Europe, with some cities seeing only a single large peak in mortality and others seeing double-peaked epidemics. Here we examine whether differences in the public health measures adopted by different cities can explain the variation in epidemic patterns and overall mortality observed. We show that city-specific per-capita excess mortality in 1918 was significantly correlated with 1917 per-capita mortality, indicating some intrinsic variation in overall mortality, perhaps related to sociodemographic factors. In the subset of 23 cities for which we had partial data on the timing of interventions, an even stronger correlation was found between excess mortality and how early in the epidemic interventions were introduced. We then fitted an epidemic model to weekly mortality in 16 cities with nearly complete intervention-timing data and estimated the impact of interventions. The model reproduced the observed epidemic patterns well. In line with theoretical arguments, we found the time-limited interventions used reduced total mortality only moderately (perhaps 10-30%), and that the impact was often very limited because of interventions being introduced too late and lifted too early. San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City had the most effective interventions, reducing transmission rates by up to 30-50%. Our analysis also suggests that individuals reactively reduced their contact rates in response to high levels of mortality during the pandemic.","Bootsma, Martin C J; Ferguson, Neil M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17416677/,328

New Zealand had a rapid and effective lockdown that meant the virtual elimination of community transmission. METHOD Twenty-seven semi-structured interviews were undertaken with low-income people in June-July 2020 immediately after lockdown was lifted. RESULTS Life during lockdown was challenging for study participants. They were fearful of the virus and experienced mental distress and isolation. Most participants felt safe at home and reported coping financially while still experiencing financial stress. Participants were resourceful and resilient. They coped with lockdown by using technology, self-help techniques and support from others. New Zealand's welfare state ensured participants had access to health services and welfare payments, but there were challenges. Welfare payments did not fully meet participants' needs, and support from charitable organisations was critical. Participants were overwhelmingly positive about the Government's response and advised the Government to take the same approach in the future. This is a particularly reassuring finding from some of the most vulnerable New Zealanders.

By this method 14 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the S protein of the c1-2 variant were revealed to react with the S1 subunit and one with the S2 subunit. These 14 MAbs were classified into the following three groups: (A) MAbs reactive to almost all MHV strains examined, (B) MAbs specific for the JHMV strain and (C) MAbs specific for a large S protein of the JHMV strain. All five MAbs classified in group B showed neutralization activity and four of them also showed fusion inhibition activity. Four of six MAbs in group C showed neutralizing activity to the c1-2 variant but not to the sp-4 variant, and most of them had no fusion inhibition activity. Western blot analyses showed that all of the MAbs, except for no. 2 in group A, failed to react with the denatured S and S1 proteins. All MAbs in groups A and C, with the exception of no. 19 in group A, reacted with the mildly denatured S proteins, whereas none of the MAbs in group B did. These results suggest that MAbs in group B recognized highly conformational epitopes which may be involved in the binding of virions to cellular receptors and the fusion activity of the virus.","Kubo, H; Takase-Yoden, S; Taguchi, F",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7687650/,328

In this study, we developed a rice-based oral vaccine expressing cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) under the control of the endosperm-specific expression promoter 2.3-kb glutelin GluB-1 with codon usage optimization for expression in rice seed. An average of 30 mug of CTB per seed was stored in the protein bodies, which are storage organelles in rice. When mucosally fed, rice seeds expressing CTB were taken up by the M cells covering the Peyer's patches and induced CTB-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies with neutralizing activity. When expressed in rice, CTB was protected from pepsin digestion in vitro. Rice-expressed CTB also remained stable and thus maintained immunogenicity at room temperature for >1.5 years, meaning that antigen-specific mucosal immune responses were induced at much lower doses than were necessary with purified recombinant CTB. Because they require neither refrigeration (cold-chain management) nor a needle, these rice-based mucosal vaccines offer a highly practical and cost-effective strategy for orally vaccinating large populations against mucosal infections, including those that may result from an act of bioterrorism.","Nochi, Tomonori; Takagi, Hidenori; Yuki, Yoshikazu; Yang, Lijun; Masumura, Takehiro; Mejima, Mio; Nakanishi, Ushio; Matsumura, Akiko; Uozumi, Akihiro; Hiroi, Takachika; Morita, Shigeto; Tanaka, Kunisuke; Takaiwa, Fumio; Kiyono, Hiroshi",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17573530/,328
202252,An approach towards COVID-19 pandemic with Yoga and Naturopathy interventions- Tamilnadu model,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although first responders (FRs) represent a high-risk group for exposure, little information is available regarding their risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. The purpose of the current study was to determine the serological prevalence of past COVID-19 infection in a cohort of municipal law enforcement (LE) and firefighters (FFs). METHODS: Descriptive analysis of a de-identified data reporting Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG), or COR2G, serology results for municipal FRs. As part of the serology process, FRs were surveyed for COVID-19-like symptoms since February 2020 and asked to report any prior COVID-19 nasal swab testing. Descriptive statistics and two-sided Chi Square tests with Yates correction were used to compare groups. RESULTS: Of 318 FRs, 225 (80.2%) underwent serology testing (LE: 163/207 [78.7%]; FF: 92/111 [82.9%]). The prevalence of positive serology for all FRs tested was 3/255 (1.2%). Two LE (1.2%) and one FF (1.1%) had positive serology (P = 1.0). Two hundred and twenty-four FRs responded to a survey regarding prior symptoms and testing. Fifty-eight (25.9%) FRs (44 LE; 14 FFs) reported the presence of COVID-19-like symptoms. Of these, only nine (15.5%) received reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing; none were positive. Two of the three FRs with positive serology reported no COVID-19-like symptoms and none of these responders had received prior nasal RT-PCR swabs. The overall community positive RT-PCR rate was 0.36%, representing a three-fold higher rate of positive seroprevalence amongst FRs compared with the general population (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: Amongst a cohort of municipal FRs with low community COVID-19 prevalence, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-19 IgG Ab was three-fold greater than the general community. Two-thirds of positive FRs reported a lack of symptoms. Only 15.5% of FRs with COVID-19-like symptoms received RT-PCR testing. In addition to workplace control measures, increased testing availability to FRs is critical in limiting infection spread and ensuring response capability.","McGuire, Sarayna S; Klassen, Aaron B; Heywood, John; Sztajnkrycer, Matthew D",Prehosp Disaster Med,,328
202403,"Shared trauma, resilience, and growth: A roadmap toward transcultural conceptualization",2021,"Organic nitrogen (ON) compounds are key contents of particulate matter in the megacities of Asia. As a series of important ON, nitrated phenolic compounds (NPs) are of high concentration in the atmosphere, although their formation mechanism and role in particulate nucleation and growth are not fully understood. Herein, using a high level of quantum mechanical calculations, we explore the formation paths of NPs initiated by NO3· radicals, where some common atmospheric species, such as H2O, (H2O)2, NH3, and dimethylamine (DMA), can act as molecular catalysts. The kinetic study predicts that the formation rate of methyl nitrophenols with the assistance of DMA and (H2O)2 can reach â¼103 molecules·cm-3·s-1 in a polluted and humid atmosphere. The volatilities obtained from the empirical model show the formed NPs mainly belong to the intermediate and semivolatile organic compounds, which can participate in the growth process of aerosols rather than the early stage of cluster nucleation. Moreover, some NPs can be salified with atmospheric bases to further increase their contributions to the particulate formation.","Wang, Shixian; Li, Hui",Environ. sci. technol,,328

203741,"Incb, Who and Unodc Statement on Access to Internationally Controlled Medicines during Covid-19 Pandemic",2020,"Bearing a strong resemblance to the phenotypic and functional remodeling of the immune system that occurs during aging (termed immunesenescence), the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by an expansion of inflammatory monocytes, functional exhaustion of lymphocytes, dysregulated myeloid responses and the presence of highly activated senescent T cells. Alongside advanced age, male gender and pre-existing co-morbidities [e.g., obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D)] are emerging as significant risk factors for COVID-19. Interestingly, immunesenescence is more profound in males when compared to females, whilst accelerated aging of the immune system, termed premature immunesenescence, has been described in obese subjects and T2D patients. Thus, as three distinct demographic groups with an increased susceptibility to COVID-19 share a common immune profile, could immunesenescence be a generic contributory factor in the development of severe COVID-19? Here, by focussing on three key aspects of an immune response, namely pathogen recognition, elimination and resolution, we address this question by discussing how immunesenescence may weaken or exacerbate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. We also highlight how aspects of immunesenescence could render potential COVID-19 treatments less effective in older adults and draw attention to certain therapeutic options, which by reversing or circumventing certain features of immunesenescence may prove to be beneficial for the treatment of groups at high risk of severe COVID-19.","Hazeldine, Jon; Lord, Janet M",Front Immunol,,328
203769,Methodology for Detecting Cyber Intrusions in e-Learning Systems during COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The impact of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has many facets. This ecological study analysed age-standardized incidence rates by economic level in Barcelona. METHODS: We evaluated confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Barcelona (Spain) between 26 February 2020 and 19 April 2020. Districts were classified according to most recent (2017) mean income data. The reference for estimating age-standardized cumulative incidence rates was the 2018 European population. The association between incidence rate and mean income by district was estimated with the Spearman rho. RESULTS: The lower the mean income, the higher the COVID-19 incidence (Spearman rho = 0.83; P value = 0.003). Districts with the lowest mean income had the highest incidence of COVID-19 per 10 000 inhabitants; in contrast, those with the highest income had the lowest incidence. Specifically, the district with the lowest income had 2.5 times greater incidence of the disease, compared with the highest-income district [70 (95% confidence interval 66-73) versus 28 (25-31), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of COVID-19 showed an inverse socioeconomic gradient by mean income in the 10 districts of the city of Barcelona. Beyond healthcare for people with the disease, attention must focus on a health strategy for the whole population, particularly in the most deprived areas.","Baena-Díez, Jose Miguel; Barroso, María; Cordeiro-Coelho, Sara Isabel; Díaz, Jorge L; Grau, María",J Public Health (Oxf),,328

204556,Impact of the Family Environment on the Emotional State of Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak: The Mediating Effect of Self-Efficacy,2020,"In the original article, there was an error. A citation was inserted incorrectly at the end of a paragraph. A correction has beenmade to Discussion, Paragraph 6. The corrected paragraph is shown below. With social distancing, people are modifying their social bonds, and this could result in a negative impact on the eating habits of the participants, especially the older adults (Allès et al., 2019). There is a correlation between social bonds and eating habits (Campos et al., 2000;Silveira et al., 2015). However, with stress, there may be changes in the quantity and the quality of the food consumed, a decrease in appetite (Petrowski et al., 2014;Reichenberger et al., 2018), as well as an increase in high caloric density food consumption. These alterations may lead to changes in glycemia, lipid profile, and consequently increased risk for the development of chronic diseases (Evers et al., 2010;Van Strien et al., 2012;Sinha, 2018). In the present study, adults reported lower frequency of fruit and vegetable intake and higher frequency of protein intake in comparison to older adults. Sidor and Rzymski (2020) have shown a decrease in fruit and vegetable consumption and a greater tendency to consume meat during social distancing among adults. Older adults usually eat less proteins, fruits, and vegetables, which may be related to the presence of chronic disease or with oral cavity alterations (Gaspareto et al., 2017;Ibge, 2019), reflecting on implications in muscle mass, such as sarcopenia and other adverse outcomes (do Nascimento Ferreira et al., 2017).

We investigated whole-blood expression of cholinergic system members and correlated it with COVID-19 severity. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and healthy aged-matched controls were included in this non-interventional study. A whole blood sample was drawn between 9-11 days after symptoms onset, and peripheral leukocyte phenotyping, cytokines measurement, RNA expression and plasma viral load were determined. Additionally, whole-blood expression of native alpha-7 nicotinic subunit and its negative dominant duplicate (CHRFAM7A), choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine esterase (AchE) were determined. Thirty-seven patients with COVID-19 (10 moderate, 11 severe and 16 with critical disease) and 14 controls were included. Expression of CHRFAM7A was significantly lower in critical COVID-19 patients compared to controls. COVID-19 patients not expressing CHRFAM7A had higher levels of CRP, more extended pulmonary lesions and displayed more pronounced lymphopenia. COVID-19 patients without CHRFAM7A expression also showed increased TNF pathway expression in whole blood. AchE was also expressed in 30 COVID-19 patients and in all controls. COVID-19-induced hypercytokinemia is associated with decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory dominant negative duplicate CHRFAM7A.

204750,Management of a Child vs an Adult Presenting With Acral Lesions During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Practical Review,2021,"The influence of low intensity electromagnetic fields on circadian clocks of cells and tissues has gained increasing scientific interest, either as a therapeutic tool or as a potential environmental hazard. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) refers to the property of certain atomic nuclei to absorb the energy of radio waves under a corresponding magnetic field. NMR forms the basis for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and, in a low-intensity form, for NMR therapy (tNMR). Since the circadian clock is bi-directionally intertwined with hypoxic signaling in vertebrates and mammals, we hypothesized that low intensity electromagnetic fields, such as tNMR, might not only affect circadian clocks but also Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;). As master regulator of the hypoxic signaling pathway, HIF-1&#945; is known to dampen the circadian amplitude under reduced oxygen availability, while the hypoxic response of cells and organisms, itself, is tightly clock controlled. In a first experiment, we investigated if tNMR is able to act as Zeitgeber for the core clock mechanism of unsynchronized zebrafish and mouse fibroblast cells, using direct light irradiation and treatment with the glucocorticoid Dexamethasone as references. tNMR significantly affected the cell autonomous clocks of unsynchronized mouse fibroblast cells NIH3-T3, but did not act as a Zeitgeber. Similar to light irradiation and in contrast to treatment with Dexamethasone, tNMR did not synchronize expression profiles of murine clock genes. However, irradiation with tNMR as well as light significantly altered mRNA and protein expression levels of Cryptochrome1, Cryptochrome2 and Clock1 for more than 24 h. Changes in mRNA and protein after different treatment durations, namely 6 and 12 h, appeared to be nonlinear. A nonlinear dose-response relationship is known as hallmark of electromagnetic field induced effects on biological systems. The most prominent alterations were detected in murine HIF-1&#945; protein, again in a nonlinear dose-response. In contrast to murine cells, zebrafish fibroblasts did not respond to tNMR at all. Light, a potent Zeitgeber for the peripheral clocks of fish, led to the expected synchronized clock gene oscillations of high amplitude, as did Dexamethasone. Hence, we conclude, mammalian peripheral clocks are more susceptible to tNMR than the direct light entrainable fish fibroblasts. Although light and tNMR did not act as Zeitgebers for the circadian clocks of unsynchronized murine cells, the significant observed effects might indicate downstream cell-physiological ramifications, which are worth future investigation. However, beside the effects tNMR exerts on the core clock mechanism of mammalian cells, the technology might be the first non-pharmacological approach to modify HIF-1&#945; protein in cells and tissues. HIF-1&#945; and the associated circadian clock play key roles in diseases with underlying ischemic background, such as infarct, stroke, and cancer and, also infectious diseases, such as Covid-19. Hence, low intensity magnetic fields such as tNMR might be of significant medical interest.","Thöni, Viktoria; Oliva, Regina; Mauracher, David; Egg, Margit",Chronobiol Int,,328

Goal of the study was to determine the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Perception (KAP) of Georgian patients attending dental clinics regarding cross-infections and infection control measures in dentistry. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 570 participants from all 10 regions of Georgia and Tbilisi (the capital city) during 2019. A standardized, confidential, self-administered, close-ended questionnaire was used to assess respondents' knowledge, attitudes, self-reported practices, perception and behaviors toward cross-infection control measures in dental clinics. 71.4% (n 407) of participants were females and 28.6% (n 163) were males. 72.6%, 63.2%, and 62.5% of respondents agreed that they can catch during dental treatment HCV, HBV and AIDS/HIV respectively, while 50.5% and 55.8% mentioned about TB and respiratory infectious (RI) diseases respectively. 80% of participants are concerned about the risk to be infected during the dental treatment. 62.5% of participants responded that they would not receive treatment in dental clinic where HIV and HBV/HCV patients are being treated. Overall, the study suggests that participants' knowledge, attitude and perception regarding cross-infection control in dentistry need some improvements.

205901,Persons with Substance Abuse Disorders and Other Addictions: Coping with the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate promising performance in natural image computer vision tasks. However, their use in medical computer vision tasks faces several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations through application to the pandemic-caused need for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution highlights significant benefits obtained through (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance over individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages for validating results; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; and, (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We find that ensemble approaches markedly improved classification and localization performance, and that inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helps guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Sornapudi, Sudhir; Alderson, Philip O; Folio, Les R; Antani, Sameer K",PLoS One,,328

Consider that a simple search on Google usingthe terms ""vaccine mRNA"" immediately yields a ""COVID-19 alert"" with several ""common questions,"" including ""Could an mRNA vaccine change my DNA?""

207342,The Media Coverage of Drugs and Alcohol in Punjab during COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, a majority of states have instituted ""shelter-in-place"" policies effectively quarantining individuals-including pregnant persons-in their homes. Given the concern for COVID-19 acquisition in health care settings, pregnant persons with high-risk pregnancies-such as persons living with HIV (PLHIV)-are increasingly investigating the option of a home birth. Although we strongly recommend hospital birth for PLHIV, we discuss our experience and recommendations for counseling and preparation of pregnant PLHIV who may be considering home birth or at risk for unintentional home birth due to the pandemic. We also discuss issues associated with implementing a risk mitigation strategy involving high-risk births occurring at home during a pandemic. KEY POINTS: · Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has increased interest in home birth.. · Women living with HIV are pursuing home birth.. · Safe planning is paramount for women living with HIV desiring home birth, despite recommending against the practice..","Premkumar, Ashish; Cassimatis, Irina; Berhie, Saba H; Jao, Jennifer; Cohn, Susan E; Sutton, Sarah H; Condron, Brianne; Levesque, Jordan; Garcia, Patricia M; Miller, Emily S; Yee, Lynn M",Am J Perinatol,,328

209118,[Proposals by the Spanish Society of Quality in Healthcare (SECA) for the recovery of the National Health Service after the COVID-19 pandemic],2020,"Abstract Background Patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are at risk for thrombotic complications necessitating use of therapeutic unfractionated heparin (UFH). Full-dose anticoagulation limits requirements for organ support interventions in moderately ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given this benefit, it is important to evaluate response to therapeutic anticoagulation in this population. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess therapeutic UFH infusions and associated bleeding risk in patients with COVID-19. Patients/Methods This retrospective cohort study includes patients at Brigham and Women?s Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, receiving weight-based nursing-nomogram titrated UFH infusion during a 10-week surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Of 358 patients on therapeutic UFH during this interval, 97 (27.1%) had confirmed COVID-19. Patient characteristics, laboratory values, and information regarding UFH infusion and bleeding events were obtained from the electronic medical record. Results Patients who were COVID-19 positive had fewer therapeutic activatrd partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) compared to COVID-19?negative patients (median rate, 40.0% vs 53.1%;P &lt; .0005). Both major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were increased in COVID-19?positive patients, with major bleeding observed in 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7%-17.9%) of patients who were COVID-19 positive and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.6%-5.9%) of patients who were COVID-19 negative (P &lt; .005). In logistic regression, bleeding events were associated with receiving UFH for longer than 7 days, but not platelet count, coagulation, or inflammatory measurements. Conclusions Our data indicate a higher incidence of bleeding complications in patients with COVID-19 receiving weight-based nursing-nomogram titrated UFH infusions despite a higher prevalence of subtherapeutic aPTTs in this population. These data underscore the need for prospective studies aimed at improving the quality and safety of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19.","Weeks, Lachelle D.; Sylvester, Katelyn W.; Connors, Jean M.; Connell, Nathan T.",Research and Practice in Thrombosis and Haemostasis,,328

Yet they may also utilize emotional and behavioral coping strategies. This qualitative paper aims to identify ways of coping with worries and stress during the pandemic from the perspectives of older adults in the United States. Methods: The COVID-19 Coping Study recruited 6,938 adults aged &#8805;55 through online multi-frame sampling from April 2-May 31, 2020 across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The online questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on daily life, mental health, and well-being. This included an open-ended question regarding participants' coping strategies. We used qualitative content analysis to identify and code diverse coping strategies. Our general inductive approach enabled findings to emerge from the most frequent and dominant themes in the raw data. Results: A total of 5,180 adults [74% of the total sample; mean age 67.3 (SD 7.9); 63.8% female] responded to the question about using strategies to cope with living through the COVID-19 pandemic. Frequently-reported strategies included exercising and going outdoors, modifying routines, following public health guidelines, adjusting attitudes, and staying socially connected. Some coping strategies were health-limiting (e.g., overeating), while most strategies encouraged self-improvement, positive adjustment, and wellness. Conclusions: This study provides novel qualitative evidence on coping strategies of older adults early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings can inform community and clinical interventions to support older adults that harness positive coping strategies such as exercise, modified routines, and social strategies to improve physical and mental health, foster social support, and encourage meaningful daily activities during times of stress and trauma.","Finlay, Jessica M; Kler, Jasdeep S; O039,; Shea, Brendan Q; Eastman, Marisa R; Vinson, Yamani R; Kobayashi, Lindsay C",Front Public Health,,328

212342,Covid-19 pandemic containment: following the example of military submariners,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is an extremely common clinical method for detecting pathogens, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Currently, detection of the RNA from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the gold standard for establishing a COVID-19 diagnosis. This study evaluates the characteristic performance of the analytical system in a clinical laboratory. METHODS: A commercial SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR Kit used in a clinical laboratory is assessed based on ISO 15189 verification requirements. A multiple real-time RT-PCR assay for the RdRP, N, and E genes in SARS-CoV-2 is verified. RESULTS: The analytical system exhibits good analytical sensitivity (1000 copies/mL) and specificity (100%); however, the values of 86.7% and 100% for analytical accuracy deserved attention, compared with two other types of methods. Overall, the kit is potentially useful for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing and meets the verification requirements. CONCLUSION: Compliance with international standards, such as ISO 15189, is valuable for clinical laboratories and for improving laboratory medicine quality and safety. Normalization is essential for obtaining reliable results from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR assay. This study aims to develop an improved SARS-CoV-2 verification framework compared with traditional molecular diagnostic methods, given the urgency of implementing new assays in clinical laboratories.","Wu, Yingping; Xu, Wei; Zhu, Zhiqiang; Xia, Xiaoping",J Clin Lab Anal,,328

212761,The interplay between environmental exposures and COVID-19 risks in the health of children,2021,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on infant feeding in the context of COVID-19 uphold standing recommendations for breastfeeding, non-separation, and skin-to-skin contact, including the use of donor human milk when mother's own milk is not available. INSUFFICIENT GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF DONOR HUMAN MILK AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN MILK BANKS IN THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE: COVID-19 clinical management guidelines in seven countries in Southeast Asia are not aligned with WHO recommendations despite the lack of evidence of transmission through either breastmilk or breastfeeding. The use of safe donor human milk accessed through human milk banks is also insufficiently recommended, even in countries with an existing human milk bank, leading to a gap in evidence-based management of COVID-19. This highlights long-standing challenges as well as opportunities in the safe, equitable, and resilient implementation of human milk banks in the region. CONCLUSIONS: This statement reflects the expert opinion of the Regional Human Milk Bank Network for Southeast Asia and Beyond on the need to revisit national guidelines based on the best evidence for breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, to incorporate human milk bank services in national obstetric and newborn care guidelines for COVID-19 where possible, and to ensure that operations of human milk banks are adapted to meet the needs of the current pandemic and to sustain donor human milk supply in the long-term. The Network also recommends sustained engagement with the global human milk bank community.","Olonan-Jusi, Estrella; Zambrano, Paul G; Duong, Vu H; Anh, Nguyen T T; Aye, Nant S S; Chua, Mei Chien; Kurniasari, Hikmah; Moe, Zaw Win; Ngerncham, Sopapan; Phuong, Nguyen T T; Datu-Sanguyo, Janice",Int Breastfeed J,,328

Methods: Acute respiratory tract infections were collected from 3 hospitals in Shanghai from 2015 to 2019. Relevant information was registered and respiratory specimens were sampled for detection of respiratory pathogens by multiplex PCR. Results: A total of 1 543 cases of acute respiratory tract infection were included. The positive rate of adenovirus was 2.92%(45/1 543), the positive rates of influenza like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were 2.74%(29/1 058) and 3.30%(16/485), respectively. The positive rate of ILI during January-May 2019 was 5.43%(7/129), higher than that in the same period of 2015- 2018 (0.52%-4.48%) (Fisher's exact test value=8.92, P=0.036). The incidence of adenovirus-positive cases was mainly distributed in the first and second quarters, accounting for 62.22% (28/45). The difference of the incidence of adenovirus-positive cases in each quarter was significant (&#967;(2)= 12.52, P=0.006). The positive rate in the second quarter was highest (6.03%), which was higher than that in other quarters (1.89%-2.93%). There were significant differences among different age groups (&#967;(2)=16.94, P=0.001), and the positive rate decreased with age (&#967;(2)=10.16, P=0.001). The positive rate of 13-19 years old group (9.43%) was higher than that of other age groups (1.48%-4.81%). The positive rate of student group (12.07%) was higher than that of other occupations (2.61%). The difference was systematic (&#967;(2)=11.53, P=0.001). Mixed infection accounted for 31.11% (14/45) of 45 adenovirus positive cases. The mixed infection rates of ILI and SARI were 34.48% (10/29) and 25.00% (4/16), respectively. Among 14 cases of mixed infection, the main mixed infection pathogens of adenovirus were influenza A virus and coronavirus. Conclusion: Adenovirus surveillance should be further strengthened in adolescents with a focus on students and other key groups in the second quarter.","Kong, D C; Zheng, Y X; Jiang, C Y; Pan, H; Han, R B; Wu, H Y; Chen, J",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,328

This article is based on a review of current labor and delivery guidelines in relation to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, and on an email survey of 28 community-based and hospital-based maternity care providers in the United State, who discuss their experiences and clients' needs in response to a rapidly shifting landscape of maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. One-third of our respondents are obstetricians, while the other two-thirds include midwives, doulas, and labor and delivery nurses. We present these providers' frustrations and coping mechanisms in shifting their practices in relation to COVID-19. The primary lessons learned relate to improved testing and accessing PPE for providers and clients;the need for better integration between community- and hospital-based providers;and changes in restrictive protocols concerning labor support persons, rooming-in with newborns, immediate skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding. We conclude by suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic offers a transformational moment to shift maternity care in the United States toward a more integrated and sustainable model that might improve provider and maternal experiences as well as maternal and newborn outcomes.","Gutschow, K.; Davis-Floyd, R.",Frontiers in Sociology,,328

K150del, a natural variant of APC, is associated with reduced anticoagulant activity. We performed a comprehensive study to analyze the functional alterations of the K150del mutant. Transcriptome analysis of HEK 293T cells treated with wild and mutant APC revealed differentially expressed genes enriched in inflammatory, apoptotic, and virus defense-related signaling pathways. Both wild and mutant APC displayed concentration-dependent cytoprotective effects. Low concentrations of K150del mutant resulted in decreased anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities, whereas its higher concentrations restored these effects. Expression of virus defense-related genes improved in mouse lung tissues after repeated administration of the APC variant. These results suggest that the APC K150del mutant could help clinicians to accurately predict disease risks and serve as a potential auxiliary therapeutic in viral infections, including 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).","Lin, Wen-Yi; Tang, Liang; Lu, Xuan; Hu, Yu",Aging (Albany NY),,328

219170,Prosociality Predicts Health Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Novel-coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is currently a worldwide health risk and public health emergency concern. The virus is transmitted from an infected person to another person through close contact and droplets. Frontline health care workers are the most at risk of infection, and so a WHO interim guidance document was issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) which underscores the importance of proper sanitation and waste management practices for COVID- 19 in health-care settings. This study aimed at assessing knowledge and preventive practices towards Covid-19 among health care providers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno Bedele zones, Southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020 among 330 health workers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno-Bedelle Zones, Southwest Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of preventive practices towards Covid-19. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value of < 0.05. RESULT: The majority of respondents (93.3%) demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19, and the mean (SD) knowledge score was 9.04 ± 1.06. Nearly two-thirds (64.2%) of the study participants had good infection prevention practices. Being male (AOR = 3.65, 95% CI: (1.96, 6.80)), education level (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI (1.02, 3.22)), profession (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI (1.08, 9.33)), service year (5-10 years) (AOR = 2.00 (1.02, 3.92)) and more than 10 years (AOR = 3.14 (1.51, 6.52)), availability of personal protective equipment (AOR = 1.96 (1.06, 3.61)) and Knowledge level (AOR = 2.61 (1.48, 4.62)) were independent predictors of COVID-19 preventive practices. CONCLUSION: The overall level of knowledge of HCWs was good. However, the practice was relatively low. Gender, educational status, profession, year of service, knowledge towards COVID-19, and availability of personal protective equipment were independent predictors of good infection prevention practices. Optimizing the infection prevention and control loop of the health facilities is recommended.","Tsegaye, Dereje; Shuremu, Muluneh; Oljira, Dereje; Dubale, Sileshi; Befekadu, Getachew; Bidira, Kebebe",BMC Infect Dis,,328

219708,Resilience during uncertainty? Greater social connectedness during COVID-19 lockdown is associated with reduced distress and fatigue,2020,"BACKGROUND: Public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak may impact on the incidence rate of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in severely affected areas. However, this phenomenon demands attention also in areas where media and patients were focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, but the healthcare system was not overwhelmed by the huge number of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this observational study, we compared the incidence rate of all consecutive STEMI patients admitted at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy, during March and April 2020 with the same 2 months of the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Patient characteristics were compared between 2020 and 2019.The incidence rate of STEMI admission in March-April 2020 was lower than those in March-April 2015-2019, 36 vs. 56 cases per 100â000âinhabitants/year [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.96, Pâ=â0.045]. Considering that the incidence rates were constant in the past years (Pâ=â0.24), the turnaround in 2020 is most likely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, this reduction was a dynamic phenomenon with a U-shaped curve during the 2-month period. System-of-care times were similar between 2020 and 2019; however in 2020, patients presented more frequently signs of heart failure compared to 2019 (Killip class &#8805;2 in 68% vs. 29%, Pâ=â0.003). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a marked reduction in the STEMI incidence rate. This U-shaped phenomenon demands attention because a potential cause for the decrease in STEMI incidence may include the avoidance of medical care. Public campaigns aiming to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms may be needed during community outbreak.","Fabris, Enrico; Bessi, Riccardo; De Bellis, Annamaria; Gregorio, Caterina; Peratoner, Alberto; Lardieri, Gerardina; Cominotto, Franco; Vitrella, Giancarlo; Rakar, Serana; Perkan, Andrea; Sinagra, Gianfranco",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,328
220177,The crisis of Neoliberal project of aging during the COVID-19 pandemic: from compulsory activity to mandatory isolation,2020,"Background: COVID-19 interacts at multiple levels with the cardiovascular system. The prognosis of COVID-19 infection is known to be worse for patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the virus is responsible for many cardiovascular complications. Myocardial injury may affect up to 20% of the critically ill patients. However, echocardiography's impact on the management of patients affected by COVID-19 remains unknown. Objectives: To explore echocardiography's impact on the management of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study was conducted from March 24th to April 14th, 2020, in a single center at Adolphe de Rothschild Foundation Hospital, Paris, France. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory and/or CT COVID-19 diagnosis were included in this study. Patients' characteristics (clinical, biological, and imaging) and treatment change induced by echocardiography were collected and analyzed. Patients with and without treatment change induced by echocardiography were compared. Results: A total of 56 echocardiographies in 42 patients with highly suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were included in the final analyses. The median age was 66 (IQR 60.5-74). Echocardiography induced a treatment change in 9 cases (16%). The analyzed clinical data were not associated with any treatment change induced by echocardiography. D-dimer and Troponin levels were the only biological predictors of the induced treatment change. On echocardiography, higher systolic pulmonary arterial pressure and documented cardiac thrombi were associated with treatment changes in these patients. Conclusions: Echocardiography may be useful for the management of selected COVID-19 patients, especially those with elevated D-Dimer and Troponin levels, in up to 16% of patients.","Benyounes, Nadia; Van Der Vynckt, Clélie; Tibi, Séverine; Iglesias, Alexandra; Salomon, Laurence; Gout, Olivier; Tibi, Thierry",Cardiol Res Pract,,328
221361,Impact of Bhagavad Gita Course on College Students: A Study Based on Students Feedback,2020,"Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated closure of physical classroom for maintaining social distancing norms, prompting learning environment to shift from offline to online. Medical education has also undergone similar changes, and online education and assessment methods had to be implemented. Student's perception regarding the same was assessed through this study. Aim: To assess the perception of first year MBBS students about the online education and assessment during the lockdown period of two months. Materials and Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on the first year MBBS students of North Bengal Medical College (NBMCH) during the COVID-19 Lockdown period. All first year MBBS students of NBMCH were added in WhatsApp groups created for academic purposes by Department of Anatomy, NBMCH during the lockdown period. Respective teachers in the academic groups carried out sharing of Digital Education Material (DEM), holding Online Interaction (OI) and correspondence with students, and taking Online Assessments (OA) through sharing questions framed in Google Forms. After two months, the perception of the students was assessed through a voluntary participation based online survey designed in google forms, the results of which were tabulated later and analysed. Results: A total 95 students (54 Male, 41 Female) out of 200 had participated in the survey. Most students were reliant on smartphones (n=90, 94.7%) and mobile internet (n=78, 82%). Most agreed on DEM being relevant (83.2%) and informative (80.7%) but showed diverging opinion on ease of understanding, revision and overall fulfillment of learning objective. On OI majority students responded positively on promptness, relevancy, informative and helpfulness but only 46.8% considered DEM and OI fulfilled the overall learning objective. Regarding OA students had an overall positive opinion. Comparing the online mode with offline, students mostly preferred the latter, though agreeing that online method of education was effective and it was easier to score in OAs. Conclusion: While most students accepted online education, interaction and assessment positively, at the end most of them still preferred offline mode of education and assessment. This could reflect lack of student-student interaction and indicated need of further studies to explore the matter, to help us approach online education better.","Ghosal, T.; Sadhu, A.; Mukherjee, P.; Mukhopadhyay, P.",Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research,,328
221427,The mental health of Australian medical practitioners during Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the four months after the discovery of the index case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several studies highlighted the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline health care workers and on members of the general public. It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020. The following search strings were used: ""NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus OR COVID19 OR COVID"" and ""mHealth OR eHealth OR text"". Another search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google) was used to identify if the cited web-based interventions could be accessed. A mobile app search engine, App Annie, was used to determine if the identified mobile apps were commercially available. Results: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological distress. Digital tools that are commercially available may be useful for at-risk individuals or individuals with pre-existing psychiatric symptoms.","Zhang, Melvyn; Smith, Helen Elizabeth",J Med Internet Res,,328

222949,The role of digital health technologies in COVID-19 surveillance and recovery: a specific case of long haulers,2021,"Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.","Sims, Natalie; Kasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara",Environ Int,,328

223340,A Pilot Test of a Text Message-Based Transgender and Nonbinary Affirmative Cognitive-Behavioral Intervention for Anxiety and Depression,2020,"Tocilizumab has been reported to attenuate the ""cytokine storm"" in COVID-19 patients. We attempted to verify the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab therapy in COVID-19 and identify patients most likely to benefit from this treatment. We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label multicenter trial among COVID-19 patients. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tocilizumab in addition to standard care or standard care alone. The cure rate, changes of oxygen saturation and interference, and inflammation biomarkers were observed. Thirty-three patients were randomized to the tocilizumab group, and 32 patients to the control group. The cure rate in the tocilizumab group was higher than that in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (94.12% vs. 87.10%, rate difference 95% CI-7.19%-21.23%, P = 0.4133). The improvement in hypoxia for the tocilizumab group was higher from day 4 onward and statistically significant from day 12 (P = 0.0359). In moderate disease patients with bilateral pulmonary lesions, the hypoxia ameliorated earlier after tocilizumab treatment, and less patients (1/12, 8.33%) needed an increase of inhaled oxygen concentration compared with the controls (4/6, 66.67%; rate difference 95% CI-99.17% to-17.50%, P = 0.0217). No severe adverse events occurred. More mild temporary adverse events were recorded in tocilizumab recipients (20/34, 58.82%) than the controls (4/31, 12.90%). Tocilizumab can improve hypoxia without unacceptable side effect profile and significant influences on the time virus load becomes negative. For patients with bilateral pulmonary lesions and elevated IL-6 levels, tocilizumab could be recommended to improve outcome.","Wang, Dongsheng; Fu, Binqing; Peng, Zhen; Yang, Dongliang; Han, Mingfeng; Li, Min; Yang, Yun; Yang, Tianjun; Sun, Liangye; Li, Wei; Shi, Wei; Yao, Xin; Ma, Yan; Xu, Fei; Wang, Xiaojing; Chen, Jun; Xia, Daqing; Sun, Yubei; Dong, Lin; Wang, Jumei; Zhu, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Min; Zhou, Yonggang; Pan, Aijun; Hu, Xiaowen; Mei, Xiaodong; Wei, Haiming; Xu, Xiaoling",Front.

This study aims to analyze the pandemic risk of COVID-19 outbreak in the US. METHODS: Time series plots of the network density, together with the daily reported confirmed COVID-19 cases and flight frequency in the five states in the US with the largest numbers of COVID-19 cases, were developed to discover the trends and patterns of the pandemic connectedness of COVID-19 among the five states. RESULTS: The research findings suggest that the pandemic risk of the outbreak in the US could be detected as early as the beginning of March. The signal was prior to the rapid increase of reported COVID-19 cases and flight reduction measures. Travel restriction can be strengthened at early stage of the outbreak while more focus of local public health measures can be addressed after community spread occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the application of network density on detection of the pandemic risk and its relationship with air travel restriction in order to provide useful information for policymakers to better optimize timely containment strategies to mitigate the outbreak of infectious diseases.","Tiwari, Agnes; So, Mike K P; Chong, Andy C Y; Chan, Jacky N L; Chu, Amanda M Y",Int. j. infect. dis,,328
224820,"Child maltreatment in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic: A proposed global framework on research, policy and practice",2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We seek to describe the medical history and clinical findings of patients attending the emergency department (ED) with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and estimate the diagnostic accuracy of patients' characteristics for predicting COVID-19. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in our ED from March 9, 2020, to April 4, 2020. We abstracted medical history, physical examination findings, and the clinical probability of COVID-19 (low, moderate, and high) rated by emergency physicians, depending on their clinical judgment. We assessed diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 by calculating positive and negative likelihood ratios. RESULTS: We included 391 patients, of whom 225 had positive test results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction result was more likely to be negative when the emergency physician thought that clinical probability was low, and more likely to be positive when he or she thought that it was high. Patient-reported anosmia and the presence of bilateral B lines on lung ultrasonography had the highest positive likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (7.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.36 to 24.36; and 7.09, 95% CI 2.77 to 18.12, respectively). The absence of a high clinical probability determined by the emergency physician and the absence of bilateral B lines on lung ultrasonography had the lowest negative likelihood ratio for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (0.33, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.43; and 0.26, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.45, respectively). CONCLUSION: Anosmia, emergency physician estimate of high clinical probability, and bilateral B lines on lung ultrasonography increased the likelihood of identifying COVID-19 in patients presenting to the ED.","Peyrony, Olivier; Marbeuf-Gueye, Carole; Truong, Vy; Giroud, Marion; Rivière, Clémentine; Khenissi, Khalil; Legay, Léa; Simonetta, Marie; Elezi, Arben; Principe, Alessandra; Taboulet, Pierre; Ogereau, Carl; Tourdjman, Mathieu; Ellouze, Sami; Fontaine, Jean-Paul",Ann Emerg Med,,328

Methods: We conducted online survey on adult resident of Bali Province, Indonesia in September 14th to October 31st 2020 collecting data on demographics, impacts of the pandemic, conspiracy beliefs, trusts in conventional media and authoritative sources, as well as vaccine acceptance. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis for determinants of vaccine acceptance with SPSS 23.0. Results: We recruited 779 respondents with 38.9% male and median age of 24 years old (IQR 20 - 26). The result showed vaccine acceptance of 60.8%. Vaccine acceptance was correlated with conspiracy beliefs, trusts in conventional media and authoritative sources with Spearman's rho of -0.350, 0.269, and 0.287 respectively. Controlling for demographics and impacts of pandemic, showed strong conspiracy beliefs and trust in conventional media as the only independent determinants with OR of 0.33 (CI95% 0.20 - 0.54) and 1.91 (CI95% 1.37 - 2.65) respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated considerable impacts of infodemic, represented by conspiracy beliefs, trust in media, and in authoritative sources, toward COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.

225296,Should countries aim for elimination in the covid-19 pandemic?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate sleep and awakening quality (SQ and AQ) during COVID-19 in a large and diversified population in order to identify significant associations and risks in terms of demography, health and health-related behaviors, sleep variables, mental health, and attitudes. METHODS/RESULTS: Online surveys were used for data collection, received from 5479 individuals from the general population, sleep disorder patients, and COVID-involved (medical doctors (MDs) and nurses) and COVID-affected professionals (teachers, psychologists, and dentists). SQ and AQ were worse in adults, females, and high-education subjects. Feeling worse, having economic problems, depression, anxiety, irritability, and a high Calamity Experience Check List (CECL) score during COVID were significantly associated with poor SQ and AQ. Shorter sleep duration, increased latency, poor nutrition, low physical activity, increased mobile and social network use, more negative and less positive attitudes and behaviors were associated with poor AQ. CONCLUSIONS: The SQ logistic regression showed gender, morbidities, CECL, and awakenings as relevant, whereas, for AQ, relevant variables further included age and physical activity. Aiming to have a high stress compliance, each individual should sleep well, have important control of their mood, practice positive behaviors while dismissing negative behaviors and attitudes, practice exercise, have adequate nutrition, and beware of technologies and dependences.","Paiva, Teresa; Reis, Cátia; Feliciano, Amélia; Canas-Simião, Hugo; Machado, Maria Augusta; Gaspar, Tânia; Tomé, Gina; Branquinho, Cátia; Silva, Maria Raquel; Ramiro, Lúcia; Gaspar, Susana; Bentes, Carla; Sampaio, Francisco; Pinho, Lara; Pereira, Conceição; Carreiro, Alexandra; Moreira, Susana; Luzeiro, Isabel; Pimentel, Joana; Videira, Gabriela; Fonseca, Júlio; Bernarda, Ana; Vaz Castro, Joana; Rebocho, Sofia; Almondes, Katie; Canhão, Helena; Matos, Margarida Gaspar",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,328
225571,How to respond to the COVID-19 economic and health financing crisis? (Special Issue: COVID-19 health system response.),2020,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive single-stranded RNA viruses that cause severe respiratory syndromes in humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of 2019 became a global pandemic. The 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) processes viral polyproteins to yield mature non-structural proteins, thus playing an important role in the CoV life cycle, and therefore is considered as a prominent target for antiviral drugs. To date, many 3CLpro inhibitors have been reported, and their molecular mechanisms have been illustrated. Here, we briefly introduce the structural features of 3CLpro of the human-related SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and explore the potency and mechanism of their cognate inhibitors. This information will shed light on the development and optimization of CoV 3CLpro inhibitors, which may benefit the further designation of therapeutic strategies for treating CoV diseases.","Chen, Chun-Chi; Yu, Xuejing; Kuo, Chih-Jung; Min, Jian; Chen, Sizhuo; Ma, Lixin; Liu, Ke; Guo, Rey-Ting",FEBS j,,328

226764,The Use of Cluster Analysis to Evaluate the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Daily Water Demand Patterns,2021,"Social systems are characterized by an enormous network of connections and factors that can influence the structure and dynamics of these systems. Among them the whole economical sphere of human activity seems to be the most interrelated and complex. All financial markets, including the youngest one, the cryptocurrency market, belong to this sphere. The complexity of the cryptocurrency market can be studied from different perspectives. First, the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rates to other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies can be studied and quantified by means of multifractal formalism. Second, coupling and decoupling of the cryptocurrencies and the conventional assets can be investigated with the advanced cross-correlation analyses based on fractal analysis. Third, an internal structure of the cryptocurrency market can also be a subject of analysis that exploits, for example, a network representation of the market. In this work, we approach the subject from all three perspectives based on data from a recent time interval between January 2019 and June 2020. This period includes the peculiar time of the Covid-19 pandemic; therefore, we pay particular attention to this event and investigate how strong its impact on the structure and dynamics of the market was. Besides, the studied data covers a few other significant events like double bull and bear phases in 2019. We show that, throughout the considered interval, the exchange rate returns were multifractal with intermittent signatures of bifractality that can be associated with the most volatile periods of the market dynamics like a bull market onset in April 2019 and the Covid-19 outburst in March 2020. The topology of a minimal spanning tree representation of the market also used to alter during these events from a distributed type without any dominant node to a highly centralized type with a dominating hub of USDT. However, the MST topology during the pandemic differs in some details from other volatile periods.","Drozdz, Stanislaw; Kwapien, Jaroslaw; Oswiecimka, Pawel; Stanisz, Tomasz; Watorek, Marcin",,,328

230165,Violence Against Women During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Introduction: Evidence establishes that COVID-19 patients with DM2 are at increased risk for severe disease and worse outcomes. Peer reviewed data is sparse comparing glycemic control and clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients with vs. without DM2, and thus we sought to address this gap. Methods: We selected patients at least 18 years old who expired or were discharged between March 16, 2020 through September 15, 2020. Principal analysis compared glycemic patterns among patients with DM2 vs. non-DM2. Median, coefficient of variation (CV), maximum and minimum glucose parameters were computed to characterize longitudinal glycemic patterns. Logistic regression modeling identified significant (p&amp;lt;.05) associations between composite outcome vs. glycemic parameters and putative risks for progression to severe COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified cut points for glycemic parameters. Cox regression models were employed to control for significant confounders. Continuous data summarized as median was compared using Kruskal-Wallis test. Discrete data were compared with Pearson’s chi-square test. Two-tailed p&amp;lt;.05 was significant. Results: Among 494 patients, 157 (32%) had DM2 with no intergroup differences in age (68 [56–79]), sex (52% male, 48% female), or race (68% Caucasian, 19% Other, 13% African American). Insulin was administered to DM2 (93%) and non-DM2 (54%) patients (p&amp;lt;.0001). Comorbidities were more prevalent in DM2, including cardiovascular (68% vs. 54%, p=.003), renal (72% vs. 52%, p&amp;lt;.0001) and obesity (51% vs. 38%, p&amp;lt;.0001). Markers including D-dimer (0.98 [0.61–1.95] mg/L), lactate dehydrogenase (308 [230–392] U/L), ferritin (436 [174–856] ng/mL), and triglycerides (172 [109–239] mg/dL), were not different in DM2 vs. non-DM2 (p&amp;gt;.05). CRP was greater in patients with (8.6 [3.6–14.6]) vs. without (6.1 [2.0–12.6]) DM2 (p=.005). Baseline glucose in DM2 (163 [121–253] mg/dL) vs. non-DM2 (107 [96–124] mg/dL) was significantly greater, with former an independent predictor of composite outcome (p=.0005). Cox modeling of other glucose parameters in DM2 vs. non-DM2 demonstrated various impact regarding risk for composite outcome including median (155 [128–209], p=.46) vs. (103 [94–118], p=.09);coefficient of variation (28 [19–38], p=.08) vs. (15 [9–20], p=.002);maximum (252 [187–362], p=.0005) vs. (129 [110–156], p=.002);and minimum (99 [79–128], p=.95) vs. (89 [81–98], p=.02). The unified baseline glucose cut point for composite outcome risk controlled for significant covariates was 138 gm/dL (p&amp;lt;.0001), which included respectively 20% and 10% of patients with and without DM2. Conclusion: Glycemic dysregulation in COVID-19 patients is independently associated with ICU admission and/or hospital mortality. Presence of DM2 amplifies glycemic dysregulation, but risk stratification appears warranted in all COVID-19 patients.","Rodriguez, Lisette Patricia Farhangi Vida Braham Julaine Smith Robert A.; Wiese-Rometsch, Wilhelmine",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,328

Ces formes sévères étant significativement associées à un état d'hyperinflammation, et notamment à un niveau élevé d'interleukine-6, il a été proposé que cibler la voie de signalisation de cette interleukine majoritairement pro-inflammatoire, puisse réduire la mortalité de la COVID-19. Pour autant, un an après le début de la pandémie, la place de ces inhibiteurs, dont le Tocilizumab, un anticorps monoclonal dirigé contre le récepteur de l'interleuline-6, reste à déterminer. Cohorte exposé-non exposé en vie réelle, monocentrique et menée à l'hôpital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France, avant la mise en place de l'essai randomisé CORIMUNO-TOCI. Etaient inclus les patients de plus de 18 ans qui présentaient une forme modérée à sévère de COVID-19, selon la définition de l'OMS, et qui nécessitaient une oxygéno-requerance ≥ 4 L/min, associée à un syndrome inflammatoire biologique (CRP &gt; 50 mg/L). Etaient exclus les patients qui portaient des contre-indications au Tocilizumab (antécédent de sigmoïdite ou de diverticulite, une cytolyse hépatique supérieure à 5 N, une allergie connue au Tocilizumab, ou une infection bactérienne active.) Par ailleurs, les patients qui étaient transférés en soins intensifs dans les premières 24 h après l'injection de Tocilizumab étaient exclus de notre étude, puisque ils étaient inclus dans une étude qui évaluait le Tocilizumab en réanimation. Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab recevaient une injection de 8 mg/kg (maximum 800 mg) de Tocilizumab associée aux soins courants et les patients du groupe soins courants ne recevaient que les soins courants. Pour assurer la comparabilité des deux groupes nous avons utilisé le score de propension. Notre critère de jugement principal était le délai de sevrage en oxygène. Les critères de jugement secondaire étaient : le transfert en soins intensifs, le besoin de ventilation mécanique, le décès toutes causes confondues, le décès au dixie jour, la durée d'hospitalisation ainsi que les scores composites intubation ou décès et transfert en soins intensifs ou décès. Cinquante patients ont été inclus dans le groupe Tocilizumab et 52 patients dans le groupe soins courants. L'âge moyen était de 68,9 ± 2 ans et 71 % des patients étaient des hommes. Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab étaient plus fréquemment diabétique (34 % vs 13 % ;p = 0,02), et avaient un niveau d'oxygène moyen plus élevé (9,1 L/min vs 6,8 L/min ;p = 0,0002). Les patients du groupe Tocilizumab avaient reçu plus de corticoïdes que les patients du groupe soins courants (53 % vs 6 % ;p &lt; 0,0001). Le délai de sevrage en oxygène n'était pas diffèrent dans les deux groupes, 14,1 [IQR 7-19] jours dans le groupe Tocilizumab versus 12,2 [IQR 7,5-14] jours dans le groupe soins courants, hazard ratio ajusté à 1,53 (IC95 % (0,96-2,45) ;p = 0,073). Il n'y avait pas non plus de différence concernant les critères de jugement secondaires. Dans cet essai, nous rapportons une absence de bénéfice du Tocilizumab dans les formes modérées à sévères de la COVID-19. L'injection de Tocilizumab à la posologie de 8 mg/kg n'améliorait pas le délai de sevrage en oxygène, et ne réduisait pas la nécessité d'intubation, de transfert en soins intensifs ou la mortalité. Cette absence de différence peut être expliquée, en partie, par le fait que les patients du groupe Tocilizumab étaient plus graves (oxygéno-requerance plus élevée) et comorbides (plus fréquemment diabétiques). En revanche, ces patients avaient reçu plus de corticoides qui est aujourd'hui un traitement recommandé dans la prise en charge des patients sous oxygène, atteints de la COVID-19. Notre étude manque aussi de puissance, une récente méta-analyse estimait à 2300 patients (dans chaque bras) le nombre de sujet nécessaire pour mettre en évidence une différence significative si ce le-ci existait. Un essai randomisé récent qui incluait un nombre de sujet suffisant, en cours de publication, a montré des résultats encourageants, avec une diminution de la mortalité à 28 jours chez les patients traités par Tocilizumab (majoritairement en associations au corticoïdes). Toutefois la question du meilleur moment de l'injection de Tocilizumab chez les patients atteints de COVID-19 reste entière.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to predict medical needs (hospitalizations, ICU admission, respiratory assistance) and survivability of individuals testing SARS-CoV-2 positive using a retrospective cohort with 38.545 infected individuals in Portugal during 2020. METHODS: Predictions of medical needs are performed using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches at various stages of a patient's cycle, namely: testing time (pre-hospitalization), post-hospitalization, and post-intensive care. A thorough optimization of state-of-the-art predictors is undertaken to assess the ability to anticipate medical needs and infection outcomes using demographic and comorbidity variables, as well as onset date of symptoms, test and hospitalization. RESULTS: For the target cohort, 75% of hospitalization needs can be identified at the SARS-CoV-2 testing time and over 60% respiratory needs at hospitalization time, both with >50% precision. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted study pinpoints the relevance of the proposed predictive models as good candidates to support medical decisions for the Portuguese population, including both monitoring and in-hospital care decisions. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is further provided to this end.","Patrício, André; Costa, Rafael S; Henriques, Rui",J. med. internet res,,328

233847,Novel device for preventing diffusion of aerosol droplets from subjects undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Malaysia had 10,219 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of September 20, 2020. About 33% were associated with a Tablighi Jamaat religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 3, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysia's second wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to better understand the molecular epidemiology and spread. We obtained 58 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from patients in Kuala Lumpur and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 57 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Nine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the Tablighi mass gathering and became predominant (65.2%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) globally. Direct epidemiological links between lineage B.6 viruses and the mass gathering were identified. Increases in reported total cases, Tablighi-associated cases, and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly travel-associated and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. Over 95% of global B.6 sequences originated from Asia Pacific. We also report a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 47.3% of global B.6 sequences which was associated with reduced sensitivity using a commercial diagnostic real-time PCR assay. Lineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering.

234126,Reflections on COVID-19 and the ethical issues for healthcare providers,2020,"The clinical condition COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Currently, there are more than 5 million cases worldwide, and the pandemic has increased exponentially in many countries, with different incidences and death rates among regions/ethnicities and, intriguingly, between sexes. In addition to the many factors that can influence these discrepancies, we suggest a biological aspect, the genetic variation at the viral S protein receptor in human cells, ACE2 (angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2), which may contribute to the worse clinical outcome in males and in some regions worldwide. We performed exomics analysis in native and admixed South American populations, and we also conducted in silico genomics databank investigations in populations from other continents. Interestingly, at least ten polymorphisms in coding, noncoding and regulatory sites were found that can shed light on this issue and offer a plausible biological explanation for these epidemiological differences. In conclusion, there are ACE2 polymorphisms that could influence epidemiological discrepancies observed among ancestry and, moreover, between sexes.","Khayat, André Salim; de Assumpção, Paulo Pimentel; Meireles Khayat, Bruna Claudia; Thomaz Araújo, Taíssa Maíra; Batista-Gomes, Jéssica Almeida; Imbiriba, Luciana Carvalho; Ishak, Geraldo; de Assumpção, Paula Baraúna; Moreira, Fabiano Cordeiro; Burbano, Rommel Rodriguez; Ribeiro-Dos-Santos, André; Ribeiro-Dos-Santos, Ândrea Kelly; Dos Santos, Ney Pereira Carneiro; Dos Santos, Sidney Emmanuel Batista",PLoS One,,328

cellules humaines par le biais de ses glycoprotéines S à l&#039;enzyme de conversion de l&#039;angiotensine 2 (de l&#039;anglais ACE 2) [Letko et al , 2020;Zhou et al , 2020] Cette enzyme se trouve notamment à la surface des cellules épithéliales qui tapissent le tractus respiratoire, le tube digestif, les reins et le cÅur [Zou et al , 2020;Li et al , 2003] Une fois à l&#039;intérieur de la cellule, toute la machinerie cellulaire et le matériel protéique et génomique sont détournés en faveur de la production de protéines virales puis de la réplication de l&#039;ARN qui sont nécessaires à la fabrication de nouvelles copies du virus [Fehr et Perlman, 2015] Une multiplication virale importante provoque généralement une mort des cellules infectées Les dommages entraînent une mobilisation des cellules immunitaires locales et une production de chimiokines et de cytokines proinflammatoires qui permettent à leur tour le recrutement massif d&#039;autres cellules pour contenir l&#039;infection La maladie se manifeste le plus souvent par une toux sèche et de la fièvre, des symptômes pouvant s&#039;apparenter à ceux d&#039;un rhume ou d&#039;une grippe;certains patients développent une dyspnée L&#039;expérience clinique montre qu&#039;elle peut être accompagnée d&#039;une lymphopénie, qui semble directement influencer le pronostic [Liu et al , 2020;Tan et al , 2020;Zheng et al , 2020] Une pneumonie interstitielle, caractérisée par des opacités en verre dépoli généralement périphériques et bilatérales à l&#039;imagerie pulmonaire [Yang et al , 2020] survient dans les formes plus sévères de la maladie Les données actuellement disponibles indiq ent que les formes sévères et critiques de COVID-19 pourraient être causées par la survenue d&#039;un syndrome de libération de cytokines pro-inflammatoires (cytokine release syndrome, CRS) [Liu et al , 2020;Thompson et al , 2017] Sur le plan biologique, celui-ci se traduit notamment par ratio neutrophile-lymphocyte sanguin plus élevé et une expression accrue des cytokines pro-inflammatoires [Qin et al , 2020] Ce syndrome est une réponse aberrante du système immunitaire;il a été mis en évidence dans diverses pathologies infectieuses, dont certaines infections respiratoires humaines causées par des coronavirus [Channappanavar et Perlman, 2017] Ce phénomène d&#039;inflammation massive entraine une augmentation importante de la perméabilité vasculaire;l&#039;entrée de fluides et de cellules sanguines dans les alvéoles mène à l&#039;aggravation de la dyspnée Les dommages alvéolaires alors provoqués peuvent précipiter un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë (SDRA);l&#039;auto-entretien de cette cascade inflammatoire peut mener à un choc cytokinique et à un syndrome de défaillance multiviscérale (SDMV) conduisant au décès DISCUSSION: Malgré des données issues d&#039;études conduites in vitro et in vivo indiquant que la chloroquine et l&#039;hydroxychloroquine pourraient exercer une action antivirale contre le coronavirus SARS-CoV et le SARS-CoV-2 et influencer les mécanismes régulateurs de &#039;inflammation, l&#039;état actuel des connaissances ne permet pas d&#039;associer ou d&#039;exclure ces phénomènes chez l&#039;humain, aux posologies utilisées, dans le contexte de la COVID-19 Depuis le début de la pandémie quelques études cliniques ont été

To explore this association a cohort study was undertaken. Methods: We assembled a cohort of 505,992 patients receiving ambulatory care at Bronx Montefiore Health System (BMHS) between 1/1/18 and 1/1/20 to evaluate the relative risk of hospitalization and death in two time-periods, the pre-COVID time-period (1/1/20-2/15/20) and COVID time-period (3/1/20-4/15/20). COVID testing, hospitalization and mortality were determined with the Black and Hispanic patient population compared separately to the White population using logistic modeling. Evaluation of the interaction of pre-COVID and COVID time periods and race, with respect to mortality was completed. Findings: A total of 9,286/505,992 (1.8%) patients were hospitalized during either or both pre-COVID or COVID periods. Compared to Whites the relative risk of hospitalization of Black patients did not increase in the COVID period (p for interaction=0.12). In the pre- COVID period, compared to Whites, the odds of death for Blacks and Hispanics adjusted for comorbidity was statistically equivalent. In the COVID period compared to Whites the adjusted odds of death for Blacks was 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.0, p = 0.001). There was a significant increase in Black mortality risk from pre-COVID to COVID periods (p for interaction=0.02). Adjustment for relevant clinical and social indices attenuated but did not fully explain the observed difference in Black mortality. Interpretation: The BMHS COVID experience demonstrates that Blacks do have a higher mortality with COVID incompletely explained by age, multiple reported comorbidities and available metrics of sociodemographic disparity.

(Special Issue: Digital health in times of COVID-19.),2020,"What is already known about this topic? The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in China had been effectively controlled for several months, but as the ambient temperature dropped, large gathering-initiated epidemics occurred in northern China, including Hebei, Liaoning, and Jilin provinces. What is added by this report? A sudden epidemic emerged in Wangkui County, Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province, on January 9, 2021. An asymptomatically-infected resident of Harbin City returned from Suihua and triggered a large-scale outbreak in the Zhengda Food Processing Company in Harbin, Heilongjiang. The epidemic was associated with widespread community transmission inside and outside the company, eventually leading to 260 persons being infected (87.8% of 296 patients in Harbin). What are the implications for public health practice? This study demonstrates the importance of screening for infections in the COVID-19 prevention and control system, shares experiences identifying and managing asymptomatic infections, and recommends food processing enterprises like the Zhengda Company to improve preventative measures. Our evidence-based epidemiological analyses provide methods for finding high-risk settings and evaluating epidemic situations when many asymptomatic patients are identified in a short period of time.","Hou, L.; Zhou, H.; Meng, N.

CCR5 resides at the same locus and, given its known biological role in other infection diseases, we investigated if common noncoding and rare coding variants, affecting CCR5, can predispose to severe COVID-19. We combined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that met the suggestive significance level (P &#8804; 1 × 10-5) at the 3p21.31 locus in public GWAS datasets (6406 COVID-19 hospitalized patients and 902,088 controls) with gene expression data from 208 lung tissues, Hi-C, and Chip-seq data. Through whole exome sequencing (WES), we explored rare coding variants in 147 severe COVID-19 patients. We identified three SNPs (rs9845542, rs12639314, and rs35951367) associated with severe COVID-19 whose risk alleles correlated with low CCR5 expression in lung tissues. The rs35951367 resided in a CTFC binding site that interacts with CCR5 gene in lung tissues and was confirmed to be associated with severe COVID-19 in two independent datasets. We also identified a rare coding variant (rs34418657) associated with the risk of developing severe COVID-19. Our results suggest a biological role of CCR5 in the progression of COVID-19 as common and rare genetic variants can increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 by affecting the functions of CCR5.","Cantalupo, Sueva; Lasorsa, Vito Alessandro; Russo, Roberta; Andolfo, Immacolata; D039,; Alterio, Giuseppe; Rosato, Barbara Eleni; Frisso, Giulia; Abete, Pasquale; Cassese, Gian Marco; Servillo, Giuseppe; Gentile, Ivan; Piscopo, Carmelo; Della Monica, Matteo; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Russo, Giuseppe; Cerino, Pellegrino; Buonerba, Carlo; Pierri, Biancamaria; Zollo, Massimo; Iolascon, Achille; Capasso, Mario",Int. j. mol. sci.

In this paper, the SEIR model is used to fit the number of confirmed cases in each province in China, and the reduction rate of the basic reproduction number is used to measure the actual score of the control effect of COVID-19. The potential capacity of prevention and control of epidemics, in theory, is constructed, and we use the difference between theoretical ability and actual score to measure the ability of governance of public health. We found that there were significant differences between actual effect and theoretical ability in various regions, and governance capabilities were an important reason leading to this difference, which was not consistent with the level of economic development. The balance of multiple objectives, the guiding ideology of emphasizing medical treatment over prevention, the fragmentation of the public health system, and the insufficiency of prevention and control ability in primary public health systems seriously affected the government's ability to respond to public health emergencies.","Fang, Y.; Zhang, F.; Zhou, C.; Chen, M.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,328

This study reports how COVID-19 has spread in South Korea and examines the effects of rapid widespread diagnostic testing on the spread of the disease in the early epidemic phase. METHODS: We collected daily data on the number of confirmed cases, tests and deaths due to COVID-19 from 20 January to 13 April 2020. We estimated the spread pattern with a logistic growth model, calculated the daily reproduction number (Rt) and examined the fatality pattern of COVID-19. RESULTS: From the start date of the epidemic in Korea (18 February 2020), the time to peak and plateau were 15.2 and 25 days, respectively. The initial Rt was 3.9 [95% credible interval (CI) 3.7 to 4.2] and declined to <1 after 2 weeks. The initial epidemic doubling time was 3.8 days (3.4 to 4.2 days). The aggressive testing in the early days of the epidemic was associated with reduction in transmission speed of COVID-19. In addition, as of 13 April, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in Korea was 2.1%, suggesting a positive effect of the targeted treatment policy for severe patients and medical resources.

The first step in designing interventions to mitigate the impacts of adhering to COVID-19-related instructions is to identify what are the most prevalent challenges and what characterises the people facing them. A cross-sectional survey was administered to a representative sample of the UK population (N = 2252), of whom n = 2139 (94.9%) reported adhering to the UK government's COVID-19-related instructions, and were included in the final analysis. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Of the people who reported adhering to UK government's COVID-19-related instructions, 80.3% reported experiencing challenges. Adults aged 55 years or over (OR = 1.939, 95%CI 1.331-2.825) and men (OR = 0.489, 95%CI 0.393-0.608) were least likely to report challenges. Adjusting to changes in daily routine (reported by 48.7% of the sample), mental health (reported by 41.4% of the sample) and physical health (reported by 31.5% of the sample) were the most prevalent challenges. For the first time, the present study quantifies the extent to which people experienced challenges when adhering to government COVID-19-related instructions. Few people reported experiencing no challenges when adhering to COVID-19-related instructions. Interventions to address the effects of changes in daily routine, mental health challenges, and physical health challenges should be prioritised, with a focus on key subgroups including women, younger adults, and people without care commitments.","Keyworth, Chris; Epton, Tracy; Byrne-Davis, Lucie; Leather, Jessica Z; Armitage, Christopher J",Prev Med,,328

245248,A commentary on COVID-19 and the LGBT community in Nigeria: Risks and resilience,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Immune dysfunction, including severe combined immunodeficiency, has been described in genetic disorders affecting the metabolism of the vitamins cobalamin (vitamin B12) and folate. We have reviewed reports of clinical findings in patients with a number of inborn errors of cobalamin or folate metabolism, specifically looking for immune problems. RECENT FINDINGS: There is little evidence that immune function is affected in most of the disorders. Exceptions are Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome and hereditary folate malabsorption (affecting intestinal absorption of cobalamin and folate, respectively), transcobalamin deficiency (affecting transport of cobalamin in blood and cellular cobalamin uptake), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 deficiency (catalyzing cytoplasmic interconversion of reduced folate coenzyme derivatives). SUMMARY: Although some inborn errors of cobalamin or folate can be associated with immune dysfunction, the degree and type of immune dysfunction vary with no obvious pattern.","Watkins, David; Rosenblatt, David S",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,,328

245467,"Social Listening in Eastern and Southern Africa, a UNICEF Risk Communication and Community Engagement Strategy to Address the COVID-19 Infodemic",2021,"Background The often-precarious life circumstances of undocumented migrants are likely to heighten the detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. Given the paucity of research exploring how undocumented migrants are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we set out to explore the association between being an undocumented migrant and a range of social and mental health measures. Methods Our study draws on three complementary surveys conducted among migrants in France between April 1st and June 7th 2020 (APART TOGETHER, MAKASI, ECHO; n = 716). We tested associations between eight outcome measures, covering health literacy, prevention behaviours, perceptions of government responses, livelihoods and mental health (PHQ-9 score), and the participants' legal status as either undocumented or documented. We modelled the probability of food insecurity increase, job loss, depression, and responses to SARS-COV-2 symptoms with logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender and legal status. Results Undocumented migrants had a higher probability of experiencing food insecurity increase (aORs=10.40 [3.59, 30.16], and 2.19 [1.39, 3.50] in APART TOGETHER and ECHO), a higher probability of depression (aOR=2.65 [1.01, 6.97] in MAKASI). In all three surveys, undocumented migrants were more likely to lose their job (aORs=6.51 [1.18, 36.00], 8.36 [1.08, 64.70] and 3.96 [1.79, 9.16] in APART TOGETHER, MAKASI and ECHO respectively). Conclusion Our results suggest that the lives of undocumented migrants have been dramatically worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, exposing and amplifying the inequalities facing this group. There is an urgent need for action to address these inequalities.","Gosselin, Anne; Longchamps, Cecile; Oulahal, Rachid; Derluyn, Ilse; Ducarroz, Simon; Skovdal, Morten; Verelst, An; Sturm, Gesine; Lou, Annabel Desgrees du; Melchior, Maria",,,328

248342,Impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the provision of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies,2020,"In this work, the structural, electronic, topological and vibrational properties of potential antiviral to treatment of COVID-19, niclosamide (NCL) have been studied in different media together with its reactivities by combination of DFT calculations with molecular docking. Properties of two most stable conformers of niclosamide (C1 and C2) were reported in gas phase and water, ethanol and chloroform solvents. Calculations using the integral equation formalism variant polarised continuum (IEFPCM) and solvation methods in the different solutions have revealed solvation energy values for C1 and C2 in aqueous solution (GC=-78.43 and-64.53 kJ/mol, respectively) comparable with that observed for the antiviral agent zalcitabine (-78.92 kJ/mol). Probably, the high stability of C1, predicted by NBO studies, explains the experimental existence of C1 in the solid phase. Comparisons of frontier orbitals with eleven antiviral agents have evidenced the high reactivity of C2 slightly higher than brincidofovir, an antiviral agent used in the treatment to ebola disease. Possibly, the presence of deactivating groups (NO2and Cl) in the chloro-4-nitrophenyl and hydroxybenzamide rings of both forms of NCL could explain the higher reactivities predicted in the different media. Here, the harmonic force fields and force constants for both forms are reported together with the assignments of 80 vibration modes expected in the experimental infrared spectrum of NCL. The predicted UV-Vis spectra in the different solvents suggest the presence of both forms of NCL in solution. Molecular docking results were discussed basing on the type of interaction between the ligands and several amino acid residues.","Romani, Davide; Noureddine, Olfa; Issaoui, Noureddine; Brandán, Silvia Antonia",Biointerface Res.

248506,Managing health systems on a seesaw: balancing the delivery of essential health services whilst responding to COVID-19,2020,"Approximately 60% of the UK’s leisure horses are kept at livery yards under the management and oversight of a livery yard owner or manager (LYO/M), yet their role has received little research attention. This study used the COVID-19 pandemic as a lens through which to view LYO/Ms’ decisions around equine care and management at a time when changes to usual practice were necessary. Qualitative research methods were used. Up to 3 interviews were conducted with 24 different LYO/Ms over nine months (n = 48). Discussion threads from open-access UK discussion fora were also analysed. All data were anonymised and analysed using a Grounded Theory meth-odology. Prior to the pandemic, equine care and management practices varied greatly across yards, and yard cultures were a product of LYO/Ms’ construction of good equine care, their business model, and the need to balance human and equine contentment. The role of the LYO/M was to maintain an equilibrium between those interlinked factors. During the pandemic, LYO/Ms adopted new measures designed to influence the movement of horse owners and other people on yards to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. During this time, LYO/Ms reported prioritising equine wellbeing by limiting change to equine routines and management wherever possible. Instead of altering equine management, there was an expectation that the lives of humans would be moulded and re-shaped to fit with the government COVID-19 guidelines. These results highlight the importance of routines, traditions and cultures in each individual yard. Maintaining the standard of care for the horse was prioritised regardless of who provided that care.","Furtado, T.; Perkins, E.; McGowan, C.; Pinchbeck, G.",Animals,,328
248960,"Social, Cognitive, and Emotional Predictors of Adherence to Physical Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020,"As coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases continue to increase in Africa, healthcare workers (HCWs) have a high risk of being infected and the risks may be higher among those who work closely with patients. The risks of HCW infections can be mitigated with adequate precautions within healthcare facilities, especially with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). We highlight and contextualise the findings of a Cochrane review on the type of PPE that protects best, the best way to put PPE on (donning) or to remove PPE (doffing) and how to train HCWs to use PPE. The review found low-certainty of evidence that full body PPE offer more protection, but HCWs may be faced with difficulty during donning and doffing. Following standard guidelines may be helpful in reducing infection and increasing compliance among HCWs. Video training and simulations may be better methods for training on the correct use of PPE than traditional methods of teaching. Countries must, therefore, ensure that HCWs undergo compulsory training on the correct use of PPE; regardless of their professional category. Of the 24 studies included in this review, none was conducted on the African continent. There is thus an urgent need for well conducted studies on the experiences of HCWs using full-body covering PPE within the African context. Such studies could lead to tailored interventions that will improve the proper use of PPE among HCWs.","Iwu, Chinwe Juliana; Jordan, Portia; Jaca, Anelisa; Iwu, Chidozie Declan; Schutte, Lorraine; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,,328
249595,The effect of the lockdown executive order during the COVID-19 pandemic in recent trauma admissions in Puerto Rico,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) are widely used in off-label treatment of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, cardiac safety of these drugs is still controversial in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate association of HCQ or HCQ+AZM treatment regimens, corrected QT (QTc) interval and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, and observational study. All data were extracted from the electronic medical records. The initial and post-treatment mean QTc intervals were calculated and compared in patients with HCQ alone or HCQ+AZM therapy. Associated factors with QTc prolongation, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia during treatment and in-hospital mortality due to ventricular arrhythmias were evaluated. RESULTS: Our cohort comprised 101 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (mean age of 49.60±18 years, 54.4% men). HCQ+AZM combination therapy group (n=56) was more likely to have comorbidities. After 5-days treatment, 19 (18.8%) patients had QTc prolongation, and significant increase in the QTc interval was observed in both two groups (p<0.001). However, HCQ+AZM combination group had significantly higher &#916;QTc compared to HCQ group (22.5±18.4 vs. 7.5±15.3 ms, p<0.001). All of 101 patients completed the 5-days treatment without interruption. Also, no malignant ventricular arrhythmia or death secondary to ventricular arrhythmia occurred during the treatment in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that although HCQ+AZM treatment was independently associated with QTc prolongation, none of patients experienced malignant ventricular arrhythmia or death during treatment. Further prospective studies are needed to determine the exact implications of these drugs on arrhythmias in patients with COVID-19.","Özdemir, Ibrahim Halil; Özlek, Bülent; Özen, Mehmet Burak; Gündüz, Ramazan; Çetin, Nurullah; Bilge, Ali Riza",Int J Clin Pract,,328
249797,[The use of telepsychiatry in psychiatric disability committees during the COVID-19 pandemic],2020,"INTRODUCTION: We describe a new service model, the Orthopaedic Assessment Unit (OAU), designed to provide care for trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients without COVID-19 symptoms and isolated musculoskeletal injuries were redirected to the OAU. METHODS: We prospectively reviewed patients throughput during the peak of the global pandemic (7 May 2020 to 7 June 2020) and compared with our historic service provision (7 May 2019 to 7 June 2019). The Mann-Whitney and Fisher Exact tests were used to test the statistical significance of data. RESULTS: A total of 1,147 patients were seen, with peak attendances between 11am and 2pm; 96% of all referrals were seen within 4h. The majority of patients were seen by orthopaedic registrars (52%) and nurse practitioners (44%). The majority of patients suffered from sprains and strains (39%), followed by fractures (22%) and wounds (20%); 73% of patients were discharged on the same day, 15% given follow up, 8% underwent surgery and 3% were admitted but did not undergo surgery. Our volume of trauma admissions and theatre cases decreased by 22% and 17%, respectively (p=0.058; 0.139). There was a significant reduction of virtual fracture clinic referrals after reconfiguration of services (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid implementation of a specialist OAU during a pandemic can provide early definitive trauma care while exceeding national waiting time standards. The fall in trauma attendances was lower than anticipated. The retention of orthopaedic staff in the department to staff the unit and maintain a high standard of care is imperative.","Lim, J W; Rehman, H; Gaba, S; Sargeant, H; Stevenson, I M; Boddie, D E",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,328

250479,Students' Experiences With Racism During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"WATERLIT Abstract: Effective identification and prognostication of severe COVID-19 patients presenting to healthcare facilities are essential to reducing morbidity and mortality. Low- and middle-income country (LMIC) facilities often suffer from restrictions in availability of human resources, laboratory testing, medications, and imaging during routine functioning, and such shortages may worsen during times of surge. Low- and middle-income country healthcare providers will need contextually appropriate tools to identify and triage potential COVID-19 patients. We report on a series of LMIC-appropriate recommendations and suggestions for screening and triage of COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on a pragmatic, experience-based appraisal of existing literature. We recommend that all patients be screened upon first contact with the healthcare system using a locally approved questionnaire to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. We suggest that primary screening tools used to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 include a broad range of signs and symptoms based on standard case definitions of COVID-19 disease. We recommend that screening include endemic febrile illness per routine protocols upon presentation to a healthcare facility. We recommend that, following screening and implementation of appropriate universal source control measures, suspected COVID-19 patients be triaged with a triage tool appropriate for the setting. We recommend a standardized severity score based on the WHO COVID-19 disease definitions be assigned to all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients before their disposition from the emergency unit. We suggest against using diagnostic imaging to improve triage of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR–confirmed COVID-19 patients, unless a patient has worsening respiratory status. We suggest against the use of point-of-care lung ultrasound to improve triage of RT-PCR–confirmed COVID-19 patients. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients who are RT-PCR negative but have moderate to severe symptoms and are suspected of a false-negative RT-PCR with high risk of disease progression. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe clinical features who are without access to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2","Himer, S.; Barros, L.

251720,Protecting Our Own: Equity for Employees as Hospitals Battle COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in children is usually mild but some are susceptible to a Kawasaki disease (KD)-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in the convalescent stage, posing a need to differentiate the phenotype, susceptibility, autoimmunity, and immunotherapy between KD and MIS-C, particularly in the upcoming mass vaccination of COVID-19. Patients with MIS-C are prone to gastrointestinal symptoms, coagulopathy, and shock in addition to atypical KD syndrome with fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and/or cardiovascular events. MIS-C manifests KD-like symptoms that alert physicians to early recognize and adopt the KD treatment regimen for patients with MIS-C. MIS-C linked to COVID-19 teaches us infection-associated autoimmune vasculitis and vice versa. Studies on genetic susceptibility have identified certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and toll-like receptor (TLR) associated with KD and/or COVID-19. Certain HLA subtypes, such as HLA-DRB1 and HLA-MICA A4 are associated with KD. HLA-B*46:01 is proposed to be the risk allele of severe COVID-19 infection, and blood group O type is a protective factor of COVID-19. The autoimmune vasculitis of KD, KD shock syndrome (KDSS), or MIS-C is mediated by a genetic variant of HLA, FcÎ³R, and/or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) resulting in hyperinflammation with T helper 17 (Th17)/Treg imbalance with augmented Th17/Th1 mediators: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Interferon (IFNÎ³), and IL-17A, and lower expression of Treg-signaling molecules, FoxP3, and transforming growth factor (TGF-ß). There are certain similarities and differences in phenotypes, susceptibility, and pathogenesis of KD, KDSS, and MIS-C, by which a physician can make early protection, prevention, and precision treatment of the diseases. The evolution of immunotherapies for the diseases has shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone or combined with corticosteroids is the standard treatment for KD, KDSS, and MIS-C. However, a certain portion of patients who revealed a treatment resistance to IVIG or IVIG plus corticosteroids, posing a need to early identify the immunopathogenesis, to protect hosts with genetic susceptibility, and to combat Th17/Treg imbalance by anti-cytokine or pro-Treg for reversal of the hyperinflammation and IVIG resistance. Based on physiological and pathological immunity of the diseases under genetic susceptibility and host milieu conditions, a series of sequential regimens are provided to develop a so-called ""Know thyself, enemy (pathogen), and ever-victorious"" strategy for the prevention and immunotherapy of KD and/or MIS-C.","Chen, Men-Ren; Kuo, Ho-Chang; Lee, Yann-Jinn; Chi, Hsin; Li, Sung Chou; Lee, Hung-Chang; Yang, Kuender D",Front Immunol,,328

Recently, associations between SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia and disease severity and mortality have been reported in adults, while no reports are available in pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality, severity, clinical, and laboratory findings of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood in 96 pediatric patients with confirmed COVID-19. Among all patients, 6 (6%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Out of the six patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia, four (67%) had a severe form of the disease, and two out of the 6 patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia passed away (33%). Our results show that the symptoms more commonly found in the cases of COVID-19 in the study (fever, cough, tachypnea, and vomiting), were found at a higher percentage in the patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia. Creatine phosphokinase and magnesium tests showed significant differences between the positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia groups. Among all laboratory tests, magnesium and creatine phosphokinase could better predict SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia with area under the curve levels of 0.808 and 0.748, respectively. In conclusion, 67% of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia showed a severe COVID-19 and one-third of the patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia passed away. Our findings suggest that magnesium and creatine phosphokinase might be considered as markers to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia.","Pourakbari, Babak; Mahmoudi, Shima; Mahmoudieh, Yasmine; Eshaghi, Hamid; Navaeian, Amene; Rostamyan, Maryam; Mamishi, Setareh",J. med. virol,,328

253134,Does Religion Influence the Motivations of Future Healthcare Professionals to Volunteer During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland? An Exploratory Study,2021,"In times of public health emergencies, health agencies need to engage and communicate with the public in real-time to share updates and accurate information. This is especially the case for the COVID-19 pandemic where public engagement can potentially save lives and flatten the curve. This paper considers how the use of interactive features and strategic network positions of health agencies on social media influenced their public engagement outcomes. Specifically, we analyzed 203 U.S. public health agencies' Twitter activity and the public engagement they received by extracting data from a large-scale Twitter dataset collected from January 21st to May 31st, 2020. Results show that health agencies' network position in addition to their two-way communication strategy greatly influenced the level of public engagement with their COVID-19 related content on Twitter. Findings highlight the benefits of strategic social media communication of public health agencies resides not only in how agencies use social media but also in their formation of network position to amplify their visibility. As official sources of health and risk information, public health agencies should coordinate their social media communication efforts to strategically position themselves in advantageous network positions to augment public engagement outcomes.","Kim, Hye Min; Saffer, Adam J; Liu, Wenlin; Sun, Jingyi; Li, Yiqi; Zhen, Lichen; Yang, Aimei",Health Commun,,328

Lebanon, a small country of 10 452 km2 bordering the eastern Mediterranean, ratified the IHR in 2007 after the devasting effects of a sudden military conflict in 2006 that severely impacted the recovering health system. Moreover, the Lebanese health system infrastructure was only just recovering from 15 years of civil war that ended in 1990. Since 2005, the country has also faced a complex refugee crisis potentiating the risk of disease outbreaks since 2011, in addition to a severe financial crisis that has degenerated into social unrest since October 2019, and more recently the COVID-19 pandemic since February 2020.","Rady, Alissar; Shankiti, Iman; Brennan, Richard; Mandil, Ahmed",East Mediterr Health J,,328

Here we provide empirical evidence of the impact of a lockdown policy on satellite-measured agricultural land greenness in Badung, a highly populated regency of Bali, Indonesia. Using machine learning and satellite data, we estimate what the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) of cropland would have been without a lockdown. Based on on this counterfactual, we estimate a significant increase in the EVI over agricultural land after the beginning of the lockdown period. The finding is robust to a placebo test. Based on evidence from official reports and international press outlets, we suggest that the observed increase in EVI might be caused by labour reallocation to agriculture from the tourism sector, hardly hit by the lockdown measures. Our results show that machine learning and satellite data can be effectively combined to estimate the effects of exogenous events on land productivity.","Hammad, A. T.; Falchetta, G.; Wirawan, I. B.

The deleterious effects of stress on both pregnant women and their infants are well documented, with research suggesting that effects are exacerbated by reduced social support. In this brief report, we summarize evidence linking stress and social isolation to negative outcomes for mothers and infants and present a conceptual model featuring inflammation as a driving mechanism. There is strong evidence that the coronavirus pandemic will affect mothers and infants through immune pathways that, in previous research, have been shown to link stress and social isolation during the pre- and post-natal periods with deficits in maternal mental health and infant well-being and development across developmental stages. We close with recommendations for novel research, policy changes, and integrated clinical care that can address these biological threats to infants and mothers while leveraging the anti-inflammatory effects of social support.","Venta, Amanda; Bick, Johanna; Bechelli, Jeremy",Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,,328
254282,"National identification, a social cure for COVID-19? Evidence from 67 countries",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Intergenerational support between aging parents and adult children is important to the well-being of both groups, especially during public health emergencies. However, few previous studies have examined the effects of daily support between parents and children on their well-being during public health emergencies. To fill in this gap, we examined the association between daily support and well-being in mothers and their adult children during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Seventy-seven pairs of mothers (aged 44-80 years, M = 53.78, SD = 9.57) and adult children (aged 18-54 years, M = 26.61, SD = 9.46; 19% male) in mainland China participated in a 14-day daily diary study during a 14-day stay-at-home period. All of the participants reported the daily emotional and instrumental support they had given to and received from their mother/child each day for 14 consecutive days. Their daily positive affect and negative affect were also measured. RESULTS: Receiving more support on a given day was associated with providing more support on that day, suggesting a daily reciprocity. This finding was consistent across mothers and children. A lower level of being under-benefitted on a day was associated with better daily well-being of children, but not that of mothers. Providing support, but not receiving support, was positively associated with mothers' daily well-being, whereas receiving support, but not providing support, was positively associated with children's daily well-being. DISCUSSION: This study provides evidence of daily intergenerational support during a global public health emergency. The findings shed light on the importance of daily reciprocity and its implications for well-being.","Jiang, Da; Fung, Helene H",,,328
254498,Factors Affecting Green Entrepreneurship Intentions in Business University Students in COVID-19 Pandemic Times: Case of Ecuador,2021,"Obesity is a risk factor for disease severity in individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, the increased susceptibility of this population to COVID-19 is unclear. We outline several underlying mechanisms that may explain the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity. Obesity has an adverse effect on respiratory physiology because increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue can interfere with lung expansion, resulting in reduced lung compliance. Further, fat accumulation in the soft tissue of the pharynx can increase inspiratory resistance, and obesity may be associated with sleep apnea. Obesity is associated with several defects in cell-mediated immunity, including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Impaired adipocyte-mediated immune function results in chronically high leptin levels, low adiponectin levels, and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Reduced physical activity can impair several steps of the immune response to viruses. Obesity also promotes a hypercoagulable state, leading to severe consequences. These factors may synergistically play a role in promoting the severity of the disease in obese individuals. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which obesity contributes to the severity of COVID-19 is important for developing more effective treatments.","Kimura, Takefumi; Namkoong, Ho",Int J Infect Dis,,328

We aimed to compare clinical features of 165 Italian patients with laboratory confirmed or unconfirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: On March 31, 2020, hospitalized patients who presented with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, exposures, and presence of lung imaging features consistent with 2019-nCoV pneumonia were included. Before admission to a hospital ward, patients underwent RT-PCR based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in their nasopharyngeal swab samples. RESULTS: Of 165 patients studied, 119 had positive RT-PCR results and 46 were RT-PCR negative for 2 days or longer (i.e., when the last swab sample was obtained). The median age was 70 years (IQR, 58-78), and 123 (74.6%) of 165 patients had at least one comorbidity. The majority of patients (101/165, 61.2%) had a mild pneumonia, and the remaining patients (64/165, 38.8%) a severe/critical pneumonia. We did not find any substantial difference in symptoms, incubation periods, and radiographic/CT abnormalities as well as in many of the biological abnormalities recorded. However, at multivariable analysis, higher concentrations of hemoglobin (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.65; P = 0.003) and lower counts of leukocytes (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.90; P < 0.001) were statistically associated with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. While mortality rates were similar, patients with confirmed diagnosis were more likely to receive antivirals (95% vs 19.6%, P < 0.001) and to develop ARDS (63% vs 37%, P = 0.003) than those with unconfirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that unconfirmed 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases may be actually COVID-19 cases and that clinicians should be cautious when managing patients with presentations compatible with COVID-19.","De Angelis, Giulia; Posteraro, Brunella; Biscetti, Federico; Ianiro, Gianluca; Zileri Dal Verme, Lorenzo; Cattani, Paola; Franceschi, Francesco; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Gasbarrini, Antonio",BMC Infect Dis,,328
254896,"Looking out for myself: Exploring the relationship between conspiracy mentality, perceived personal risk, and COVID-19 prevention measures",2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel infectious disease of multi-system involvement with significant pulmonary manifestations. So far, many prognostic models have been introduced to guide treatment and resource management. However, data on the impact of measurable respiratory parameters associated with the disease are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the role of Comorbidity-Age-Lymphocyte count-Lactate dehydrogenase (CALL) score and to introduce Respiratory Assessment Scoring (RAS) model in predicting disease progression and mortality in COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Data of 252 confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected at Pak Emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) from 10th April 2020 to 31st August 2020. The CALL score and proposed factors of RAS model, namely respiratory rate, oxygen saturation at rest, alveolar arterial gradient and minimal exercise desaturation test, were calculated on the day of admission. Progression of disease was defined and correlated with measured variables. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis for each variable, its hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated, and a nomogram was made using the high-risk respiratory parameters to establish the RAS model. RESULTS: Progression of disease and death was observed in 124 (49.2%) and 49 (19.4%) patients, respectively. Presence of more than 50% of chest infiltrates was significantly associated with worsening disease and death (p-value <0.001). Death was observed in 100% of patients who had critical disease category on presentation. Regression analysis showed that the presence of comorbidity (n: 180), in contrast to other variables of CALL score, was not a good prognosticator of disease severity (p-value: 0.565). Nonetheless, the CALL model itself was validated to be a reliable prognostic indicator of disease progression and mortality. Some 10 feet oxygen desaturation test (HR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.95-1.04, p--value: 0.706) was not a powerful predictor of the progression of disease. However, respiratory rate of more than 30 breaths/minute (b/m) (HR: 3.03, 95%CI: 1.77-5.19), resting oxygen saturation of less than 90% (HR: 2.41, 95%CI: 1.15-5.06), and an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (HR: 2.14, 95%CI: 1.04-4.39) were considered statistically significant high-risk predictors of disease progression and death, in the formed RAS model. The model resulted in 85% (95%CI: 80%-89%) of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), with substantial positive (76%, 95%CI: 68%-83%) and negative predictive values (80%, 95%CI: 73%-87%) for a cutoff value of seven. Patients with higher CALL and RAS scores also resulted in higher mortality. CONCLUSION: CALL and RAS scores were strongly associated with progression and mortality in patients with COVID-19.","Kamran, Sultan M; Mirza, Zill-E-Humayun; Moeed, Hussain Abdul; Naseem, Arshad; Hussain, Maryam; Fazal, Imran; Saeed, Farrukh; Alamgir, Wasim; Saleem, Salman; Riaz, Sidra",Cureus,,328

255171,Through the lens of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated the global need for remotely delivered and scalable interventions after psychological trauma. A brief intervention involving a computer game as an imagery-competing task has shown promising results for reducing the number of intrusive memories of trauma-one of the core clinical symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. To date, the intervention has only been delivered face-to-face. To be tested and implemented on a wider scale, digital adaptation for remote delivery is crucial. An important first step is to develop digitalized intervention materials in a systematic way based on feedback from clinicians, researchers, and students in preparation for pilot testing with target users. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of this study is to obtain and analyze qualitative feedback on digital intervention materials, namely two animated videos and two quizzes that explain the target clinical symptoms and provide intervention instructions. The second aim is to refine the digitalized materials based on this feedback. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 12 participants who had delivered or had knowledge of the intervention when delivered face-to-face. We obtained in-depth feedback on the perceived feasibility of using the digitalized materials and suggestions for improvements. Interviews were assessed using qualitative content analysis, and suggested improvements were evaluated for implementation using a systematic method of prioritization. RESULTS: A total of three overarching themes were identified from the data. First, participants were highly positive about the potential benefits of using these digital materials for remote delivery, reporting that the videos effectively conveyed key concepts of the symptom and its treatment. Second, some modifications to the materials were suggested for improving clarity. On the basis of this feedback, we made nine specific changes. Finally, participants raised some key challenges for remote delivery, mainly in overcoming the lack of real-time communication during the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians, researchers, and clinical psychology students were overall confident in the use of digitalized materials to remotely deliver a brief intervention to reduce intrusive memories of trauma. Guided by participant feedback, we identified and implemented changes to refine the intervention materials. This study lays the groundwork for the next step: pilot testing remote delivery of the full intervention to trauma survivors.","Gamble, Beau; Depa, Katherine; Holmes, Emily A; Kanstrup, Marie",JMIR Ment Health,,328

This paper aimed to review the auditory-vestibular symptoms associated with COVID-19 and it also investigated the impacts of this pandemic on hearing-impaired community. Recent Findings: The existing studies related to the effects of COVID-19 on the auditoryvestibular system were reviewed and discussed in order to achieve the overall image of COVID-19 on this system. Moreover, due to the adverse effects of using a mask on the communication function of hearing-impaired people, the effects of the mask on the communication process of hearing-impaired people were also reviewed. Conclusion: COVID-19 may be accompanying with some auditory and vestibular dysfunctions. Although there are few findings in this area, they showed that the induced hearing loss is often sudden in nature and it is unclear that this situation is because of the ototoxicity of virus treated drugs or not. The vertigo induced by COVID-19 can be a direct invasion of the virus or an invasion by the immune system and its association with hearing loss and tinnitus must be identified, and appropriate referrals should be considered. On the other hand, due to the adverse effects of using personal protective equipment such as masks on the communication performance of hearing-impaired people, the necessary advice and guidance in this field are provided to the medical staff.

To ensure balanced supply–demand of shared cars in the operational areas, ECS operators tend to explore user-based relocation strategies in addition to the costly operator-based ones. Through a stated preference experiment administered in the Netherlands, we study the travel preferences for ECS and user-based relocation strategies in a comprehensive framework integrating people's current mobility choices and contextual variables. Incentives for picking-up/dropping-off shared cars at distant alternative locations and sharing rides are embedded in two sub-experiments of varied trip distances. The results from an error component multinomial logit (EC-MNL) model show multi-faceted preferences. Particularly, we find that people interested in ECS are willing to collaborate with ECS operators. Alternative pick-up is the most favorite relocation strategy, followed by alternative drop-off and sharing rides. The willingness to accept the incentive for additional access and egress time is estimated as high as 0.33 EUR per walking minute. It is also found that respondents do not show significant differences in preferences for car sanitation by ECS operators or self-service during the times of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides useful implications for operators and policy-makers regarding the user characteristics and contextual settings favoring user-based relocation strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)","Curtale, R.; Liao, F.; van der Waerden, P.",Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,,328

We study popular attitudes toward the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and how these have changed over the course of the pandemic in Switzerland, drawing on data from two rounds of an original public opinion survey conducted in the spring and winter of 2020. We find that the public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups such as health care workers or the elderly. We also find a notable degree of cross-generational solidarity: younger age cohorts prioritize the elderly, while older groups prioritize (typically younger) health care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older age groups, whose solidarity thus seems to be genuine. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue among younger groups, however.","Knotz, Carlo M.; Gandenberger, Mia K.; Fossati, Flavia Bonoli Giuliano",Swiss Political Science Review,,328
257582,"Working in lockdown: the relationship between COVID-19 induced work stressors, job performance, distress, and life satisfaction",2021,"The lockdown introduced in Georgia on November 28, 2020 brought positive results. There were clearly positive tendencies in the spread of COVID-19 to February - first half of March 2021. However, in April-May 2021 there was a significant deterioration in the epidemiological situation. From June to August 2021, the epidemiological situation with Covid-19 in Georgia became very difficult. In this work results of the next statistical analysis of the daily data associated with New Coronavirus COVID-19 infection of confirmed (C), recovered (R), deaths (D) and infection rate (I) cases of the population of Georgia in the period from June 01, 2021 to August 31, 2021 are presented. It also presents the results of the analysis of two-week forecasting of the values of C, D and I. As earlier, the information was regularly sent to the National Center for Disease Control & Public Health of Georgia and posted on the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Avtandil1948/. The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, the following results were obtained. Georgias ranking in the world for Covid-19 monthly mean values of infection and deaths cases in summer 2021 (per 1 million population) was determined. Among 159 countries with population [≥] 1 million inhabitants in August 2021 Georgia was in the 1 place on new infection cases and on Death. A comparison between the daily mortality from Covid-19 in Georgia in summer 2021 with the average daily mortality rate in 2015-2019 shows, that the largest share value of D from mean death in 2015-2019 was 66.0 % (26.08.2021 and 31.08.2021), the smallest 6.0 % (09.07.2021). The statistical analysis of the daily and decade data associated with coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic of confirmed, recovered, deaths cases and infection rate of the population of Georgia are carried out. Maximum daily values of investigation parameters are following: C = 6208 (17.08.2021), R = 6177 (29.08.2021), D = 79 (26.08.2021 and 31.08.2021), I = 13.0 % (17.08.2021). Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: C = 5019 (2 Decade of August 2021), R = 4822 (3 Decade of August 2021), D = 69 (3 Decade of August 2021), I = 10.88 % (2 Decade of August 2021). It was found that as with September 2020 to February 2021 and in spring 2021 [7,8], from June to August 2021 the regression equations for the time variability of the daily values of C, R and D have the form of a tenth order polynomial. Mean values of speed of change of confirmed -V(C), recovered - V(R), deaths - V(D) and infection rate V(I) coronavirus-related cases in different decades of months in the summer 2021 were determined. Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: V(C) = +134 cases/day (1 Decade of August 2021), V(R) = +134 cases/day (2 Decade of August 2021), V(D) = +2.4 cases/day (3 Decade of August 2021), V(I) = + 0.25 %/ day (1 decades of August 2021). Cross-correlations analysis between confirmed COVID-19 cases with recovered and deaths cases shows, that the maximum effect of recovery is observed 19 days after infection (RC=0.95), and deaths - after 16 and 18 days (RC=0.94). In Georgia in the summer 2021, the duration of the impact of the delta variant of the coronavirus on people (recovery, mortality) could be up to two months. Comparison of real and calculated predictions data of C, D and I in Georgia are carried out. It was found that in summer 2021 two-week daily and mean two-week real values of C, D and I practically fall into the 67% - 99.99% confidence interval of these predicted values. With September 1, 2021, it is started monthly forecasting of C, D and I values. As earlier, the comparison of data about C and D in Georgia (GEO) with similar data in Armenia (ARM), Azerbaijan (AZE), Russia (RUS), Turkey (TUR) and in the World (WRL) is also carried out.","Amiranashvili, Avtandil G.; Khazaradze, Ketevan R.; Japaridze, Nino D.",,,328

A video-based physical demands description (PDD) tool may improve time and accuracy concerns associated with current methods. METHODS: Ten simulated occupational tasks were synchronously recorded using a motion capture system and digital video. The tasks included a variety of industrial tasks from lifting to drilling to overhead upper extremity tasks of different cycle times. The digital video was processed with a novel video-based assessment tool to produce 3D joint trajectories (PDAi), and joint angle and reach envelope measures were calculated and compared between both data sources. RESULTS: Root mean squared error between video-based and motion capture posture estimated ranged from 89.0 mm to 118.6 mm for hand height and reach distance measures, and from 13.5° to 21.6° for trunk, shoulder, and elbow angle metrics. Continuous data were reduced to time-weighted bins, and video-based posture estimates showed 75% overall agreement and quadratic-weight Cohen's kappa scores ranging from 0.29 to 1.0 compared to motion capture data across all posture metrics. CONCLUSION AND APPLICATION: The substantial level of agreement between time-weighted bins for video-based and motion capture measures suggest that video-based job task assessment may be a viable approach to improve accuracy and standardization of field physical demands descriptions and minimize error in joint posture and reach envelope estimates compared to traditional pen-and-paper methods.","McKinnon, Colin D; Sonne, Michael W; Keir, Peter J",Hum Factors,,328
257942,Safety and Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is responsible for the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Small studies have shown a potential benefit of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019. Use of these medications alone, or in combination, can lead to a prolongation of the QT interval, possibly increasing the risk of Torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. METHODS: Hospitalized patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin from March 1 to the 23 at 3 hospitals within the Northwell Health system were included in this prospective, observational study. Serial assessments of the QT interval were performed. The primary outcome was QT prolongation resulting in Torsade de pointes. Secondary outcomes included QT prolongation, the need to prematurely discontinue any of the medications due to QT prolongation, and arrhythmogenic death. RESULTS: Two hundred one patients were treated for coronavirus disease 2019 with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Ten patients (5.0%) received chloroquine, 191 (95.0%) received hydroxychloroquine, and 119 (59.2%) also received azithromycin. The primary outcome of torsade de pointes was not observed in the entire population. Baseline corrected QT interval intervals did not differ between patients treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy group) versus those treated with combination group (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; 440.6±24.9 versus 439.9±24.7 ms, P=0.834). The maximum corrected QT interval during treatment was significantly longer in the combination group versus the monotherapy group (470.4±45.0 ms versus 453.3±37.0 ms, P=0.004). Seven patients (3.5%) required discontinuation of these medications due to corrected QT interval prolongation. No arrhythmogenic deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest reported cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients to date treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine±azithromycin, no instances of Torsade de pointes, or arrhythmogenic death were reported. Although use of these medications resulted in QT prolongation, clinicians seldomly needed to discontinue therapy. Further study of the need for QT interval monitoring is needed before final recommendations can be made.","Saleh, Moussa; Gabriels, James; Chang, David; Soo Kim, Beom; Mansoor, Amtul; Mahmood, Eitezaz; Makker, Parth; Ismail, Haisam; Goldner, Bruce; Willner, Jonathan; Beldner, Stuart; Mitra, Raman; John, Roy; Chinitz, Jason; Skipitaris, Nicholas; Mountantonakis, Stavros; Epstein, Laurence M",Circ Arrhythm Electrophysiol,,328
257956,Suffering and Salutogenesis: A Conceptual Analysis of Lessons for Psychiatry From Existential Positive Psychology (PP2.0) in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity. Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","Menendez, Cintia A.; Bylehn, Fabian; Perez-Lemus, Gustavo R.; Alvarado, Walter; Pablo, Juan J. de",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.09805v1.pdf,328

Results in six cities reveal that travel costs could be reduced in half through redistributing facilities. In the optimal scenario, the average travel distance can be modeled as a functional form of the number of facilities and the population density.

262236,Need for a population health approach to understand and address psychosocial consequences of COVID-19,2020,"Glycans of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are speculated to play functional roles in the infection processes as they extensively cover the protein surface and are highly conserved across the variants. To date, the spike protein has become the principal target for vaccine and therapeutic development while the exact effects of its glycosylation remain elusive. Experimental reports have described the heterogeneity of the spike protein glycosylation profile. Subsequent molecular simulation studies provided a knowledge basis of the glycan functions. However, there are no studies to date on the role of discrete glycoforms on the spike protein pathobiology. Building an understanding of its role in SARS-CoV-2 is important as we continue to develop effective medicines and vaccines to combat the disease. Herein, we used designed combinations of glycoengineering enzymes to simplify and control the glycosylation profile of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). Measurements of the receptor binding affinity revealed the regulatory effects of the RBD glycans. Remarkably, opposite effects were observed from differently remodeled glycans, which presents a potential strategy for modulating the spike protein behaviors through glycoengineering. Moreover, we found that the reported anti-SARS-CoV-(2) antibody, S309, neutralizes the impact of different RBD glycoforms on the receptor binding affinity. Overall, this work reports the regulatory roles that glycosylation plays in the interaction between the viral spike protein and host receptor, providing new insights into the nature of SARS-CoV-2. Beyond this study, enzymatic remodeling of glycosylation offers the opportunity to understand the fundamental role of specific glycoforms on glycoconjugates across molecular biology. Covert art LegendsThe glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain has regulatory effects on the receptor binding affinity. Sialylation or not determines the ""stabilizing"" or ""destabilizing"" effect of the glycans. (Protein structure model is adapted from Protein Data Bank: 6moj. The original model does not contain the glycan structure.) SignificanceGlycans extensively cover the surface of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein but the relationships between the glycan structures and the protein pathological behaviors remain elusive. Herein, we simplified and harmonized the glycan structures in the S protein receptor-binding domain and reported their regulatory roles in human receptor interaction. Opposite regulatory effects were observed and were determined by discrete glycan structures, which can be neutralized by the reported S309 antibody binding to the S protein. This report provides new insight into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 S protein infection as well as S309 neutralization.","Hsu, Yen-Pang; Mukherjee, Debopreeti; Shchurik, Vladimir; Makarov, Alexey; Mann, Benjamin F.",,,328

We construct a provincial-level dataset on COVID-19 and link it with population mobility data, among other control variables, to estimate how media coverage mitigates the spread of COVID-19. Seemingly unrelated regressions are used to examine the simultaneous impact of media coverage on the number of new cases and close contacts. The results show that the effect of media coverage on COVID-19 transmission in China had an inverse-U curvature and was mediated by within- and across-province population mobility. Our simulation results indicate that COVID-19 media coverage in China was associated with a potential reduction of 394,000 cases and 1.4 million close contacts during January 19 and February 29, 2020.

263016,"Impact of Shutdown due to COVID-19 Pandemic on Aerosol Characteristics in Kanpur, India",2020,"Populations structured into genetic groups may display group-specific linkage disequilibrium, mutations and/or interactions between quantitative trait loci and the genetic background. These factors lead to heterogeneous marker effects affecting the efficiency of genomic prediction, especially for admixed individuals. Such individuals have a genome that is a mosaic of chromosome blocks from different origins, and may be of interest to combine favorable group-specific characteristics. We developed two genomic prediction models adapted to the prediction of admixed individuals in presence of heterogeneous marker effects: Multi-group Admixed GBLUP Random Individual (MAGBLUP-RI) modeling the ancestry of alleles, and MAGBLUP Random Allele Effect (MAGBLUP-RAE) modeling group-specific distributions of allele effects. MAGBLUP-RI can estimate the segregation variance generated by admixture while MAGBLUP-RAE can disentangle the variability that is due to main allele effects from that due to group-specific deviation effects. Both models were evaluated for their genomic prediction accuracy using a maize panel including lines from the Dent and Flint groups, along with admixed individuals. Based on simulated traits, both models proved their efficiency to improve genomic prediction accuracy compared to standard GBLUP models. For real traits, a clear gain was observed at low marker densities whereas it became limited at high marker densities. The interest of including admixed individuals in multi-group training sets was confirmed using simulated traits, but was variable using real traits. Both MAGBLUP models and admixed individuals are of interest whenever there exist group-specific SNP allele effects.","Rio, Simon; Moreau, Laurence; Charcosset, Alain; Mary-Huard, Tristan",Genetics,,328
263145,COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown Fine Optimality,2021,"BACKGROUND: When a new infectious disease emerges, appropriate case definitions are important for clinical diagnosis and for public health surveillance. Tracking case numbers over time is important to establish the speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. We aimed to assess whether changes in case definitions affected inferences on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China. METHODS: We examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used exponential growth models to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the number of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. FINDINGS: From Jan 15 to March 3, 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed, the proportion of infections being detected as cases increased by 7·1 times (95% credible interval [CrI] 4·8-10·9) from version 1 to 2, 2·8 times (1·9-4·2) from version 2 to 4, and 4·2 times (2·6-7·3) from version 4 to 5. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak with sufficient testing capacity, we estimated that by Feb 20, 2020, there would have been 232â000 (95% CrI 161â000-359â000) confirmed cases in China as opposed to the 55â508 confirmed cases reported. INTERPRETATION: The case definition was initially narrow and was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan, China, or other known cases. These changes should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

Some sparse case reports have described various forms of encephalitis in COVID-19 disease, but very few data have focused on clinical presentations, clinical course, response to treatment and outcomes. METHODS: The ENCOVID multicentre study included patients with encephalitis with full infectious screening, CSF, EEG, MRI data and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection recruited from 13 centres in northern Italy. Clinical presentation and laboratory markers, severity of COVID-19 disease, response to treatment and outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: twenty-five cases of encephalitis positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia and/or pleocytosis in 68% of cases whereas SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR resulted negative. Based on MRI, cases were classified as ADEM (n=3), limbic encephalitis (LE, n=2), encephalitis with normal imaging (n=13) and encephalitis with MRI alterations (n=7). ADEM and LE cases showed a delayed onset compared to the other encephalitis (p=0.001) and were associated with previous more severe COVID-19 respiratory involvement. Patients with MRI alterations exhibited worse response to treatment and final outcomes compared to other encephalitis.

265454,Exploring the factors affecting travel behaviors during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States,2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), first described in December 2019, has infected more than 33 million people and claimed more than 1 million deaths worldwide. Rheumatic diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases, the prevalence and impact of which in COVID-19 patients are poorly known. We performed a pooled analysis of published data intending to summarize clinical presentation and patient outcomes in those with established rheumatic disease diagnosis and concurrent COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies reporting data about rheumatic disease patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and published until July 22, 2020. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled incidence and rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality among these patients, and interstudy heterogeneity was identified using I2 statistics with greater than 75% value indicating substantial interstudy variation. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included, giving a total sample size of 49,099 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 49,099 COVID-19 patients, a total of 1382 were also diagnosed with a rheumatic disease in the past. The random-effects pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among rheumatic disease patients was found to be 0.9%. The rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality were 70.7%, 11.6%, and 10.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not dramatically high in rheumatic disease patients, concurrent COVID-19 does seem to play a role in determining disease severity and outcomes to some extent.

COVID-19 has a range of symptoms that includes fever, fatigue, dry cough, aches, and labored breathing to acute respiratory distress and possibly death. Health systems and hospitals have been completely rearranged since March 2020 in order to limit the high rate of virus spreading. Hence, a great debate on postponable visits and treatments including phototherapy for skin diseases is developing. In particular, as regards phototherapy very few data are currently available regarding the chance to continue it, even if it may be an useful resource for treating numerous dermatological patients. However, phototherapy has an immunosuppressive action possibly facilitating virus infection. In the context of COVID-19 infection risk it is important to pointed out whether sunlight, phototherapy and in particular ultraviolet radiation (UV-R) constitute or not a risk for patients. In this review we aimed to focus on the relationship between UV-R, sunlight, phototherapy, and viral infections particularly focusing on COVID-19.","Megna, Matteo; Marasca, Claudio; Fabbrocini, Gabriella; Monfrecola, Giuseppe",,,328

268943,Cutting Through the Noise: Predictors of Successful Online Message Retransmission in the First 8 Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Much attention has been paid to developing methods capable of synchronous removal of pollutants from swine wastewater. Due to the natural symbiotic interactions between microalgae and bacteria, the microalgae-bacteria symbiosis (ABS) system has been found to have potential for treating wastewater. However, the corresponding biological mechanisms in the ABS system and the role of dynamic microbial community evolution in pollutant removal systems remain poorly understood. Therefore, we investigate the potential of an ABS system for pollutant removal applications and analyze the bacterial consortium symbiotically combined with Chlorella sp. MA1 and Coelastrella sp. KE4. The NH4+-N and PO43--P removal efficiencies were significantly increased from 12.79% to 99.52% and 35.66% to 96.06% due to biotic interactions between the microalgae and bacteria. The abundance of bacterial taxa and genes related to oxidative stress, cell growth and nitrogen transfer were found to increase in response to photosynthesis, respiration and NH4+-N uptake. Furthermore, pathogen inactivation was induced via microalgae, co-driven by microbial succession under high dissolved oxygen conditions. In this microalgae-enhanced ABS system, the interactions between microalgae and bacteria are established for pathogens elimination and nitrogen cycling, verifying that the ABS system is an effective and environmentally sustainable swine wastewater treatment method.","Qu, Wenying; Zhang, Chaofan; Chen, Xi; Ho, Shih-Hsin",J Hazard Mater,,328

The presentation of the disease is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to critical COVID-19. The availability of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors may reportedly increase the susceptibility and/or disease progression of COVID-19. Comorbidities and risk factors have also been noted to increase COVID-19 susceptibility. In this paper, we hereby review the evidence pertaining to ACE2's relationship to common comorbidities, risk factors, and therapies associated with severe and critical COVID-19. We also highlight gaps of knowledge that require further investigation. The primary comorbidities of respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension had strong evidence. The secondary risk factors of age, sex, and genetics had limited-to-moderate evidence. The tertiary factors of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers had limited-to-moderate evidence.

270831,Lessons learned in managing risk: Tools and strategies for confident operations from the CLEAN 2020 Summit,2020,"The novel RNA virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus II (SARS-CoV-2), is currently the leading cause of mortality in 2020, having led to over 1.6 million deaths and infecting over 75 million people worldwide by December 2020. While vaccination has started and several clinical trials for a number of vaccines are currently underway, there is a pressing need for a cure for those already infected with the virus. Of particular interest in the design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics is the human protein angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) to which this virus adheres before entry into the host cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virion binds to cell-surface bound ACE2 via interactions of the spike protein (s-protein) on the viral surface with ACE2. In this paper, we use all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and binding enthalpy calculations to determine the effect that a bound ACE2 active site inhibitor (MLN-4760) would have on the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 s-protein with ACE2. Our analysis indicates that the binding enthalpy could be reduced for s-protein adherence to the active site inhibitor-bound ACE2 protein by as much as 1.48-fold as an upper limit. This weakening of binding strength was observed to be due to the destabilization of the interactions between ACE2 residues Glu-35, Glu-37, Tyr-83, Lys-353, and Arg-393 and the SARS-CoV-2 s-protein receptor binding domain (RBD). The conformational changes were shown to lead to weakening of ACE2 interactions with SARS-CoV-2 s-protein, therefore reducing s-protein binding strength. Further, we observed increased conformational lability of the N-terminal helix and a conformational shift of a significant portion of the ACE2 motifs involved in s-protein binding, which may affect the kinetics of the s-protein binding when the small molecule inhibitor is bound to the ACE2 active site. These observations suggest potential new ways for interfering with the SARS-CoV-2 adhesion by modulating ACE2 conformation through distal active site inhibitor binding.","Williams-Noonan, Billy J; Todorova, Nevena; Kulkarni, Ketav; Aguilar, Marie-Isabel; Yarovsky, Irene",J Phys Chem B,,328

Phase solubility studies confirmed a stoichiometry of a 1:1 ratio for both ADL:β-CD and ADL/β-CD with a 1% poloxamer 188 system with an AL type of phase solubility curve. The stability constants (K1:1) calculated from the AL type diagram were 550 M-1 and 2134 M-1 for AD:β-CD and ADL/β-CD with 1% poloxamer 188, respectively. The binary ADL/β-CD and ternary ADL/β-CD with 1% poloxamer 188 complexes were prepared by kneading and a solvent evaporation method and were characterized by aqueous solubility, FTIR, PXRD, DSC and SEM in vitro studies. The solubility (13.1 fold) and release of ADL were markedly improved in kneaded ternary ADL/β-CD with 1% poloxamer 188 (KDB). The binding affinity of ADL and β-CD was confirmed by 1H NMR and 2D ROSEY studies. The ternary complex (KDB) was further subjected for in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats and a significant improvement in the bioavailability (2.17 fold) was observed in comparison with pure ADL. Therefore, it can be concluded that the solubilization and bioavailability of ADL can be remarkably increased by ADL/β-CD complexation in the presence of a third component, poloxamer 188.","Md Khalid, Anwer Iqbal Muzaffar Ahmed Mohammad Muqtader Aldawsari Mohammed F.; Ansari, Mohd Nazam Ezzeldin Essam Khalil Nasr Y.; Raisuddin, Ali",Pharmaceuticals,,328

The precise aim of this study was to assess the impact of ongoing online education on current university students’ FAD and psychological stress symptoms following one year of calamitous COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted from March 15 to 30, 2021, for data collection through a snowball simple sampling technique among Bangladeshi University students, where a total of 1,299 respondents (age: ≥ 18 years) responded in the questionnaire. After obtaining informed consent from the participants, we evaluated the association of various sociodemographic factors and the effects of current e-Learning activities on FAD and subsequent psychological distress among university students in Bangladesh. After excluding the partial responses (n = 177), we analyzed the clean data sheet (n = 1,122) by three consecutive statistical methods: univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Results Alarmingly, near 60% of the current students exerted extreme FAD and were suffering from severe stress. Besides, 78.1% of students having severe FAD were severely psychologically stressed. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the students of the female gender, rural area, lower-income families, and who suffered from the highest FAD were more significantly (p &lt; 0.05) stressed than their reference groups. Conclusion The current analysis demonstrates that most Bangladeshi university students are battling with the unrivaled trend of FAD and facing severe psychological stress symptoms, which must be alleviated by the concerted efforts of the Government, Universities, and educationalists.","Hossain, Md Jamal Ahmmed Foyez Rahman S.

THE STUDY: We investigated the epidemiological relationship among infected cases on a recent cluster infection of COVID-19 in an apartment building in Seoul, South Korea. All infected cases were found along two vertical lines of the building, and each line was connected through a single air duct in the bathroom for natural ventilation. Our investigation found no other possible contact between the cases than the airborne infection through a single air duct in the bathroom. The virus from the first infected case can be spread to upstairs and downstairs through the air duct by the (reverse) stack effect, which explains the air movement in a vertical shaft.

The objective of this study was to identify patient populations with poor health care access and assess prescribing trends for drugs with published PGx testing guidelines. We used electronic health record data from 67,753 University of Florida Health patients, geographic access scores calculated via the 2-step floating catchment area method, and a composite measure of socioeconomic status. Comparing the poorest (Q4) and greatest (Q1) access score quartiles, poor geographic access was significantly associated with fewer prescriber encounters (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-0.91), fewer total unique drugs (IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95), and fewer PGx guideline drugs (IRR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.99). After correcting for number of unique drugs, patients in low-access areas were prescribed a greater proportion of PGx guideline drugs (IRR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.13). We detected significant interactions between Black race and access score. Compared to Q1, Black patients with Q4 access scores were disproportionately affected and had fewer encounters (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.7-0.82) and a higher proportion of PGx drugs (IRR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13-1.41), creating further disparity. Overall, these results suggest that improved geographic access to PGx testing may allow prescribers to make more efficient use of limited opportunities to optimize therapy for drugs with PGx testing guidelines.","Dalton, Rachel; Brown, Joshua D; Duarte, Julio D",Clinical and translational science (Online),,328

This study investigates relationship between total severity score by first chest CT and the outcome of coronavirus COVID-19 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). RESULTS: A total of 48 patients with a history of CAD (mean age=60.83±3.06 years, 75% male) with positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 were included. Outcome was defined as acute respiratory distress syndrome or death. The unadjusted and adjusted effects of the CT score on the outcome were reported through odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Outcome occurred in 17 (35.5%) patients (8 deaths). The CT score was directly and significantly correlated with the outcome in the univariate analysis (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.12-1.70; P=0.003) and remained significant after adjustment for diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, and serum level of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.11-2.05; P=0.009). Outcome rate was 24.1% in patients with a CT score <2.5, whereas it was 8.3% in patients with a CT score>2.5.

Telemedicine should be vigorously promoted to reduce the risk of infections and to offer medical assistance to restricted patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand physicians' attitudes toward and perspectives of telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to provide support for better implementation of telemedicine. METHODS: We surveyed all physicians (N=148), from October 17 to 25, 2020, who attended the clinical informatics PhD program at West China Medical School, Sichuan University, China. The physicians came from 57 hospitals in 16 provinces (ie, municipalities) across China, 54 of which are 3A-level hospitals, two are 3B-level hospitals, and one is a 2A-level hospital. RESULTS: Among 148 physicians, a survey response rate of 87.2% (129/148) was attained. The average age of the respondents was 35.6 (SD 3.9) years (range 23-48 years) and 67 out of 129 respondents (51.9%) were female. The respondents come from 37 clinical specialties in 55 hospitals located in 14 provinces (ie, municipalities) across Eastern, Central, and Western China. A total of 94.6% (122/129) of respondents' hospitals had adopted a telemedicine system; however, 34.1% (44/129) of the physicians had never used a telemedicine system and only 9.3% (12/129) used one frequently (&#8805;1 time/week). A total of 91.5% (118/129) and 88.4% (114/129) of physicians were willing to use telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Physicians considered the inability to examine patients in person to be the biggest concern (101/129, 78.3%) and the biggest barrier (76/129, 58.9%) to implementing telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is not yet universally available for all health care needs and has not been used frequently by physicians in this study. However, the willingness of physicians to use telemedicine was high. Telemedicine still has many problems to overcome.","Liu, Jialin; Liu, Siru; Zheng, Tao; Bi, Yongdong",JMIR Med Inform,,328

279022,New Ways of Working and Public Healthcare Professionals’ Well-Being: The Response to Face the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"In-person traditional approaches to mental health care services are facing difficulties amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. The recent implementation of social distancing has redirected attention to nontraditional mental health care delivery to overcome hindrances to essential services. Telehealth has been established for several decades but has only been able to play a small role in health service delivery. Mobile and teledigital health solutions for mental health are well poised to respond to the upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first-aid resources and targeting interventions. However, rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities is needed in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness, and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained, unlicensed professionals, who may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members with stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking (with real-time automation and machine learning) of mental health in general populations as well as considerations and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","Balcombe, Luke; De Leo, Diego",JMIR Ment Health,,328

We aimed to analyse the effect of 'social distancing' on the emotional state, post-operative pain and functional outcomes of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Material and methods: We retrospectively reviewed data of male patients who underwent RARP within the study period (from March to April 2019 [Group A = 27 patients] and from March to April 2020 [Group B = 29 patients]). Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) results were collected on the first day of hospitalization. Post-operative pain was assessed using the numerical rating scale (NRS) and visual analogic scale (VAS) after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 24 hours. Functional outcomes were evaluated at the one-month follow-up. Demographic, pathological and peri-operative data were collected for all patients. Results: There were no significant differences in demographics and pathological characteristics amongst the groups. We observed that patients in Group A had a statistically lower value on the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 questionnaires than patients of Group B. Moreover, Group A showed statistically significant better post-operative pain control in PACU and at 24 hours. At one-month follow-up, patients in Group B required more diapers for incontinence than Group A, showing poor early continence. Patients in Group A showed interest in sexual rehabilitation after 1.11 ±.320 months while patients in Group B after 2.59 ±.712 months (p <.001). Moreover, 17 out of 29 patients (58.62%) in Group B were referred to an andrologist, compared to 100% of patients from Group A (p = 0.0006). Conclusions: Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a poor pre-operative emotional state, as well as influencing post-operative pain, early urinary continence and desire for sexual rehabilitation.","Chiancone, Francesco; Fabiano, Marco; Fedelini, Maurizio; Carrino, Maurizio; Meccariello, Clemente; Fedelini, Paolo",Cent European J Urol,,328

The current paper aims to discuss the impact of two different sampling methodologies when executing a drive through COVID-19 survey on the quality of estimated disease burden measures. Secondary data analysis of a pilot cross-sectional survey targeting Qatar's primary health care registered population was done. Two groups with different sampling methods were compared for estimating COVID-19 point prevalence using molecular testing for nasopharyngeal swabs. The first group is a stratified random sample non-proportional to size (N = 260). A total of 16 population strata based on age group, gender, and nationality were sampled. The second group is the Open invitation group (N = 841). The results showed that the two groups were obviously and significantly different in age and nationality. Besides, reporting of COVID-19 symptoms was more frequent in the open invitation group (28.2%) than the random sample (16.2%). The open invitation group overestimated the symptomatic COVID-19 prevalence rate by more than four times, while it overestimated the asymptomatic COVID-19 cases by a small margin. The overall prevalence rate of active COVID-19 cases in the open invitation sample (13.3%) was almost double that of the random sample (6.9%). Furthermore, using population sampling weights reduced the prevalence rate to 0.8%. The lesson learned here is that it is wise to consider the magnitude of bias introduced in a surveillance system when relying on convenient sampling approaches in response to time constraints.","AQotba, Hamda Abdulla; Al Nuaimi, Ahmed Sameer; Al Mujalli, Hanan; Zainel, Abduljaleel Abdullatif; Khudadad, Hanan; Marji, Tamara; Veettil, Shajitha Thekke; Syed, Mohamed Ahmed",Front Public Health,,328

Within their scope of practice, pharmacists can prescribe and administer vaccines, conduct point-of-care testing, and address drug shortages through therapeutic substitutions. OBJECTIVES: To better use pharmacists as first responders to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we conducted a needs and capacity assessment to (1) determine individual commitment to provide COVID-19 testing and management services, (2) identify resources required to provide these services, and (3) help prioritize unmet community needs that could be addressed by pharmacists. METHODS: In March 2020, pharmacists and student pharmacists within the Alaska Pharmacist Association worked to tailor, administer, and evaluate results from a 10-question survey, including demographics (respondent name, ZIP Code, cell phone, and alternate e-mail). The survey was developed on the basis of published COVID-19 guidelines, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 screening and management guidelines, National Association of Boards of Pharmacy guidance, and joint policy recommendation from pharmacy organizations. RESULTS: Pharmacies are located in the areas of greatest COVID-19 need in Alaska. Pharmacists are willing and interested in providing support. Approximately 63% of the pharmacists who completed the survey indicated that they were interested in providing COVID-19 nasal testing, 60% were interested in conducting COVID-19 antibody testing, and 93% were interested in prescribing and administering immunizations for COVID-19, as available. When asked about resources needed to enable pharmacists to prescribe antiviral therapy, 37% of the pharmacists indicated they needed additional education or training, and 39% required access to technology to bill and document provided services. CONCLUSION: The primary barrier to pharmacists augmenting the current COVID-19 response is an inability to cover the costs of providing these health services. Pharmacists in Alaska are ready to meet COVID-19-related clinical needs if public and private insurers and legislators can help address the barriers to service sustainability.","Paul, Amy K; Bogart, Talethia; Schaber, Ashley R; Cutchins, Della C; Robinson, Renee F",,,328
283930,Laboratory Preparedness To Support The COVID-19 Pandemic Respond In Indonesia,2020,"AIMS: Chronic heart failure (HF) is a major comorbidity accounting for an increased severity and mortality related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To reduce the risk of COVID-19 in HF patients, telemedicine has been encouraged. METHODS AND RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedical management with mainly over-the-phone appointments became a major strategy of follow-up of our HF clinic patients. Previously, the large majority of patients have been seen in the hospital with direct patient-provider contact. We compared both strategies of follow-up, in pre-pandemic (PPP) and pandemic (PP) periods, regarding total mortality and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits due to HF exacerbation. We prospectively studied a cohort of 196 patients. The mean follow-up time in PPP was 1.4 years. In this period, 20 patients died. In PP (follow-up of 71 days), there was one additional death. Total mortality in the first year of follow-up was 12.0%, matching the mortality predicted by the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score. Considering hospitalizations/ED visits due to decompensated HF, there was no statistically significant difference between PPP and PP. Only one patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of an increase in telemedical management of this cohort of HF patients, we were able to maintain a low rate of admissions due to HF decompensation, without an increment in mortality. Regarding these results, we encourage the incremental use of telemedicine in HF patients in the context of this or future pandemics and also in situations in which physical consultation might not be possible due to logistic issues.","Afonso Nogueira, Marta; Ferreira, Fernanda; Raposo, Ana Filipa; Mónica, Lurdes; Simões Dias, Sara; Vasconcellos, Rafael; Proença, Gonçalo",ESC Heart Fail,,328

Downregulation of cytokeratin 18 (CK18) is a critical molecular event of EMT; however, its importance in the induction of EMT and CSC features has not been defined to date. This study aimed to investigate the biological significance and underlying molecular mechanisms of CK18 in inducing EMT phenotype and stemness properties of breast cancer cells. Three breast cancer cell lines (i.e., non-metastatic MCF-7, highly metastatic MDA-MB-231, and mitoxantrone (MX)-selected resistant MCF-7/MX cells) and two CK18-knockdown stable cell clones (MCF-7-shCK18-7D and 3C) were used to determine the association between CK18 and EMT and stemness. CK18 expression was extremely low in highly metastatic, resistant, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß1/tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;-treated breast cancer cells with mesenchymal phenotype and increased expression of CSC markers. Depletion of CK18 promoted partial EMT and the acquisition of stemness properties in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Mechanistically, CK18 interference in MCF-7 cells activated the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, resulting in the up-regulation of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Consistently, the stemness properties and metastasis can be attenuated by further knockdown of EpCAM in CK18-depleted cells. In conclusion, downregulation of CK18 promotes partial EMT and enhances breast cancer stemness by increasing EpCAM expression partly via the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway. These findings indicate that CK18 may serve as a potential treatment target for advanced breast cancer.","Shi, Ruizan; Liu, Linhong; Wang, Fengge; He, Yifan; Niu, Yanan; Wang, Chang; Zhang, Xuanping; Zhang, Xiuli; Zhang, Huifeng; Chen, Min; Wang, Yan",Cell Signal,,328
285044,Prevalence of self-reported anxiety and self-medication among upper and middle socioeconomic strata amidst COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background and Objective: Coronavirus is spreading across the globe since December 2019. As India's first case was reported on January 30, 2020, the spread of this virus is experiencing by our population. As a result, there are extensive emotional distress and anxiety among populations due to this pandemic. Screening mental health is important for psychological well-being of any individual during this pandemic. The objective of this study was to validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) in an Indian population. Materials and Methods: The research proposal was laid out before an ethical clearance committee, which approved the conduct of the research and consequent publication of the paper. Data were collected from 246 respondents through online. CAS, developed by Lee (2020), was adopted for the study. Informed consent was given by all the respondents, and their participation was voluntary. AMOS and SPSS were used to calculate confirmatory factor analysis and other statistical analyses. Bartlett's test of sphericity and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test, and Cronbach's alpha, were also calculated. Convergent validity was calculated through average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) in Microsoft Excel. Results, and Conclusions: Bartlett's test of sphericity was highly significant measuring Chi-square = 494.004, df = 10, and P &lt; 0.001. The KMO was acceptable at 0.805. Fit indices (P &lt; 0.001, Chi-square/df = 3.24, goodness of fit index = 0.976, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.954, and comparative fit index = 0.977) are statistically significant. Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.822), AVE (0.526), and CR (0.745) were adequate. The overall findings of the analyses demonstrate that the CAS is a reliable and valid scale that evaluates the severity levels of dysfunctional anxiety linked to COVID-19 in an Indian sample. CAS is applicable to measure the level of dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety in the Indian population. © 2021 Medical Journal of Dr. D.Y. Patil Vidyapeeth.","Singh, K.",Medical Journal of Dr. D.Y.

285181,Hospital Nursing Staff Perceptions of Resources Provided by Their Organizations During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Current commercially available silver-based wound dressings such as silver-nylon have been used as antimicrobial barriers for burn and trauma care in combat conditions for over 10 years However, these dressings do not stabilize the eschar or reduce its toxicity Cerium nitrate (CN) solutions have been established clinically to stabilize the eschar by decreasing release of inflammatory mediators from burned tissue thereby allowing delayed excision and grafting In this report, we tested the extent to which CN imparts CN benefits to silver dressings for temporizing treatments of burn wounds and enhancing anti-bacterial activity Using a rat full-thickness scald burn model, we showed that CN enhanced the anti-bacterial effects of the tested silver-based dressings (Acticoat™, Mepilex™, and Silverlon(®)), while also imparting anti-inflammatory properties to these dressings Compared to the use of silver dressings alone, CN significantly decreased the levels of IL-1β and GRO/KC, and exhibited downward trending levels of IL-1α, MIP-1α, and bacterial bioburden within the wound Based on our findings, we conclude that CN has the ability to expand and enhance the function of several silver dressings We propose the use of CN in combination with silver dressings to stabilize burn wounds thereby allowing postponement of excision and grafting, most notably in scenarios where the standard of care is not feasible such as in combat situations, resource limited regions, and new emergent health care challenges as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in which COVID-positive severe burn patients are not able to undergo surgery during an active outbreak","Qian, L.

285638,COVID-19-related media consumption and parental mental health,2021,"BACKGROUND: Rapid access to emergency medical communication centers (EMCCs) is pivotal to address potentially life-threatening conditions. Maintaining public access to EMCCs without delay is crucial in case of disease outbreak despite the significant increased activity and the difficulties to mobilize extra staff resources. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of two-level filtering on EMCC performance during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A before-after monocentric prospective study was conducted at the EMCC at the Nantes University Hospital. Using telephone activity data, we compared EMCC performance during 2 periods. In period one (February 27th to March 11th 2020), call takers managed calls as usual, gathering basic information from the caller and giving first aid instructions to a bystander on scene if needed. During period two (March 12th to March 25th 2020), calls were answered by a first-line call taker to identify potentially serious conditions that required immediate dispatch. When a serious condition was excluded, the call was immediately transferred to a second-line call taker who managed the call as usual so the first-line call taker could be rapidly available for other incoming calls. The primary outcome was the quality of service at 20 s (QS20), corresponding to the rate of calls answered within 20 s. We described activity and outcome measures by hourly range. We compared EMCC performance during periods one and two using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed 45,451 incoming calls during the two study periods: 21,435 during period 1 and 24,016 during period 2. Between the two study periods, we observed a significant increase in the number of incoming calls per hour, the number of connected call takers and average call duration. A linear regression model, adjusted for these confounding variables, showed a significant increase in the QS20 slope (from - 0.4 to 1.4%, p = 0.01), highlighting the significant impact of two-level filtering on the quality of service. CONCLUSIONS: We found that rapid access to our EMCC was maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic via two-level filtering. This system helped reduce the time gap between call placement and first-line call-taker evaluation of a potentially life-threatening situation. We suggest implementing this system when an EMCC faces significantly increased activity with limited staff resources.","Penverne, Y; Leclere, B; Labady, J; Berthier, F; Jenvrin, J; Javaudin, F; Montassier, E",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,,328

Most findings were reported in the form of case reports or case series, whereas a comprehensive overview is still lacking. We conducted a systematic review and searched for all published cases until July 20th 2020. We included 73 patients reported in 52 publications. A broad age range was affected (mean 55, min 11-max 94 years) with male predominance (68.5%). Most patients showed respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, and developed GBS manifestations after COVID-19. However, asymptomatic cases for COVID-19 were also described. The distributions of clinical variants and electrophysiological subtypes resemble those of classic GBS, with a higher prevalence of the classic sensorimotor form and the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, although rare variants like Miller Fisher syndrome were also reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytological dissociation was present in around 71% cases, and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all tested cases. More than 70% of patients showed a good prognosis, mostly after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Patients with less favorable outcome were associated with a significantly older age in accordance with previous findings regarding both classic GBS and COVID-19. COVID-19-associated GBS seems to share most features of classic post-infectious GBS and possibly the same immune-mediated pathogenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, more extensive epidemiological studies are needed to clarify these issues.","Abu-Rumeileh, Samir; Abdelhak, Ahmed; Foschi, Matteo; Tumani, Hayrettin; Otto, Markus",J. neurol,,328
291336,"Reactance, morality, and disgust: the relationship between affective dispositions and compliance with official health recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has strained many healthcare systems. In response, U.S. hospitals altered their care delivery systems, but there are few data regarding specific structural changes. Understanding these changes is important to guide interpretation of outcomes and inform pandemic preparedness. We sought to characterize emergency responses across hospitals in the United States over time and in the context of local case rates early in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN: We surveyed hospitals from a national acute care trials group regarding operational and structural changes made in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from January to August 2020. We collected prepandemic characteristics and changes to hospital system, space, staffing, and equipment during the pandemic. We compared the timing of these changes with county-level coronavirus disease 2019 case rates. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: U.S. hospitals participating in the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network Coronavirus Disease 2019 Observational study. Site investigators at each hospital collected local data. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five sites participated (94% response rate). System-level changes (incident command activation and elective procedure cancellation) occurred at nearly all sites, preceding rises in local case rates. The peak inpatient census during the pandemic was greater than the prior hospital bed capacity in 57% of sites with notable regional variation. Nearly half (49%) expanded ward capacity, and 63% expanded ICU capacity, with nearly all bed expansion achieved through repurposing of clinical spaces. Two-thirds of sites adapted staffing to care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019, with 48% implementing tiered staffing models, 49% adding temporary physicians, nurses, or respiratory therapists, and 30% changing the ratios of physicians or nurses to patients. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic prompted widespread system-level changes, but front-line clinical care varied widely according to specific hospital needs and infrastructure. Linking operational changes to care delivery processes is a necessary step to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on patient outcomes.","Mathews, Kusum S; Seitz, Kevin P; Vranas, Kelly C; Duggal, Abhijit; Valley, Thomas S; Zhao, Bo; Gundel, Stephanie; Harhay, Michael O; Chang, Steven Y; Hough, Catherine L",Crit. care med,,328

Voters care only about the final decision, not the elected representatives. The disutility of a voter is proportional to the fraction of issues, where his preferences disagree with the decision. While an issue-by-issue vote by all voters would maximize social welfare, we are interested in how well the preferences of the population can be approximated by a small committee. We show that a k-sortition (a random committee of k voters with the majority vote within the committee) leads to an outcome within the factor 1+O(1/k) of the optimal social cost for any number of voters n, any number of issues $m$, and any preference profile. For a small number of issues m, the social cost can be made even closer to optimal by delegation procedures that weigh committee members according to their number of followers. However, for large m, we demonstrate that the k-sortition is the worst-case optimal rule within a broad family of committee-based rules that take into account metric information about the preference profile of the whole population.","Meir, Reshef; Sandomirskiy, Fedor; Tennenholtz, Moshe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07837v1.pdf,328
293222,Accelerated Graduation and the Deployment of New Physicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Although statins are widely prescribed lipid-lowering drugs, there are concerns about the safety of their use in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), since statins increase the expression of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). This study aimed to disclose the association between statins and 60-day COVID-19 mortality. Approach and Results: All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study from January 19 to April 16, 2020, in Korea. We evaluated the association between the use of statins and COVID-19-related mortality in the overall and the nested 1:2 propensity score-matched study. Furthermore, a comparison of the hazard ratio for death was performed between COVID-19 patients and a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with pneumonia between January and June 2019 in Korea. The median age of the 10 448 COVID-19 patients was 45 years. Statins were prescribed in 533 (5.1%) patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, Cox regression showed a significant decrease in hazard ratio associated with the use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.637 [95% CI, 0.425-0.953]; P=0.0283). Moreover, on comparing the hazard ratio between COVID-19 patients and the retrospective cohort of hospitalized pneumonia patients, the use of statins showed similar benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The use of statins correlates significantly with lower mortality in patients with COVID-19, consistent with the findings in patients with pneumonia.

293430,The Pros and Cons of Online Competitive Gaming: An Evidence-Based Approach to Assessing Young Players' Well-Being,2021,"Introduction: Safety behaviors are key elements in reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, but have also assumed excessive proportions in form of panic buying groceries. This raises the question whether these behaviors are independent or related to each other. Adherent safety behavior including increased hygiene and physical distancing appears inherently adherent and prosocial, while dysfunctional safety behavior such as panic buying most probably emerges from other motives and contextual variables. Methods: Data from 15,308 participants collected from March 10 to May 4, 2020, during the COVID-19 acute period in Germany, was analyzed to assess whether adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior are predicted by the same or divergent variables. Two multiple regression models are presented including various sociodemographic, trait, attitudinal, and COVID-19-specific variables as predictors. Results: Some variables similarly predict both, adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior. Yet, adherent safety behavior is stronger predicted by COVID-19-related fear than generalized anxiety, while a trend toward a reverse pattern emerged for dysfunctional safety behavior. Adherent safety behavior was also related to higher trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, subjective level of information, as well as use of public media and TV to remain informed on COVID-19. Higher age was related to dysfunctional, but not adherent safety behavior. Respondents living in rural communities report more adherent safety behavior than urban dwellers. Discussion: Divergent psychological variables underlie adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior. This hints toward a theoretical separation with practical relevance in behavioral engineering and public health campaigning.","Weismüller, Benjamin; Schweda, Adam; Dörrie, Nora; Musche, Venja; Fink, Madeleine; Kohler, Hannah; Skoda, Eva-Maria; Teufel, Martin; Bäuerle, Alexander",Front Public Health,,328

As of May 19, 2020, the virus had spread to 215 countries with more than 4,622,001 confirmed cases and 311,916 reported deaths worldwide, including Algeria with 7201 cases and 555 deaths. Analyze and forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths growth could be useful in many ways, governments could estimate medical equipment and take appropriate policy responses, and experts could approximate the peak and the end of the disease. In this work, we first train a time series Prophet model to analyze and forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Algeria based on the previously reported numbers. Then, to better understand the spread and the properties of the COVID-19, we include external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus, construct a dataset from reliable sources, and conduct a large-scale data analysis considering 82 countries worldwide. The evaluation results show that the time series Prophet model accurately predicts the number of cases and deaths in Algeria with low RMSE scores of 218.87 and 4.79 respectively, while the forecast suggests that the total number of cases and deaths are expected to increase in the coming weeks. Moreover, the worldwide data-driven analysis reveals several correlations between the increase/decrease in the number of cases and deaths and external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus such as geographic, climatic, health, economic, and demographic factors.","Belkacem, Sami",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09755v1.pdf,328

Based on evolutionary biology and translational research this review suggests that the high antioxidant capacity of children leading to a balanced redox state is the key factor for mild SARS-CoV-2 infections in this age group. On the other hand, elderly individuals with low antioxidant capacity and low angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression are prone to severe infections by redox-sensitive immune modulation.","Keles, E.

296467,"Reimagining U.S. Olympic Sports – How the Covid-19 Pandemic Serves as the Catalyst for Public Funding, Greater Transparency, and Increased Athlete Rights",2020,"We describe the design and performance evaluation of a portable gas chromatograph suitable for the analysis of volatile organic and odorous compounds at trace levels. The system comprises a carbon nanotube sponge preconcentrator, an electronic pressure control (EPC) unit, a temperature-programmable column module, and a fast-response photoionization detector. A built-in tablet computer controls instrumental parameters and chromatogram display functions. The compact GC with dimensions of 35 cm (l) × 26 cm (w) × 15 cm (h) is self-contained, weighing less than 5 kg without a battery pack, and uses no auxiliary compressed gases. Our design has three main advantages over conventional portable GCs: recharging configuration of ambient air as the carrier gas using a miniature diaphragm pump, precise control of column flow by the built-in canister and EPC system, and rapid thermal desorption of the preconcentrator facilitated by intrinsic resistivity of the carbon nanotube sponge. A 30 m, 0.28 mm I.D. capillary column operated at a head pressure of 14 psi provided a peak capacity of 55 for a 10 min isothermal analysis. The temperature-programmability feature could decrease the analysis time of less than 5 min for vapor mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene. More than a 100-fold increase in sensitivity by preconcentrating a sample adsorption volume of 90 mL resulted in improved detection limits of 0.13 (benzene), 0.20 (toluene), 0.23 (ethylbenzene), and 0.28 (o-xylene) ppb (v/v). Our instrument displayed good stability and reproducibility of retention times (< 0.14% RSD) and intensities (< 4.5% RSD) for continuous measurements using the preconcentrator over 10 h. Thus, continuous and on-site determinations of trace volatile organic compounds in air samples with this instrument appear feasible.","You, Dong-Wook; Seon, Yeong-Sik; Jang, Yeonhee; Bang, Juyeon; Oh, Jun-Sik; Jung, Kwang-Woo",J Chromatogr A,,328

Acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a disease with high morbidity and mortality rates, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention is usually recommended for the treatment. A patient with diabetes mellitus and hypertension for five years was admitted to the emergency unit with symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnoea. These symptoms were consistent with viral pneumonia and a COVID PCR test was performed, which tested positive three days later. The patient had chest pain on the eighth day of hospitalisation. On electrocardiography, simultaneous acute inferior and anterior STEMI were identified. High levels of stress and increased metabolic demand in these patients may lead to concomitant thrombosis of different coronary arteries, presenting with two different STEMIs.","Yolcu, Mustafa; Gunesdogdu, Fusun; Bektas, Metin; Bayirli, Derya Turan; Serefhanoglu, Kivanc",Cardiovasc J Afr,,328

We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the dynamics and influencing factors of HBsAg. METHODS: Literature search was conducted through PubMed from January 1995 to May 2015 for papers reporting HBsAg in patients receiving various anti-viral treatments. We conducted weighted linear regression to select for potential influencing factors on maximum HBsAg loss percentage, and subgroup analysis to calculate the pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss and seroconversion percentage following treatment of interferon (IFN), nucleoside analogue (NUC), or combination therapies (NUC+IFN), respectively. Study heterogeneity was assessed through sensitivity test and I-square statistics. RESULTS: We collected data from 24 papers involving 6674 adult CHB patients. In most studies, average HBsAg level decreased during treatment but relapsed after treatment cessation, while HBsAg loss or seroconversion percentage continued to increase or remain stable after treatment cessation. No strong relationship was observed between maximum HBsAg change and its baseline level. The pooled estimates of maximum HBsAg loss percentage for IFN (5.3%, 2.7%-7.9%) and NUC+IFN (5.2%, 3.1%-7.4%) were significantly higher than that of NUC (0.93%, 0.29%-1.6%). Higher maximum HBsAg loss percentage is associated with longer peak time. Pooled maximum HBsAg seroconversion percentage estimates were 1.6%, 0.56% and 6.2% for IFN, NUC and NUC+IFN. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to HBsAg lowering, this meta-analysis confirmed the importance of longer treatment duration and addition of IFN, which revealed the potential value of immune-based therapies.","Chen, Yusi; Li, Justin Jinhui; Chen, Rong; Li, Gailing; Ji, Jia",Antivir. ther,,328

The modern world is a world in which the media and social networks play a dominant role in the formation of a certain model of the world in the minds of individuals. Naturally, the consciousness of each person has a certain ""information filter"", the functional ability of which varies greatly depending on the characteristics of the person. The ""strength"" and capacity of this ""filter"" are influenced by many factors, which are the subject of a separate study for psychologists. Thus, let us accept the fact that this ""filter"" exists, and it is he who is responsible for the fact that a person filters all information coming to him in a certain way. And this applies to any information received by a person, including negative information. Most people, having received a portion of negative information - about politics, economics, natural disasters, pandemics, react in a certain way, primarily on an emotional level. For some, the first emotional reaction is gradually extinguished, and the action of the information negatively ends without causing any consequences. For others, a weak information filter allows a reaction in the form of fears, which may exist up to a certain moment, and then either the fear disappears, or, receiving a new informational ""feed"", that is, a new portion of negativity, increases. © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Bushuyev, S.; Bushuieva, V.; Onyshchenko, S.; Bondar, A.","4th International Workshop on Computer Modeling and Intelligent Systems, CMIS 2021",,328
298555,Staying Connected and Prepared for Collegiate Athletic Competitions During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has extraordinarily impacted global healthcare. Neuro-oncological surgery units have peculiar features that make them highly relevant in the strategic reaction to the pandemic. In this Chinese Society of Neuro-Oncology (CSNO) initiated survey, we appraise the changes implemented in neuro-oncological surgery hospitals across different Asian countries and provide expert recommendations for responses at different stages of the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a 42-question survey of the early experience of neuro-oncological surgery practice in hospitals across different Asian countries on April 1, 2020, with responses closed on April 18, 2020. RESULTS: 144 hospitals completed the questionnaire. Most were in WHO post-peak phase of the pandemic and reported a median reduction in neuro-oncological surgery volume of 25-50%. Most (67.4%) resumed elective surgery in only COVID-19 negative patients;11.1% performed only emergency cases irrespective of COVID-19 status;2.1% suspended all surgical activity. Ninety-one (63.2%) relocated personnel from neurosurgery to other departments. Fifty-two (36.1%) hospitals suspended post-operative adjuvant therapy and 94 (65.2%) instituted different measures to administer post-operative adjuvant therapy. Majority (59.0%) of the hospitals suspended research activity. Most (70%) respondents anticipate that current neurosurgery restrictions will continue to remain for > 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the respondents to our survey reported reduced neuro-oncological surgery activity, policy modification, personnel reallocation, and curtailment of educational/research activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistent widespread interruption of surgical neuro-oncology in even post-peak phases of the pandemic raises serious concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic on neuro-oncological patients and highlights the essence of timely measures for pandemic preparedness, patient triage, and workforce protection.","Hameed, N U Farrukh; Ma, Yixin; Zhen, Zili; Wu, Shuai; Feng, Rui; Li, Weiping; Huang, Guodong; Wu, Jinsong; Chen, Zhongping",BMC Surg,,328

299945,Covid-19 and Domestic Violence: an Indirect Path to Social and Economic Crisis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To understand National Health Service (NHS) staff experiences of working in critical care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews and rapid analysis, interpreted using Baehr's sociological lens of 'communities of fate'. PARTICIPANTS: Forty NHS staff working in critical care, including 21 nurses, 10 doctors and advanced critical care practitioners, 4 allied health professionals, 3 operating department practitioners and 2 ward clerks. Participants were interviewed between August and October 2020; we purposefully sought the experiences of trained and experienced critical care staff and those who were redeployed. SETTING: Four hospitals in the UK. RESULTS: COVID-19 presented staff with a situation of extreme stress, duress and social emergency, leading to a shared set of experiences which we have characterised as a community of fate. This involved not only fear and dread of working in critical care, but also a collective sense of duty and vocation. Caring for patients and families involved changes to usual ways of working, revolving around: reorganisation of space and personnel, personal protective equipment, lack of evidence for treating COVID-19, inability for families to be physically present, and the trauma of witnessing extreme patient acuity and death on a large scale. The stress and isolation of working in critical care during COVID-19 was mitigated by strong teamwork, camaraderie, pride and fulfilment. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has changed working practices in critical care and profoundly affected staff physically, mentally and emotionally. Attention needs to be paid to the social and organisational conditions in which individuals work, addressing both practical resourcing and the interpersonal dynamics of critical care provision.","Montgomery, Catherine M; Humphreys, Sally; McCulloch, Corrienne; Docherty, Annemarie B; Sturdy, Steve; Pattison, Natalie",BMJ Open,,328

302133,Aging and emotion regulation during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Objective: R0, the number of cases resulting from one infectious person in a susceptible population, is a common metric in infectious disease research. Newly-developed methods for real-time approximations (Rt) offer promise for monitoring COVID-19 trends using real-world data. The objective was to compare available methods of calculating Rt and understand drivers in variability, using available regional public surveillance data. Methods: Longitudinal public health data describing infections, recoveries, and deaths from New Jersey (NJ), British Columbia (BC), and Ontario were visualized. Two methods for calculating Rt, by Cori et al. (growth in cases) and Contreras et al. (cases, recoveries, deaths), were implemented and compared. The sensitivity of estimated Rt parameter to changes in infection rates, duration of infection, and mortality rates was investigated, and the relationship with public health measures explored visually. Results: Rates of COVID-19 infections per 100,000 residents from May to December ranged from 2,856 (NJ) to 622 (BC), and total cases ranged from 253,696 (NJ) to 31,782 (BC). Using Cori et al. method, Rt estimates ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 across jurisdictions;even with large rises in incidence, estimates remained relatively stable. In contrast, Rt estimates based on Contreras et al. markedly fluctuated. Estimates for BC and Ontario were generally 0.5 to 3, but exceeded 10 for NJ for much of the observation period due to limited reporting of recoveries. Conclusions: Rt estimates for COVID-19, calculated using two recent methods, vary;and each method considers different parameters in its derivation. The Cori et al. method may be better suited to tracking COVID-19 burden in jurisdictions with incomplete recovery data reported;the choice of measure should depend on accuracy and timing of the reporting of required metrics. Accurate estimates and visualizations of Rt will be informative for understanding changing COVID-19 burden and comparing the impact of interventions across jurisdictions.","Emerson, S.; Johnston, K.; Howarth, A.; Schneider, J.; Friesen, M.; Szabo, S.",Value in Health,,328

Many mathematical models have been developed to understand and predict the infectiousness of COVID-19. We aim to summarize these models to inform efforts to manage the current outbreak. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of science, EMBASE, bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, Preprints, and National Knowledge Infrastructure (Chinese database) for relevant studies published between 1 December 2019 and 21 February 2020. References were screened for additional publications. Crucial indicators were extracted and analysed. We also built a mathematical model for the evolution of the epidemic in Wuhan that synthesised extracted indicators. Results: Fifty-two articles involving 75 mathematical or statistical models were included in our systematic review. The overall median basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.78–5.13], which dropped to a controlled reproduction number (Rc) of 1.88 (IQR 1.41–2.24) after city lockdown. The median incubation and infectious periods were 5.90 (IQR 4.78–6.25) and 9.94 (IQR 3.93–13.50) days, respectively. The median case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.9% (IQR 2.3–5.4%). Our mathematical model showed that, in Wuhan, the peak time of infection is likely to be March 2020 with a median size of 98,333 infected cases (range 55,225–188,284). The earliest elimination of ongoing transmission is likely to be achieved around 7 May 2020. Conclusions: Our analysis found a sustained Rcand prolonged incubation/ infectious periods, suggesting COVID-19 is highly infectious. Although interventions in China have been effective in controlling secondary transmission, sustained global efforts are needed to contain an emerging pandemic. Alternative interventions can be explored using modelling studies to better inform policymaking as the outbreak continues.","Lin, Yi-Fan; Duan, Qibin; Zhou, Yiguo; Yuan, Tanwei; Li, Peiyang; Fitzpatrick, Thomas; Fu, Leiwen; Feng, Anping; Luo, Ganfeng; Zhan, Yuewei; Liang, Bowen; Fan, Song; Lu, Yong; Wang, Bingyi; Wang, Zhenyu; Zhao, Heping; Gao, Yanxiao; Li, Meijuan; Chen, Dahui; Chen, Xiaoting; Ao, Yunlong; Li, Linghua; Cai, Weiping; Du, Xiangjun; Shu, Yuelong; Zou, Huachun",Front.

The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to describe the content of COVID-19 material on TikTok. Methods A total of 100 videos posted under the hashtag #Coronavirus were included in this study along with all (n=17) posts uploaded by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results Overall, these videos were viewed 1,194,081,700 times. The most commonly cited topics included anxiety (14.5%) with more than 190.6 million views and quarantine (10.3%) with 106.6 million views. Fewer than 10% of videos mentioned how the virus is transmitted, symptoms, and prevention. WHO videos more often focused on viral transmission and symptoms but covered these topics in fewer than 10% of the videos. Conclusions Although research suggests that cases of COVID-19 may be less severe in those under 18 years of age, social distancing remains paramount due to the possibility of transmission even in those with minimal or no symptoms. For young adults in particular, the WHO suggests staying connected through social media and making every attempt to stay positive. TikTok has the potential, not only to convey important health information, but to address these aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic as well.","Basch, Corey H; Hillyer, Grace C; Jaime, Christie",Int. j. adolesc. med. health,,328

Our aim is to assess gastroenterologist's assistance in COVID-19 by assessing mortality, ICU admission, and length of stay, and seek for risk factors for in-hospital mortality and longer hospital stay. METHODS: A total of 41 COVID-19 patients assisted by gastroenterologist (GI cohort) and 137 assisted by pulmonologist, internal medicine practitioners, and infectious disease specialists (COVID expert cohort) during October-November 2020 were prospectively collected. Clinical, demographic, imaging, and laboratory markers were collected and compared between both cohorts. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed to search for risk factors of mortality and longer hospital stays. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients died (15.1%), 11 were admitted to ICU (6.1%). There were no differences between cohorts in mortality (14.6% vs 15.4%;p = 0.90), ICU admission (12.1% vs 4%;p = 0.13), and length of stay (6.67 ± 4 vs 7.15 ± 4.5 days; p = 0.58). PaO2/FiO2 on admission (OR 0.991;CI95% 0.984-0.998) and age > 70 (OR 17.54;CI95% 3.93-78.22) were independently related to mortality. Age > 70, history of malignancy, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were related to longer hospital stays (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, p = 0.04, p = 0.02 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 assistance was similar between gastroenterologist and COVID experts when assessing mortality, ICU admission, and length of stay. Age>70 and decreased PaO2/FiO2 on admission were independent risk factors of mortality.

In this prolonged pandemic, nurses and midwives working at the frontline face multiple ethical problems, including their obligation to care for their patients and the risk for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Despite the frequency of emergencies in Africa, there is a paucity of literature on ethical issues during epidemics. Furthermore, nursing regulatory bodies in African countries such as Kenya have primarily adopted a Western code of ethics that may not reflect the realities of the healthcare systems and cultural context in which nurses and midwives care for patients. In this article, we discuss the tension between nurses' and midwives' duty of care and resource allocation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to clarify nurses' and midwives' rights and responsibilities, especially in the current political setting, limited resources, and ambiguous professional codes of ethics that guide their practice.","Shaibu, Sheila; Kimani, Rachel Wangari; Shumba, Constance; Maina, Rose; Ndirangu, Eunice; Kambo, Isabel",Nurs Ethics,,328

METHODS: This review synthesized the literature on the mental health sequelae for health workers during major pandemics and epidemics that occurred in the 21st century (severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, and swine flu) and interventions used to address related mental health sequelae. PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched with terms related to these epidemics/pandemics. RESULTS: Of 3,876 articles retrieved, 94 were included in this review. Across these studies, most health workers exhibited some adverse psychological experiences during outbreaks, with stress and anxiety being most common. Psychological distress decreased over time. Some studies reported insomnia, burnout, and posttraumatic stress for a subset of individuals up to 3 years after the disease outbreak. Few interventions have been implemented to address providers' mental health needs, and these strategies have not been evaluated systematically. CONCLUSIONS: Systems-level interventions may alleviate distress for most providers without the need for specialized mental health intervention. Psychotherapeutic support and referral to specialty care should be available to health workers with severe and intense adverse psychological outcomes during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions are urgently needed to better serve health workers both during and following epidemics/pandemics.","Magill, Elizabeth; Siegel, Zoe; Pike, Kathleen M",Psychiatr Serv,,328

The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine that prevents severe forms of tuberculosis is getting more attention in this scenario. The objective of our study was to determine the association between BCG vaccine coverage and incidence of COVID-19 at a national-level across the Globe. Methods: The data of 160 countries were included in the study. Meta-regression was done to estimate the difference in the incidence of COVID-19 cases between countries with BCG vaccination coverage. BCG coverage was categorized as &#8804;70%, >70% and no vaccination. The analyses were carried out by adjusting for factors such as population density, income group, latitude, and percentage of the total population under age groups 15-64 and above 65 years of each country. Results: The countries that had &#8804;70% coverage of BCG vaccine reported 6.5 (95% CI: -8.4 to -4.5) less COVID-19 infections per 10,000 population as compared to countries that reported no coverage. Those that had >70% coverage reported 10.1 (95% CI: -11.4 to -8.7) less infections per 10,000 population compared to those with no BCG countries. Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that BCG is associated with reduced COVID-19 infections if the BCG vaccine coverage is over 70%. The region-wise analyses also suggested similar findings, except the Middle East and North African region.","Joy, Melvin; Malavika, B; Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Sudarsanam, Thambu David; Jeyaseelan, L",,,328

This global pandemic has pushed the healthcare system and restricted the movement of people and succumbing of the available therapeutics utterly warrants the development of a potential vaccine to contest the deadly situation. In the present study, highly efficacious, immunodominant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes were predicted by advanced immunoinformatics assays using the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2, generating a robust and specific immune response with convincing immunological parameters (Antigenicity, TAP affinity, MHC binder) engendering an efficient viral vaccine. The molecular docking studies show strong binding of the CTL construct with MHC-1 and host membrane specific TLR2 receptors. The molecular dynamics simulation in an explicit system confirmed the stable and robust binding of CTL epitope with TLR2. Steep magnitude RMSD variation and compelling residual fluctuations existed in terminal residues and various loops of the ß linker segments of TLR2-epitope (residues 105-156 and 239-254) to about 0.4 nm. The reduced Rg value (3.3 nm) and stagnant SASA analysis (275 nm/S2/N after 8 ns and 5 ns) for protein surface and its orientation in the exposed and buried regions suggests more compactness due to the strong binding interaction of the epitope. The CTL vaccine candidate establishes a high capability to elicit the critical immune regulators, like T-cells and memory cells as proven by the in silico immunization assays and can be further corroborated through in vitro and in vivo assays.","Kumar, Neeraj; Admane, Nikita; Kumari, Anchala; Sood, Damini; Grover, Sonam; Prajapati, Vijay Kumar; Chandra, Ramesh; Grover, Abhinav",Sci Rep,,328

312933,Clinical pearls to managing men's health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Regulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression is critical in the face of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus infections. Many viruses, including coronavirus and influenza virus, wreak havoc on the control of cytokine expression, leading to the formation of detrimental cytokine storms. Understanding the regulation and interplay between inflammatory cytokines is critical to the identification of targets involved in controlling the induction of cytokine expression. In this study, we focused on how the antiviral cytokine interleukin-27 (IL-27) regulates signal transduction downstream of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8 ligation, which recognize endosomal single-stranded RNA. Given that IL-27 alters bacterial-sensing TLR expression on myeloid cells and can inhibit replication of single-stranded RNA viruses, we investigated whether IL-27 affects expression and function of TLR7 and TLR8. Analysis of IL-27-treated THP-1 monocytic cells and THP-1-derived macrophages revealed changes in mRNA and protein expression of TLR7 and TLR8. Although treatment with IL-27 enhanced TLR7 expression, only TLR8-mediated cytokine secretion was amplified. Furthermore, we demonstrated that imiquimod, a TLR7 agonist, inhibited cytokine and chemokine production induced by a TLR8 agonist, TL8-506. Delineating the immunomodulatory role of IL-27 on TLR7 and TLR8 responses provides insight into how myeloid cell TLR-mediated responses are regulated during virus infection.","Odoardi, Natalya; Kourko, Olena; Petes, Carlene; Basta, Sameh; Gee, Katrina",J Innate Immun,,328

314774,[Health-promoting work design for telework in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic],2021,"BACKGROUND: The clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are highly variable. Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia in others. This can lead to some people requiring intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of smell or taste, and signs such as oxygen saturation are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19, or select patients for further testing. This is an update of this review, the first version of which published in July 2020. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: For this review iteration we undertook electronic searches up to 15 July 2020 in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were eligible if they included patients with clinically suspected COVID-19, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies in hospitalised patients were only included if symptoms and signs were recorded on admission or at presentation. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 44 studies including 26,884 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 varied from 3% to 71% with a median of 21%. There were three studies from primary care settings (1824 participants), nine studies from outpatient testing centres (10,717 participants), 12 studies performed in hospital outpatient wards (5061 participants), seven studies in hospitalised patients (1048 participants), 10 studies in the emergency department (3173 participants), and three studies in which the setting was not specified (5061 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild from severe COVID-19, so we present the results for all disease severities together. Fifteen studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. This may have especially influenced the sensitivity of those features used in referral protocols, such as fever and cough. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional 12 studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. This makes it very difficult to judge the validity of the diagnostic accuracy of the signs and symptoms from these included studies. The applicability of the results of this review update improved in comparison with the original review. A greater proportion of studies included participants who presented to outpatient settings, which is where the majority of clinical assessments for COVID-19 take place. However, still none of the studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 84 signs and symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. Only cough (25 studies) and fever (7 studies) had a pooled sensitivity of at least 50% but specificities were moderate to low. Cough had a sensitivity of 67.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 59.8% to 74.1%) and specificity of 35.0% (95% CI 28.7% to 41.9%). Fever had a sensitivity of 53.8% (95% CI 35.0% to 71.7%) and a specificity of 67.4% (95% CI 53.3% to 78.9%). The pooled positive likelihood ratio of cough was only 1.04 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.11) and that of fever 1.65 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.93). Anosmia alone (11 studies), ageusia alone (6 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had sensitivities below 50% but specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a pooled sensitivity of 28.0% (95% CI 17.7% to 41.3%) and a specificity of 93.4% (95% CI 88.3% to 96.4%). Ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 24.8% (95% CI 12.4% to 43.5%) and a specificity of 91.4% (95% CI 81.3% to 96.3%). Anosmia or ageusia had a pooled sensitivity of 41.0% (95% CI 27.0% to 56.6%) and a specificity of 90.5% (95% CI 81.2% to 95.4%). The pooled positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.25 (95% CI 3.17 to 5.71) and 4.31 (95% CI 3.00 to 6.18) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The pooled positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was only 2.88 (95% CI 2.02 to 4.09). Only two studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining fever and cough with other symptoms. These combinations had a specificity above 80%, but at the cost of very low sensitivity (< 30%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The majority of individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic accuracy, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out COVID-19. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for COVID-19. The presence of fever or cough, given their high sensitivities, may also be useful to identify people for further testing. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19, are still urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions.","Struyf, Thomas; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Takwoingi, Yemisi; Davenport, Clare; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Spijker, René; Hooft, Lotty; Emperador, Devy; Domen, Julie; Horn, Sebastiaan R A; Van den Bruel, Ann",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,328

The present study aims to investigate the effect of wildfire allied pollutants, particulate matter (PM-2.5 µm), and carbon monoxide (CO) on the dynamics of daily cases and deaths due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in San Francisco, USA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we selected San Francisco, one of the regions affected by the wildfires allied pollution in California, USA. The data on the COVID-19 pandemic in San Francisco, including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from Worldometer Web. The daily environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM-2.5 µm) and carbon monoxide (CO) were recorded from the metrological web ""BAAQMD"". The daily cases, deaths, particulate matter (PM-2.5 µm) and carbon monoxide were documented from the date of the occurrence of the first case of (SARS-CoV-2) in San Francisco, CA, USA, from March 20, 2020 to Sept 16, 2020. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM2.5 µm) and the number of daily cases (r=0.203, p=0.007), cumulative cases (r=0.567, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.562, p<0.001); whereas the PM2.5 µm and daily deaths had no relationship (r=-0.015, p=0.842). In addition, CO was also positively correlated with cumulative cases (r=0.423, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.315, p<0.001), however, CO had no correlation with the number of daily cases (r=0.134, p=0.075) and daily deaths (r=0.030, p=0.693). In San Francisco, one micrometer (µg/m3) increase in PM2.5 caused an increase in the daily cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths of SARS-COV-2 by 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, with a 1 part per million (ppm) increase in carbon monoxide level, the daily number of cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths increased by 5%, 9.3% and 5.3%, respectively. On the other hand, CO and daily deaths had no significant relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The wildfire allied pollutants, particulate matter PM-2.5µm and CO have a positive association with an increased number of SARS-COV-2 daily cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths in San Francisco. The metrological, disaster management and health officials must implement the necessary policies and assist in planning to minimize the wildfire incidences, environmental pollution and COVID-19 pandemic both at regional and international levels.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Alessa, O M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,328

This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of economic evaluations of obesity prevention interventions with a telehealth or eHealth intervention component. A systematic search of six academic databases was conducted through October 2020. Studies were included if they reported full economic evaluations of interventions aimed at preventing overweight or obesity, or interventions aimed at improving obesity-related behaviors, with at least one intervention component delivered by telephone (telehealth) or web-based technology (eHealth). Findings were reported narratively, based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. Twenty-seven economic evaluations were included from 20 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Sixteen of the included interventions had a telehealth component, whereas 11 had an eHealth component. Seventeen interventions were evaluated using cost-utility analysis, five with cost-effectiveness analysis, and five undertook both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses. Only eight cost-utility analyses reported that the intervention was cost-effective. Comparison of results from cost-effectiveness analyses was limited by heterogeneity in methods and outcome units reported. The evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of interventions with a telehealth or eHealth delivery component is currently inconclusive. Although obesity prevention telehealth and eHealth interventions are gaining popularity, more evidence is required on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.","Brown, Vicki; Tran, Huong; Downing, Katherine L; Hesketh, Kylie D; Moodie, Marj",Obes. rev,,328

We reviewed the impacts of Big Events with relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic on drug-related risk and harms and access to drug treatment and harm reduction services. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods literature relating to the following Big Events: respiratory infection pandemics, natural disasters, financial crises, and heroin shortages. Included studies reported data on changes to risks, harms, and/or service provisioning for people who use illicit drugs (other than cannabis) in the context of these Big Events. Searches were conducted in PubMed in May 2020, and two reviewers screened studies for inclusion. Peer-reviewed studies published in English or French were included. We used a narrative synthesis approach and mapped risk pathways identified in the literature. RESULTS: No studies reporting on respiratory infection pandemics were identified. Twelve studies reporting on natural disaster outcomes noted marked disruption to drug markets, increased violence and risk of drug-related harm, and significant barriers to service provision caused by infrastructure damage. Five studies of the 2008 global financial crisis indicated increases in the frequency of drug use and associated harms as incomes and service funding declined. Finally, 17 studies of heroin shortages noted increases in heroin price and adulteration, potentiating drug substitutions and risk behaviors, as well as growing demand for drug treatment. CONCLUSION: Current evidence reveals numerous risk pathways and service impacts emanating from Big Events. Risk pathway maps derived from this literature provide groundwork for future research and policy analyses, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the findings, we recommend responding to the pandemic with legislative and financial support for the flexible delivery of harm reduction services, opioid agonist treatment, and mental health care.","Zolopa, Camille; Hoj, Stine; Bruneau, Julie; Meeson, Julie-Soleil; Minoyan, Nanor; Raynault, Marie-France; Makarenko, Iuliia; Larney, Sarah",Int J Drug Policy,,328

Here we reflect on how our integrated organisational model has faced the first impact of the pandemic and describe what challenges, opportunities and lessons have emerged. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The organisational model of the Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank (Banc de Sang i Teixits, BST) is described. The new scenario was managed by following international recommendations and considering the pandemic in a context of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), allowing rapid measures to be taken. These aimed to: ensure donor safety, promote proper responses to patients' needs, ensure the health and well-being of personnel, and prepare for future scenarios. RESULTS: The BST has adapted its activities to the changes in demand. No shortage of any product or service occurred. Donor acceptance, safety and wellbeing were maintained except for tissue donation, which almost completely stopped. To support the health system, several activities have been promoted: large-scale convalescent plasma (CP) production, clinical trials with CP and mesenchymal stromal cells, massive COVID-19 diagnoses, and participation in co-operative research and publications. Haemovigilance is running smoothly and no adverse effects have been detected among donors or patients. DISCUSSION: Several elements have proven to be critical when addressing the pandemic scenario: a) the early creation of a crisis committee in combination with technical recommendations and the recognition of a VUCA scenario; b) identification of the strategies described; c) the integrated donor-to-patient organisational model; d) active Research and Development (R&D); and e) the flexibility of the staff. It is essential to underline the importance of the need for centralised management, effective contingency strategies, and early collaboration with peers.","Garcia-Lopez, Joan; Delgadillo, Joaquin; Vilarrodona, Anna; Querol, Sergi; Ovejo, Joan; Coll, Ruth; Millan, Anna; Madrigal, Alejandro; Soria, Gloria; Vidal, Francisco; Vives, Joaquim; Herrero, María J; Lopez, Isabel; Sauleda, Silvia; Contreras, Enric; Grifols, Joan Ramon; Guasch, Rosa; Tahull, Elisabet; Puig, Lluís; Masip, Aurora; Argelagués, Enric; Muñiz-Diaz, Eduardo",Blood Transfus,,328

It is a long-term change in weather patterns that characterises different regions of the world. The warming effect in the earth's atmosphere has dramatically increased through the influence of some heat-taping gases emitted by various human activities, especially fossil fuel burning. The more the input of such gases, the more will be the warming effect in the coming times. Global climate change is already visible in various parts of the larger ecosystems like forests, fisheries, biodiversity, and agriculture; however, it is now also influencing the supply of freshwater, human health, and well-being. This paper reviews climate change drivers, its global scenario, major global events, and assessing climate change impacts. The most daunting problem of economic and ecological risks, along with the threats to humanity, is also discussed. The paper further reviews the species' vulnerability to climate change and the heat waves and human migration vis-à-vis climate change.

The circulation of new variants with emerging clinical characteristics requires more studies focusing the impact of preexisting health conditions on outcome of COVID-19 accurately. AIMS: Main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) on disease prognosis and severe health outcomes among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 799 patients with COVID-19 during December 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020 in Bangladesh. Logistic regression analysis was performed for age, sex, diabetes, CVD and symptoms on fatality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to predict the survival rate. RESULTS: Fatality was detected in 40% (318 of 799) patients with COVID-19. Among 318 fatalities, 90.6% were detected in patients with CVD and 74.5% in patients with diabetes. Case fatality rate was highest in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes (94, 184 of 195). Fever (91%) and dry cough (71%) were the most frequent symptoms. CVD (42.2%), diabetes (32.7%) and obesity (18%) were prevalent. The highest odds of risk was detected in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes (OR: 6.98, 95% CI, 4.21 to 7.34). Female patients had the highest survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 318 fatality was seen in 799 patients with COVID-19.

Coexisting CVD may influence the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. AIMS: To analyze the impact of CVD and use of cardiovascular drugs on the in-hospital course and mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively studied data for consecutive patients admitted to our hospital, with COVID-19 between March 6th and October 15th, 2020. RESULTS: 1729 patients (median (Q1 - Q3) age 63 (50-75) years;women 48.8%) were included. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 12.9%. The most prevalent CVD was arterial hypertension (56.1%), followed by hyperlipidemia (27.4%), diabetes mellitus (DM) (25.7%), coronary artery disease (16.8%), heart failure (HF) (10.3%), atrial fibrillation (13.5%), and stroke (8%). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) were used in 25.0% of patients, beta-blockers in 40.7%, statins in 15.6%, and antiplatelet therapy in 19.9%.

In particular, cash transfer programmes are currently being adapted or expanded in various low-income and middle-income countries to support individuals and families during the pandemic. We argue that the current crisis offers an opportunity for these programmes to focus on susceptible young people (aged 15-24 years), including those with mental health conditions. Young people living in poverty and with mental health problems are at particular risk of experiencing adverse health, wellbeing, and employment outcomes with long-term consequences. They are also at risk of developing mental health conditions during this pandemic. To support this population, cash transfer programmes should not only address urgent needs around food security and survival but expand their focus to address longer-term mental health impacts of pandemics and economic crises. Such an approach could help support young people's future life chances and break the vicious cycle between mental illness and poverty that spirals many young people into both socioeconomic and mental health disadvantage.","Bauer, Annette; Garman, Emily; McDaid, David; Avendano, Mauricio; Hessel, Philipp; Díaz, Yadira; Araya, Ricardo; Lund, Crick; Malvasi, Paulo; Matijasevich, Alicia; Park, A-La; Paula, Cristiane Silvestre; Ziebold, Carolina; Zimmerman, Annie; Evans-Lacko, Sara",Lancet Psychiatry,,328

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has evoked a tremendous investigative effort primarily centered on clinical studies. However, several animal SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 models have been developed and pre-clinical findings aimed at supporting clinical evidence rapidly emerge. In this review, we characterize the existing animal models exposing their relevance and limitations as well as outline their utility in COVID-19 drug and vaccine development. Concurrently, we summarize the status of clinical trial research and discuss the novel tactics utilized in the largest multi-center trials aiming to accelerate generation of reliable results that may subsequently shape COVID-19 clinical treatment practices. We also highlight areas of improvement for animal studies in order to elevate their translational utility. In pandemics, to optimize the use of strained resources in a short time-frame, optimizing and strengthening the synergy between the preclinical and clinical domains is pivotal.","Winkler, Martin S; Skirecki, Tomasz; Brunkhorst, Frank M; Cajander, Sara; Cavaillon, Jean-Marc; Ferrer, Ricard; Flohé, Stefanie B; García-Salido, Alberto; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Girardis, Massimo; Kox, Matthijs; Lachmann, Gunnar; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Netea, Mihai G; Spinetti, Thibaud; Schefold, Joerg C; Torres, Antoni; Uhle, Florian; Venet, Fabienne; Weis, Sebastian; Scherag, André; Rubio, Ignacio; Osuchowski, Marcin F",EBioMedicine,,328

323417,The Brazilian Government's mistakes in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"One year after the first human case of SARS-CoV-2, two nanomedicine-based mRNA vaccines have been fast-tracked, developed, and have received emergency use authorization throughout the globe with more vaccine approvals on the heels of these first two. Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compositions use nanotechnology-enabled formulations. A silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that the fast-tracked vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 has advanced the clinical translation pathway for nanomedicine drug delivery systems. The laboratory science of lipid-based nanoparticles was ready and rose to the clinical challenge of rapid vaccine development. The successful development and fast tracking of SARS-CoV-2 nanomedicine vaccines has exciting implications for the future of nanotechnology-enabled drug and gene delivery; it demonstrates that nanomedicine is necessary and critical to the successful delivery of advanced molecular therapeutics such as nucleic acids, it is establishing the precedent of safety and the population effect of phase four clinical trials, and it is laying the foundation for the clinical translation of more complex, non-lipid nanomedicines. The development, fast-tracking, and approval of SARS-CoV-2 nanotechnology-based vaccines has transformed the seemingly daunting challenges for clinically translating nanomedicines into measurable hurdles that can be overcome. Due to the tremendous scientific achievements that have occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, years, perhaps even decades, have been streamlined for certain translational nanomedicines.","Milane, Lara; Amiji, Mansoor",Drug deliv. transl. res.

323481,Health surveillance during covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Caregiving has been associated with increased levels of fear and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of studies that analyze when the relationship between fear and PTSS occur, using informal caregiving as a moderator variable. To explore this moderating role, we conducted a cross-sectional online study between November 2020 and January 2021. A total of 503 men and women from the Spanish general population completed the survey. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data, fear of COVID-19, PTSS symptoms, and current psychological history were assessed. Prevalence of informal caregiving in the sample was 16.5%. Increased levels of fear and PTSS were found in caregivers compared to non-caregivers. Female gender and high number of COVID-19 related risk factors was also associated with fear and PTSS severity. The moderation analyses showed an interaction effect between caregiving and fear of COVID-19 when predicting PTSS symptoms. Particularly, results showed that informal caregivers reported greater PTSS symptoms, when compared to non-caregivers with same levels of fear of COVID-19. This evidence suggests that being a caregiver could increase the fear's impact on PTSS severity in the context of pandemics. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.","Carballo, José Luis; Coloma-Carmona, Ainhoa; Arteseros-Bañón, Sara; Pérez-Jover, Virtudes",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,328

Pre-symptomatic spread and high false negative rates for testing may make it difficult to stop viral spread. Here, we develop a stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 in a university sized population, considering the dynamics of both viral load and false negative rate of tests on the ability of testing to combat viral spread. Reported dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to an apparent false negative rate from ~ 17 to ~ 48%. Nonuniform distributions of viral load and false negative rate lead to higher requirements for frequency and fraction of population tested in order to bring the apparent Reproduction number (Rt) below 1. Thus, it is important to consider non-uniform dynamics of viral spread and false negative rate in order to model effective testing plans.","Jarvis, Katherine F; Kelley, Joshua B",Sci Rep,,328

On the other hand, healthcare resources should be spared to the maximum extent possible during a pandemic. Indeed, while thyroid nodules are very common, only a small percentage are cancerous and, in turn, most thyroid cancers are indolent in nature. Accordingly, diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules, thyroid surgery for either benign or malignant thyroid nodules and radioiodine treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers may be safely postponed during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Appropriate patient counselling, however, is mandatory and red flags should be carefully identified prompting immediate evaluation and treatment as appropriate. For these selected cases diagnostic work-up (e.g. ultrasound, scintigraphy, fine-needle aspiration), surgery and radioiodine therapy may proceed despite the threat of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, after an individual risk-benefit analysis.","Vrachimis, Alexis; Iakovou, Ioannis; Giannoula, Evanthia; Giovanella, Luca",Eur J Endocrinol,,328

A continuing need for diagnostic tools is a must to contain its spread. Till now, the gold standard method, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the precise procedure to detect the virus. However, SARS-CoV-2 may escape RT-PCR detection for several reasons. The development of well-designed, specific and sensitive serological test like enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is needed. This EIA can stand alone or work side by side with RT-PCR. In this study, we developed several EIAs including plates that are coated with either specially designed SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or surface recombinant proteins. Each protein type can separately detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. For each EIAs, the cut-off value, specificity and sensitivity were determined utilizing RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 and pre-pandemic healthy and other viruses-infected sera. Also, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to define the specificities and sensitivities of the optimized assay. The in-house EIAs were validated by comparing against commercial EIA kits. All in-house EIAs showed high specificity (98-99%) and sensitivity (97.8-98.9%) for the detection of IgG/IgM against RBD and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. From these results, the developed Anti-RBD and anti-N IgG and IgM antibodies EIAs can be used as a specific and sensitive tool to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, calculate the burden of disease and case fatality rates.","Ibrahim, Essam H; Ghramh, Hamed A; Kilany, Mona",J King Saud Univ Sci,,328

Many institutions have instituted mandatory preoperative SARS-CoV-2 PCR nasopharyngeal swab (NS) testing in patients who are low risk for COVID-19 prior to elective cases. This method, however, is challenging as the sensitivity, specificity, and overall reliability of testing remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the concordance of a negative NS in low risk preoperative patients with lower airway bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens obtained from the same patients. METHODS: We prospectively sent intraoperative lower airway BAL samples collected within 48 h of a negative mandatory preoperative NS for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. All adult patients undergoing a scheduled bronchoscopic procedure for any reason were enrolled, including elective and nonelective cases. RESULTS: One-hundred eighty-nine patients were included. All BAL specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2 indicative of 100% concordance between testing modalities. CONCLUSIONS: These results are promising and suggest that preoperative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 testing provides adequate screening to rule out active COVID-19 infection prior to OR cases in a population characterized as low risk by negative symptom screening. This information can be used for both pre-procedural screening and when reintroducing trainees into the workforce.","Oberg, Catherine L; Ronaghi, Reza; Folch, Erik E; Channick, Colleen L; He, Tao; Susanto, Irawan; Oh, Scott S",Respiration,,328

325007,LGBTQ populations: Psychologically vulnerable communities in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of elective cancer operations performed. Cancer patients are felt to be a high-risk group for COVID-19, and therefore, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of operating during this time; however, the potential risk of cancer progression if untreated must also be considered. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the incidence of COVID-19 post-operatively in patients undergoing elective cancer surgery of all types. METHODS: Data were collected on all patients who had an elective therapeutic cancer operation in a single large district general hospital, where standard COVID-19 precautions were in place, between 01/02/2020 and 27/4/2020, Follow-up was for a minimum of 2 weeks post-discharge. The primary outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 during the follow-up period. RESULTS: A total of 621 elective cancer surgeries, from a range of specialities, were performed during the study period, with 55% (n = 341) being done as day cases. None of the patients were positive for COVID-19 post-operatively using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of COVID-19 following elective cancer surgery in this group of high-risk patients appears to be minimal in this study. With further precautions being introduced to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, an increase in the rate of elective cancer surgery should be a current priority for all hospitals where possible.","Ji, Chenchen; Singh, Kaushiki; Luther, Alison Zoe; Agrawal, Avi",World J Surg,,328

325201,UK medical students graduating early to work during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"We investigate spreading and recovery of disease in a square lattice, and in particular, emphasize the role of the initial distribution of infected patches in the network, on the progression of an endemic and initiation of a recovery process, if any, due to migration of both the susceptible and infected hosts. The disease starts in the lattice with three possible initial distribution patterns of infected and infection-free sites, infected core patches (ICP), infected peripheral patches (IPP) and randomly distributed infected patches (RDIP). Our results show that infection spreads monotonically in the lattice with increasing migration without showing any sign of recovery in the ICP case. In the IPP case, it follows a similar monotonic progression with increasing migration, however, a self-organized healing process starts for higher migration, leading the lattice to full recovery at a critical rate of migration. Encouragingly, for the initial RDIP arrangement, chances of recovery are much higher with a lower rate of critical migration. An eigenvalue based semi-analytical study is made to determine the critical migration rate for realizing a stable infection-free lattice. The initial fraction of infected patches and the force of infection play significant roles in the self-organized recovery. They follow an exponential law, for the RDIP case, that governs the recovery process. For the frustrating case of ICP arrangement, we propose a random rewiring of links in the lattice allowing long-distance migratory paths that effectively initiate a recovery process. Global prevalence of infection thereby declines and progressively improves with the rewiring probability that follows a power law with the critical migration and leads to the birth of emergent infection-free networks.","Saha, Suman; Mishra, Arindam; Dana, Syamal K.; Hens, Chittaranjan; Bairagi, Nandadulal",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14229v1.pdf,328

Traditional methods are either insufficient to cope with the heterogeneous nature of uncertainty or inadequate to perform well with unknown mathematical models. In this paper, we propose using multi-layer convolutional neural networks for empirical uncertainty estimation and feature extraction of nuclear pulse signals. This method is based on deep learning, a recent development of machine learning techniques, which learns the desired mapping function from training data and generalizes to unseen test data. Furthermore, ensemble learning is utilized to estimate the uncertainty originated from trainable parameters of the network and improve the robustness of the whole model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, simulation studies, in comparison with curve fitting, investigate extensive conditions and show its universal applicability. Finally, a case study with the NICA-MPD electromagnetic calorimeter is performed with test beam at DESY, Germany. The uncertainty estimation method successfully detected out-of-distribution samples and also achieved good accuracy in time and energy measurements.","Ai, Pengcheng; Deng, Zhi; Wang, Yi; Shen, Chendi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04975v1.pdf,328

In this study, a sustainable and cost-effective method for the synthesis of lignin-containing cellulose nanocrystals (LCNC) from oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) is presented. This method is able to retain the lignin in EFB and manifest the properties of lignin. The proposed synthesis process is simpler than the conventional method of producing lignin-coated CNC by first removing the lignin to synthesize CNC followed by the re-coating of lignin on the structure. The samples of LCNC were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and water contact angle analysis. In addition, by altering the acid concentration during acid hydrolysis process (53% - 60% H2SO4), both surface hydrophobicity (66.0° - 75.1°) and length of LCNC (467 nm-177 nm) can be altered wherein a higher concentration of acid resulted in a greater contact angle and a shorter length of LCNC. Cost and energy analysis deduced that the proposed synthesis method saved about 62% of the total material cost and 80% less energy as compared to the synthesis of lignin-coated CNC.","Teh, Khai Chyi; Foo, Mei Ling; Ooi, Chien Wei; Leng Chew, Irene Mei",Chemosphere,,328

However, widespread uptake of greywater reuse depends on its acceptability by the population. Previous studies have assessed the implementation costs of greywater reuse technology, and considered its acceptability in principle. Although cost is clearly very important in terms of adopting/installing the technology, the actual perception of greywater reuse is crucial in driving the acceptability of use and the long-term success of the technology. This study uses discrete choice models to quantify, for the first time, the preferences of different socio-economic groups for greywater of different quality (colour, odour) and for different uses inside homes. A stated choice survey that removed the influence of installation costs was developed, and implemented in Santiago, Chile. Although legislation allows greywater use in Santiago, it does not take place at any meaningful scale. Results show that, in decreasing order of preference, there is an overall acceptance for using high quality treated greywater for toilet flushing, laundry, garden irrigation, hand washing and, shower/bathtub use, but not for drinking. When the quality of appearance in terms of colour and odour gets worse, monetary incentives could be needed even for those uses that do not involve human contact. Gender, age, educational level, water expenditure level, and in particular previous knowledge about greywater reuse, are important determinants of acceptability and thus willingness to pay for greywater use; however, their importance varies according to the type of use. Our results provide important insights for understanding the conditions that would precipitate rapid and wide uptake of greywater reuse in cities, and thereby make better use of limited water resources.","Amaris, Gloria; Dawson, Richard; Gironás, Jorge; Hess, Stephane; Ortúzar, Juan de Dios",Water Res,,328

Two days after the introduction of ECMO, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased, chest X-p showed no improvement in pneumonia, and PaO2/FiO2 decreased again. As D-dimer rose and found a blood clot in the ECMO circuit, we had to decide whether to replace the circuit and continue with ECMO or stop ECMO. At this time, the viral load by RT-PCR was drastically reduced to about 1/1750. We decided to continue ECMO therapy and replaced the circuit. The patient's respiratory status subsequently improved and ECMO was stopped on day 21 of onset. In conclusion, viral load measurement by RT-PCR may be one of the indicators for promoting the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.","Sakamaki, Ippei; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Tani, Hideki; Takegoshi, Yusuke; Fukui, Yasutaka; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Wakasugi, Masahiro; Kawagishi, Toshiomi; Kuwano, Hroyuki; Hatano, Tomoya; Shibuya, Tadaki; Okudera, Hiroshi; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",J. infect. chemother,,328

331850,Incarceration and pandemic-related restrictions during COVID-19: An empathic understanding of two worlds,2020,"The transport sector has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting travel behaviors and mobility patterns around the globe. The pandemic has also affected mode choice behavior. This research study modeled the mode choice behavior before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan. Data was collected through an online questionnaire survey consisting of questions about socio-economic characteristics, factors affecting mode choice, and mode chosen for shorter as well as longer distances for both before and during COVID-19 pandemic situations. The results indicated that public transport use declined, whereas walking and bicycling slightly increased during the pandemic. The respondents placed more priority on safety and security, comfort, cleanliness, infection concerns, personal social status, availability of hand-sanitizers, waiting, and paying more for less congested vehicles during the pandemic. Factor analysis was performed to explore the underlying factors affecting mode choice before and during the pandemic. Discrete choice models were developed to model the mode choice behavior. Monthly household income and pandemic-related underlying factor were significant predictors of mode choice for shorter distances (i.e., &lt; 5 km) during the pandemic. Whereas, gender, car ownership and monthly household income were significant predictors of mode choice for longer distances (i.e., &gt; 5 km) during the pandemic. Understanding the modal shift during a pandemic will surely help urban and transport planners to prepare better for effective transport management in the future. Policy implications are also presented to help policymakers in developing policies for post-pandemic mobility needs, particularly in developing countries.","Abdullah, Muhammad Ali Nazam Bilal Aslam Atif Ashraf Javid Muhammad Arif Hussain Syed",International Journal of Transportation Science and Technology,,328

334670,"Symptomatology, assessment, and treatment of anxiety in older adults with cancer",2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2, is often more severe in older adults. Besides age, other underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and malignancies, which are also associated with aging, have been considered risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. A rapidly expanding body of evidence has brought up various scenarios for these observations and hyperinflammatory reactions associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) generated upon glycation of proteins, DNA, or lipids play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of age-related diseases and all of the above-mentioned COVID-19 risk factors. Interestingly, the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is mainly expressed by type 2 epithelial cells in the alveolar sac, which has a critical role in SARS-CoV-2-associated hyper inflammation and lung injury. Here we discuss our hypothesis that AGEs, through their interaction with RAGE amongst other molecules, modulates COVID-19 pathogenesis and related comorbidities, especially in the elderly.","Sellegounder, Durai Zafari Parisa Rajabinejad Misagh Taghadosi Mahdi Kapahi Pankaj",International Immunopharmacology,,328

While fatalities in the city-state remain low and contact tracing efforts have been largely successful, it has nonetheless experienced high rates of infection and the emergence of large infection clusters in its foreign worker dormitories. This paper analyses this dual-track policy outcome–low fatalities but high infection rates–from a policy capacity perspective. Specifically, the policy capacities that had contributed to Singapore’s low fatality rates and effective contact tracing are identified while the capacity deficiencies that may have caused its high rates of infection are discussed. In doing so, I argue that the presence of fiscal, operational and political capacities that were built up after the SARS crisis had contributed to Singapore’s low fatality rate and contact tracing capabilities while deficiencies in analytical capacities may explain its high infection rate.","Woo, J.

335142,"Contamination-related behaviors, obsessions, and compulsions during the COVID-19 pandemic in a United States population sample",2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has produced serious turmoil world-wide. Lung injury causing acute respiratory distress syndrome seems to be a most dreaded complication occurring in â¼30%. Older patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and acute respiratory distress syndrome have an increased mortality. Although the precise mechanisms involved in the development of lung injury have not been fully elucidated, the role of the extended renin-angiotensin system seems to be pivotal. In this context, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue, has been recognized as a facilitator of viral entry into the host, albeit its involvement in other counter-regulatory effects, such as converting angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang 1-7 with its known protective actions. Thus, concern was raised that the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors by increasing ACE2 expression may enhance patient susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus. However, current data have appeased such concerns because there has been no clinical evidence of a harmful effect of these agents as based on observational studies. However, properly designed future studies will be needed to further confirm or refute current evidence. Furthermore, other pathways may also play important roles in COVID-19 transmission and pathogenesis; spike (S) protein proteases facilitate viral transmission by cleaving S protein that promotes viral entry into the host; neprilysin (NEP), a neutral endopeptidase known to cleave natriuretic peptides, degrades Ang I into Ang 1-7; NEP can also catabolize bradykinin and thus mitigate bradykinin's role in inflammation, whereas, in the same context, specific bradykinin inhibitors may also negate bradykinin's harmful effects. Based on these intricate mechanisms, various preventive and therapeutic strategies may be devised, such as upregulating ACE2 and/or using recombinant ACE2, and exploiting the NEP, bradykinin and serine protease pathways, in addition to anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapies. These issues are herein reviewed, available studies are tabulated and pathogenetic mechanisms are pictorially illustrated.","Manolis, Antonis S; Manolis, Theodora A; Manolis, Antonis A; Melita, Helen",J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,,328

The Self-Care Traumatic Episode Protocol (STEP) is a computerized intervention adapted from the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Group Traumatic Episode Protocol (EMDR G-TEP). This study evaluated the effectiveness of STEP for mental health clinicians in the context of COVID-19. Thirty-four mental health clinicians were randomly allocated to treatment (n = 17) or waitlist (n = 17). The Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) and Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) were completed by the treatment group at baseline and 1-week follow-up postintervention and by the waitlist group at baseline, preintervention, and 1-week follow-up postintervention. Pre–post comparisons showed a significant decrease in depression, anxiety, and stress for Immediate Treatment, t(15) = −3.64, p &lt;.01, d =.73, and for Delayed Treatment, t(15) = −3.53, p &lt;.01, d =.68, There was also a significant increase in general self-efficacy for Immediate Treatment, t(15) = 2.87, p &lt;.05, d =.46, and Delayed Treatment, t(15) = 3.72, p &lt;.01, d =.56.

With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (&#945;,ß,Î³,Î´), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under &#945;-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and ß-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a ß-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.","Malik, Y A",Malays J Pathol,,328
338944,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wellbeing of Irish Men's Shed members,2020,"BACKGROUND: Contamination-prevention behaviors such as mask wearing and physical distancing are crucial to reduce coronavirus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that engagement in these behaviors could provoke obsessions and phobias in vulnerable individuals in the community. METHODS: A total of 2117 participants, systematically selected to represent the age, gender, and race distributions of the US population, completed an online survey that assessed demographic characteristics, clinical features, COVID-19 risks, and COVID-19 contamination-prevention behaviors. Logistic regression was used to estimate the magnitude of the relationships between the COVID-19 behavior score and clinically significant contamination obsessions, contamination compulsions, and pre-COVID-19 to current change in obsessive-compulsive symptom scores. RESULTS: The COVID-19 behavior score was significantly associated with contamination obsessions (odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.12-1.16; p < 0.001) and contamination phobias (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.12-1.16; p < 0.001). The COVID-19 behavior score also was associated with pre-pandemic to current increase in the overall obsessive-compulsive symptom score (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09-1.23; p < 0.001), as well as increase in obsessive-compulsive symptom score excluding washing items (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.07-1.19; p < 0.001). The magnitude of these relationships did not appreciably change, after adjustment for other variables associated with the outcomes. Moreover, the relationship was significant in those with or without OCD, and in individuals with different levels of doubt and COVID-19 risk. CONCLUSIONS: Contamination safety measures are critical for reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the community. However, they may be related to the development of contamination-related symptoms and OCD in vulnerable individuals, complicating the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders during this period.","Samuels, Jack; Holingue, Calliope; Nestadt, Paul S; Bienvenu, O Joseph; Phan, Phillip; Nestadt, Gerald",J Psychiatr Res,,328

339942,Cultivating the Therapeutic Alliance in a Telemental Health Setting,2021,"Introduction Même en période d’urgence épidémique, les essais cliniques randomisés restent la meilleure approche pour évaluer l’efficacité d’une intervention. Cependant différents défis méthodologiques se posent : pouvoir : – intégrer différentes stratégies thérapeutiques repositionnées ou innovantes adaptées aux connaissances émergentes lors de la conception et à différents stades de l’essai ;– écarter rapidement celles qui ne se révèlent pas prometteuses. Début 2021, aucun traitement n’est validé dans le traitement précoce de la COVID-19. Pourtant un tel traitement permettrait d’éviter les hospitalisations ou le décès. L’objectif de COVERAGE est d’évaluer la sécurité et l’efficacité de différents traitements ambulatoires pour diminuer le risque d’aggravation chez des patients fragiles avec facteurs de risque de gravité. Depuis sa mise en place de multiples adaptations ont pu être effectuées grâce au choix d’un schéma flexible. Méthodes COVERAGE est un essai multicentrique français de phase 3, de supériorité, contrôlé randomisé, ouvert à plusieurs bras parallèles (NCT04356495). Les patients – âge≥60 ans ou≥50 ans avec des comorbidités (ex : obésité) – présentant une COVID-19 sans critère d’hospitalisation sont randomisés (ratio 1) entre différentes stratégies expérimentales ou une stratégie contrôle. La randomisation est stratifiée sur le centre et d’autres facteurs de stratification peuvent être définis au cours du temps. Chaque stratégie thérapeutique peut être introduite dans tous ou certains centres à une période calendaire différente dans deux phases successives : d’abord une phase pilote (n=36) fondée sur un schéma de Fleming en une étape destinée à évaluer la tolérance et l’acceptabilité en traitement ambulatoire et à explorer les premiers paramètres d’évolution clinique ;puis, une phase d’efficacité (n=169) comparative utilisant un schéma adaptatif multi-bras multi-étape (MAMS) où chaque bras expérimental est comparé séparément aux participants du bras témoin unique inclus dans la même période calendaire pour éviter des biais de sélection et de confusion. Trois analyses intermédiaires (futilité±efficacité précoce) et une analyse finale seront effectuées pour le critère principal d’efficacité à j14, après l’inclusion de 30, 60, et 102 participants en phase d’efficacité. Chaque bras a un minimum de 36 participants (si arrêt après la phase pilote) et un maximum de 36+169 participants (si arrêt en fin de la phase d’efficacité). Le nombre total de patients inclus dans l’essai dépendra du nombre de bras, des décisions de passage de la phase pilote à la phase d’efficacité pour chaque stratégie, et de la durée de l’épidémie. Résultats Depuis mars 2020, plusieurs amendements au protocole ont permis de supprimer ou ajouter des bras, adapter les critères d’éligibilité et de stratification, effectuer une ouverture multicentrique progressive dans le cadre d’une extension nationale. En novembre 2020, COVERAGE s’est transformé en plateforme nationale dans le cadre de la stratégie REACTing pour optimiser les efforts de recherche français et a obtenu le label priorité nationale de recherche par le CAPNET. Fin janvier 2021, 112 participants étaient inclus et le recrutement continue. Conclusion L’essai COVERAGE a été construit pour s’adapter aux contraintes de la recherche clinique en période d’urgence épidémique. Le schéma adaptatif permettra d’évaluer la tolérance, la faisabilité ambulatoire et l’efficacité de différentes stratégies thérapeutiques précoces contre la COVID-19.","Lhomme, E.; Sitta, R.; Journot, V.; Chazallon, C.; Gabillard, D.; Piroth, L.; Lefèvre, B.; Darnaud, T.; Naccache, J.; Weiss, L.; Le Bel, J.; Binquet, C.; Markinson, A.; Dupouy, J.; Onaisi, R.; Duvigneau, A.; Anglaret, X.; Malvy, D.; Richert, L.; Wittkop, L.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,328

In particular, healthcare professionals faced the need to change their traditional activities of providing psychological assistance to children with special educational needs. Inclusive education has not been adapted to distance education in Ukraine. The aim of the study is to identify the impact of personality traits and the activity features on the use of remote educational tools by inclusive education specialists during quarantine. The study involved 50 professionals working with children with special educational needs. The surveyed professional included 26 psychologists, 13 speech therapists and 11 correctional educators. The survey was conducted online, covered six Ukrainian cities and was based on psychological questionnaires. The paper concludes that work effectiveness of healthcare specialists in remote form depends on the following personality traits: the level of tolerance for uncertainty and novelty, generosity, orientation toward the specialist’s achievements;it also depends on the method of assistance and the children’s nosologies. The paper provides three “psychological portraits” of specialists who find themselves in quarantine. Most of the specialists who participated in the study (more than 75%) expressed the opinion that remote learning was less effective than traditional education. Only applied behavior analysts believed that online corrective classes were good enough to use this form of activity in the future. © Andrii Trofimov, Kateryna Miliutina, Iuliia Romanova, Olha Drobot, Nataliia Rubel, 2021","Trofimov, A.; Miliutina, K.; Romanova, I.; Drobot, O.; Rubel, N.",Problems and Perspectives in Management,,328

During the lockdown, the general population delayed sleep timing and spent more time in bed; however, little is known on the effects of COVID-19 restriction on children and adolescents suffering type 1 narcolepsy. In the last months of 2019, we performed follow-up actigraphy in 18 type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents under stable pharmacological treatment with sodium oxybate. We contacted these patients for a follow-up actigraphy during the first Italian lockdown. Actigraphs and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale for children and adolescents (ESS-CHAD) have been sent to participants' homes. Differences in motor activity were analysed through functional linear modelling. During lockdown, type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents went to bed and woke up later, slept more during the daytime and napped more frequently. No difference emerged in time in bed, estimated total sleep time and nocturnal sleep quality. Similarly, no difference emerged in ESS-CHAD and body mass index. The time-series analysis of motor activity documented reduced activity during the early morning and in the evening during the lockdown period compared with pre-lockdown. Our study objectively showed that type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents delayed the sleep phase and slept more during the daytime during the lockdown. The analysis of type 1 narcolepsy children and adolescents' behaviour during the lockdown has provided new information that could pave the way to a personalized school programme.","Filardi, Marco; D039,; Anselmo, Anita; Mazzoni, Alice; Moresco, Monica; Pizza, Fabio; Plazzi, Giuseppe",J Sleep Res,,328

Nanoparticles of sizes less than 150 nm with a spherical shape were prepared using poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) and polyvinyl alcohol, respectively, as polymer and stabilizer. Rats were injected with subconvulsive doses of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (35 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) every second day, with 22 injections in total, and on the same days, they received protective doses of the chrysin NPs (5 and 10 µg/mL, PO), respectively, 45 min before each PTZ injection.

The cortex and hippocampus were removed and stored in liquid nitrogen for determining oxidative stress terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay, histopathology, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for messenger RNA expression. The result showed chrysin NPs treatment has counteracted oxidative stress, reduced neuronal apoptosis, and upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of chrysin NPs against kindling-induced epilepsy might be escorted by the alleviation of oxidative stress through the Nrf2/antioxidant response element/HO-1 pathway signal pathway.","Zhang, Ying; Zhao, Jing; Afzal, Obaid; Kazmi, Imran; Al-Abbasi, Fahad A; Altamimi, Abdulmalik S A; Yang, Zhen",J Biochem Mol Toxicol,,328
343770,"Organizational Justice, Professional Identification, Empathy, and Meaningful Work During COVID-19 Pandemic: Are They Burnout Protectors in Physicians and Nurses?",2020,"FANCJ, a DNA helicase and interacting partner of the tumor suppressor BRCA1, is crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL), a highly toxic lesion that leads to chromosomal instability and perturbs normal transcription. In diploid cells, FANCJ is believed to operate in homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB); however, its precise role and molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Moreover, compensatory mechanisms of ICL resistance when FANCJ is deficient have not been explored. In this work, we conducted a siRNA screen to identify genes of the DNA damage response/DNA repair regime that when acutely depleted sensitize FANCJ CRISPR knockout cells to a low concentration of the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (MMC). One of the top hits from the screen was RAP80, a protein that recruits repair machinery to broken DNA ends and regulates DNA end-processing. Concomitant loss of FANCJ and RAP80 not only accentuates DNA damage levels in human cells but also adversely affects the cell cycle checkpoint, resulting in profound chromosomal instability. Genetic complementation experiments demonstrated that both FANCJ's catalytic activity and interaction with BRCA1 are important for ICL resistance when RAP80 is deficient. The elevated RPA and RAD51 foci in cells co-deficient of FANCJ and RAP80 exposed to MMC are attributed to single-stranded DNA created by Mre11 and CtIP nucleases. Altogether, our cell-based findings together with biochemical studies suggest a critical function of FANCJ to suppress incompletely processed and toxic joint DNA molecules during repair of ICL-induced DNA damage.","Awate, Sanket; Sommers, Joshua A; Datta, Arindam; Nayak, Sumeet; Bellani, Marina A; Yang, Olivia; Dunn, Christopher A; Nicolae, Claudia M; Moldovan, George-Lucian; Seidman, Michael M; Cantor, Sharon B; Brosh, Robert M",Nucleic acids res,,328

Our tertiary care children's hospital pivoted towards a brief trial of intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy in all patients in order to limit operating room (OR) utilization and avoid prolonged hospital stays. We describe our pandemic-based strategy for non-operative management (NOM) of appendicitis but with a limited duration of IV antibiotics. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of children treated for acute appendicitis at our center from 3/31/2020 to 5/3/2020 during the peak of the New York pandemic. We compared appendicitis volume to similar months in prior years. We evaluated failure of NOM, length of stay, and compared characteristics of children we successfully treated with our expanded NOM protocol to previously published inclusion criteria for NOM. RESULTS: 45.5% of children (25/55) with acute appendicitis underwent NOM. Of the 30 who underwent surgery, 13 had complicated appendicitis while 17 had simple appendicitis. Three patients were COVID-positive, although none had respiratory symptoms. The majority of patients presenting with acute appendicitis (78.2%) did not meet previously published criteria for NOM. CONCLUSIONS: We treated a similar volume of children with acute appendicitis during the pandemic compared to prior years. We applied non-operative management to nearly half our patients, even as we expanded inclusion criteria for NOM to reduce OR utilization, but limited the duration of the antibiotic trial to avoid prolonged hospital stays.

Background and problem definition: The admission of patients to an intensive care unit is extremely stressful for relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they are not allowed to visit their family members due to a visitation restriction. OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience of relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic and to derive support information for health professionals. METHODS: Qualitative analysis of three written testimonies of relatives whose family members were hospitalized with COVID-19 or other disease at intensive care unit. RESULTS: Relatives report the sudden, unexpected occurrence of the disease. ""It was there, out of nowhere, hits the heart of life, doesn't just go away, does what it wants. It is an unknown virus that we have to get to know very closely."" The ban on visiting was harsh, it made her faint. The first visit was an indescribable joy. Knowing how the family member was and that the health care professionals were taking professional and empathetic care of the sick person were the only things the relatives could hold on to. DISCUSSION: Relatives were reassured when they experienced a high level of commitment on the part of health professionals and received repeated comprehensible information by phone. Limitations and transfer: Restrictions on visits depend on national legislation. Measures such as video calls can also be useful outside of a pandemic to build relationships with relatives.","Jeitziner, Marie-Madlen; Zante, Björn; Jenni-Moser, Béatrice",Pflege,,328

We used mathematical modelling to estimate the impact of delaying or cancelling treatment rounds and explore possible mitigation strategies. METHODS: We used three established LF transmission models to simulate infection trends in settings with annual treatment rounds and programme delays in 2020 of 6, 12, 18 or 24 months. We then evaluated the impact of various mitigation strategies upon resuming activities. RESULTS: The delay in achieving the elimination goals is on average similar to the number of years the treatment rounds are missed. Enhanced interventions implemented for as little as 1 y can allow catch-up on the progress lost and, if maintained throughout the programme, can lead to acceleration of up to 3 y. CONCLUSIONS: In general, a short delay in the programme does not cause a major delay in achieving the goals. Impact is strongest in high-endemicity areas. Mitigation strategies such as biannual treatment or increased coverage are key to minimizing the impact of the disruption once the programme resumes and lead to potential acceleration should these enhanced strategies be maintained.","Prada, Joaquín M; Stolk, Wilma A; Davis, Emma L; Touloupou, Panayiota; Sharma, Swarnali; Muñoz, Johanna; Caja Rivera, Rocio M; Reimer, Lisa J; Michael, Edwin; de Vlas, Sake J; Hollingsworth, T Déirdre",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,,328

351848,Engaging hospitalized youth with medication education groups during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Among the factors that could determine neurological outcome after hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) rewarming is rarely considered. The optimal rewarming rate is still unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of 2 different protocols for rewarming after HCA on neurological outcome in an experimental animal model. METHODS: Forty-four Sprague Dawley rats were cooled to 19 ± 1°C body core temperature by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). HCA was maintained for 60 min. Animals were randomized to receive slow (90 min) or fast (45 min) assisted rewarming with CPB to a target temperature of 35°C. After a total of 90 min of reperfusion in both groups, brain samples were collected and analysed immunohistochemically and with immunofluorescence. In 10 rats, magnetic resonance imaging was performed after 2 and after 24 h to investigate cerebral perfusion and cerebral oedema. RESULTS: Interleukin 6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and tumour necrosis factor &#945; in the hippocampus are significantly less expressed in the slow rewarming group, and microglia cells are significantly less activated in the slow rewarming group. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis demonstrated better cerebral perfusion and less water content in brains that underwent slow rewarming at 2 and 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Slow rewarming after HCA might be superior to fast rewarming in neurological outcome. The present experimental study demonstrated reduction in the inflammatory response, reduction of inflammatory cell activation in the brain, enhancement of cerebral blood flow and reduction of cerebral oedema when slow rewarming was applied.","Linardi, Daniele; Walpoth, Beat; Mani, Romel; Murari, Angela; Tessari, Maddalena; Hoxha, Stiljan; Anderloni, Marco; Decimo, Ilaria; Dolci, Sissi; Nicolato, Elena; Bontempi, Pietro; Merigo, Flavia; Luciani, Giovanni B; Faggian, Giuseppe; Rungatscher, Alessio",Eur. j. cardiothorac. surg,,328

However, we do not know the clinical significance of serum Zinc levels in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of serum zinc in COVID-19 patients and to establish a correlation with disease severity. METHODS: This was a prospective study of fasting zinc levels in COVID-19 patients at the time of hospitalization. An initial comparative analysis was conducted between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. COVID-19 patients with zinc deficiency were compared to those with normal zinc levels. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients (n = 47) showed significantly lower zinc levels when compared to healthy controls (n = 45): median 74.5 (interquartile range 53.4-94.6) µg/dl vs 105.8 (interquartile range 95.65-120.90) µg/dl (p < 0.001). Amongst the COVID-19 patients, 27 (57.4%) were found to be zinc deficient. These patients were found to have higher rates of complications (p = 0.009), acute respiratory distress syndrome (18.5% vs 0%, p = 0.06), corticosteroid therapy (p = 0.02), prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.05), and increased mortality (18.5% vs 0%, p = 0.06). The odds ratio (OR) of developing complications was 5.54 for zinc deficient COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The study data clearly show that a significant number of COVID-19 patients were zinc deficient. These zinc deficient patients developed more complications, and the deficiency was associated with a prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality.","Jothimani, Dinesh; Kailasam, Ezhilarasan; Danielraj, Silas; Nallathambi, Balaji; Ramachandran, Hemalatha; Sekar, Padmini; Manoharan, Shruthi; Ramani, Vidyalakshmi; Narasimhan, Gomathy; Kaliamoorthy, Ilankumaran; Rela, Mohamed",Int J Infect Dis,,328

Adding on to the already existing burnout, an increase in incidents of violence and aggression against HCWs was seen in Pakistan and globally. Objectives: Primarily to review cases of violence against HCWs in Pakistan, highlighting and comparing the instigating factors seen within the country and globally. Secondly, to enlist possible interventions to counter workplace violence in healthcare during a pandemic and in general. Methods: Incidents of violence towards HCWs in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic occurring between April 7, 2020, and August 7, 2020, were included. The incidents reported from local newspapers were reviewed. Findings and Conclusion: A total of 29 incidents were identified, with perpetrators of violence most commonly being relatives of COVID-19 patients. Most frequent reasons included mistrust in HCWs, belief in conspiracy theories, hospitals' refusal to admit COVID-19 patients due to limited space, COVID-19 hospital policies, and the death of the COVID-19 patients. Protests by doctors and other HCWs for provision of adequate PPE, better quarantine conditions for doctors with suspected COVID-19, and better compensation for doctors on COVID-19 patient duty resulted in police violence towards HCWs. To avoid such incidents in the future, institutions, healthcare policymakers, media organisations, and law enforcement agencies must work together for widespread public awareness to counter misconceptions and to exhibit responsible journalism. In hospitals, measures such as de-escalation training and increased security must be implemented. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies must be trained in non-violent methods of crowd dispersal and control to manage peaceful protests by HCWs over legitimate issues.","Bhatti, Omaima Anis; Rauf, Hareem; Aziz, Namrah; Martins, Russell Seth; Khan, Javaid A",Ann Glob Health,,328
353436,Difficulties with emotion regulation and drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduates: the serial mediation of COVID-related distress and drinking to cope with the pandemic,2021,"This paper presents a stochastic optimization model for allocating and sharing a critical resource in the case of a pandemic. The demand for different entities peaks at different times, and an initial inventory from a central agency is to be allocated. The entities (states) may share the critical resource with a different state under a risk-averse condition. The model is applied to study the allocation of ventilator inventory in the COVID-19 pandemic by the Federal Emergency Management Agency of the US Department of Homeland Security (FEMA) to different states in the US. Findings suggest that if less than 60% of the ventilator inventory is available for non-COVID-19 patients, FEMA's stockpile of 20,000 ventilators (as of 03/23/2020) would be nearly adequate to meet the projected needs. However, when more than 75% of the available ventilator inventory must be reserved for non-COVID-19 patients, various degrees of shortfall are expected. In an extreme case, where the demand is assumed to be concentrated in the top-most quartile of the forecast confidence interval, the total shortfall over the planning horizon (till 05/31/20) is about 28,500 ventilator days, with a peak shortfall of 2,700 ventilators on 04/12/20. The results also suggest that in the worse-than-average to severe demand scenario cases, NY requires between 7,600-9,200 additional ventilators for COVID-19 patients during its peak demand. However, between 400 to 2,000 of these ventilators can be given to a different state after the peak demand in NY has subsided.","Mehrotra, Sanjay; Rahimian, Hamed; Barah, Masoud; Luo, Fengqiao; Schantz, Karolina",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01318v1.pdf,328

DESIGN AND SAMPLE: This was a cross-sectional survey of 36 hospice and palliative care workforce members representing all United States geographic regions. RESULTS: Most respondents (70%) reported an increase in specific palliative care services as a result of the pandemic. Two thirds (78%) of respondents reported their agency has cared for confirmed COVID-19 patients. Only half reported the agency had access to laboratory facilities for surveillance and detection of outbreaks in both patients and staff (58%) and that the agency could test patients and providers for COVID-19 (55%). Qualitative comments described the impact of the pandemic and resulting social distancing measures on the emotional well-being of patients, families, and staff. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the palliative and hospice care workforce as it provides increased services at an unprecedented rate to patients and families. The implications of these findings are important for public health nurses who are skilled in disaster management and quickly responding to emergencies. The expertise of public health nurses can be leveraged to support palliative care agencies as they strive to manage the pandemic in the communities they serve.","Kates, Jeannette; Gerolamo, Angela; Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Monika",Public health nurs,,328

The lack of targeted therapeutics and limited treatment options have triggered the scientific community to develop new vaccines or small molecule therapeutics against various targets of SARS-CoV-2. The main protease (Mpro) is a well characterized and attractive drug target because of its crucial role in processing of the polyproteins which are required for viral replication. In order to provide potential lead molecules against the Mpro for clinical use, we docked a set of 65 bioactive molecules of Tea plant followed by exploration of the vast conformational space of protein-ligand complexes by long term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (1.50 µs). Top three bioactive molecules (Oolonghomobisflavan-A, Theasinensin-D, and Theaflavin-3-O-gallate) were selected by comparing their docking scores with repurposed drugs (Atazanavir, Darunavir, and Lopinavir) against SARS-CoV-2. Oolonghomobisflavan-A molecule showed a good number of hydrogen bonds with Mpro and higher MM-PBSA binding energy when compared to all three repurposed drug molecules. during the time of simulation. This study showed Oolonghomobisflavan-A as a potential bioactive molecule to act as an inhibitor for the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. [Formula: see text]Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

A relatively recent extension of this approach has been allowing for potential asymmetric impacts since it is harmonious with the way reality operates in many cases according to Hatemi-J (2012). The current paper maintains that it is also important to account for the potential change in the parameters when asymmetric causation tests are conducted, as there exists a number of reasons for changing the potential causal connection between variables across time. The current paper extends therefore the static asymmetric causality tests by making them dynamic via the usage of subsamples. An application is also provided consistent with measurable definitions of economic or financial bad as well as good news and their potential interaction across time.","Hatemi-J, Abdulnasser",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07612v2.pdf,328
357712,Digital health during COVID-19: lessons from operationalising new models of care in ophthalmology,2021,"BACKGROUND: Research regarding COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) in older adults is scarce. We evaluated risk factors and outcomes of AKI in hospitalized older adults with and without COVID-19. METHODS: Observational study of patients admitted to two geriatric clinics in Stockholm from March 1st to June 15th, 2020. The difference in incidence, risk factors and adverse outcomes for AKI between patients with or without COVID-19 were examined. Odds ratios (OR) for the risk of AKI and in-hospital death were obtained from logistic regression. RESULTS: Three hundred-sixteen older patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 and 876 patients for non-COVID-19 diagnoses. AKI occurred in 92 (29%) patients with COVID-19 vs. 159 (18%) without COVID-19. The odds for developing AKI were higher in patients with COVID-19 (adjusted OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-2.76), low baseline kidney function as depicted by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [4.19 (2.48-7.05), for eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min, and 20.3 (9.95-41.3) for eGFR < 30 mL/min], and higher C reactive protein (CRP) (OR 1.81 (1.11-2.95) in patients with initial CRP > 10 mg/L). Compared to patients without COVID-19 and without AKI, the risk of in-hospital death was highest in patients with COVID-19 and AKI [OR 80.3, 95% CI (27.3-235.6)], followed by COVID-19 without AKI [16.3 (6.28-42.4)], and by patients without COVID-19 and with AKI [10.2 (3.66-28.2)]. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had a higher incidence of AKI compared to patients hospitalized for other diagnoses. COVID-19 and reduced baseline kidney function were risk factors for developing AKI. AKI and COVID-19 were associated with in-hospital death.","Xu, Hong; Garcia-Ptacek, Sara; Annetorp, Martin; Bruchfeld, Annette; Cederholm, Tommy; Johnson, Peter; Kivipelto, Miia; Metzner, Carina; Religa, Dorota; Eriksdotter, Maria",J Nephrol,,328

We describe a panel of human mAbs binding to diverse epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors and found a minority of these possessed neutralizing activity. Two mAbs (COV2-2676 and COV2-2489) inhibited infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and recombinant VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We mapped their binding epitopes by alanine-scanning mutagenesis and selection of functional SARS-CoV-2 S neutralization escape variants. Mechanistic studies showed that these antibodies neutralize in part by inhibiting a post-attachment step in the infection cycle. COV2-2676 and COV2-2489 offered protection either as prophylaxis or therapy, and Fc effector functions were required for optimal protection. Thus, natural infection induces a subset of potent NTD-specific mAbs that leverage neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple functional attributes.","Suryadevara, Naveenchandra; Shrihari, Swathi; Gilchuk, Pavlo; VanBlargan, Laura A; Binshtein, Elad; Zost, Seth J; Nargi, Rachel S; Sutton, Rachel E; Winkler, Emma S; Chen, Elaine C; Fouch, Mallorie E; Davidson, Edgar; Doranz, Benjamin J; Chen, Rita E; Shi, Pei-Yong; Carnahan, Robert H; Thackray, Larissa B; Diamond, Michael S; Crowe, James E",Cell,,328

359109,Adolescents at a Distance: The Importance of Socio-Cognitive Factors in Preventive Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Disposable surgical face masks are usually used by medical/nurse staff but the current Covid-19 pandemic has caused their massive use by many people. Being worn closely attached to the people's face, they are continuously subjected to routine movements, i.e., facial expressions, breathing, and talking. These motional forces represent an unusual source of wasted mechanical energy that can be rather harvested by electromechanical transducers and exploited to power mask-integrated sensors. Typically, piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators are exploited to this aim; however, most of the current devices are too thick or wide, not really conformable, and affected by humidity, which make them hardly embeddable in a mask, in contact with skin. Different from recent attempts to fabricate smart energy-harvesting cloth masks, in this work, a wearable energy harvester is rather enclosed in the mask and can be reused and not disposed. The device is a metal-free hybrid piezoelectric nanogenerator (hPENG) based on soft biocompatible materials. In particular, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membranes in the pure form and with a biobased plasticizer (cardanol oil, CA) are electrospun onto a laser-ablated polyimide flexible substrate attached on a skin-conformable elastomeric blend of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and Ecoflex. The multilayer structure of the device harnesses the piezoelectricity of the PVDF nanofibers and the friction triboelectric effects. The ultrasensitive mechanoelectrical transduction properties of the composite device are determined by the strong electrostatic behavior of the membranes and the plasticization effect of cardanol. In addition, encapsulation based on PVDF, PDMS, CA, and parylene C is used, allowing the hPENG to exhibit optimal reliability and resistance against the wet and warm atmosphere around the face mask. The proposed device reveals potential applications for the future development of smart masks with coupled energy-harvesting devices, allowing to use them not only for anti-infective protection but also to supply sensors or active antibacterial/viral devices.","Mariello, Massimo; Qualtieri, Antonio; Mele, Giuseppe; De Vittorio, Massimo",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,328

Initial imaging was negative but later imaging was suggestive of serious pathology. At laparotomy, a caesarean section was performed. Peritonitis was encountered secondary to two discrete perforations in the small bowel separate from her pouch. Histology found an ischaemic perforation secondary to a pressure effect from the gravid uterus. In pregnancy, ileoanal pouches may make the interconnected bowel vulnerable to the pressure effect of the gravid uterus and perforation. Pregnant women with such a surgical history who develop symptoms suggestive of bowel perforation should have rapid imaging and their clinical team should consider early definitive surgical intervention.","Wasson, E; Jones, M J; Fazili, N; Burn, P; Nagabushanam, S; Vickery, C; Ryan, Naj",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,328

The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of such measures in a large sample of the Brazilian population. We relied on recreancy theory, which argues that confidence in the ability of social institutions and perceived vulnerability to the disease are central factors predicting the adoption of these behaviors. Our results, drawn from 7554 respondents, indicate that self-confidence in the ability to carry out these behaviors, confidence in the ability of social institutions such as the government, hospitals, health workers and the media to cope with the pandemic crisis, and risk perceptions are associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors. Our results expand the recreancy theory and show that beyond the main effects, the effect of perceived vulnerability depends on the values of self-confidence and confidence in social institutions. The theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.","Storopoli, Jose; Braga da Silva Neto, Wilson Levy; Mesch, Gustavo S",Soc Sci Med,,328

There was a positive correlation between aerosols and intraocular pressure (IOP), and the concentration of aerosols beside the air jet port was the highest. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of IOP on the aerosol density generated during the use of an NCT and provide references and suggestions for daily protection of ophthalmic medical staff during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: This cross-sectional clinical trial included 214 eyes of 140 patients from a hospital in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang Province. All subjects' IOPs were measured by an NCT (39 eyes with low IOP, 90 eyes with normal IOP, 37 eyes with moderately high IOP, and 48 eyes with very high IOP) between March 7 and June 17, 2020. The density of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10 generated during the process of IOP measurement with an NCT was analyzed. IOP values were recorded simultaneously. The aerosols generated during different IOP measurements were plotted in scatter plots. RESULTS: PM2.5 was generated more at the air jet port of the tonometer during the process of IOP measurement (H=2.731, P=0.019). Larger quantities of PM2.5 and PM10 were generated when the IOP was higher, and these differences were statistically significant (PM2.5: H=119.476, P<0.001; PM10: H=160.801, P<0.001). Linear correlation analysis with one variable demonstrated that IOP had significantly positive correlations with PM2.5 (r=0.756, P<0.001) and PM10 (r=0.864, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Aerosols can be generated while using an NCT to measure IOP, and aerosols and IOP are positively correlated. Patients with moderately high IOP or very high IOP tend to generate more aerosols during the IOP measurement. The concentration of aerosols beside the air jet port was the highest.","Tang, Yuan; Li, Chunchun; Chen, Yanyan; Chen, Zhangyan; Zhang, Peihua; Wang, Aisun; Huang, Xiaoqiong; Qu, Jia; Li, Mengchen; Ma, Siwen; Vasudevan, Balamurali",J Glaucoma,,328
362671,Time-trend analysis of medicine sales and shortages during COVID-19 outbreak: Data from community pharmacies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Bats have been considered natural reservoirs for several pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs) in the last two decades. Recently, a bat CoV was detected in the Republic of Korea; its entire genome was sequenced and reported to be genetically similar to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the two Korean bat CoV strains 16BO133 and B15-21, to estimate the likelihood of an interaction between the Korean bat CoVs and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. METHODS: The phylogenetic analysis was conducted with the maximum-likelihood (ML) method using MEGA 7 software. The Korean bat CoVs receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein was analyzed by comparative homology modeling using the SWISS-MODEL server. The binding energies of the complexes were calculated using PRODIGY and MM/GBGA. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses of the entire RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, spike regions, and the complete genome revealed that the Korean CoVs, along with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, within BetaCoVs. However, the two Korean CoVs were distinct from SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the spike gene of the Korean CoVs, which is involved in host infection, differed from that of SARS-CoV-2, showing only 66.8%-67.0% nucleotide homology and presented deletions within the RBD, particularly within regions critical for cross-species transmission and that mediate interaction with ACE2. Binding free energy calculation revealed that the binding affinity of Korean bat CoV RBD to hACE2 was drastically lower than that of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Korean bat CoVs are unlikely to bind to the human ACE2 receptor.","Na, Eun Jee; Lee, Sook Young; Kim, Hak Jun; Oem, Jae Ku",J Vet Sci,,328

They not only rarely get symptoms but also seem to be poor transmitters. We propose that this may be explained by the mechanism of breath droplet formation, which occur during the re-opening of collapsed terminal bronchioles. Children's lungs are still developing. Compared to adults they have few alveoli and terminal bronchioles, thus less sites of aerosol formation where virus-loaded lung lining liquid can get airborne. In addition, children have a lower respiratory minute volume and tend to have a lower viral load. These points, together with the fact that asymptomatic carriers release less aerosols than symptomatic carriers support the idea that children are indeed poor transmitters of the COVID-19 virus.","Riediker, Michael; Morawska, Lidia",Aerosol Air Qual.

Objective: To provide quantitative data about the use of teledermatology. Methods: Retrospective analysis of teledermatology consultations was performed from March 16 to May 1, 2020. The number/type of encounters, differences in diagnoses, and prescriptions between asynchronous and synchronous teledermatology visits were analyzed. Results: A total of 951 visits (36.2%) were asynchronous whereas 1,672 visits (63.8%) were synchronous. Only 131 (<5%) visits required an acute in-person follow-up. The diagnosis of acne was more frequent with asynchronous visits (p < 0.002, Bonferroni corrected). Antibiotics and nonretinoid acne medications were prescribed more with asynchronous visits, whereas immunomodulators and biologics were more commonly prescribed with synchronous visits (p < 0.02, Bonferroni corrected). Providers at our institution were split on preferred mode (54.2% synchronous, 45.8% asynchronous); however, synchronous visits were preferred for complex medical dermatology patients and return patients (p < 0.05). Limitations: This study is limited by being a single-center study. Conclusions: Asynchronous teledermatology was used more for acne management, whereas synchronous teledermatology was preferable to providers for complex medical dermatology.

366295,The Endemic Amid the Pandemic: Seeking Help for Violence Against Women in the Initial Phases of COVID-19,2021,"We analyze 'stop and go' containment policies which produces infection cycles as periods of tight lock-downs are followed by periods of falling infection rates, which then lead to a relaxation of containment measures, allowing cases to increase again until another lock-down is imposed. The policies followed by several European countries seem to fit this pattern. We show that 'stop and go' should lead to lower medical costs than keeping infections at the midpoint between the highs and lows produced by 'stop and go'. Increasing the upper and reducing the lower limits of a stop and go policy by the same amount would lower the average medical load. But increasing the upper and lowering the lower limit while keeping the geometric average constant would have the opposite impact. We also show that with economic costs proportional to containment, any path that brings infections back to the original level (technically a closed cycle) has the same overall economic cost.","Gros, Claudius; Gros, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07739v1.pdf,328

A SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The majority of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units with confirmed severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 developed an acute respiratory distress like syndrome. The main objective of this opinion paper is to raise the discussion about the possible benefit of keeping the patient with COVID-19 disease and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in the prone position during the perioperative period, especially where this position is not a required factor for the surgical or invasive procedure. We believe that the prone position, due to its favorable pulmonary physiology, can improve the V̇/Q̇ ratio in the perioperative period.","Alves Bersot, Carlos Darcy; Linhares, Rafael Mercante; Guimarães Pereira, Jose Eduardo; Galhardo, Carlos",Trends Anaesth.

370006,The rise of adverse childhood experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Tracking the genetic variability of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a crucial challenge. Mainly to identify target sequences in order to generate robust vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, but also to track viral genetic temporal and geographic evolution and to mine for variants associated with reduced or increased disease severity. Several online tools and bioinformatic phylogenetic analyses have been released, but the main interest lies in the Spike protein, which is the pivotal element of current vaccine design, and in the Receptor Binding Domain, that accounts for most of the neutralizing the antibody activity. METHODS: Here, we present an open-source bioinformatic protocol, and a web portal focused on SARS-CoV-2 single mutations and minimal consensus sequence building as a companion vaccine design tool. Furthermore, we provide immunogenomic analyses to understand the impact of the most frequent RBD variations. RESULTS: Results on the whole GISAID sequence dataset at the time of the writing (October 2020) reveals an emerging mutation, S477N, located on the central part of the Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain, the Receptor Binding Motif. Immunogenomic analyses revealed some variation in mutated epitope MHC compatibility, T-cell recognition, and B-cell epitope probability for most frequent human HLAs. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a framework able to track down SARS-CoV-2 genomic variability.","Massacci, Alice; Sperandio, Eleonora; D039,; Ambrosio, Lorenzo; Maffei, Mariano; Palombo, Fabio; Aurisicchio, Luigi; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Pallocca, Matteo",J Transl Med,,328

371924,Physical activity during the Covid-19 pandemic/ L'activité physique en période de pandémie Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to quantify the potential survival benefit of convalescent plasma therapy (CVP) in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure related to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a single-center prospective observational cohort study in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Immediately after intensive care unit (ICU) admission patients were allocated to CVP treatment following pre-specified criteria to rapidly identify those patients potentially susceptible for this treatment. A propensity score adjustment [inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) analysis] was implemented to account rigorously for imbalances in prognostic variables between the treatment groups. RESULTS: We included 120 patients of whom 48 received CVP. Thirty percent were female with a median age of 66 years [25th-75th percentile 54-75]. Eighty-eight percent of patients presented with severe acute respiratory failure as displayed by a median paO2/FiO2 ratio (Horowitz Index) of 92 [77-150]. All patients required any kind of ventilatory support with more than half of them (52%) receiving invasive ventilation. Thirty-day ICU overall survival (OS) was 69% in the CVP group and 54% in the non-CVP group (log-rank p = 0.049), respectively. After weighing the time-to-event data for the IPTW, the favorable association between CVP and OS became even stronger (log-rank p = 0.035). Moreover, an exploratory analysis showed an overall survival benefit of CVP therapy for patients with non-invasive ventilation (Hazard ratio 0.12 95% CI 0.03-0.57, p = 0.007) CONCLUSION: Administration of CVP in patients with acute respiratory failure related to COVID-19 is associated with improved ICU survival rates.","Hatzl, Stefan; Posch, Florian; Sareban, Nazanin; Stradner, Martin; Rosskopf, Konrad; Reisinger, Alexander C; Eller, Philipp; Schörghuber, Michael; Toller, Wolfgang; Sloup, Zdenka; Prüller, Florian; Gütl, Katharina; Pilz, Stefan; Rosenkranz, Alexander R; Greinix, Hildegard T; Krause, Robert; Schlenke, Peter; Schilcher, Gernot",Ann Intensive Care,,328

This highly pathogenic virus has to date caused >71 million infections and >1.6 million deaths in >180 countries. Several vaccines and drugs are being studied as possible treatments or prophylactics of this viral infection. M3CLpro (coronavirus main cysteine protease) is a promising drug target as it has a significant role in viral replication. Here we use the X-ray crystal structure of M3CLpro in complex with boceprevir to study the dynamic changes of the protease upon ligand binding. The binding free energy was calculated for water molecules at different locations of the binding site, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for the M3CLpro/boceprevir complex, to thoroughly understand the chemical environment of the binding site. Several HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors were tested in vitro against M3CLpro. Specifically, asunaprevir, narlaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir all showed inhibitory effects on M3CLpro. Molecular docking and MD simulations were then performed to investigate the effects of these ligands on M3CLpro and to provide insights into the chemical environment of the ligand binding site. Our findings and observations are offered to help guide the design of possible potent protease inhibitors and aid in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Manandhar, Anjela; Blass, Benjamin E; Colussi, Dennis J; Almi, Imane; Abou-Gharbia, Magid; Klein, Michael L; Elokely, Khaled M",J Chem Inf Model,,328

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, residents, and fellows at a medical university hospital in New York using self-reported PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening tools administered via an anonymized survey. The study was conducted in April 2020. RESULTS: The authors received 438 responses (33.4% response rate). Nearly half (44.5%) were medical students and female (56.6%). The prevalence of positive screen for depression (45.3%) and anxiety (48.1%) was high. Many reported moderate to severe depression (17.2%) and anxiety (20.3%). Over half (57.3%) experienced significant mood changes and inability to concentrate, and 14.6% had reconsidered their choice of profession since the start of the pandemic. Those who had reconsidered their profession had higher PHQ-9 [8.1 (6.4) vs 4.4 (4.3), p < 0.0001] and GAD-7 scores [8.3 (6.1) vs 4.7 (4.6), p < 0.0001], indicating adverse mental health partly contributed to their reconsideration of choice of profession.

Considering the recent food and drug administration (FDA) approval of remdesivir as the first officially approved agent for COVID-19 treatment, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of remdesivir administration in COVID-19 patients. A systematic literature search was done through MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from their inception to December 22nd, 2020. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five non-randomized studies of intervention (NRSI) were entered into the meta-analysis. The results showed that remdesivir administration was associated with a significant improvement in the 28-day recovery (RR = 1.09, 95%CI, 1.04-1.15), low flow oxygen support through days one to 14 (RR = 2.88, 95%CI, 1.80-4.60), and invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation requirement through days 14-28 of the follow-up time (RR = 5.34, 95%CI, 2.37-12.05). The risk of experiencing serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was significantly lower (RR = 0.75, 95%CI, 0.63-0.90) in the remdesivir group than the comparison/control group. The pooled median difference of the time to clinical improvement was 2.99 (95%CI = 2.71-3.28), which did not remain significant during the sensitivity analysis. The clinical output comparison of the 5-day and 10-day remdesivir courses revealed that the 5-day regimen might provide similar benefits while causing fewer serious ADRs than 10-day. The current meta-analysis provided an updated evaluation of scientific evidence on the use of remdesivir in COVID-19 patients.

375731,Teleworking in the Aftermath of the Covid-19 Pandemic: Enabling Conditions for a Successful Transition (preprint),2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of linear and monocentric approaches in addressing today's complex, cross-cutting, and interconnected challenges. Experiences from the Covid-19 have shown that focusing on one sector during a crisis only aggravates the stresses in other sectors as decision-makers often view the world from a linear perspective, with the thought that a click of a button would get the economy and society back on track. This study argues that linearity forgets the interconnectedness of systems and how their systemic properties shape their interactions, interdependencies, and interrelationships, whereas nexus planning integrates and simplifies socio-ecological systems, indicates priority areas for intervention, and reduces risk and vulnerability. The lockdowns implemented during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in job losses, company closures, and economic recessions, demonstrating that linear approaches often over-emphasise on a limited set of attributes of a system, notably efficiency, at the expense of other aspects. While linear approaches have been beneficial to some extent for long, the Covid-19 pandemic exposed how they transfer stresses to other sectors, and compromise resilience-building initiatives, allowing failure to cascade from one sector to the other. Nexus planning emphasises on cross-sectoral sustainability and enhances socio-economic resilience against future shocks.","Nhamo, Luxon; Ndlela, Bekithemba",Environ Res,,328

Introduction: The COVID-19 Precision Recovery Program (PRP) is a remote patient monitoring (RPM) clinical program that was deployed by a New York health system to perform physiologic and symptomatic monitoring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses. Methods: The present cross-sectional descriptive study reports retrospective data collected from the PRP during the COVID-19 crisis in New York. Results: One hundred twelve patients were included; mean (standard deviation) age was 49 (17.6) years and 60.7% were female. Most prevalent reported comorbidities were hypertension (36.3%), hypercholesterolemia (26.5%), and diabetes (17.7%). Less than half (44.6%) had a positive polymerase chain reaction COVID test (PCR-test), 33% had an unknown COVID status, and 17.9% had a negative test result. The most commonly reported symptoms included dyspnea (55.4%) and anxiety (55.4%). Anxiety was ranked as the most severe symptom (9.8%), followed by difficulty concentrating (4.5%). Symptom presentation did not significantly differ based on PCR-test status. Discussion: RPM can be a valuable tool for delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses. Considering similarities in symptom presentation between PCR-test statuses, access to COVID-related clinical care should not be based on PCR-test results. Conclusions: RPM has strong potential to assist in the effective management of suspected COVID-19 patients.","Tabacof, Laura; Kellner, Christopher; Breyman, Erica; Dewil, Sophie; Braren, Stephen; Nasr, Leila; Tosto, Jenna; Cortes, Mar; Putrino, David",Telemed. j. e. health,,328

Initially, the state-space representation for the bats-hosts-reservoir-people (BHRP) model is obtained using a set of fractional order differential equations for the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. Afterward, the EKF and Kronecker product based WT methods have been applied to the discrete vector representation of the BHRP model. The main advantage of using EKF in this system is that it considers both the process and the measurement noise, which gives better accuracy and probable states, which are the Markovian (processes). The importance of proposed models lies in the fact that these models can accommodate conventional EKF and WT methods as their special cases. Further, we have compared the estimated number of contagious people and recovered people with the actual number of infectious people and recovered people in India and China.","Bansal, Rahul; Kumar, Amit; Singh, Amit Kumar; Kumar, Sandeep",Digit Signal Process,,328

378183,Making brochure of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for children with autism spectrum disorder and their family members,2020,"In the last 5 years, frequent outbreaks of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are observed in both broiler and layer chicken flocks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in spite of extensive usage of vaccines. The IBV is a widespread avian coronavirus affecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated chicken flocks and is attributed to significant economic losses, around the globe. In the present study, 58 (n = 58) samples were collected from four different commercial poultry flocks from 8 KSA districts during 2019. A total of nine positive isolates (9/58; 15.5%), based on real-time reverse transcriptase PCR targeting nucleocapsid (N) gene, were used for further genetic characterization and evolutionary analysis. Genetic characterization of the partial spike (S1) gene revealed the clustering of the reported isolates into three different genotypes, whereas four additional isolates were grouped within 4/91 genotype, two isolates within IS/885 genotype, one isolate was closely related to IS/1494/06, and two isolates were grouped within classic serotype (vaccine-like strains). Phylodynamic revealed clustering of four isolated viruses within GI-13 lineage, three isolates within GI-23 lineage, and two isolates within GI-1 lineage. Results indicate that there are high evolutionary distances between the newly identified IBV strains in this study and the commercially used vaccines (GI-1), suggesting that IBV strains circulating in the KSA are under constant evolutionary pressures. Selective pressure biostatistics analyses consistently demonstrate the presence of a higher positive score which highlights the role of natural selection, a mechanism of virus evolution on sites located on the protein surface, within or nearby domains involved in viral attachment or related functions. Recombination analysis revealed emergence of two isolates through recombination events resulting in new recombinant viruses. Taken together, these finding demonstrate the genetic and evolutionary insights into the currently circulating IBV genotypes in KSA, which could help to better understand the origin, spread, and evolution of infectious bronchitis viruses, and to ascertain the importance of disease monitoring as well as re-evaluation for the currently used vaccines and vaccination programs.","Rohaim, Mohammed A; El Naggar, Rania F; Abdelsabour, Mohammed A; Mohamed, Mahmoud H A; El-Sabagh, Ibrahim M; Munir, Muhammad",,,328

We therefore compared the unique features among 62 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan (15 cases), exposed to the patients from Wuhan (26 cases), or acquired the disease without exposure to Wuhan patients (21 cases). Median incubation periods are 4.5 days (3-5) for Wuhan patients, 8 days (3-11) for those infected by Wuhan patients, and 12 days (7-13) for those without aforementioned experience. The disease onset dates are earliest for Wuhan patients and latest for those without exposure to Wuhan patients. Blood lymphocytes were lowest in Wuhan patients, lower in those affected by Wuhan patients, and modest reduced in remaining ones. Disease severity is worst for Wuhan patients, and modest for those without contact with Wuhan patients. Wuhan patients had longest (27 days, 18-28), those transmitted by Wuhan patients had intermediate (16 days, 8-23), and the rest of the patients had shortest (13 days, 8.5-22.5) hospital stay. Early viral exposure, older age, lymphocytopenia, and underlying conditions are risk factors which warrant aggressive intervention. Even though the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 appears decline over the course of serial transmissions, viral testing, contact tracing, social distancing, and face masking should be imposed on general public to contain viral dissemination from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with this highly contagious disease.","Gao, Yinjie; Ma, Xuemei; Bi, Jingfeng; Chu, Jindong; Liu, Bo; Chi, Chunsheng; Yan, Jianguo; Yu, Xiaoli; Liu, Fangming; Deng, Xiaohong; Zhang, Hongbing; Jin, Bo",Virulence,,328
381409,Health systems resilience in managing the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from 28 countries,2021,"BACKGROUND: Initial training is essential for the mental health peer support worker (PSW) role. Training needs to incorporate recent advances in digital peer support and the increase of peer support work roles internationally. There is a lack of evidence on training topics that are important for initial peer support work training and on which training topics can be provided on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to establish consensus levels about the content of initial training for mental health PSWs and the extent to which each identified topic can be delivered over the internet. METHODS: A systematized review was conducted to identify a preliminary list of training topics from existing training manuals. Three rounds of Delphi consultation were then conducted to establish the importance and web-based deliverability of each topic. In round 1, participants were asked to rate the training topics for importance, and the topic list was refined. In rounds 2 and 3, participants were asked to rate each topic for importance and the extent to which they could be delivered over the internet. RESULTS: The systematized review identified 32 training manuals from 14 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Scotland, Sweden, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These were synthesized to develop a preliminary list of 18 topics. The Delphi consultation involved 110 participants (49 PSWs, 36 managers, and 25 researchers) from 21 countries (14 high-income, 5 middle-income, and 2 low-income countries). After the Delphi consultation (round 1: n=110; round 2: n=89; and round 3: n=82), 20 training topics (18 universal and 2 context-specific) were identified. There was a strong consensus about the importance of five topics: lived experience as an asset, ethics, PSW well-being, and PSW role focus on recovery and communication, with a moderate consensus for all other topics apart from the knowledge of mental health. There was no clear pattern of differences among PSW, manager, and researcher ratings of importance or between responses from participants in countries with different resource levels. All training topics were identified with a strong consensus as being deliverable through blended web-based and face-to-face training (rating 1) or fully deliverable on the internet with moderation (rating 2), with none identified as only deliverable through face-to-face teaching (rating 0) or deliverable fully on the web as a stand-alone course without moderation (rating 3). CONCLUSIONS: The 20 training topics identified can be recommended for inclusion in the curriculum of initial training programs for PSWs. Further research on web-based delivery of initial training is needed to understand the role of web-based moderation and whether web-based training better prepares recipients to deliver web-based peer support.","Charles, Ashleigh; Nixdorf, Rebecca; Ibrahim, Nashwa; Meir, Lion Gai; Mpango, Richard S; Ngakongwa, Fileuka; Nudds, Hannah; Pathare, Soumitra; Ryan, Grace; Repper, Julie; Wharrad, Heather; Wolf, Philip; Slade, Mike; Mahlke, Candelaria",JMIR Ment Health,,328

The novel coronavirus pandemic and its subsequent response have laid bare the overall feebleness of public life in the US. The pandemic has made even more concrete the long-standing inequalities and injustices of the society by disproportionately affecting communities already disadvantaged in areas like income, health care, and housing. Some optimistic public thinkers have urged that this moment might be an opportunity to deliberate together about how to develop institutions of greater justice and the common good, while others argue that the historical record belies such a rosy view.

383115,Web workouts and consumer well-being: The role of digital-physical activity during the UK COVID-19 lockdown,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, the ongoing global pandemic. It has posed a worldwide challenge to human health as no effective treatment is currently available to combat the disease. Its severity has led to unprecedented collaborative initiatives for therapeutic solutions against COVID-19. Studies resorting to structure-based drug design for COVID-19 are plethoric and show good promise. Structural biology provides key insights into 3D structures, critical residues/mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins, implicated in infectivity, molecular recognition and susceptibility to a broad range of host species. The detailed understanding of viral proteins and their complexes with host receptors and candidate epitope/lead compounds is the key to developing a structure-guided therapeutic design. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, several structures of its proteins have been determined experimentally at an unprecedented speed and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Further, specialized structural bioinformatics tools and resources have been developed for theoretical models, data on protein dynamics from computer simulations, impact of variants/mutations and molecular therapeutics. Here, we provide an overview of ongoing efforts on developing structural bioinformatics tools and resources for COVID-19 research. We also discuss the impact of these resources and structure-based studies, to understand various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutic development. These include (i) understanding differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, leading to increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, (ii) deciphering key residues in the SARS-CoV-2 involved in receptor-antibody recognition, (iii) analysis of variants in host proteins that affect host susceptibility to infection and (iv) analyses facilitating structure-based drug and vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2.","Waman, Vaishali P; Sen, Neeladri; Varadi, Mihaly; Daina, Antoine; Wodak, Shoshana J; Zoete, Vincent; Velankar, Sameer; Orengo, Christine",Brief. bioinform,,328

To describe the effect of mass media communications on Twitter and Google Search user trends. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: United States. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Google Search and ""tweet"" frequency concerning COVID-19, smell, and nonsmell symptoms of COVID-19 generated between January 1 and April 8, 2020, were collected using Google Trends and Crimson Hexagon, respectively. Spearman coefficients linking each of these user trends to COVID-19 incidence were compared. Correlations obtained after excluding a short timeframe (March 22 to March 24) corresponding to the publication of a widely read lay media publication reporting anosmia as a symptom of infection was performed for comparative analysis. RESULTS: Google searches and tweets concerning all nonsmell symptoms (0.744 and 0.761, respectively) and COVID-19 (0.899 and 0.848) are more strongly correlated with disease incidence than smell loss (0.564 and 0.539). Twitter users tweeting about smell loss during the study period were more likely to be female (52%) than users tweeting about COVID-19 more generally (47%). Tweet and Google Search frequency pertaining to smell loss increased significantly (>2.5 standard deviations) following a widely read media publication linking smell loss and SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Google Search and tweet frequency regarding fever and shortness of breath are more robust indicators of COVID-19 incidence than anosmia. Mass media communications represent important confounders that should be considered in future analyses.","Panuganti, Bharat A; Jafari, Aria; MacDonald, Bridget; DeConde, Adam S",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,328
383150,A commentary on the Nigerian response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The management of the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on the approval of safe and effective vaccines but, equally importantly, on high vaccine acceptance among people. To facilitate vaccine acceptance via effective health communication, it is key to understand levels of vaccine scepticism and the demographic, psychological and political predictors. To this end, we examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We examine the levels and predictors of acceptance of an approved COVID-19 vaccine in large online surveys from eight Western democracies that differ in terms of the severity of the pandemic and their response: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Italy, UK and USA (total N=18 231). Survey respondents were quota sampled to match the population margins on age, gender and geographical location for each country. The study was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, allowing us to assess changes in acceptance and predictors as COVID-19 vaccine programmes were rolled out. OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome of the study is self-reported acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine approved and recommended by health authorities. RESULTS: The data reveal large variations in vaccine acceptance that ranges from 83% in Denmark to 47% in France and Hungary. Lack of vaccine acceptance is associated with lack of trust in authorities and scientists, conspiratorial thinking and a lack of concern about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most national levels of vaccine acceptance fall below estimates of the required threshold for herd immunity. The results emphasise the long-term importance of building trust in preparations for health emergencies such as the current pandemic. For health communication, the results emphasise the importance of focusing on personal consequences of infections and debunking of myths to guide communication strategies.","Lindholt, Marie Fly; Jørgensen, Frederik; Bor, Alexander; Petersen, Michael Bang",BMJ Open,,328

How COVID-19 Pandemic Induced Lockdown Influence Mental Health of Women in India? (preprint),2021,"Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a relatively rare condition, that usually presents with features of heart failure in the peripartum period. The ongoing pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported to be associated with myocarditis, with progression to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Dilated cardiomyopathy in a peripartum patient with COVID-19 infection may present a diagnostic dilemma. We report a case of dilated cardiomyopathy in a peripartum patient with COVID-19 infection. She presented with shortness of breath in the peripartum period. Chest X-ray showed a grossly enlarged heart with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent with congestive heart failure or viral pneumonia. Echocardiography revealed dilated chambers with 22% left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global hypokinesis. Despite completing 5 days of remdesivir and dexamethasone, she had worsening dyspnea on postpartum day 10, a repeat echocardiogram showed further reduction in LVEF to 10-15% and was discharged with a life-vest after acute management. She had multiple hospital admissions for decompensated heart failure. Myocardial core biopsy showed marked acute inflammation and necrosis. She had an intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular and right ventricular assist devices placed on account of persistent hemodynamic instability, and is now scheduled to have a cardiac transplant.","Akintayo, Akinyemi A; Addo, Basilio; Soleye, Saheed O; Patel, Dipal; Ahmad, Ayesha; Tongia, Shraddha",,,328

We study the potential of using on-demand services to improve train station access by means of a three-step sequential stated preference survey. We compare the preferences for on-demand services with the bicycle, car and public transport for accessing two alternative train stations at different access distances. We estimate a joint access mode and train station choice model. By estimating a latent class choice model, we uncover five distinct segments in the population. We describe the classes based on their stated preferences, travel behaviour, attitudes towards new mobility and their socio-demographic characteristics. The two largest classes, accounting for over half of the sample, are the most likely to adopt on-demand services. Having an average willingness-to-pay, they would choose these services for longer access distances, competing mainly with the car and local public transport. Applying the model estimates, we observe that while on-demand services mainly compete with public transportation (obtaining most of its travellers from it), they are not able to fully substitute a public transport service for train station access, as many users would switch to cycling or driving a car, rather than opting for the on-demand service.","Gervzinivc, N.; Cats, O.; Oort, N. van; Hoogendoorn-Lanser, S.; Hoogendoorn, S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00980v1.pdf,328

Little is known about the role of direct anticoagulants (DOACs) in COVID-19 related thrombosis. In this audit we sought to distinguish COVID-19 hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and record their outcomes over a period of 3 months (01/02/2020-30/04/2020). A total of 1583 patients were diagnosed with laboratory proven COVID-19 disease. Amongst them, 38 patients (0.82%) suffered VTE (median age 68 years, male/female: 20/18). VTE was the presenting symptom on admission in 71%. Pulmonary embolism was diagnosed in 92% of patients; 5 patients required intensive care and 3 underwent thrombolysis. 27 patients received initial treatment with unfractionated heparin/low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) while 10 were treated with direct anticoagulants (DOACs). After a median follow up of 25 days, 29 (76%) patients were alive while 5 were still hospitalised. Most patients (83%) were discharged on DOACs, no VTE recurrence or bleeding was recorded post-discharge. Our results suggest that direct anticoagulants could be a safe and effective treatment option in selected COVID-19 positive patients who have suffered venous thromboembolism.","Kartsios, Charalampos; Lokare, Anand; Osman, Husam; Perrin, Damian; Razaq, Shahzad; Ayub, Namrah; Daddar, Bobby; Fair, Susan",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,328

AIMS: To discuss the negative effects of garlic used as a preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study reports a case of oral mucosa burn on the dorsal surface of the tongue in a 72-year-old woman. The patient was using raw garlic daily during the pandemic to improve her immunological system. She scheduled a dental appointment and was assessed by teledentistry due to the pandemic, in which a detailed anamnesis was carried out. The burned area and ulceration were identified by video call and photographs. The patient was instructed to cease the habit immediately and change to a soft and non-acid/spicy/hot diet, which resulted in a great recovery 2 days later. She was monitored for 2 weeks until her tongue was completely healed. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the consequences of inappropriate use of natural product and how self-treatment could negatively influence oral health. Additionally, it shows the importance of teledentistry for oral diagnosis and treatment during a pandemic.","Muniz, Isis de Araújo Ferreira; Campos, Débora E Silva; Shinkai, Rosemary Sadami Arai; Trindade, Thiago Gomes da; Cosme-Trindade, Dúcia Caldas",Spec. care dentist,,328

As with the financial slump of 2008, however, such notions have proved almost ridiculously optimistic as it has been capital, through its near symbiosis with the state, that has been best able to respond, with the English government-the devolved nations adopted a markedly different approach-taking every opportunity to ensure the pandemic has proved a bonanza for private-sector healthcare interests. However, this has not just been about individual contracts in, for example, test and trace, vaccination, or personal protective equipment; the crisis has been used to both rescue the private acute market following 2 years of contracted revenues and to provide enormous stimulus for its future growth. This has required the support of several organizations acting in concert, including the NHS Confederation and the Royal Colleges. While the pandemic has served to illuminate such relationships, the author also argues that the oft-recurring governmental praise of the NHS needs to be matched by genuine investment in public hospitals.","Player, Stewart D",Int J Health Serv,,328

Early reports from studies with patients with long COVID suggests a constellation of symptoms with similarities to another chronic medical illness-myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A review study comparing and contrasting ME/CFS with reported symptoms of long COVID may yield mutualistic insight into the characterization and management of both conditions. Materials and Methods: A systemic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycInfo through to 31 January 2021 for studies related to long COVID symptomatology. The literature search was conducted in accordance with PRISMA methodology. Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the qualitative analysis. Long COVID symptoms reported by the included studies were compared to a list of ME/CFS symptoms compiled from multiple case definitions. Twenty-five out of 29 known ME/CFS symptoms were reported by at least one selected long COVID study. Conclusions: Early studies into long COVID symptomatology suggest many overlaps with clinical presentation of ME/CFS. The need for monitoring and treatment for patients post-COVID is evident.

389264,COVID-19 and the role of inequality in French regional departments,2021,"Under the pandemic of COVID-19, people experiencing COVID19-related symptoms or exposed to risk factors have a pressing need to consult doctors. Due to hospital closure, a lot of consulting services have been moved online. Because of the shortage of medical professionals, many people cannot receive online consultations timely. To address this problem, we aim to develop a medical dialogue system that can provide COVID19-related consultations. We collected two dialogue datasets -CovidDialog- (in English and Chinese respectively) containing conversations between doctors and patients about COVID-19. On these two datasets, we train several dialogue generation models based on Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT. Since the two COVID-19 dialogue datasets are small in size, which bears high risk of overfitting, we leverage transfer learning to mitigate data deficiency. Specifically, we take the pretrained models of Transformer, GPT, and BERT-GPT on dialog datasets and other large-scale texts, then finetune them on our CovidDialog datasets. Experiments demonstrate that these approaches are promising in generating meaningful medical dialogues about COVID-19. But more advanced approaches are needed to build a fully useful dialogue system that can offer accurate COVID-related consultations.

The aim of the present work is to review the most recent experimental evidence about telepsychotherapy, focusing on its effectiveness, possible determinants of efficacy and therapists/patients’ attitudes, to rapidly inform psychotherapists. Out of the 857 records found, 18 studies have been included in the review. Our results show that, despite therapists and public’s skepticism, telepsychotherapy is a trustworthy alternative to be adopted, which can be used efficaciously to treat common mental-health disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic distress. As well as in the traditional setting, a higher number of sessions and the proper management of patients’ expectations seem to be associated with better outcomes. On the contrary, low familiarity with web-based means of communication and technical issues might reduce specifically the effectiveness of telepsychotherapy.","Poletti, Barbara; Tagini, Sofia; Brugnera, Agostino; Parolin, Laura; Pievani, Luca; Ferrucci, Roberta; Compare, Angelo; Silani, Vincenzo",Couns.

Surgical risk assessment in these patients is often complex, considers all factors known to impact short- and long-term outcomes, and the additional risk that COVID-19 infection could convey in this patient population is unknown. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published risk factors (ECDC-RF) implicated in increased COVID-19 hospitalization and case-fatality which have been further evidenced by initial reports from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC reports additionally indicate that African American (AA) patients have incurred disparate infection outcomes in the United States. We set forth to survey the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database over a nearly 20 year span to inform ongoing risk assessment with an estimation of the prevalence of ECDC-RF in our veteran critical limb ischemia population and investigate whether an increased COVID-19 comorbidity burden exists for AA veterans presenting for major non-traumatic amputation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VASQIP database was queried for all above knee amputation (AKA) and below knee amputation (BKA) completed 1999-2018 after IRB approval (MIRB:#02507). Patient race and ECDC-RF including male gender, age > 60 years, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were recorded from preoperative patient history. AKA and BKA cohorts were compared via &#967;2-test with Yates correction or unpaired t-test and a subgroup analysis was conducted between AA and all other race patients for COVID-19 comorbidities in each cohort. RESULTS: VASQIP query returned 50,083 total entries. Average age was 65.1 ± 10.4 years and 68.2 ± 10.5 years for BKA and AKA cohorts, respectively, (P < .0001) and nearly all patients were male (99%). At least one ECDC-RF comorbidity was present in 25,526 (88.7%) of BKA and 17,558 (82.4%) of AKA patients (P < .0001). AA BKA patients were significantly more likely than non-AA BKA patients to present with at least one ECDC-RF comorbidity (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: According to a large national Veterans Affairs database, there are high rates of ECDC-RF in veteran amputees. During the present crisis, management of these patients should incorporate telehealth, expedient discharge, and ongoing COVID-19 transmission precautions.","Dittman, James M; Tse, Wayne; Amendola, Michael F",Mil. med,,328
391608,Mobilizing medical students for COVID-19 responses: Experience of Vietnam,2020,"The containment of infectious diseases is challenging due to complex transmutation in the biological system, intricate global interactions, intense mobility, and multiple transmission modes. An emergent disease has the potential to turn into a pandemic impacting millions of people with loss of life, mental health, and severe economic impairment. Multifarious approaches to risk management have been explored for combating an epidemic spread. This work presents the implementation of engineering safety principles to pandemic risk management. We have assessed the pandemic risk using Paté-Cornell's six levels of uncertainty. The susceptible, exposed, infected, quarantined, recovered, deceased (SEIQRD), an advanced mechanistic model, along with the Monte Carlo simulation, has been used to estimate the fatality risk. The risk minimization strategies have been categorized into hierarchical safety measures. We have developed an event tree model of pandemic risk management for distinct risk-reducing strategies realized due to natural evolution, government interventions, societal responses, and individual practices. The roles of distinct interventions have also been investigated for an infected individual's survivability with the existing healthcare facilities. We have studied the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) for pandemic risk management using the proposed framework. The results highlight effectiveness of the proposed strategies in containing a pandemic.","Alauddin, Md; Khan, Faisal; Imtiaz, Syed; Ahmed, Salim; Amyotte, Paul",,,328

Several companies developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In this study, we compared 4 different serology assays in convalescents up to 7 months post-infection. Both Abbott assays showed a significative decrease of IgG antibodies over time. Whereas the Elecsys Anti­SARS­CoV­2 N assay (Roche) initially showed a significant increase, antibody titers significantly decreased at the latest timepoint. Although not significant, the Elecsys Anti­SARS­CoV­2 S assay (Roche) showed tendency towards increasing titers overtime. Our data showed that results of SARS-CoV-2 serology should be interpreted with caution.","Schallier, Anneleen; De Baets, Sarah; De Bruyne, Dirk; Dauwe, Kenny; Herpol, Margaux; Couck, Pedro",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,328
393944,"The COVID-19 pandemic, stress, and trauma in the disability community: A call to action",2020,"Purpose: To characterize regional pulmonary function on CT images using a radiomic filtering approach. Methods: We develop a radiomic filtering technique to capture the image encoded regional pulmonary ventilation information on CT. The lung volumes were first segmented on 46 CT images. Then, a 3D sliding window kernel is implemented to map the impulse response of radiomic features. Specifically, for each voxel in the lungs, 53 radiomic features were calculated in such a rotationally-invariant 3D kernel to capture spatially-encoded information. Accordingly, each voxel coordinate is represented as a 53-dimensional feature vector, and each image is represented as an image tensor that we refer to as a feature map. To test the technique as a potential pulmonary biomarker, the Spearman correlation analysis is performed between the feature map and matched nuclear imaging measurements (Galligas PET or DTPA-SPECT) of lung ventilation. Results: Two features were found to be highly correlated with benchmark pulmonary ventilation function results based on the median of Spearman correlation coefficient () distribution. In particular, feature GLRLM-based Run Length Non-uniformity and GLCOM-based Sum Average achieved robust high correlation across 46 patients and both Galligas PET or DTPA-SPECT nuclear imaging modalities, with the range (median) of [0.05, 0.67] (0.46) and [0.21, 0.65] (0.45), respectively. Such results are comparable to other image-based pulmonary function quantification techniques. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that local regions of sparsely encoded homogenous lung parenchyma on CT are associated with diminished radiotracer uptake and measured lung ventilation defects on PET/SPECT imaging. This finding demonstrates the potential of radiomics to serve as a non-invasive surrogate of regional lung function and provides hypothesis-generating data for future studies.","Yang, Zhenyu; Lafata, Kyle; Chen, Xinru; Bowsher, James; Chang, Yushi; Wang, Chunhao; Yin, Fang-Fang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11171v1.pdf,328

China in late December and developed fever on 3 January 2020 while staying in Wuhan He did not visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or any other live animal markets in Wuhan He has indicated that he was in close contact with a person with pneumonia On 6 January, he traveled back to Japan and tested negative for influenza when he visited a local clinic on the same day On 10 January 2020, due to his continued symptoms of cough, sore throat and fever, he visited a local hospital and was found to have abnormal chest x-ray with infiltrates He was admitted to the hospital on the same day and had remained febrile until 14 January On 14 January, his attending doctor notified the case to a local public health authority under the surveillance system for “Unidentified Serious Infectious Illness” Samples were collected and sent to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), and at NIID, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and sequencing was performed twice, which identified very small amount of 2019-nCoV RNA on 15 January 2020 On 15 January, the case-patient was afebrile and was discharged from hospital Currently, he is staying at home in a stable condition Public health response Contact tracing and other epidemiological investigations are underway by the local health authorities in Japan;The Japanese Government has scaled up a whole-of-government coordination mechanism on the 16 January;The MHLW has strengthened surveillance for undiagnosed severe acute respiratory illnesses since the report of undiagnosed pneumonia in Wuhan, China;From 6 January, MHLW requested local health governments to be aware of the respiratory illnesses in Wuhan by using the existing surveillance system for serious infectious illness with unknown etiology;NIID is supporting local authorities on epidemiologic investigations including contact tracing;Quarantine and screening measures have been enhanced for travelers from Wuhan city at the point of entries since 7 January;NIID established an in-house PCR assay for nCoV on 16 January;Revision of the risk assessment by NIID is being conducted, including case definition of close contacts;The public risk

all available information to fully understand the extent of transmissibility between people and likelihood of zoonotic spillover WHO advice Although the source of the novel coronavirus causing this cluster of pneumonia and the mode(s) of transmission are unknown, it would be prudent to remind populations and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections: Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals;People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands);Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments;WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travelers In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider Travel guidance has been updated Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travellers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators and at points of entry WHO has provided interim guidance for

Its spontaneous evolution remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous evolution of olfactory disorders in COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 229 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from March 1 through 31, 2020 in our institution were included. Among them, 140 patients (mean age, 38.5 years, 89 women) reported sudden olfactory/gustatory disorders during COVID-19. All patients were interviewed by phone based on a questionnaire with 16 questions at time of survey. The primary end point was olfactory recovery rate at time of survey. RESULTS: The frequency of patients with olfactory disorders was higher before March 20, 2020 than since (70.3% vs. 53.9%, respectively) (P = .016). At time of survey (26 days of the mean time from anosmia onset), 95.71% reported to start an olfactory recovery. The mean time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset was 11.6 days. Recovery started between the fourth and the fifteenth day after olfactory loss onset in 78.4% of patients. Complete olfactory recovery happened for 51.43% of patients. There was a significant relationship between the complete olfactory recovery and a short time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset (P = .0004), absence of nasal obstruction (P = .023) and absence of sore/dry/tingling feeling in the nose (P = .007) in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of spontaneous evolution of olfactory disorders allows reassuring patients and planning therapeutic strategies for persistent olfactory dysfunction after having definitely recovered from COVID-19.

The COVID 19 neurological consequences occur more frequently even in mild cases, presenting with CNS involvement in up to 25%, musculoskeletal and peripheral manifestation (PNM). Through preceding ECoVs case reports, the PNM not linked to fatal outcomes, however, required, repeated neuro-imaging as notable CT and MRI changes appeared as late as 21 days while the likelihood of Cerebrospinal fluid to test positive for ECoV was 25%, only in the CNS presenting cases. Owing to 44-60% myalgia presentation, risk of the high inflammatory state, and coagulation cascade abnormalities reported in ECoVs, testing for C-reactive protein, serum creatine kinase, and D-dimer level is mandatory. Presently, there is no antiviral medication or vaccination for the ECoVs, early induction of antiviral drugs remains the backbone of management. Neurologically, the therapeutic dosages of anticoagulants are linked to the high incidence of thrombotic complexities, while methylprednisolone is associated with myopathy.

The Gender Similarities Hypothesis suggests there are more similarities than differences and the Divorce Stress Adjustment Perspective suggests that structural inequalities may contribute to adverse postdivorce outcomes. We conducted secondary analyses from an RCT study to investigate if there were gender-specific trajectories and whether gender was associated with outcomes (self-perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization, general hostility, and overall mental and physical health) after controlling for effects of the intervention, income, and number of children using linear mixed-effect regression modeling, and whether number of children and income influenced these outcomes. Participants were 1,239 women and 617 men from the Cooperation after Divorce (CAD) study, conducted in Denmark, a country with less income disparity, high gender equality, shared childrearing by men and women, and societal acceptance of divorce. The analyses assessing the relationship between gender and 12-month postdivorce adjustment in terms of physical and mental health outcomes revealed that for self-perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization, hostility, and overall mental and physical health in this sample postdivorce adjustment trajectories were not gender-specific, and gender was only significantly associated with stress and somatization as a time-invariant additive effect. These findings suggest gender similarities in postdivorce adjustment and contribute to the Gender Similarities Hypothesis and the Divorce-Stress-Adjustment-Perspective by assessing individuals' postdivorce adjustment in a low-stigma and relatively egalitarian setting, providing a clearer assessment of the role of gender without potentially confounding issues of structural inequalities.

In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic records were queried (02/26-07/14/2020) to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit generalized linear models for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. In the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95% CI 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization, and 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.94] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, Black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The models can be applied to predict the absolute risks of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid in individualizing the decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not readily available.","Dashti, Hesam; Roche, Elise C; Bates, David William; Mora, Samia; Demler, Olga",Sci Rep,,328
403467,Behavioral and Psychological Correlates of Well-Being during COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus identified as the cause of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and spread now in 210 countries and territories around the world. Many people are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. However, in some cases (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities) the disease may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction that can lead to death. Such wide interindividual differences in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may relate to several pathogen- and host-related factors. These include the different levels of the ubiquitously present human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors gene expression and its variant alleles, the different binding affinities of ACE2 to the virus spike (S) protein given its L- and S-subtypes and the subsequent extent of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia. The extensive synthesis of cytokines and chemokines in coronavirus diseases was suggested as a major factor in exacerbating lung damage and other fatal complications. The polymorphisms in genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been associated with mediating the response and susceptibility to a wide range of infections and their severe outcomes. Understanding the nature of pathogen-host interaction in COVID-19 symptomatology together with the role of hypercytokinemia in disease severity may permit developing new avenues of approach for prevention and treatment and can delineate public health measures to control the spread of the disease.","Badawi, Alaa",J Inflamm Res,,328

Current data regarding disease characteristics and outcomes in this population is limited. AIM: To delineate the adverse factors associated with outcomes of COVID- 19 patients &#8805;75 years of age. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients were classified into mild/moderate, severe/very severe, and critical disease (intubated) based on oxygen requirements. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 355 patients aged &#8805;75 years hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 19th and April 25th, 2020 were included. Mean age was 84.3 years. One-third of the patients developed critical disease. Mean length of stay was 7.10 days. Vasopressors were required in 27%, with the highest frequency in the critical disease group (74.1%). Overall mortality was 57.2%, with a significant difference between severity groups (mild/moderate disease : 17.4%, severe/very severe disease : 71.3%, critical disease: 94.9%, p < 0.001). Increased age, dementia, and severe/very severe and critical disease groups were each significantly associated with increased odds for mortality while diarrhea was associated with decreased odds for mortality (OR : 0.12, 95% CI : 0.02-0.60, p < 0.05)]. None of the cardiovascular comorbidities were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Age and dementia are associated with increased odds for mortality in patients &#8805;75 years of age hospitalized with COVID-19. Those who require intubation have the greatest odds for mortality. Diarrhea as a presenting symptom was associated with lower odds for mortality.","Raheja, Hitesh; Chukwuka, Nnamdi; Agarwal, Chirag; Sharma, Dikshya; Munoz-Martinez, Alejandro; Fogel, Joshua; Khalid, Mazin; Hashmi, Arsalan Talib; Ehrlich, Samantha; Waheed, Maham Akbar; Siddiqui, Sabah; de Brito Gomes, Bruno Augusto; Aslam, Awais; Gualan, Carlos Jose Merino; Aftab, Iqra; Tiwari, Aparna; Singh, Sehajpareet; Pouching, Kristal; Somal, Navjot; Shani, Jacob; Rojas-Marte, Geurys R",QJM,,328

Recently it has been noticed that the viral Spike protein has an RGD motif, suggesting that cell surface integrins may be co-receptors. We examined the sequences of ACE2 and integrins with the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource, ELM, and were presented with candidate short linear motifs (SLiMs) in their short, unstructured, cytosolic tails with potential roles in endocytosis, membrane dynamics, autophagy, cytoskeleton and cell signalling. These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates. They suggest potential interactions with the AP2 mu2 subunit as well as I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins present in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2 and integrin beta3, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit autophagy components. We also noticed that the extracellular part of ACE2 has a conserved MIDAS structural motif, which are commonly used by beta integrins for ligand binding, potentially supporting the proposal that integrins and ACE2 share common ligands. The findings presented here identify several molecular links and testable hypotheses that might help uncover the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 attachment, entry and replication, and strengthen the possibility that it might be possible to develop host-directed therapies to dampen the efficiency of viral entry and hamper disease progression. The strong sequence conservation means that these putative SLiMs are good candidates: Nevertheless, SLiMs must always be validated by experimentation before they can be stated to be functional.","M'esz'aros, B'alint; S'amano-S'anchez, Hugo; Alvarado-Valverde, Jes'us; vCalyvseva, Jelena; Mart'inez-P'erez, Elizabeth; Alves, Renato; Kumar, Manjeet; Rippmann, Friedrich; Chemes, Luc'ia B.; Laboratory, Toby J.

408041,Forging ahead from adaptations of teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives from multiple pharmacy programs,2020,"The mammalian olfactory system enables to sense and distinguish a large number of odors, which is essential to find food, avoid predators, communicate and reproduce, while the human olfactory system can even avoid potential hazard by discriminating the smell quality. Olfactory dysfunction is a common disease symptom which seriously affects the life quality of patients. In addition, many studies have revealed that olfactory dysfunction can also indicate many other potential diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and mental diseases. Olfactory dysfunction is an early common symptom of a variety of diseases, such as inflammation, viral infection, neurodegenerative diseases, and the current epidemic of COVID-19. Researchers have indicated that some patients with certain diseases already have suffered from symptoms of olfactory dysfunction early in the clinic. For instance, one of the early clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is the loss of smell. Besides, patients suffered from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease usually have an increased threshold of olfactory perception and even endure anosmia. Therefore, research on early screening and diagnosis of dysosmia diseases on the basis of olfactory function detection is of great significance to control and slow the disease's progression and to improve the health of human body. At present, olfactory function detection technologies mainly contain olfactory neuropsychological testing, electrophysiological detection, olfaction system structure or functional imaging, etc. Although these technologies have played an important role in the study of dysosmia, there have been no standardized detection indicators established so far. Therefore, the establishment and improvement of early olfactory dysfunction disease diagnosis technology based on the detection of olfactory function requires a novel approach in principle and technology. By utilizing the bionic olfactory sensing technologies such as bioelectronic noses, the olfactory analog sensing system with high sensitivity, high specificity and short response time, and even simulating biological olfactory systems, can be expected to be realized. Based on the current understanding of the mechanism of olfactory dysfunction, our team is committed to breaking through the traditional odor-induced olfactory function detection method. By combining with the bionic olfactory perception technology, three original methods which include olfactory neural network chip, organoid chip and neural interactive olfaction detection technology have been proposed. These three technologies essentially construct and simulate the olfactory nervous system in vitro or in vivo, by means of the sensing technique to detect physiological signals changes that correspond with the alternations in the nervous system. However, the difficulties currently lie in how to determine the characteristic physiological signal, and how to establish the correlation between the characteristic signals and the degree of dysosmia for the ultimate goal of further screening the olfactory dysfunction related diseases through the detection parameters. The clarification of these difficulties and in-depth progress of research will promote the innovation and development of olfactory function detection technology, and provide reliable theoretical technical support and experimental basis. This review comprehensively interpreted the current research status of dysosmia diseases, as well as analyzed the principles of bionic olfactory perception technology and its research progress in the detection and diagnosis of dysosmia and related diseases. With the development of multidisciplinary intersection in the field of biomedical engineering, the transformation and application of cell network chips, organoid bionic chips and braincomputer interaction technology will promote the progress of bionic olfactory perception technology in the research of olfactory dysfunction diseases and the innovation of clinical diseases diagnosis. © 2021, Science Press.

However, the outcomes of recovered patients have not been well defined. METHODS: This is a prospective observational follow-up study of survivors with COVID-19 from a designated tertiary center in Hefei, China. We examined chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, pulmonary function, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and 36 item Short Form General Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS: Among 81 enrolled patients, 62 (77%) patients and 61 (75%) patients, respectively, completed 1-month and 3-month follow-ups. Abnormal CT findings were still present in 73% of patients at 1 month and 54% at 3 months, whereas chest CT scan scores improved progressively at 1-month (5.0 ± 5.1) and 3-month follow up (3.0 ± 4.5) compared with that during hospitalization (11 ± 6.8). Mild restrictive pulmonary impairment was detected in 11% and 10% of patients at 1-month and 3-month follow up, respectively. The 6MWD was 523 ± 77 m in male patients and 484 ± 58 m in female patients, which was significantly lower than in healthy controls (606 ± 68 m, 568 ± 78 m, p < 0.001). SF-36 scores were significantly impaired in the domains of role physical (RP), role emotional (RE), and social functioning (SF) compared with the normal age-matched population. RP was improved at 3-month compared with 1-month follow up in the 41-64 years group (p < 0.01). Multivariable analysis showed that older age (over 40 years) and steroid administration during hospitalization were independently associated with worse chest CT scores at 3-month follow up. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 months, chest CT abnormalities were present in one half of COVID-19 survivors and worse chest CT scores were independently associated with older age and steroid administration during hospitalization. Residual pulmonary function impairments were modest, whereas exercise capacity and SF-36 scores were significantly lower than the general population.

Population-based evidence on potential explanatory factors across minority groups and within subgroups is lacking. This study aims to quantify the association between ethnicity and the risk of hospitalisation and mortality due to COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a retrospective cohort study of adults registered across a representative and anonymised national primary care database (QResearch) that includes data on 10 million people in England. Sociodemographic, deprivation, clinical and domicile characteristics will be summarised and compared across ethnic subgroups (categorised as per 2011 census). Cox models will be used to calculate HR for hospitalisation and COVID-19 mortality associated with ethnic group. Potential confounding and explanatory factors (such as demographic, socioeconomic and clinical) will be adjusted for within regression models. The percentage contribution of distinct risk factor classes to the excess risks seen in ethnic groups/subgroups will be calculated.

We performed a literature research to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) of in-hospital mortality and major bleeding comparing among intermediate-to-therapeutic dose AC, prophylactic dose AC, and no AC. Until October 22, 2020, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library Database were searched for studies reporting AC utilization and mortality in COVID-19. Studies with suspected risk of bias were excluded before the synthesis of pooled ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. Of 37 identified studies (N = 19,510), 17 (N = 17,833) were aggregated in the meta-analysis. The overall mortality rate was 23.1% (95% CI 18.7-28.2). The pooled odds of mortality comparing anticoagulated to non-anticoagulated patients were similar, but lower in prophylactic dose AC group (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.73-0.95). Notably, intermediate-to-therapeutic dose AC increased mortality (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.11-2.31) and major bleeding compared to prophylactic dose AC (OR 3.33; 95% CI 2.34-4.72). Our findings support the optimal efficacy and safety profiles of prophylactic dose AC in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Moonla, Chatphatai; Sosothikul, Darintr; Chiasakul, Thita; Rojnuckarin, Ponlapat; Uaprasert, Noppacharn",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,328

The complex and harsh experience provoked a hypomanic response such as elated feelings with increased energy, decreased need for sleep and an increase in goal-directed activity, which allowed him to continue working, even though he was adversely affected by the disaster. However, 3.5 years later, when he suffered further psychological damage, his PTSD symptoms became evident. In addition to treating mood disorders, trauma-focused psychotherapy was required for his recovery.

The purpose of our study was to determine useful criteria for the differentiation of patients with acute clinical syndromes and suspicion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Materials and Methods: This was an observational retrospective study, conducted in an internal medicine clinic from April to May 2020. We collected clinical, biological, and computed tomography (CT) data on patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases and clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients with an already-positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 on presentation at the emergency department were excluded from our study. Results: Of 253 suspected cases, 20 were laboratory-confirmed as having SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, whereas COVID-19 diagnosis was ruled out in the remaining 233. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) correlated significantly with COVID-19 diagnosis in suspected patients, while laboratory markers were not significantly different between the two groups. Of the suspected patients, significantly higher percentages of dry cough, fever, myalgias, sore throat, loss of smell and appetite, and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) on CT were found in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that, until receiving the result of an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 (usually 12-24 h), association with VTE as a comorbidity, fever, dry cough, and myalgia as clinical features, and GGO on CT are the main markers for the identification of COVID-19 patients among those suspected with acute clinical syndromes. Our results also provide evidence for doctors not to rely solely on biological markers in the case of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with exacerbations of chronic diseases. These data are useful for faster decision-making with regard to suspected COVID-19 patients before receiving RT-PCR test results, thus avoiding keeping patients in crowded emergency departments.","Haliga, Raluca Ecaterina; Sorodoc, Victorita; Lionte, Catalina; Petris, Ovidiu Rusalim; Bologa, Cristina; Coman, Adorata Elena; Vata, Luminita Gina; Puha, Gabriela; Dumitrescu, Gabriela; Sirbu, Oana; Stoica, Alexandra; Ceasovschih, Alexandr; Constantin, Mihai; Nicoleta Catana, Andreea; Jaba, Elisabeta; Sorodoc, Laurentiu",Medicina (Kaunas),,328

Flavonoids exist in many diets as well as in traditional medicine, and their modern subset, indole-chalcones, are effective in fighting various diseases. Hence, these flavonoids and structurally similar indole chalcones derivatives were studied in silico for their pharmacokinetic properties including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity (ADMET) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties against their proteins, namely, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (rdrp), main protease (Mpro) and Spike (S) protein via homology modelling and docking. Interactions were studied with respect to biology and function of SARS-CoV-2 proteins for activity. Functional/structural roles of amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and, the effect of flavonoid and indole chalcone interactions which may cause disease suppression are discussed. The results reveal that out of 23 natural flavonoids and 25 synthetic indole chalcones, 30 compounds are capable of Mpro deactivation as well as potentially lowering the efficiency of Mpro function. Cyanidin may inhibit RNA polymerase function and, Quercetin is found to block interaction sites on the viral spike. These results suggest flavonoids and their modern pharmaceutical cousins, indole chalcones are capable of fighting SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of these 30 compounds needs to be studied further for complete understanding and confirmation of their inhibitory potential.","Vijayakumar, Balaji Gowrivel; Ramesh, Deepthi; Joji, Annu; Jayachandra Prakasan, Jayadharini; Kannan, Tharanikkarasu",Eur J Pharmacol,,328

In this context, longitudinal data on proportions of positive results in different age groups are rare. Data on total positive counts and on shares of positive counts deriving from a private (MVZ) and a University (RWTH) laboratory were analyzed retrospectively and compared with public data on total positive counts of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Data were covered for Weeks 9-24 of the year 2020 and all patient ages. Total positive counts were lower in children compared to adults. Proportions of children and adults tested positive were 3%-5% and 5%-7%, respectively. RKI and MVZ data showed similar time-related patterns. Patients of 20-60 years of age did account for the initial virus spread (maximum infection rates at Weeks 9-11). Thereafter, infection rates decreased in older patients whereas children did not show a comparable time-related decrease. Pediatric data generated in outpatient settings and hospitals differed markedly which should be considered in further studies. In summary, compared with adults children are less affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections and are unlikely to account for the initial viral spread.

We enrolled a cohort of 545 COVID-19 patients from Hubei, China, who were followed up up to 7 months, and determined the dynamics of NAbs to SARS-CoV-2 by using a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). In our validation study, sVNT IC50 titers and the neutralization rate measured at a single dilution (1:20) were well correlated with FRNT titers (r = 0.85 and 0.84, respectively). The median time to seroconversion of NAbs was 5.5 days post onset of symptoms. The rate of positive sVNT was 52% in the first week, reached 100% in the third week, and remained above 97% till 6 months post onset. Quantitatively, NAbs peaked in the fourth week and only a quarter of patients had an estimated peak titer of >1000. NAbs declined with a half-time of 61 days (95% CI: 49-80 days) within the first two months, and the decay deaccelerated to a half-time of 104 days (95% CI: 86-130 days) afterward. The peak levels of NAbs were positively associated with severity of COVID-19 and age, while negatively associated with serum albumin levels. The observation that the low-moderate peak neutralizing activity and fast decay of NAbs in most naturally infected individuals called for caution in evaluating the feasibility of antibody-based therapy and vaccine durability. NAbs response positively correlated with disease severity, warning for the possibility of repeat infection in patients with mild COVID-19.","Xu, Xin; Nie, Sheng; Wang, Yanqun; Long, Quanxin; Zhu, Hong; Zhang, Xiaoyong; Sun, Jian; Zeng, Qinglang; Zhao, Jincun; Liu, Li; Li, Ling; Huang, Ailong; Hou, Jinlin; Hou, Fan Fan",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,328

412421,Guarding a city from the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Translation of community-based functional training for older adults to reduce frailty is still lacking. We evaluated the effectiveness and implementation of a community-delivered group-based functional power training (FPT) program for frail older adults within their neighborhoods. A two-arm, multicenter assessor-blind stratified randomized controlled trial was conducted at four local senior activity centers in Singapore. Sixty-one community-dwelling older adults with low handgrip strength were randomized to intervention (IG) or control (CG) group. The IG underwent the FPT program (power and balance exercises using simple equipment) delivered by a community service provider. The 12-week program comprised 2 × 60 min sessions/week. CG continued usual activities at the centers. Functional performance, muscle strength, and frailty status were assessed at baseline and 3 months. Program implementation was evaluated using RE-AIM framework. The program was halted due to Coronavirus Disease 2019-related suspension of senior center activities. Results are reported from four centers, which completed the program. IG showed significantly greater improvement in the Short Physical Performance Battery test as compared to CG (p = 0.047). No effects were found for timed up and go test performance, muscle strength, and frailty status. The community program exhibited good reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation. Our study demonstrated that FPT was associated with greater improvement in physical function in pre-frail/frail participants as compared to exercise activities offered at local senior activity centers. It is a feasible intervention that can be successfully implemented for frail older adults in their neighborhoods. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04438876.

412517,Wellbeing of a selection of seafarers in Eastern Adriatic Sea during the COVID-19 pandemic 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: Previous literature shows systematic differences in health according to socioeconomic status (SES). However, there is no clear evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 infection might be different across SES in Portugal. This work identifies the COVID-19 worst-affected municipalities at four different time points in Portugal measured by prevalence of cases, and seeks to determine if these worst-affected areas are associated with SES. METHODS: The worst-affected areas were defined using the spatial scan statistic for the cumulative number of cases per municipality. The likelihood of being in a worst-affected area was then modelled using logistic regressions, as a function of area-based SES and health services supply. The analyses were repeated at four different time points of the COVID-19 pandemic: 1st of April, 1st of May, 1st of June, and 1st of July, corresponding to two moments before and during the confinement period and two moments thereafter. RESULTS: Twenty municipalities were identified as worst-affected areas in all four time points, most in the coastal area in the Northern part of the country. The areas of lower unemployment were less likely to be a worst-affected area on the 1st of April [AOR = 0.36 (0.14; 0.91)], on the 1st of May [AOR = 0.03 (0.00; 0.41)], and on the 1st of July [AOR = 0.40 (0.16; 1.05)]. CONCLUSION: This study shows a relationship between being in a worst-affected area and unemployment. Governments and public health authorities should formulate measures and be prepared to protect the most vulnerable groups.","Alves, Joana; Soares, Patrícia; Rocha, João Victor; Santana, Rui; Nunes, Carla",Eur. j. public health,,328

413030,Public behaviour in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: understanding the role of group processes,2020,"Background: In March 2020 elective total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) were suspended across the United States in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We had previously published the results of a survey to the affected patients from 6 institutions. We now present the results of a larger distribution of this survey, through May and June 2020, to electively scheduled patients representing different regions of the United States. Methods: Fifteen centers identified through the AAHKS Research Committee participated in a survey study of THA and TKA patients. Patients scheduled for primary elective THA or TKA but canceled due to the COVID-19 elective surgery stoppage (3/2020-5/2020) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics along with subgroup analysis with Wilcoxon rank were performed. Results: In total, surveys were distributed to 2135 patients and completed by 848 patients (40%) from 15 institutions. Most patients (728/848, 86%) had their surgery postponed or canceled by the surgeon or hospital. Unknown length of surgical delay remained the highest source of anxiety among survey participants. Male patients were more likely to be willing to proceed with surgery in spite of COVID-19. There were minimal regional differences in responses. Only 61 patients (7%) stated they will continue to delay surgery for fear of contracting COVID-19 while in the hospital. Conclusion: Similar to the previous study, the most anxiety-provoking thought was the uncertainty over if and when the canceled joint replacement surgery could be rescheduled. Patients suffering from the daily pain of hip and knee arthritis that have been scheduled for elective arthroplasty remain eager to have their operation as soon as elective surgery is allowed to resume.","Brown, Timothy S; Bedard, Nicholas A; Rojas, Edward O; Anthony, Christopher A; Schwarzkopf, Ran; Stambough, Jeffrey B; Nandi, Sumon; Prieto, Hernan; Parvizi, Javad; Bini, Stefano A; Higuera, Carlos A; Piuzzi, Nicholas S; Blankstein, Michael; Wellman, Samuel S; Dietz, Matthew J; Jennings, Jason M; Dasa, Vinod",Arthroplast Today,,328

414375,"We May Develop Medications Effective against COVID-19, but Can We Distribute Them Equitably?",2020,"BACKGROUND: It is expected that COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China by the end of 2020. Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children's vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics. RESULTS: The prevalence of parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China. The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.","Zhang, Ke Chun; Fang, Yuan; Cao, He; Chen, Hongbiao; Hu, Tian; Chen, Ya Qi; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Wang, Zixin",JMIR Pediatr Parent,,328
414617,The effect on and experience of families with a member who has Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: developing an investigation,2020,Purpose This paper aims to examine developments in tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic using the hotel sector in the North-East of England as the area of study. The country has attracted a lot of attention not only because of its importance as a tourism destination but also due to its rather controversial management of the pandemic at least in its early stages. Design/methodology/approach Fifteen semi-structured interviews based on ten open-ended questions were conducted with North East of England-based hotel managers of international brands on the level of their hotels' preparedness to effectively deal with pandemic cases. The interviews took place in August and September 2020 with participants kept anonymous. Findings Meeting new operational and bureaucratic requirements added to the cost structure and proved a major challenge for managers who saw their hotel occupancy rates and revenue collapsing within a short period of time. Innovative and aggressive pricing strategies were introduced to lure especially younger travelers in the absence of business clientele. Staff were made redundant and/or asked to work overtime making effective human resource management very difficult. Originality/value This is one of the first research attempts to highlight the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic for the hotel sector in a major region of the UK. The paper also attempts some generalization by discussing managerial implications and suggesting a possible way forward for the hotel sector. Developing resilience by building on previously used successful business practices proves of essence.,"Spanaki, M. Z.; Papatheodorou, A.; Pappas, N.",Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes,,328

415409,COVID-19 pandemic preventive behaviors and causal beliefs among Italian community dwelling adults,2020,"The governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic include concerns for both public health and formal social control. Government leaders asked the public to help mitigate the spread of the virus by adopting various protective behaviors. Our purpose was to evaluate and explain defiance of COVID-19 mitigation strategies, drawing from the expanded model of deterrence and protection motivation theory. A national sample of 600 American adults were surveyed about perceptions of, and behaviors during, the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, including defiance of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Perceived severity of the disease, certainty about dying from it, and how much control one has over getting it each predicted fear of COVID-19. Defiance of COVID-19 mitigation guidelines appear to be a combination of rational choice considerations and emotions.

Methods: The experimental method was used. Twelve healthy adult New Zealand long-eared rabbits were divided into normal control group and scar group, with 6 rabbits in each group. The hypertrophic scar model of long-eared rabbit was made according to the literature, and the rats in normal control group were subjected to no disposal. At 60 days after modeling, hematoxylin eosin(HE) staining was used to detect the morphology of skin tissue cells in the two groups. The mRNA expressions of miR-296 and transforming growth factor-ß1(TGF-ß1) were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Human fibroblasts (HFbs) were divided into psiCHECK-WT-TGF-ß1+miR-296 negative control group, psiCHECK-WT-TGF-ß1+miR-296 mimic group, psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-ß1+miR-296 negative control group, and psiCHECK-MUT-TGF-ß1+miR-296 mimic group. And the corresponding sequence were transfected respectively. At 48 h after transfection, luciferase reporter gene detection kit was used to detect the luciferase and renal luciferase expression of miR-296 and TGF-ß1 in each group, and the ratio was used to reflect the gene expression level. Two batches of HFbs were used and divided into miR-296 negative control group and miR-296 mimic group, transfecting the corresponding sequence. The first batch of cells were used. At 0 (immediately), 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after transfection, the cell proliferation was detected by thiazolyl blue method. The second batch of cells were used. At 24 h after transfection, the expression of TGF-ß1 and collagen type I was detected by Western blotting. The number of samples in cell experiment was 3. Data were statistically analyzed with analysis of variance factorial design, one-way analysis of variance, independent-samples t test, LSD-t test and Pearson correlation coefficient regression. Results: At 60 days after modeling, Fbs in scar group were hyperplastic and arranged abnormally; Fbs in normal control group were evenly arranged without morphological abnormality. The mRNA expression of miR-296 in scar group(0.652±0.107) was significantly lower than that in normal control group(1.192±0.121, t=5.175, P<0.01). The mRNA expression of TGF-ß1 in scar group(1.467±0.065) was significantly higher than that in normal control group(1.105±0.030, t=12.410, P<0.01). Pearson correlation coefficient analysis showed that there was a negative correlation between the mRNA expression of miR-296 and TGF-ß1(F=7.278, P<0.05), and the equation was y=-1.151x+2.066, R2=0.421. At 48 h after transfection, the expression of TGF-ß1 luciferase / renal luciferase in psiCHECK-WT-TGF-ß1+ miR-296 mimic group was significantly lower than that in psiCHECK-WT-TGF-ß1 + miR-296 negative control group(t=35.190, P<0.01). At 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after transfection, the HFbs proliferation ability in miR-296 mimic group were significantly lower than that in miR-296 negative control group(t=3.275ã11.980ã10.460ã17.260ï¼P<0.05 or P<0.01). At 24 h after transfection, the protein expression of TGF-ß1 and type I collagen in negative control group was significantly higher than that in miR-296 mimic group(t=3.758, 29.390, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: miR-296 expression in rabbit hypertrophic scars is down-regulated; miR-296 can inhibit the proliferation of HFbs and the expression of type I collagen by down regulating the expression of TGF-ß1.","Guo, B Y; Lin, F; Bai, Z M; Tao, K; Wang, H Y",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,,328
416614,Response to the COVID-19 pandemic in India: case studies on leadership in crisis situations. (Special Issue: COVID-19: supporting scientific surge.),2020,"Research suggests that emerging information about infection-acquired COVID-19 immunity should be interpreted with caution. The introduction of ""immunity passports"" that would enable people who have recovered from COVID-19 to travel freely and return to work may therefore have detrimental consequences if not managed carefully. In two studies, we examined how perceived (suspected or imagined) recovery from COVID-19, and the concept of immunity passports, influence people's intentions to engage in behaviors aimed to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We also consider ways to lessen potential negative effects. In Study 1 (N = 1604), participants asked to imagine that they had recovered from COVID-19 reported lower social distancing intentions compared to a control condition. Participants who suspected (versus imagined) that they had recovered from past infection did not report lower preventative intentions compared to the control condition, even at high levels of certainty of past infection. In Study 2 (N = 1732), introducing the idea of immunity passports also reduced social distancing intentions compared to a control condition. The latter effect was, however, attenuated when cautious information about the equivocal science on COVID-19 was also presented to participants. Participants who suspected that they had COVID-19 in the past (compared to the control condition) revealed a similar pattern of results, but only at higher levels of certainty of past infection. Caution regarding infection-acquired COVID-19 immunity and immunity passports will be crucial in the COVID-19 response. Implications for premature pandemic announcements, as well as their potential remedies, are discussed.","Green, Ricky; Biddlestone, Mikey; Douglas, Karen M",,,328

417684,The impact of the covid-19 pandemic on lifestyle behaviors in U.S. college students,2021,"Objective: To evaluate two pooled-sample analysis strategies (a routine high-throughput approach and a novel context-sensitive approach) for mass testing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with an emphasis on the number of tests required to screen a population. Methods: We used Monte Carlo simulations to compare the two testing strategies for different infection prevalences and pooled group sizes. With the routine high-throughput approach, heterogeneous sample pools are formed randomly for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. With the novel context-sensitive approach, PCR analysis is performed on pooled samples from homogeneous groups of similar people that have been purposively formed in the field. In both approaches, all samples contributing to pools that tested positive are subsequently analysed individually. Findings: Both pooled-sample strategies would save substantial resources compared to individual analysis during surge testing and enhanced epidemic surveillance. The context-sensitive approach offers the greatest savings: for instance, 58-89% fewer tests would be required for a pooled group size of 3 to 25 samples in a population of 150 000 with an infection prevalence of 1% or 5%. Correspondingly, the routine high-throughput strategy would require 24-80% fewer tests than individual testing. Conclusion: Pooled-sample PCR screening could save resources during COVID-19 mass testing. In particular, the novel context-sensitive approach, which uses pooled samples from homogeneous population groups, could substantially reduce the number of tests required to screen a population. Pooled-sample approaches could help countries sustain population screening over extended periods of time and thereby help contain foreseeable second-wave outbreaks.","Deckert, Andreas; Bärnighausen, Till; Kyei, Nicholas Na",Bull World Health Organ,,328

The purpose of this international survey was to assess optimal timing, technique and outcome for this intervention. METHODS: An online survey was generated. Otorhinolaryngologists from both the United Kingdom and Abroad were polled with regards to their experience of tracheostomy in COVID-19 positive ventilated patients. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 50 respondents from 16 nations. The number of ventilated patients totalled 3403, on average 9.7% required a tracheostomy. This was on average performed on day 14 following intubation. The majority of patients were successfully weaned (mean 7.4 days following tracheostomy). CONCLUSION: The results of this brief survey suggest that tracheostomy is of benefit in selected patients. There was insufficient data to suggest improved outcomes with either percutaneous vs an open surgical technique.","D039,; Souza, Ayman; Simo, Ricard; Souza, Alwyn; Vaz, Francis; Prior, Andrew; Kanegaonkar, Rahul",Head Neck,,328

Their importance for vacuolar (plants) and endo-lysosomal (animals) function highlights them as a very attractive system to study, both theoretically and experimentally. Indicated as key players in the trafficking of the cell, today they are considered a new potential target for avoiding virus infections, including those from coronaviruses. A particular boost for theoretical examinations has been made with recent high-resolution X-ray and cryo-EM structures. These findings have opened the way for efficient and precise computational studies at the atomistic level. Here we report a set of multiscale-calculations performed on the mTPC1, a ligand- and voltage-gated sodium selective channel. The molecular dynamics and enhanced molecular dynamics simulations were used for a thorough analysis of the mammalian TPC1 behaviour in the presence and absence of the ligand molecule, with a special accent on the supposed bottleneck, the hydrophobic gate. Moreover, from the reconstructed free energy obtained from enhanced simulations, we have calculated the macroscopic conductance of sodium ions through the mTPC1, which we compared with measured single-channel conductance values. The hydrophobic gate works as a steric barrier and the key parameters are its flexibility and the dimension of the sodium first hydration shell.","Milenkovic, Stefan; Bodrenko, Igor V; Lagostena, Laura; Gradogna, Antonella; Serra, Giovanni; Bosin, Andrea; Carpaneto, Armando; Ceccarelli, Matteo",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,328
423331,The Effect of Delay in Care Among Patients Requiring Intravitreal Injections,2021,"Investigations into the function of non-promoter DNA methylation have yielded new insights into epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between DNA methylation in discrete functional regions; however, integrated non-promoter DNA methylation and gene expression analyses across a wide number of tumor types and corresponding normal tissues have not been performed. Through integrated analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles, we examined 32 tumor types and identified 57 tumor suppressors and oncogenes out of 260 genes exhibiting a correlation of > 0.5 between gene body methylation and gene expression in at least 1 tumor type. The lymphocyte-specific gene CARD11 exhibits robust association between gene body methylation and expression across 19 of 32 tumor types examined. It is significantly overexpressed in kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumor tissues in comparison to respective control samples; and is significantly associated with lower overall survival in KIRC. Contrary to its canonical function in lymphocyte NF-kB activation, CARD11 activates the mTOR pathway in KIRC and LUAD, resulting in suppressed autophagy. Furthermore, demethylation of a CpG island within the gene body of CARD11 decreases gene expression. Collectively, our study highlights how DNA methylation outside the promoter region can impact tumor progression. Implications: Our study describes a novel regulatory role of gene body DNA methylation-dependent CARD11 expression on mTOR signaling and its impact on tumor progression.","McGuire, Michael H; Dasari, Santosh K; Yao, Hui; Wen, Yunfei; Mangala, Lingegowda S; Bayraktar, Emine; Ma, Wencai; Ivan, Cristina; Shoshan, Einav; Wu, Sherry Y; Jonasch, Eric; Bar-Eli, Menashe; Wang, Jing; Baggerly, Keith A; Sood, Anil K",Mol. cancer res,,328
423740,The path of hope in relationships involving older adults: the perspective from the complexity of the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread from a regional outbreak to a global pandemic in just a few months. Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18 and 0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4 and 3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6 and 8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R0, the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","Ke, Ruian; Romero-Severson, Ethan; Sanche, Steven; Hengartner, Nick",J Theor Biol,,328

The aim of this study was to investigate how these restrictions and the transition to an increased reliance on telemedicine within clinical care of people living with kidney disease impacted the physical activity (PA), wellbeing and quality of life (QoL) of adults dialysing at home (HHD) or receiving in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD) in the UK. Individual semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with adults receiving HHD (n = 10) or ICHD (n = 10), were transcribed verbatim and, subsequently, thematically analysed. As result of the COVID-19 restrictions, PA, wellbeing and QoL of people with ESRD were found to have been hindered. However, widespread support for the continued use of telemedicine was strongly advocated and promoted independence and satisfaction in patient care. These findings highlight the need for more proactive care of people with ESRD if asked to shield again, as well as increased awareness of safe and appropriate PA resources to help with home-based PA and emotional wellbeing.","Antoun, Joe; Brown, Daniel J; Jones, Daniel J W; Sangala, Nicholas C; Lewis, Robert J; Shepherd, Anthony I; McNarry, Melitta A; Mackintosh, Kelly A; Mason, Laura; Corbett, Jo; Saynor, Zoe L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,328

426224,The Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Process on Dietary Behaviours and Physical Activity Habits of High School Students (preprint),2021,"OBJECTIVE: A higher body mass index (BMI) has become acknowledged as one of the important risk factors for developing critical condition in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to BMI, body composition, particularly visceral adiposity, might be an even more accurate measure to stratify patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between the distributions of CT-quantified fat mass and critical condition of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in five databases for studies published until 17th November 2020. In the meta-analysis, we calculated pooled mean difference (standardized mean difference; SMD) of visceral fat area (VFA; cm2 ) between patients in intensive care unit (ICU) and general ward, and between patients with and without IMV requirement. RESULTS: Our quantitative synthesis revealed that patients requiring intensive care had higher VFA values (SMD=0.46, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.71, p<0.001) compared to patients on the general ward. Similarly, patients requiring IMV had higher VFA values (SMD=0.38, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.71, p=0.026) compared to patients without IMV requirement. CONCLUSIONS: We found that VFA values were significantly higher in patients with critical condition. Therefore, abdominal adiposity seems to be a risk factor in COVID-19, and patients with central obesity might need special attention.","Földi, Mária; Farkas, Nelli; Kiss, Szabolcs; Dembrovszky, Fanni; Szakács, Zsolt; Balaskó, Márta; Eross, Bálint; Hegyi, Péter; Szentesi, Andrea",Obesity (Silver Spring),,328

Aim: This study was conducted in a descriptive and comparative way in order to identify the relation between the breastfeeding success and self-efficacy of obese and non-obese mothers during postnatal period and to make a comparison between the obese and non-obese group. Methods: The study sample consisted of 113 obese and 111 non-obese mothers that met the study criteria who were hospitalized at the postnatal service of Health Education and Research Hospital in Ankara, September 2014-February 2015. Result: The mean BMI of obese women prior to the pregnancy was 31.41±2.4 while it was 22.25±2.8 for the non-obese women. As the BSS scores increase among both the obese and non-obese mothers, the LATCH breastfeeding success score averages increase as well (p<0.05, r:0.613). Conclusion: In the light of the data of, to increase the breastfeeding success among obese mothers, it is suggested that the perception of self-efficacy is enhanced, and additional consultation is provided on breastfeeding starting from the antenatal period.

Medical undergraduate education has been disrupted and transformed into prolonged home isolation and online learning. Although studies have reported that the COVID-19 pandemic tends to increase perceived stress (PS) and affect the mental health of medical students, the influencing factors are unclear. Therefore, based on the stress process model, this study will comprehensively evaluate the distribution of stressors of medical students and explore the personal and environmental predictors of PS during the epidemic. Participants and Methods: An online survey was conducted among medical students (n=369) from three medical universities in western China who engaged in online learning. A stress process conceptual framework was formed to explore the influencing factors of PS. The survey items contained four sections: (a) the potential stressors derived from academic, psychosocial and health-related demands;coping resources such as (b) online learning environment support and (c) personal resilience, including online learning behavior and individual characteristics;and (d) PS, perception of imbalanced demands and coping resources. Results: The mean PS score was 17.39 (SD=4.58), and over four-fifths (82.3%) of the students had moderate to high levels of stress. The average item scores of academic, psychosocial and health-related stressors were 2.72 (SD=0.55), 2.31 (SD=0.55) and 2.07 (SD=0.50), respectively. Gender, grade, psychosocial stressors, health-related stressors, specific online learning behavior (persistence, attitude and flexibility), and the online learning environment (teaching, social and cognitive presence) were predictors of PS. Conclusion: Our results specify that a reduction in psychological and health-related stressor stimulation, specific online learning behavior promotion, and well-established online learning environment support could be considered essential for alleviating the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the psychosocial health of medical undergraduates.","Wang, Jun Liu Weichu Zhang Yunmei Xie Shiqi Yang Bing",Psychology Research and Behavior Management,,328

428125,"COVID-19, Islam and Christianity",2021,"The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has affected all supply chains through severe disruption of logistics activities, production, and markets. This study aimed to survey the impact of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain using an exploratory sequential mixed design. We first addressed those stages of the poultry supply chain disrupted in an ongoing pandemic, and then elaborated particular disturbances associated with each stage. This study was based on data collected from Iranian poultry industry owners and experts who had sufficient experience in agricultural supply chains as well. As the qualitative phase, the content analysis was conducted to identify the impacts of the coronavirus on the poultry supply chain. The results and conclusions that emerged from the qualitative phase were refined and weighted by the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) and the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) respectively, in the quantitative phase. The results suggested that the pandemic has further affected the input supply as a stage in the poultry supply chain. This is probably because of the fact that the poultry industry is heavily dependent on inputs' flow. In addition, supply chain governance was seriously impaired due to the persistence of the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic has significantly affected the stages that are most reliant on transportation. Finally, we found that a part of the disruptions that occur in the downstream of the supply chain is due to the epidemic's direct adverse effects, and another part is due to indirect consequences received from the upstream. Our findings and implications can be useful in decision-making procedures during ongoing epidemics.","Palouj, Mojtaba; Adaryani, Rasool Lavaei; Alambeigi, Amir; Movarej, Maryam; Sis, Yahya Safi",Food Control,,328

The smart sustainable city concept is widely based on making efforts to understand this relationship and create sustainable communities. The placemaking process is highly dependent on people’s perception of places, events and situations in which they find themselves. Moreover, the greater the event scale, the more essential the research concentrated on them. A certain number of scientific papers have focused on the event management and event perception;however, there is still a research gap in works regarding sustainable development concepts. Thus, to fill this gap, the framework for large-scale event perception evaluation was created. Moreover, the cognitive map of large-scale event perception based on the Szczecin city citizens’ opinions was created. In order to acquire the opinions, a questionnaire with spatial–temporal measurement scales was applied. The representativeness estimation method, natural event ontology and framework for image interpretation were used for event segmentation. The storm phenomenon scenes were selected for picture measurement scale creation. The most significant factors of large-scale event perception were identified based on the questionnaire results. Finally, the cognitive map of global event perception factors is presented. By applying the analysis presented in this paper in various industries, relevant policies related to different dimensions of the citizens’ well-being could be created by governments.","Pilipczuk, Olga",Sustainability,,328

METHODS: This paper proposes a local region-based variational region growing algorithm, which integrates local region and shape prior to segment the mandible accurately. Firstly, we select initial seeds in the CBCT image and then calculate candidate point sets and the local region energy function of each point. If a point reduces the energy, it is selected to be a pixel of the foreground region. By multiple iterations, the mandible segmentation of the slice can be obtained. Secondly, the segmented result of the previous slice is adopted as the shape prior to the next slice until all of the slices in CBCT are segmented. At last, the final mandible model is reconstructed by the Marching Cubes algorithm. RESULTS: The experimental results on CBCT datasets illustrate the LRVRG algorithm can obtain satisfied 3D mandible models from CBCT images and it can solve the fuzzy problem effectively. Furthermore, quantitative comparisons with other methods demonstrate the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in mandible segmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Experiments demonstrate that our method is efficient and accurate for the mandible model segmentation.","Jiang, Yankai; Qian, Jiahong; Lu, Shijuan; Tao, Yubo; Lin, Jun; Lin, Hai",Oral radiol,,328

Despite an unprecedented focus of scientific investigation, there is a paucity of evidence-based pharmacotherapies against this disease. Due to this lack of data-driven treatment strategies, broad variations in practice patterns have emerged. Observed hypercoagulability in COVID-19 patients has created debate within the critical care community on the therapeutic utility of heparin. We seek to provide an overview of the data supporting the therapeutic use of heparin, both unfractionated and low molecular weight, as an anticoagulant for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we review preclinical evidence establishing biological plausibility for heparin and synthetic heparin-like drugs as therapies for COVID-19 through anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we discuss known adverse effects and theoretical off-target effects that may temper enthusiasm for the adoption of heparin as a therapy in COVID-19 without confirmatory prospective randomized controlled trials. Despite previous failures of anticoagulants in critical illness, plausibility of heparin for COVID-19 is sufficiently robust to justify urgent randomized controlled trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of this therapy.","Hippensteel, Joseph Alan; LaRiviere, Wells B; Colbert, James F; Langouët-Astrié, Christophe J; Schmidt, Eric P","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",,328
432283,Reopening schools after the COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"Coronavirus has claimed the lives of over half a million people world-wide and this death toll continues to rise rapidly each day. In the absence of a vaccine, non-clinical preventative measures have been implemented as the principal means of limiting deaths. However, these measures have caused unprecedented disruption to daily lives and economic activity. Given this developing crisis, the potential for a second wave of infections and the near certainty of future pandemics, lessons need to be rapidly gleaned from the available data. We address the challenges of cross-country comparisons by allowing for differences in reporting and variation in underlying socio-economic conditions between countries. Our analyses show that, to date, differences in policy interventions have out-weighed socio-economic variation in explaining the range of death rates observed in the data. Our epidemiological models show that across 8 countries a further week long delay in imposing lockdown would likely have cost more than half a million lives. Furthermore, those countries which acted more promptly saved substantially more lives than those that delayed. Linking decisions over the timing of lockdown and consequent deaths to economic data, we reveal the costs that national governments were implicitly prepared to pay to protect their citizens as reflected in the economic activity foregone to save lives. These 'price of life' estimates vary enormously between countries, ranging from as low as around $100,000 (e.g. the UK, US and Italy) to in excess of $1million (e.g. Denmark, Germany, New Zealand and Korea). The lowest estimates are further reduced once we correct for under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths.","Balmford, Ben; Annan, James D; Hargreaves, Julia C; Altoè, Marina; Bateman, Ian J",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,328

Seeing the vast impact of the pandemic and knowing its roots as a zoonotic disease, he realized this approach was critical to his medical education and for preparation against future novel infectious diseases. Zoonotic diseases have been emerging into human populations with increasing frequency, leading to public health emergencies such as Ebola, Avian Influenza, and SARS. The SARS-CoV-2 narrative, starting in bats then mutating through an intermediate host into humans, is another striking example of the interconnectedness between human, animal, and ecosystem health that underlies these infections. Preventing future pandemics will require a transdisciplinary One Health approach, and physicians should be prepared to participate in these discussions while advocating for One Health initiatives for the benefit of their current and future patients. Integration of One Health education into medical school curricula will also prepare future physicians for other complex and urgently important health issues such as climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and the impact of biodiversity loss. As the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, education in One Health must become a priority; it is essential to break down the conventional disciplinary silos of human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, public health, and the social sciences, so that future health crises can be prevented and mitigated collaboratively.","Dykstra, Michael P; Baitchman, Eric J",Acad. med,,328

Data on psychiatric and cognitive sequelae at medium-term follow-up are still lacking. During an ongoing prospective cohort study, the psychopathological and cognitive status of 226 COVID-19 pneumonia survivors (149 male, mean age 58) were prospectively evaluated one and three months after hospital discharge. Psychiatric clinical interview, self-report questionnaires, and neuropsychological profiling of verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor coordination, executive functions, attention and information processing, and verbal fluency were performed. Three months after discharge from the hospital, 35.8% still self-rated symptoms in the clinical range in at least one psychopathological dimension. We observed persistent depressive symptomatology, while PTSD, anxiety, and insomnia decreased during follow-up. Sex, previous psychiatric history, and the presence of depression at one month affected the depressive symptomatology at three months. Regardless of clinical physical severity, 78% of the sample showed poor performances in at least one cognitive domain, with executive functions and psychomotor coordination being impaired in 50% and 57% of the sample. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, predicted self-rated depressive symptomatology and cognitive impairment at three-months follow-up; and changes of SII predicted changes of depression during follow-up. Neurocognitive impairments associated with severity of depressive psychopathology, and processing speed, verbal memory and fluency, and psychomotor coordination were predicted by baseline SII. We hypothesize that COVID-19 could result in prolonged systemic inflammation that predisposes patients to persistent depression and associated neurocognitive dysfunction. The linkage between inflammation, depression, and neurocognition in patients with COVID-19 should be investigated in long-term longitudinal studies, to better personalize treatment options for COVID-19 survivors.","Mazza, Mario Gennaro; Palladini, Mariagrazia; De Lorenzo, Rebecca; Magnaghi, Cristiano; Poletti, Sara; Furlan, Roberto; Ciceri, Fabio; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Benedetti, Francesco",Brain Behav Immun,,328

In the past month we recorded an outbreak of Kawasaki disease; we aimed to evaluate incidence and features of patients with Kawasaki-like disease diagnosed during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with a Kawasaki-like disease at our centre in the past 5 years were divided according to symptomatic presentation before (group 1) or after (group 2) the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Kawasaki- like presentations were managed as Kawasaki disease according to the American Heart Association indications. Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) was defined by presence of circulatory dysfunction, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation criteria. Current or previous infection was sought by reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, and by serological qualitative test detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. FINDINGS: Group 1 comprised 19 patients (seven boys, 12 girls; aged 3·0 years [SD 2·5]) diagnosed between Jan 1, 2015, and Feb 17, 2020. Group 2 included ten patients (seven boys, three girls; aged 7·5 years [SD 3·5]) diagnosed between Feb 18 and April 20, 2020; eight of ten were positive for IgG or IgM, or both. The two groups differed in disease incidence (group 1 vs group 2, 0·3 vs ten per month), mean age (3·0 vs 7·5 years), cardiac involvement (two of 19 vs six of ten), KDSS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), MAS (zero of 19 vs five of ten), and need for adjunctive steroid treatment (three of 19 vs eight of ten; all p<0·01). INTERPRETATION: In the past month we found a 30-fold increased incidence of Kawasaki-like disease. Children diagnosed after the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic began showed evidence of immune response to the virus, were older, had a higher rate of cardiac involvement, and features of MAS. The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was associated with high incidence of a severe form of Kawasaki disease. A similar outbreak of Kawasaki-like disease is expected in countries involved in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

One of the key elements of these systems is video streaming, which requires a very high network bandwidth due to its specific real-time demand, especially with high-resolution video. Existing video compression methods are struggling in the trade-off between video quality and the speed requirement. Addressed that the background information rarely changes in most remote meeting cases, we introduce a Region-Of-Interests (ROI) based video compression framework (named RCLC) that leverages the cutting-edge learning-based and conventional technologies. In RCLC, each coming frame is marked as a background-updating (BU) or ROI-updating (RU) frame. By applying the conventional video codec, the BU frame is compressed with low-quality and high-compression, while the ROI from RU-frame is compressed with high-quality and low-compression. The learning-based methods are applied to detect the ROI, blend background-ROI, and enhance video quality. The experimental results show that our RCLC can reduce up to 32.55\% BD-rate for the ROI region compared to H.265 video codec under a similar compression time with 1080p resolution.","Hoang, Trinh Man; Zhou, Jinjia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06492v1.pdf,328

High anxiety levels seriously harm physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is critical to determine anxiety levels of health care workers and explore its risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to evaluate the anxiety and resilience of 364 health care workers with high exposure risk from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze factors related to anxiety. RESULTS The mean anxiety score was 44.28±8.93 and 23.4% of our study participants reported mild (n=63), moderate (n=19), or severe (n=3) anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, job position, availability of protective materials, signs of suspected symptoms, and susceptibility to emotions and behaviors of people around them were identified as risk factors for anxiety, whereas psychological resilience was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the anxiety level of health care workers in the radiology department with a high exposure risk to COVID-19 was high in the early stage of the outbreak, although the majority remained within normal limits. Timely assessment and effective intervention measures can improve the mental health of these at-risk populations.","Huang, Lei; Wang, Yun; Liu, Juan; Ye, Pengfei; Chen, Xijian; Xu, Huayan; Qu, Haibo; Ning, Gang",Med Sci Monit,,328

438136,Positive effects of covid-19 and social determinants of health: all in it together?,2020,"Extensive fibrin deposition in the lungs and altered levels of circulating blood coagulation proteins in COVID-19 patients imply local derangement of pathways that limit fibrin formation and/or promote its clearance. We examined transcriptional profiles of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples to identify molecular mechanisms underlying these coagulopathies. mRNA levels for regulators of the kallikrein-kinin (C1-inhibitor), coagulation (thrombomodulin, endothelial protein C receptor), and fibrinolytic (urokinase and urokinase receptor) pathways were significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients. While transcripts for several coagulation proteins were increased, those encoding tissue factor, the protein that initiates coagulation and whose expression is frequently increased in inflammatory disorders, were not increased in BALF from COVID-19 patients. Our analysis implicates enhanced propagation of coagulation and decreased fibrinolysis as drivers of the coagulopathy in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.","Mast, Alan E; Wolberg, Alisa S; Gailani, David; Garvin, Michael R; Alvarez, Christiane; Miller, J Izaak; Aronow, Bruce; Jacobson, Daniel",eLife (Cambridge),,328

Among all approaches, a messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine has emerged as a rapid and versatile platform to quickly respond to this challenge. Here, we developed a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate (called ARCoV). Intramuscular immunization of ARCoV mRNA-LNP elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as a Th1-biased cellular response in mice and non-human primates. Two doses of ARCoV immunization in mice conferred complete protection against the challenge of a SARS-CoV-2 mouse-adapted strain. Additionally, ARCoV is manufactured as a liquid formulation and can be stored at room temperature for at least 1 week. ARCoV is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials.","Zhang, Na-Na; Li, Xiao-Feng; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Zhao, Hui; Huang, Yi-Jiao; Yang, Guan; Huang, Wei-Jin; Gao, Peng; Zhou, Chao; Zhang, Rong-Rong; Guo, Yan; Sun, Shi-Hui; Fan, Hang; Zu, Shu-Long; Chen, Qi; He, Qi; Cao, Tian-Shu; Huang, Xing-Yao; Qiu, Hong-Ying; Nie, Jian-Hui; Jiang, Yuhang; Yan, Hua-Yuan; Ye, Qing; Zhong, Xia; Xue, Xia-Lin; Zha, Zhen-Yu; Zhou, Dongsheng; Yang, Xiao; Wang, You-Chun; Ying, Bo; Qin, Cheng-Feng",Cell,,328
438641,Guest Editorial: A potential interprofessional workforce resource for COVID-19-strained health systems,2021,"OBJECTIVE: With the current SARS-CoV2 outbreak, countless tests need to be performed on potential symptomatic individuals, contacts and travellers. The gold standard is a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based system taking several hours to confirm positivity. For effective public health containment measures, this time span is too long. We therefore evaluated a rapid test in a high-prevalence community setting. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-nine randomly selected individuals at a COVID-19 screening centre were simultaneously tested via qPCR and a rapid test. Ten previously diagnosed individuals with known SARS-CoV-2 infection were also analysed. METHODS: The evaluated rapid test is an IgG/IgM-based test for SARS-CoV-2 with a time to result of 20 min. Two drops of blood are needed for the test performance. RESULTS: Of 49 individuals, 22 tested positive by repeated qPCR. In contrast, the rapid test detected only eight of those positive correctly (sensitivity: 36.4%). Of the 27 qPCR-negative individuals, 24 were detected correctly (specificity: 88.9%). CONCLUSION: Given the low sensitivity, we recommend not to rely on an antibody-based rapid test for public health measures such as community screenings.","Döhla, M; Boesecke, C; Schulte, B; Diegmann, C; Sib, E; Richter, E; Eschbach-Bludau, M; Aldabbagh, S; Marx, B; Eis-Hübinger, A-M; Schmithausen, R M; Streeck, H",Public Health,,328

438756,COVID-19: Africa needs unprecedented attention to strengthen community health systems,2020,"COVID-19 has joined the long list of sexually dimorphic human disorders. Higher lethality in men, evident in the first reports from China, was confirmed in the subsequent Italian outbreak. Newspapers and scientific journals commented on this finding and the preexisting conditions, biological processes, and behavioral differences that may underlie it. However, little appeared to be released about sex differences in severity of disease, comorbidities, rate of recovery, length of hospital stay, or number of tests performed. Systematic analysis of official websites for 20 countries and 6 US states revealed a wide disparity in sex-disaggregated data made available to the public and scholars. Only a handful reported cases by sex. None of the other characteristics, including deaths, were stratified by sex at the time. Beyond suboptimal sex disaggregation, we found a paucity of usable raw data sets and a generalized lack of standardization of captured data, making comparisons difficult. A second round of data capture in April found more complete, but even more disparate, information. Our analysis revealed a wide range of sex ratios among confirmed cases. In countries where a male bias was initially reported, the proportion of women dramatically increased in 3 weeks. Analysis also revealed a complex pattern of sex ratio variation with age. Accurate, peer-reviewed, analysis of harmonized, sex-disaggregated data for characteristics of epidemics, such as availability of testing, suspected source of infection, or comorbidities, will be critical to understand where the observed disparities come from and to generate evidence-based recommendations for decision-making by governments.","Kocher, Kristen; Delot-Vilain, Arthur; Spencer, D039; Andre,; LoTempio, Jonathan; Délot, Emmanuèle C",Arch Sex Behav,,328

METHODS: A retrospective review of the UK Transplant Registry (UKTR) and a national survey of UK heart transplant centers have been performed. The early pandemic period is defined here as 1 March to 31 May 2020. RESULTS: There was geographic variation in the prevalence of COVID-19 across the UK. All centers reported adaptations to maintain the safety of their staff, candidate, and recipient populations. The number of donors fell by 31% during the early pandemic period. Heart utilization increased to 35%, compared to 26% during the same period of 2019. The number of heart transplants was well maintained, across all centers, with 38 performed, compared to 41 during the same period of 2019, with no change in 30-day survival. Twenty-seven heart transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were reported during the study period. CONCLUSION: All UK heart transplant centers have successfully adapted their programs to overcome the challenges of staff redeployment and ICU and hospital resource limitation, associated with the pandemic, whilst continuing heart transplant activity.

439830,"Coronavirus (COVID-19), pandemic psychology and the fractured society: a sociological case for critique, foresight and action",2020,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the way we work, with many employees working under isolating and difficult conditions. However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction. Implications for enhancing employee well-being and helping behaviors during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

439943,Lessons from COVID-19 pandemic for the child survival agenda,2020,"This paper aims to provide a perspective on data sharing practices in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The scientific community has made several important inroads in the fight against COVID-19, and there are over 2500 clinical trials registered globally. Within the context of the rapidly changing pandemic, we are seeing a large number of trials conducted without results being made available. It is likely that a plethora of trials have stopped early, not for statistical reasons but due to lack of feasibility. Trials stopped early for feasibility are, by definition, statistically underpowered and thereby prone to inconclusive findings. Statistical power is not necessarily linear with the total sample size, and even small reductions in patient numbers or events can have a substantial impact on the research outcomes. Given the profusion of clinical trials investigating identical or similar treatments across different geographical and clinical contexts, one must also consider that the likelihood of a substantial number of false-positive and false-negative trials, emerging with the increasing overall number of trials, adds to public perceptions of uncertainty. This issue is complicated further by the evolving nature of the pandemic, wherein baseline assumptions on control group risk factors used to develop sample size calculations are far more challenging than those in the case of well-documented diseases. The standard answer to these challenges during nonpandemic settings is to assess each trial for statistical power and risk-of-bias and then pool the reported aggregated results using meta-analytic approaches. This solution simply will not suffice for COVID-19. Even with random-effects meta-analysis models, it will be difficult to adjust for the heterogeneity of different trials with aggregated reported data alone, especially given the absence of common data standards and outcome measures. To date, several groups have proposed structures and partnerships for data sharing. As COVID-19 has forced reconsideration of policies, processes, and interests, this is the time to advance scientific cooperation and shift the clinical research enterprise toward a data-sharing culture to maximize our response in the service of public health.","Dron, Louis; Dillman, Alison; Zoratti, Michael J; Haggstrom, Jonas; Mills, Edward J; Park, Jay J H",J Med Internet Res,,328
440063,Key ethical questions for research during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblC type, is the most common inherited disorder of cobalamin metabolism and is characterized by severe fetal developmental defects primarily impacting the central nervous system, hematopoietic system, and heart. CblC was previously shown to be due to mutations in the MMACHC gene, which encodes a protein thought to function in intracellular cobalamin trafficking and biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and methylcobalamin (MeCbl). These coenzymes are required for the production of succinyl-CoA and methionine, respectively. However, it is currently unclear whether additional roles for MMACHC exist outside of cobalamin metabolism. Furthermore, due to a lack of sufficient animal models, the exact pathophysiology of cblC remains unknown. Here, we report the generation and characterization of two new mouse models to study the role of MMACHC in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to develop a Mmachc floxed allele (Mmachcflox/flox), which we validated as a conditional null. For a gain-of-function approach, we generated a transgenic mouse line that over-expresses functional Mmachc (Mmachc-OE+/tg) capable of rescuing Mmachc homozygous mutant lethality. Surprisingly, our data also suggest that these mice may exhibit a partially penetrant maternal-effect rescue, which might have implications for in utero therapeutic interventions to treat cblC. Both the Mmachcflox/flox and Mmachc-OE+/tg mouse models will be valuable resources for understanding the biological roles of MMACHC in a variety of tissue contexts and allow for deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of cblC.","Chern, Tiffany; Achilleos, Annita; Tong, Xuefei; Hsu, Chih-Wei; Wong, Leeyean; Poché, Ross A",Dev Biol,,328

Problem: Within a short period of time, established bedside teaching concepts had to be converted into online formats to meet the requirements of the health authorities. Approach: The Department of Neurology at the University Hospital Essen transformed the examination course in the 5th clinical semester into a live stream, taking into account data protection guidelines. This enabled students to participate from a distance, allowing them to take the medical history from a patient and to interact with the medical examiners. Thus, this concept goes beyond the video-based formats of the examination course. Optimization: During the course, we performed online evaluations to ensure an immediate feedback from the students. This enabled us to implement ongoing changes that had a positive impact on the course format, for example using better equipment to ensure a better video and audio quality.

In this paper, we analyze the preparedness of U.S. commercial airline management teams to the largest systematic exogenous shock to date, namely the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and 2020. We do this by underpinning the paper with theory on environmental scanning and managerial dysfunction and then documenting the signals and actions of management around multiple public health scares. These include the SARS outbreak, the Swine Flu outbreak and the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results, based off of corporate filings with the SEC, is that airline management had multiple “dry runs” before the COVID-19 outbreak that should have lead them to prepare for financially catastrophic scenarios such as the one observed in 2020. Instead, management teams failed to learn from these, and other, prior shocks. Instead, they focused on other, less serious threats while diffusing their financial buffers through dividends and share buybacks.","Brown, Richard S.; Kline, William A.",J. Air Transp. Manage.,,328

The knowledge of the epidemiological/clinical profile and the risk factors of Brazilian COVID-19 patients can assist in the decision making of physicians in the implementation of early and most appropriate measures for poor prognosis patients. However, these reports are missing. Here we present a comprehensive study that addresses this demand. METHODS: This data-driven study was based on the Brazilian Ministry of Health Database (SIVEP-Gripe) regarding notified cases of hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the period from February 26th to August 10th, 2020. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, comorbidities and other additional information of patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The hospitalization rate was higher for male gender (56.56%) and for older age patients of both sexes. Overall, the lethality rate was quite high (41.28%) among hospitalized patients, especially those over 60 years of age. Most prevalent symptoms were cough, dyspnoea, fever, low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress. Cardiac disease, diabetes, obesity, kidney disease, neurological disease, and pneumopathy were the most prevalent comorbidities. A high prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cardiac disease (65.7%) and diabetes (53.55%) and with a high lethality rate of around 50% was observed. The intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate was 39.37% and of these 62.4% died. 24.4% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), with high mortality among them (82.98%). The main mortality risk predictors were older age and IMV requirement. In addition, socioeconomic conditions have been shown to significantly influence the disease outcome, regardless of age and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the hospitalized Brazilian COVID-19 patients profile and the mortality risk factors. The analysis also evidenced that the disease outcome is influenced by multiple factors, as unequally affects different segments of population.","de Souza, Fernanda Sumika Hojo; Hojo-Souza, Natália Satchiko; Batista, Ben Dêivide de Oliveira; da Silva, Cristiano Maciel; Guidoni, Daniel Ludovico",PLoS One,,328
442971,COVID-19 pandemic and biological therapy in rheumatologic disorders: how to deal with?,2020,"Globally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused severe and multi-dimensional resource losses among individuals. The Conservation of Resource (COR) theory postulates that resource loss generates related stress responses. It can suitably be applied to understand the pandemic's encompassing adverse consequences. Yet, no assessment tool exists. This study hence developed and validated the COR Scale for COVID-19 (CORS-COVID-19) to facilitate relevant research. The five hypothesized domains included losses in financial resource, family resource, future control, fun, and social resource. A population-based random telephone survey interviewed 300 Chinese adults in the general population in Hong Kong, China during April 3-10, 2020. The levels of different types of resource losses were high (especially for loss in fun). The 5-factor structure identified by factor analysis matches with the five hypothesized dimensions. Its psychometric properties are acceptable, including good internal consistency, content validity (the correlations between the items and their respective subscales were stronger than that between the items and the other four subscales), concurrent validity (significant correlations between the scale/subscale scores and both emotional distress due to COVID-19 and satisfaction with living in Hong Kong), and convergent validity (significant correlations between specific subscales and corresponding external variables). Relatively high floor effects were detected in some subscales. The scale, which is the first of the types to assess resource losses during a pandemic, can provide theory-based understandings/assessment about the negative impacts of COVID-19. It also facilitates warranted comparisons across countries and time periods in future studies.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the usefulness of adding a rapid vulnerability screening to an illness acuity tool to predict mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Large university hospital dedicated to providing COVID-19 care. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included are 1,428 consecutive inpatients aged &#8805;50 years. METHODS: Vulnerability was assessed using the modified version of PRO-AGE score (0-7; higher = worse), a validated and easy-to-administer tool that rates physical impairment, recent hospitalisation, acute mental change, weight loss, and fatigue. The baseline covariates included age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, and the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), a well-known illness acuity tool. Our outcome was time-to-death within 60 days of admission. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 66 years, and 58% were male. The incidence of 60-day mortality ranged from 22% to 69% across the quartiles of modified PRO-AGE. In adjusted analysis, compared with modified PRO-AGE scores 0-1 (""lowest quartile""), the hazard ratios (95% CI) for 60-day mortality for modified PRO-AGE scores 2-3, 4, and 5-7, were 1.4 (1.1-1.9), 2.0 (1.5-2.7), and 2.8 (2.1-3.8), respectively. The modified PRO-AGE predicted different mortality risk levels within each stratum of NEWS and improved the discrimination of mortality prediction models.

We investigated whether hydroxychloroquine could prevent SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers at high risk of exposure. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of healthcare workers with ongoing exposure to persons with SARS-CoV-2, including those working in emergency departments, intensive care units, Covid-19 hospital wards, and first responders. Participants across the United States and in the Canadian province of Manitoba were randomized to hydroxychloroquine 400mg once weekly or twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was confirmed or probable Covid-19-compatible illness. We measured hydroxychloroquine whole blood concentrations. RESULTS: We enrolled 1483 healthcare workers, of which 79% reported performing aerosol-generating procedures. The incidence of Covid-19 (laboratory-confirmed or symptomatic compatible illness) was 0.27 events per person-year with once-weekly and 0.28 events per person-year with twice-weekly hydroxychloroquine compared with 0.38 events per person-year with placebo. For once weekly hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, the hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%CI 0.44 to 1.16; P=0.18), and for twice-weekly was 0.74 (95%CI 0.46 to 1.19; P=0.22) as compared with placebo. Median hydroxychloroquine concentrations in whole blood were 98 ng/mL (IQR, 82-120) with once-weekly and 200 ng/mL (IQR, 159-258) with twice-weekly dosing. Hydroxychloroquine concentrations did not differ between participants who developed Covid-19-compatible illness (154 ng/mL) versus participants without Covid-19 (133 ng/mL; P=0.08).

449297,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Disordered Eating Behavior: Qualitative Analysis of Social Media Posts,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the high mortality and spread rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there are currently serious challenges in emergency department management. As such, we investigated whether the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/albumin ratio (BAR) predicts mortality in the COVID-19 patients in the emergency department. METHODS: A total of 602 COVID-19 patients who were brought to the emergency department within the period from March to September 2020 were included in the study. The BUN level, albumin level, BAR, age, gender, and in-hospital mortality status of the patients were recorded. The patients were grouped by in-hospital mortality. Statistical comparison was conducted between the groups. RESULTS: Of the patients who were included in the study, 312(51.8%) were male, and their median age was 63 years (49-73). There was in-hospital mortality in 96(15.9%) patients. The median BUN and BAR values of the patients in the non-survivor group were significantly higher than those in the survivor group (BUN: 24.76 [17.38-38.31] and 14.43 [10.84-20.42], respectively [p < 0.001]; BAR: 6.7 [4.7-10.1] and 3.4 [2.5-5.2], respectively [p < 0.001]). The mean albumin value in the non-survivor group was significantly lower than that in the survivor group (3.60 ± 0.58 and 4.13 ± 0.51, respectively; p < 0.001). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) and odds ratio values obtained by BAR to predict in-hospital COVID-19 mortality were higher than the values obtained by BUN and albumin (AUC of BAR, BUN, and albumin: 0.809, 0.771, and 0.765, respectively; odds ratio of BAR>3.9, BUN>16.05, and albumin<4.01: 10.448, 7.048, and 6.482, respectively). CONCLUSION: The BUN, albumin, and BAR levels were found to be reliable predictors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients, but BAR was found to be a more reliable predictor than the BUN and albumin levels.","Küçükceran, Kadir; Ayranci, Mustafa Kürsat; Girisgin, Abdullah Sadik; Koçak, Sedat; Dündar, Zerrin Defne",Am J Emerg Med,,328
449502,PIN37 Projection of Covid-19 Based on Decision Tree Analysis: WE Have NOT Won but WE Have NOT Lost the WAR!,2020,"BACKGROUND: Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties There is a hyperinflammatory response involved in the clinical course of patients with pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2 To date, there has been no definite therapy for COVID-19 We reviewed the charts of SARS-CoV-2 patients with pneumonia and moderate to severely elevated CRP and worsening hypoxemia who were treated with early, short-term dexamethasone METHODS: We describe a series of 21 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to The Miriam Hospital in Providence, RI, and were treated with a short course of dexamethasone, either alone or in addition to current investigative therapies RESULTS: CRP levels decreased significantly following the start of dexamethasone from mean initial levels of 129 52 to 40 73 mg/L at time of discharge 71% percent of the patients were discharged home with a mean length of stay of 7 8 days None of the patients had escalation of care, leading to mechanical ventilation Two patients were transferred to inpatient hospice facilities on account of persistent hypoxemia, in line with their documented goals of care CONCLUSIONS: A short course of systemic corticosteroids among inpatients with SARS-CoV-2 with hypoxic respiratory failure was well tolerated, and most patients had improved outcomes This limited case series may not offer concrete evidence towards the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19 However, patients' positive response to short-term corticosteroids demonstrates that they may help blunt the severity of inflammation and prevent a severe hyperinflammatory phase, in turn reducing the length of stay, ICU admissions, and healthcare costs","Selvaraj, Vijairam; Dapaah-Afriyie, Kwame; Finn, Arkadiy; Flanigan, Timothy P.",Rhode Island medical journal (2013),,328

The COVID-19 vaccine trials are high profile trials that have enrolled more than 100â¯000 participants. Consent documents must be succinct and understandable to ensure informed voluntary participation. Objective: To assess how well informed consent documents of the COVID-19 vaccine trials achieve the ideal of being succinct and understandable, and to create a shorter, more readable document. Design, Setting, and Participants: This quality improvement study collected and analyzed the informed consent documents used in 4 COVID-19 vaccine phase III randomized clinical trials to quantitatively assess readability and length and, based on this analysis, created a measurably more accessible informed consent document. Analysis was conducted from October 2020 to January 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were number of words (measured as word count), time-to-read (measured at reading speeds of 175-300 words per minute), language complexity (measured using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level assessment), and readability (measured using Flesch Reading Ease Score). Secondary outcomes included clarity of how the placebo group could access the vaccine if it is proven safe and effective. The study also examined the length and readability of an improved consent document. Results: The 4 informed consent documents were a mean (range) of 8333 (7821 to 9340) words long, with a mean (range) 35 (32.6 to 38.9) minutes to read at 240 words per minute. All documents exceeded grade 9 language complexity and scored lower than 60 in the formal reading ease metric, which constitutes difficult. Only 1 document specified that participants in the placebo group might receive vaccine. It was possible to write a document in fewer than 3000 words with a grade 7 to 8 reading level and a formal readability score that was not difficult. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that existing COVID-19 vaccine informed consent documents were too long, difficult to read, and exceeded grade 9 in language complexity. It was possible to create a shorter, more readable informed consent document for these trials.","Emanuel, Ezekiel J; Boyle, Connor W",JAMA Netw Open,,328

We draw on a number of key sources, including key papers and book chapters, discussion forums, agency reports, and conference presentations. We develop the potential dimensions of patient-based evidence, describe its key attributes, and consider its future development. Patient-based evidence has the potential to be a key concept in HTA, comprised of a series of related elements of importance to patients. We recognize that we raise more questions than can be answered, but as an emerging concept, recognition and understanding of patient-based evidence is still developing. The concepts and methods that support its application in HTA require urgent development. We conclude that clinical and economic forms of evidence are not enough for HTA. For HTA to be complete, we need to consider all relevant aspects of the phenomena, including patient-based evidence. There is now an urgent need for the global research and HTA community to work together to realize the full potential of patient-based evidence through conceptual and methodological development and wider recognition. We advocate that a task force be set up to address these urgent issues.","Staniszewska, Sophie; Söderholm Werkö, Sophie",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,,328

451789,Discussion of digital gaming's impact on players' well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown,2020-05-01,"In Pakistan, although coverage of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) services has increased, the attributable disease burden remains high, indicating quality of these services remains suboptimal. To address this quality gap, challenges associated with the implementation of MNCH services will need to be addressed and effective use of the various MNCH guidelines will need to be supported, evaluated, and continuously improved. Even though the application of the field of implementation science and practice in the low- and middle-income settings has been limited, it is our belief, based on the experience described in this article that these competencies could enhance health professionals' ability to, not only successfully integrate MNCH guidelines into health systems, but to also support their effective and sustainable use. To address this capacity gap in Pakistan, the Health Services Academy, as a member of the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Program (HRP) Alliance for Research Capacity Strengthening (RCS), has engaged, over the course of 16 months, in the 'Implementation for the Professional Learner Program' in 2019. This innovative implementation science and practice capacity-building program is developed and conducted by The World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Research Evidence for Sexual and Reproductive Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). The initial cohort of this Program also included Palestine's West Bank, and Egypt. The objectives of this Program were to cultivate implementation science and practice competencies, and to support the development of national, community-based or institution-based implementation teams. The expected outcomes of this program included, further enhancement of the capacity of local health professionals in implementation science, systemic change and the effective use of innovations in practice at sub-national/regional levels.","Hamid, Saima; Mureed, Sheh; Kayani, Aasia; Javed, Kiran; Khan, Adnan; Awais, Sayema; Khan, Neelam; Tus-Salam, Fakiha; Fixsen, Dean L",Glob Health Action,,328

Primary diagnosis by whole-slide imaging (WSI) is a key component that would aid departments in providing uninterrupted histopathology diagnosis and maintaining revenue streams from disruption. We sought to perform rapid validation of the use of WSI in primary diagnosis meeting recommendations of the College of American Pathologists guidelines. METHODS: Glass slides from clinically reported cases from 5 participating pathologists with a preset washout period were digitally scanned and reviewed in settings identical to typical reporting. Cases were classified as concordant or with minor or major disagreement with the original diagnosis. Randomized subsampling was performed, and mean concordance rates were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 171 cases were included and distributed equally among participants. For the group as a whole, the mean concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 90) was 83.6% counting all discrepancies and 94.6% counting only major disagreements. The mean pathologist concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 18) ranged from 90.49% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel double-blinded method for rapid validation of WSI for primary diagnosis. Our findings highlight the occurrence of a range of diagnostic reproducibility when deploying digital methods.","Samuelson, Megan I; Chen, Stephanie J; Boukhar, Sarag A; Schnieders, Eric M; Walhof, Mackenzie L; Bellizzi, Andrew M; Robinson, Robert A; Rajan Kd, Anand",Am. j. clin. pathol,,328

However, the shortage of doses is slowing down the goal of reaching herd immunity. The aim of the study was to verify whether previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, a considerable portion of the population, should receive the same vaccination treatment of seronegative individuals. METHODS: Health-professionals either recovered from COVID-19 or never infected by SARS-CoV-2 were serologically tested at different time-points right before, and several days after, vaccination. RESULTS: Previously infected individuals showed humoral immune responses, 21 days after the first dose, that was approximately 10-folds higher than the seronegative group 21 days after the second dose. Seropositivity persists for at least 11 months. CONCLUSION: During a shortage of COVID-19 vaccine doses, previously SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals should be dispensed from the vaccination campaign.

DESIGN: We reviewed vital statistics data to identify deaths registered in Los Angeles County between March 15, 2020, and August 15, 2020. Deaths with an ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) code for pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 listed as an immediate or underlying cause of death were classified as PIC deaths. Expected deaths were calculated using negative binomial regression. Excess mortality was determined by subtracting the expected from the observed number of weekly deaths. The Department of Public Health conducts surveillance for COVID-19-associated deaths: persons who died of nontraumatic/nonaccidental causes within 60 days of a positive COVID-19 test result were classified as confirmed COVID-19 deaths. Deaths without a reported positive SARS-Cov-2 polymerase chain reaction result were classified as probable COVID-19 deaths if COVID-19 was listed on their death certificate or the death occurred 60 to 90 days of a positive test. We compared excess PIC deaths with the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths ascertained by surveillance. SETTING: Los Angeles County. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of Los Angeles County who died. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Excess mortality. RESULTS: There were 7208 excess all-cause and 5128 excess PIC deaths during the study period. The Department of Public Health also reported 5160 confirmed and 323 probable COVID-19-associated deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The number of excess PIC deaths estimated by our model was approximately equal to the number of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths identified by surveillance. This suggests our surveillance definition for confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths might be sufficiently sensitive for capturing the true burden of deaths caused directly or indirectly by COVID-19.","Traub, Elizabeth; Amoon, Aryana T; Rollin-Alamillo, Louise; Haddix, Meredith; Poortinga, Kathleen; Ibrahim, Mireille; Feregrino, Gustavo; Foo, Chelsea; Itano, Alison; Lee, Rebecca; Fisher, Rebecca; Jarashow, Claire; Balter, Sharon; Gounder, Prabhu",J Public Health Manag Pract,,328

Mice were immunized via intranasal inoculation, microneedle-intradermal injection, or intramuscular injection, after which the RBD-specific immune responses were compared. Results showed that when administrated intranasally, the vaccine elicited a robust systemic humoral immunity with high titers of IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies as well as a significant mucosal immunity. Besides, antigen-specific T cell responses were also analyzed. These results indicated that the non-invasive intranasal administration should be explored for the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design.","Du, Yingying; Xu, Yuhua; Feng, Jin; Hu, Longbo; Zhang, Yanan; Zhang, Bo; Guo, Weili; Mai, Runming; Chen, Liyun; Fang, Jianmin; Zhang, Hui; Peng, Tao",Vaccine,,328
456041,European biomedical research infrastructures and the fight against covid-19 pandemic,2021,"The airway epithelial barrier is a major barrier protecting against clinically significant infections of the lung. Its integrity is often compromised due to mechanical, chemical, or infectious causes. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are poised to cause parenchymal infection and become difficult to eradicate due to adaptive metabolic changes, biofilm formation, and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and fitness genes. Enhancing mucosal defenses by modulating the cytokines that regulate barrier functions, such as interleukin-22 (IL-22) and interferon-&#955; (IFN-&#955;), members of the IL-10 family of cytokines, is an attractive approach to prevent these infections that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. These cytokines both signal through the cognate receptor IL-10RB, have related protein structures and common downstream signaling suggesting shared roles in host respiratory defense. They are typically co-expressed in multiple models of infections, but with differing kinetics. IL-22 has an important role in the producing antimicrobial peptides, upregulating expression of junctional proteins in the airway epithelium and working in concert with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17. Conversely, IFN-&#955;, a potent antiviral in influenza infection with pro-inflammatory properties, appears to decrease junctional integrity allowing for bacterial and immune cell translocation. The effects of these cytokines are pleotropic, with pathogen and tissue specific consequences. Understanding how these cytokines work in the mucosal defenses of the respiratory system may suggest potential targets to prevent invasive infections of the damaged lung.","Ahn, Danielle; Prince, Alice",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,328

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants emphasized the need to enlarge the repertoire of antibodies that target diverse epitopes, the combination of which may improve immune-diagnostics, augment the efficiency of the immunotherapy and prevent selection of escape-mutants. Antigen-specific controlled immunization of experimental animals may elicit antibody repertoires that significantly differ from those generated in the context of the immune response mounted in the course of disease. Accordingly, rabbits were immunized by several recombinant antigens representing distinct domains of the viral spike protein and monoclonal antibodies were isolated from single cells obtained by cell sorting. Characterization of a panel of successfully isolated anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) and anti-N-terminal domain (NTD) antibodies demonstrated that they exhibit high specificity and affinity profiles. Anti-RBD antibodies revealing significant neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro were found to target at least three distinct epitopes. Epitope mapping established that two of these antibodies recognized a novel epitope located on the surface of the RBD. We suggest that the antibodies isolated in this study are useful for designing SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and therapy approaches.","Makdasi, Efi; Levy, Yinon; Alcalay, Ron; Noy-Porat, Tal; Zahavy, Eran; Mechaly, Adva; Epstein, Eyal; Peretz, Eldar; Cohen, Hila; Bar-On, Liat; Chitlaru, Theodor; Cohen, Ofer; Glinert, Itai; Achdout, Hagit; Israely, Tomer; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Mazor, Ohad",Viruses,,328

The reason for developing effective urban transformation strategies and for the transparent selection of independent experts (non-politicians) for policymaking, decision-making, and implementation teams is not only the heterogeneity of smart city dimensions together with the necessary complexity and systems approach, but also the nature of the capacities and tools needed for smart city concepts. The innovative hybrid competency assessment model is based on fuzzy logic and a network for neuro-fuzzy assessment. It is a technological model for evaluating the competencies of specialists, taking into account the influence of human factors on the processes of personnel selection and system management.

Purpose: There have been reports linking haemorrhagic strokes to SARS-CoV-2 infection during this pandemic, which lead us to evaluate if SARS-CoV-2 infection could be associated with increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Methods: A retrospective observational study evaluating all stroke cases admitted in our centre in the past one month. Results: More than half (56%) had ICH, compared to 22% last year. Two patients with ICH were SARS-CoV-2 positive and they had no or mild respiratory symptoms and had higher occurrence of renal dysfunction. Conclusion: There could be possible association between ICH and SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a prospective study with larger sample size is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis.","Agarwal, Ayush; Vishnu, Venugopalan; Vibha, Deepti; Bhatia, Rohit; Gupta, Anu; Das, Animesh; Srivastava, M.

While the present research on this explicit interaction among VLE implementation and student mental health is limited, the material suggests a framework for strong utilization of VLEs. Overall, our research has shown that authentic, high quality VLEs are ones that have as their primary focus the communication between students and their teachers and between students and their peers. This communication is best generated through synchronous connections where there exists the ability to convey the student’s immediate needs in real-time. Our research results and discussion will outline how a team approach that brings together teachers, students, administration, counsellors, mental health support staff, instructional designers, and ICT specialists is necessary to create a genuinely enriching VLE where both learning and social-emotional needs can be met. The authors present a case for further study in order to reveal the nature of the interaction among VLEs and student mental health.","Caprara, Laura Caprara Cataldo",Education and information technologies,,328

We studied the clinical characteristics of survivor and non-survivor COVID-19-infected cancer patients in Pakistan. Patients and Methods: We did a retrospective study of 70 cancer patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Lahore and Peshawar, Pakistan between April 13 and July 09, 2020. These patients were discharged from the hospital or had died by July 09, 2020. Clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics were compared between survivors and non-survivors by fisher's exact test and chi-square test. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to explore the risk factors of mortality. Results: Seventy cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled and the majority were males 38 (54.3%). 57 (81.4%) had solid tumors and 13 (18.6%) had hematological malignancies. Dyspnea (44 cases) was the most common symptom (62.9%). Complications were reported in 51 (72.9%) patients during the course of disease. 19 (27.1%) patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). A significant increase in the C-reactive protein level and neutrophil count was observed in the deceased patients as compared to the surviving patients. D-dimer values of &gt;=0.2 mg/L were significantly associated with mortality (P=0.01). We identified two independent risk factors associated with death, ICU admission (P=0.007) and D-dimer (P=0.003). Conclusion: Pakistani cancer patients with COVID-19 infection reported poor prognosis. Intensive surveillance of clinicopathological characteristics of cancer patients infected with COVID-19 especially D-dimer values may play a pivotal role in the outcome of the disease.","Asghar, K.; Abu Bakar, M.; Akram, M.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data from the Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2008 (JHLS II), a nationally representative population-based survey that recruited persons at their homes over a 4-month period from all 14 parishes and 113 neighbourhoods defined as enumeration districts. PARTICIPANTS: A subsample of 2529 participants aged 18-74 years from the JHLS II who completed interviewer-administered surveys, provided anthropometric measurements and whose addresses were geocoded. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean BMI, calculated as weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). RESULTS: There was significant clustering across neighbourhoods for mean BMI (intraclass correlation coefficients=4.16%). Fully adjusted models revealed higher mean BMI among women, with further distance away from supermarkets (ß=0.12; 95% CI 8.20×10-3, 0.24; p=0.036) and the absence of supermarkets within a 1 km buffer zone (ß=1.36; 95% CI 0.20 to 2.52; p=0.022). A 10 km increase in the distance from a supermarket was associated with a 1.7 kg/m2 higher mean BMI (95% CI 0.03 to 0.32; p=0.020) in the middle class. No associations were detected with fast-food outlets or interaction by urbanicity. CONCLUSIONS: Higher mean BMI in Jamaicans may be partially explained by the presence of supermarkets and markets and differ by sex and social class. National efforts to curtail obesity in middle-income countries should consider interventions focused at the neighbourhood level that target the location and density of supermarkets and markets and consider sex and social class-specific factors that may be influencing the associations.","Cunningham-Myrie, Colette Andrea; Younger, Novie O; Theall, Katherine P; Greene, Lisa-Gaye; Lyew-Ayee, Parris; Wilks, Rainford",BMJ Open,,328

A quasi-experimental design was used to conduct group interventions among college students. A total of 22 and 26 participants were included in the experimental and control groups, respectively. The experimental group received six sessions of a logo-autobiography for college students (LAC). The effects of the LAC interventions were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and four weeks after the program's end to determine their retention rate. The effects of group, time, and the group-by-time interaction were verified using generalized estimating equations with an autoregressive correlation structure. The experimental group exhibited significantly lower levels of stress and depression and higher levels concerning the meaning of life than the control group. However, only the effects on stress and the meaning of life continued four weeks after the intervention's end. Based on this study's results, LAC can be considered a useful method for reducing stress and depression in college students who have just started their adult life, as well as for aiding them in their pursuit for the meaning of life.","Cho, Sunhee; Jang, Sun Joo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,328

Based on the unique affinity between dermatan sulfate and autoantigens, we identified 348 proteins from human lung A549 cells, of which 198 are known targets of autoantibodies. Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens. Orf3 induces the largest number of protein alterations, Orf9 affects the mitochondrial ribosome, and they and E, M, N, and Nsp proteins affect protein localization to membrane, immune responses, and apoptosis. Phosphorylation and ubiquitination alterations by viral infection define major molecular changes in autoantigen origination. This study provides a large list of autoantigens as well as new targets for future investigation, e.g., UBA1, UCHL1, USP7, CDK11A, PRKDC, PLD3, PSAT1, RAB1A, SLC2A1, platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. This study illustrates how viral infection can modify host cellular proteins extensively, yield diverse autoantigens, and trigger a myriad of autoimmune sequelae.

Telemedicine has surged dramatically since the pandemic in effort to maintain patient care and reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure to patients, health care workers, and the public. Herein we present reports of 3 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who were managed using telemedicine via synchronous video visits integrated with an electronic medical record system, from home to inpatient settings. We demonstrate how telemedicine helped assess, diagnose, triage, and treat patients with COVID-19 while avoiding a visit to an emergency department or outpatient clinic. While there is limited information about the duration of viral shedding for immunosuppressed patients, our findings underscore the importance of using telemedicine in the follow-up care for kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who have recovered from symptoms but might have persistently positive nucleic acid tests. Our experience emphasizes the opportunities of telemedicine in the management of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 and in the maintenance of uninterrupted follow-up care for such immunosuppressed patients with prolonged viral shedding. Telemedicine may help increase access to care for kidney transplant recipients during and beyond the pandemic as it offers a prompt, safe, and convenient platform in the delivery of care for these patients. Yet, to advance the practice of telemedicine in the field of kidney transplantation, barriers to increasing the widespread implementation of telemedicine should be removed, and research studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine in the care of kidney transplant recipients.","Abuzeineh, Mohammad; Muzaale, Abimereki D; Crews, Deidra C; Avery, Robin K; Brotman, Daniel J; Brennan, Daniel C; Segev, Dorry L; Al Ammary, Fawaz",Transplant Proc,,328

HISTORY: Rehabilitation developed in a piecemeal way, focused on specific problems: spinal cord injury, burns, polio, stroke, back pain, equipment and adaptations etc. Rehabilitation is also provided using other names (e.g. intermediate care). Patients with complex needs do not fit easily within this system. SYSTEM FAILURE: After Covid-19, patients have problems that cross existing condition-specific and/or treatment-specific services. Covid-19 has exposed the lack of any coherent organisational principle underlying development or commissioning of rehabilitation services. Consequently, in order to have their needs met, patients either have to engage with two or more separate services or they receive good management for some problems and sub-optimal management for other problems. THE GOALS: The multitude of small specific services need to coalesce into an integrated service able to meet all the needs of any patient referred. Second, rehabilitation needs to be fully integrated into all healthcare services. A SOLUTION: The purpose of healthcare is to 'improve our health and well-being .â.â. to stay as well as we can to the end of our lives'. (NHS constitution) All healthcare services need to consider patients holistically, giving equal attention to disease, disability, and distress.

Malta has one large acute general hospital, Mater Dei (MDH). This study retrospectively analysed these declines since soft lockdown commencing on the 13th March 2020 in a population-based study, the first of its kind. METHODS: Data was obtained as anonymised totals from MDH Clinical Performance Unit. Poisson regression was used to model the counts of weekly A&E attendances and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Outpatient attendances declined in March, stabilised in April 2020 and started to climb in May. April attendances fell to 18.8% in paediatrics and 23.4% in adults of the average of the previous January and February. A&E attendances showed the same pattern, down to 22.5% and all specialities registered a decline, paediatric > adult. Attendances dropped from circa 2600 to 588/month/100,000 population. These declines were abrupt after the second week of March. MDH admissions showed the same patterns, down from circa 1800 to 757/month/100,000 population. All declines were statistically significant. DISCUSSION: Many factors played a role in this unwilling experiment but the reduction in travel and physical human contact of all sorts (including school) contributed to a reduction in contagious diseases.

Here we used a food chain consisting of a diatom as host, a chytrid as its parasitic consumer and a rotifer as the predatory consumer of the chytrid, to assess the trophic position of all three food-chain components using their natural 13C and 15N isotope signatures, and to measure the nitrogen transfer from the host via the chytrid to the rotifer by tracing 15N of a labelled host up the food chain. Additionally, we measured the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios of all food-chain components. Natural isotope abundance results showed no clear 15N enrichment in the chytrid or rotifer relative to the primary producer. However, estimates of nitrogen transfer indicated that about 14% of host nitrogen was transferred per day from host to chytrid during infection epidemics and that some of this nitrogen was also transferred onward to the rotifer. Moreover, C:N ratios decreased with trophic level, suggesting that the chytrid provided a high-quality food source to the rotifer. In conclusion, our results support the ""mycoloop"". The mycooloop proposes that chytrid infections allow the transfer of nutrients bound in large, inedible phytoplankton to zooplankton through the production of edible transmission spores, thereby rerouting nutrients back into the food web.","Sánchez Barranco, Virginia; Van der Meer, Marcel T J; Kagami, Maiko; Van den Wyngaert, Silke; Van de Waal, Dedmer B; Van Donk, Ellen; Gsell, Alena S",Oecologia,,328
470839,Alliance of COVID 19 with pandemic of sedentary lifestyle & physical inactivity: Impact on reproductive health,2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak is the most serious test of the international system since the 2008 global financial crisis. Rather than cooperate to contain and respond to a common threat, the world's leading powers-the United States and China-have increasingly blamed each other through wildly speculative theories about the origins of the virus. The World Health Organization sought to coordinate a global response, but it has been hamstrung and has come under attack. Given past cooperation between major powers to mobilize and eradicate smallpox and previous US leadership to fight HIV/AIDS and the 2014 West African Ebola crisis, the limited cooperation and lack of leadership are puzzling. What explains the anemic global response to date? This article draws from structural international relations theory to suggest a partial but somewhat dissatisfying answer. International organizations are inherently weak and now face opposition by major powers. The international system simultaneously incentivizes states to cooperate and address common threats, but it also encourages countries to take care of themselves, potentially at the expense of others. Which of these motives dominates cannot be explained by structural theory, thus requiring us to look to other factors such as the attributes of states and leaders themselves.","Busby, Joshua W",J Health Polit Policy Law,,328

Several therapeutic strategies can be envisaged to prevent further mortality and morbidity. Based on the past contribution of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) and immune-based therapies as a treatment option in crucial pathogen outbreaks, we aimed to summarize potential therapeutic strategies that could be helpful to stop further spread of SARS-CoV-2 by effecting its structural components or modulation of immune responses. Several TCM with or without modification could be effective against the structural protein, enzymes, and nucleic acid should be tested from available libraries or to identify their immune-stimulatory activities to enhance several antiviral biological agents for effective elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from the host. TCM is not only effective in the direct inhibition of virus attachment and internalization in a cell but can also prevent their replication and can also help to boost up host immune response. Immune-modulatory effects of TCMs may lead to new medications and can guide us for the scientific validity of drug development. Besides, we also summarized the effective therapies in clinical for controlling inflammation. This review will be not only helpful for the current situation of COVID-19, but can also play a major role in such epidemics in the future.","Hussain, Shahid; Xie, Ya-Jia; Li, Dan; Malik, Shaukat Iqbal; Hou, Jin-Cai; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Fan, Xing-Xing",Chin.

The goal of PhenX is to facilitate the use of standard measures, enhance data interoperability, and promote collaborative and translational research. PhenX is driven by the scientific community and historically has depended on working groups of experts to recommend measures for release in the PhenX Toolkit. The urgent need for recommended, standard measures for COVID-19 research triggered the development of a ""rapid release"" process for releasing new content in the PhenX Toolkit. Initially, PhenX collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the NIH Disaster Research Response (DR2) program to create a library of COVID-19 measurement protocols. With additional support from NIH, PhenX adapted crowdsourcing techniques to accelerate prioritization and recommendation of protocols for release in the PhenX Toolkit. Prioritized COVID-19-specific protocols were used to anchor and define specialty collections of protocols that were subject to review and approval by the PhenX Steering Committee. In addition to the COVID-19-specific protocols, the specialty collections include existing, well-established PhenX protocols, use of which will further enhance data interoperability and cross-study analysis.

Lombardy, one of the most active Italian regions in organ/tissue procurement, has been strongly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, data concerning the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission after tissue transplantation are controversial. Here, we aimed to evaluate the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 in different cardiac tissues eligible for transplantation obtained from Lombard donors. We used cardiovascular tissues from eight donors potentially suitable for pulmonary valve transplantation. All donor subjects involved in the study returned negative results for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecular tests (quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR, qRT-PCR, and chip-based digital PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). None of the eight donors included in this study revealed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. However, evaluation of the protein content of pulmonary vein wall (PVW) tissue revealed variable levels of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein signal in all donors. Our study demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that viral nucleoprotein but not viral RNA was present in the examined tissue bank specimens, suggesting the need for caution and in-depth investigations on implantable tissue specimens collected during the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Perrucci, G.

The magnitude and persistence of antibody responses are critical for assessing the duration of immunity. Methods: A SARS-CoV-2-specific immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay for immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was developed and prospectively evaluated by comparison to the reference standard of NAT on respiratory tract samples from individuals with suspected COVID-19. Neutralizing antibody responses were measured in a subset of samples using a standard microneutralization assay. Results: A total of 2753 individuals were eligible for the study (126 NAT-positive; prevalence, 4.6%). The median ""window period"" from illness onset to appearance of antibodies (range) was 10.2 (5.8-14.4) days. The sensitivity and specificity of either SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, or IgM when collected &#8805;14 days after symptom onset were 91.3% (95% CI, 84.9%-95.6%) and 98.9% (95% CI, 98.4%-99.3%), respectively. The negative predictive value was 99.6% (95% CI, 99.3%-99.8%). The positive predictive value of detecting any antibody class was 79.9% (95% CI, 73.3%-85.1%); this increased to 96.8% (95% CI, 90.7%-99.0%) for the combination of IgG and IgA. Conclusions: Measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody by IFA is an accurate method to diagnose COVID-19. Serological testing should be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms for SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify additional cases where NAT was not performed and resolve cases where false-negative and false-positive NATs are suspected. The majority of individuals develop robust antibody responses following infection, but the duration of these responses and implications for immunity remain to be established.","Hueston, Linda; Kok, Jen; Guibone, Ayla; McDonald, Damien; Hone, George; Goodwin, James; Carter, Ian; Basile, Kerri; Sandaradura, Indy; Maddocks, Susan; Sintchenko, Vitali; Gilroy, Nicole; Chen, Sharon; Dwyer, Dominic E; O039,; Sullivan, Matthew V N",Open Forum Infect Dis,,328

The objective of the present study was to examine the behavior and ultrastructure of gonocytes in culture. Neonatal porcine testis cells were cultured for 4 weeks and underwent live-cell imaging to explore real-time interactions among cultured cells. This included imaging every 1 h from day 0 to day 3, every 2 h from day 4 to day 7, and every 1 h for 24 h at days 14, 21, and 28. Samples also underwent scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, morphometric evaluations, immunofluorescence, and RT-PCR. Live-cell imaging revealed an active amoeboid-like movement of gonocytes, assisted by the formation of extensive cytoplasmic projections, which, using scanning electron microscopy, were categorized into spike-like filopodia, leaf-like lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and cytoplasmic blebs. In the first week of culture, gonocytes formed loose attachments on top of a somatic cell monolayer and, in week 2, formed grape-like clusters, which, over time, grew in cell number. Starting at week 3 of culture, some of the gonocyte clusters transformed into large multinucleated embryoid body-like colonies (EBLCs) that expressed both gonocyte- and pluripotent-specific markers. The number and diameter of individual gonocytes, the number and density of organelles within gonocytes, as well as the number and diameter of the EBLCs increased over time (P < 0.05). In conclusion, cultured porcine gonocytes displayed extensive migratory behavior facilitated by their various cytoplasmic projections, propagated, and transformed into EBLCs that increased in size and complexity over time.","Awang-Junaidi, Awang Hazmi; Fayaz, Mohammad Amin; Kawamura, Eiko; Sobchishin, LaRhonda; MacPhee, Daniel J; Honaramooz, Ali",Cell tissue res,,328

474363,Predictors of well-being and productivity among software professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic – a longitudinal study,2021,"Background: While pathogens often evolve towards reduced virulence, many counterexamples are evident. When faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is highly desirable to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) into the future. Considerable effort has been invested towards the development of a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although these approaches accurately recapitulate some complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between mortality and infectivity. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Results: Using a compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity, we reveal kinetic constraints where the variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased virulence and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as Smallpox, are likely often constrained by host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: The evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in virulence should not be assumed. Our findings imply that, without continued public health intervention, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. The existence of a parameter regime admitting endemic equilibrium suggests that herd immunity is unachievable. However, we demonstrate that even partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by potentially changing the evolutionary trajectory of the virus towards reduced virulence.","Rochman, Nash D; Wolf, Yuri I; Koonin, Eugene V",,,328

The first two factors can trace their roots to the country’s developmental state model.

Persons with disabilities may be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to underlying medical conditions that have been associated with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe self-reported hygiene behaviors among U.S. adults with disabilities to prevent transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: Data were obtained from the March 2020 Porter Novelli ConsumerStyles survey. This study includes 6463 U.S. adults (&#8805;18 years) who participated in the survey (58.2% response rate). Participants were asked about frequent handwashing and surface disinfection. Participants were also asked six questions to assess disability status and disability type. Prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated; chi-square tests were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1295 (20.3%) of survey participants reported at least one disability and their hygiene-related behavior. Overall, 91.3% of respondents with disabilities reported frequent handwashing; only 72% reported frequent surface disinfection. Those with hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living disabilities (range: 77.9%-90.6%) were significantly less likely than those without any disability (94.0%) to report frequent handwashing. People with vision (62.2%) and independent living (66.8%) disabilities were less likely to report frequent surface disinfection than those without any disability (74.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Practices such as handwashing and disinfecting surfaces are effective for reducing and preventing the spread of COVID-19.

The program utilized two simple, diverse, and easily interpretable machine learning models to quickly and accurately predict which students were at elevated risk for contracting COVID-19 and should be called proactively for testing. Our adaptive testing cohorts produced positivity rates that were 26% higher than the random cohort: 0.58% positivity (95% CI 0.47% to 0.68%) from 19,171 tests, and 0.46% positivity (95% CI 0.41% to 0.51%) from 64,003 tests, respectively. Within 14 days of their selection, 2.94% of the adaptive cohort tested positive, compared to 1.27% of the random cohort. Close contacts who were predicted by the adaptive testing models received a COVID-19 test within an average of 0.94 days (95% CI 0.78 to 1.11) of the source testing positive, while those who were manually contact traced were tested in an average of 1.92 days (95% CI 1.81 to 2.02). These results suggest that machine learning strategies can improve surveillance testing effectiveness, especially in a university setting, by effectively distributing testing resources and potentially reducing community transmission.","Krieg, Steven J; Avendano, Carolina; Grantham-Brown, Evan; Asbun, Aaron Lilienfeld; Schnur, Jennifer J; Miranda, Marie Lynn; Chawla, Nitesh V",,,328

However, the fact that strict government mandates focus on physical distancing does not mean that social connectedness for voluntary risk communication among citizens should be sacrificed. Furthermore, we lack an understanding of citizens' behaviors regarding the voluntary adoption of public health measures and the control of mental wellbeing in the age of physical distancing. Key variables in the response to the global pandemic are the emergence of risk deliberation networks, voluntary compliance with government guidelines, and the restoration of citizens' subjective health.

477863,Challenges posed by COVID-19 to the health of people with disabilities living in residential care facilities in Romania,2020,"An epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus diseases (C0VID-19) initially reported in Wuhan, China has rapidly emerged into a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) forms the mainstay in screening, diagnosis and epidemiology of the disease. Since the virus evolves by accumulating base substitutions, mutations in the viral genome could possibly affect the accuracy of RT-PCR-based detection assays. The recent availability of genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates motivated us to assess the presence and potential impact of variations in target sites of the oligonucleotide primers and probes used in molecular diagnosis. We catalogued a total of 132 primer or probe sequences from literature and data available in the public domain. Our analysis revealed that a total of 5862 unique genetic variants mapped to at least one of the 132 primer or probe binding sites in the genome. A total of 29 unique variants were present in &#8805; 1% of genomes from at least one of the continents (Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America) that mapped to 36 unique primers or probes binding sites. Similarly, a total of 27 primer or probe binding sites had cumulative variants frequency of &#8805; 1% in the global SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These included primers or probes sites which are used worldwide for molecular diagnosis as well as approved by national and international agencies. We also found 286 SARS-CoV-2 genomic regions with low variability at a continuous stretch of &#8805; 20bps that could be potentially used for primer designing. This highlights the need for sequencing genomes of emerging pathogens to enable evidence-based policies for development and approval of diagnostics.","Jain, Abhinav; Rophina, Mercy; Mahajan, Saurabh; Krishnan, Bhavya Balaji; Sharma, Manasa; Mandal, Sreya; Fernandez, Teresa; Sultanji, Sumayra; Jolly, Bani; Mathew, Samatha; Sivasubbu, Sridhar; Scaria, Vinod",Int J Infect Dis,,328

Studies revealed that obesity may affect the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. The aim of the meta-analysis is to identify the prevalence and impact of obesity on COVID-19. Studies on obese COVID-19 patients were obtained by searching PubMed, Cochrane Library databases and Web of Science databases, up to date to 5 June 2020. And the prevalence rate and the odds ratio (OR) of obesity with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as comprehensive indicators for analysis using a random-effects model. A total of 6081 patients in 11 studies were included. The prevalence of obesity in patients with COVID-19 was 30% (95% CI 21-39%). Obese patients were 1.79 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 than non-obese patients (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.52-2.11, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%). However obesity was not associated with death in COVID-19 patients (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.65-1.71, P = 0.84, I2 = 66.6%). In dose-response analysis, it was estimated that COVID-19 patients had a 16% increased risk of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.10-1.23, P < 0.0001) and a 20% increased risk of admission to ICU (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.30, P < 0.0001) per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI.

Effective vaccines remain the most promising approach to counter SARS-CoV-2. Yet, while promising results are emerging from COVID-19 vaccine trials, the need for multiple doses and the challenges associated with the widespread distribution and administration of vaccines remain concerns. Here, we engineered the coat protein of the MS2 bacteriophage and generated nanoparticles displaying multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The use of these nanoparticles as vaccines generated high neutralizing antibody titers and protected Syrian hamsters from a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 after a single immunization with no infectious virus detected in the lungs. This nanoparticle-based vaccine platform thus provides protection after a single immunization and may be broadly applicable for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens with pandemic potential.","Chiba, Shiho; Frey, Steven J; Halfmann, Peter J; Kuroda, Makoto; Maemura, Tadashi; Yang, Jie E; Wright, Elizabeth R; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Kane, Ravi S",Commun Biol,,328

In this study, by using a monoclonal antibody to the S1 protein of IBV M41 strain, we found that heat shock protein member 8 (HSPA8) could interact with spike protein of IBV. HSPA8 was found to be present on the cell membrane and chicken tissues, with highest expression level in the kidney. Results of co-IP and GST-pull-down assays indicated that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of IBV M41 could interact with HSPA8. The results of binding blocking assay and infection inhibition assay showed that recombinant protein HSPA8 and antibody to HSPA8 could inhibit IBV M41 infection of chicken embryonic kidney (CEK) cells. Further, we found that HSPA8 interacted with the N-terminal 19-272 amino acids of S1 of IBV Beaudette, H120 and QX strains and HSPA8 from human and pig also interacted with IBV M41-RBD. Finally the results of binding blocking assay and infection inhibition assay showed that recombinant HSPA8 protein and antibody to HSPA8 could inhibit IBV Beaudette strain infection of Vero cells that were treated with heparanase to remove heparan sulfate from the cell surface. Taken together, our results indicate that HSPA8 is a novel host factor involved in IBV infection.","Zhu, Pengpeng; Lv, Chenfei; Fang, Chengxiu; Peng, Xing; Sheng, Hao; Xiao, Peng; Kumar Ojha, Nishant; Yan, Yan; Liao, Min; Zhou, Jiyong",Front Microbiol,,328

Surprisingly, few cases of Covid-19 have been reported in people living with HIV (PLWHIV). METHODS: Here we present a series of 30 PLWHIV diagnosed for SARS-COV2 infection. The principal outcome was to describe clinical characteristics of this population. RESULTS: Eighteen (60%) patients were men, 10/30 (33,3%) women and 2/30 (6,7%) transgender women. Median age was 53,7 years (range 30-80 years) and 23/30 patients (76,7%) were born in a foreign country (out of France). The most common comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (11/30, 36,7%), hypertension (11/30, 36,7%), diabetes (9/30,30%) obesity (7/30, 23%) and chronic renal disease (5/30, 16,7%). Twenty (66,7%) patients presented overweight. Five patients (16,7%) had a Charlson comorbidity (Quan et al., 2011) score &#8805;3. Twenty-seven (90%) patients were virologically suppressed.CD4 count was >500cell/mm 3 in 23/30 (76,6%) patients. An antiviral treatment for SARS-COV2 was administered, in addition to HIV treatment, in 5/30 patients (16,3%). Twenty-four patients (80%) recovered from covid-19, 3/30 (10%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, 2/30 (6,7%) patients died and 4/30 (13,3%) patients were still hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the patients were virologically suppressed with CD4>500 mm3. Risk factors were the same as those described in other SARS-COV2 series, suggesting that HIV infection is probably not an independent risk factor for covid-19.","Isernia, Valentina; Julia, Zelie; Le Gac, Sylvie; Bachelard, Antoine; Landman, Roland; Lariven, Sylvie; Joly, Véronique; Deconinck, Laurène; Rioux, Christophe; Lescure, Xavier; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Ghosn, Jade",Int J Infect Dis,,328

489341,Psychological needs and response during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a major public health crisis, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demonstrates the urgent need for safe, effective, and evidence-based implementations of digital health. The urgency stems from the frequent tendency to focus attention on seemingly high promising digital health interventions despite being poorly validated in times of crisis. AIM: In this paper, we describe a joint call for action to use and leverage evidence-based health informatics as the foundation for the COVID-19 response and public health interventions. Tangible examples are provided for how the working groups and special interest groups of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) are helping to build an evidence-based response to this crisis. METHODS: Leaders of working and special interest groups of the IMIA, a total of 26 groups, were contacted via e-mail to provide a summary of the scientific-based efforts taken to combat COVID-19 pandemic and participate in the discussion toward the creation of this manuscript. A total of 13 groups participated in this manuscript. RESULTS: Various efforts were exerted by members of IMIA including (1) developing evidence-based guidelines for the design and deployment of digital health solutions during COVID-19; (2) surveying clinical informaticians internationally about key digital solutions deployed to combat COVID-19 and the challenges faced when implementing and using them; and (3) offering necessary resources for clinicians about the use of digital tools in clinical practice, education, and research during COVID-19. DISCUSSION: Rigor and evidence need to be taken into consideration when designing, implementing, and using digital tools to combat COVID-19 to avoid delays and unforeseen negative consequences. It is paramount to employ a multidisciplinary approach for the development and implementation of digital health tools that have been rapidly deployed in response to the pandemic bearing in mind human factors, ethics, data privacy, and the diversity of context at the local, national, and international levels. The training and capacity building of front-line workers is crucial and must be linked to a clear strategy for evaluation of ongoing experiences.","Fernandez-Luque, Luis; Kushniruk, Andre W; Georgiou, Andrew; Basu, Arindam; Petersen, Carolyn; Ronquillo, Charlene; Paton, Chris; Nøhr, Christian; Kuziemsky, Craig E; Alhuwail, Dari; Skiba, Diane; Huesing, Elaine; Gabarron, Elia; Borycki, Elizabeth M; Magrabi, Farah; Denecke, Kerstin; Peute, Linda W P; Topaz, Max; Al-Shorbaji, Najeeb; Lacroix, Paulette; Marcilly, Romaric; Cornet, Ronald; Gogia, Shashi B; Kobayashi, Shinji; Iyengar, Sriram; Deserno, Thomas M; Mettler, Tobias; Vimarlund, Vivian; Zhu, Xinxin",Methods Inf Med,,328

Numerous studies have illustrated that activation of inflammation and fluctuating immune reactions play a crucial role in the physiopathology of depression. The effectiveness of antidepressants is affected by the intensity of the inflammatory response. Thus, we aim to reveal the correlation of inflammatory factors and depression. MAIN METHODS: Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ&#8482;)-based proteomics was applied to verify the quantitation of target proteins in the PFC of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model mice. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to explore related pathways, and the involvement of molecules was validated by western blotting and real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). KEY FINDINGS: According to the IPA results, CSDS-susceptible mice and CSDS-resilient mice both exhibited alterations of the inflammasome pathway in the PFC. Compared with control mice, susceptible mice subjected to CSDS showed an increased ATP-activated purinergic receptor P2X7 (also known as P2RX7) protein level. Nevertheless, the expression levels of cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease 1 (Caspase 1) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) were reduced in CSDS mice, and downregulation of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) was found in susceptible mice. Moreover, no significant difference was found in nuclear factor-&#954;B levels among the three groups. SIGNIFICANCE: CSDS administration leads to dysfunctions of key molecules in the inflammasome pathway, promoting depressive-like behaviors in mice.","Lan, Tianlan; Bai, Mengge; Chen, Xiangyu; Wang, Yue; Li, Yan; Tian, Yu; He, Yong; Wu, Zhonghao; Yu, Heming; Chen, Zhi; Chen, Chong; Yu, Yaping; Cheng, Ke; Xie, Peng",Life Sci,,328

The aim of the current study was to investigate how the pandemic has affected the burnout, stress, and emotional well-being of pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) providers and staff in the New York and New Jersey epicenter. METHODS: The study was conducted in June 2020 during the pandemic through an electronic survey. The survey contained questions surrounding demographics, pandemic experiences, and validated burnout, stress, and emotional well-being measures. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-two PHO providers and staff responded to the survey. Overall, half of the participants reported high levels of burnout, average stress scores were in the mild-moderate range, and the majority scored in the none-to-mild symptomatology range for their well-being. Self-reported burnout levels before the pandemic and geographic work location were statistically significant risk factors for all outcomes. Additional predictors for some outcomes included hospital role, lack of trust in leadership, and deployment. The majority of participants (87.0%) reported that their hospitals had made mental health resources related to COVID-19 available to them but only 8.4% reported having used them. CONCLUSION: PHO providers and staff in the NYC/NJ area are experiencing a range of emotional experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the majority are not using current resources. With the continuation of the pandemic, we must continue efforts to improve provider and staff distress to mitigate the degree of potential negative short-term and long-term impact.","Moerdler, Scott; Steinberg, Dara M; Jin, Zhezhen; Cole, Peter D; Levy, Adam S; Rosenthal, Susan L",JCO Oncol Pract,,328

I merged 2020 data from the Virginia Department of Health, Google Mobility Reports, and the US Census to estimate a series of 2-way fixed-effect event-study regression models.Results. A stay-at-home order caused people to increase the amount of time spent at home by 12 percentage points and decrease the time the spent at work by 30 percentage points, retail and recreation venues by 40 percentage points, and grocery stores and pharmacies by 10 percentage points. People did not sustain changes in mobility and gradually returned to prepandemic levels before the stay-at-home order was lifted. In areas where people spent the most time at indoor locations, there was a large increase in COVID-19.Conclusions. A more robust and stricter policy response coordinated at the national level combined with a strong economic response from policymakers could have increased the effectiveness of the stay-at-home order.","Murray, Tim",Am J Public Health,,328

This meta-analysis aimed to explore the relationship between lymphocyte count and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive systematic literature search was carried out to find studies published from December 2019 to 22 March 2020 from five databases. The language of literatures included English and Chinese. Mean difference (MD) of lymphocyte count in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of lymphopenia for severe form of COVID-19 was evaluated with this meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall 13 case-series with a total of 2282 cases were included in the study. The pooled analysis showed that lymphocyte count was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients (MD -0.31×109/L; 95%CI: -0.42 to -0.19×109/L). The presence of lymphopenia was associated with nearly threefold increased risk of severe COVID-19 (Random effects model, OR=2.99, 95% CI: 1.31-6.82). CONCLUSIONS: Lymphopenia is a prominent part of severe COVID-19 and a lymphocyte count of less than 1.5×109/L may be useful in predicting the severity clinical outcomes.","Zhao, Qianwen; Meng, Meng; Kumar, Rahul; Wu, Yinlian; Huang, Jiaofeng; Deng, Yunlei; Weng, Zhiyuan; Yang, Li",Int J Infect Dis,,328

In this work, we present a novel processing framework to inject into the reconstruction problem basic prior knowledge about brain anatomy and its organization and evaluate its effectiveness using both simulated and real human brain data.

498747,Anxiety and coping strategies among nursing students during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 must (1) enter a target/host cell, (2) reprogram it to ensure its replication, (3) exit the host cell, and (4) repeat this cycle for exponential growth. During the exit step, the virus hijacks the sophisticated machineries that host cells employ to correctly fold, assemble, and transport proteins along the exocytic pathway. Therefore, secretory pathway-mediated assemblage and excretion of infective particles represent appealing targets to reduce the efficacy of virus biogenesis, if not to block it completely. Here, we analyze and discuss the contribution of the molecular machines operating in the early secretory pathway in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and their relevance for potential antiviral targeting. The fact that these molecular machines are conserved throughout evolution, together with the redundancy and tissue specificity of their components, provides opportunities in the search for unique proteins essential for SARS-CoV-2 biology that could also be targeted with therapeutic objectives. Finally, we provide an overview of recent evidence implicating proteins of the early secretory pathway as potential antiviral targets with effective therapeutic applications.","Sicari, Daria; Chatziioannou, Aristotelis; Koutsandreas, Theodoros; Sitia, Roberto; Chevet, Eric",J. cell. biol,,328

Airborne transmission, beyond the projection of droplets from upper airways, expose healthcare workers to a risk of viral infection. Aerosol generating procedures (AGP) increase the risk of viral transmission to staff within the operating room. METHODS: Surgery of middle ear and mastoid is also considered an AGP, particularly mastoidectomy performed using a high-speed drill. The authors report their experience in endoscopic ear surgery as an alternative technique to reduce AGP in otologic procedures. RESULTS: Transcanal endoscopic ear surgery is a reliable technique used to manage many otologic conditions. CONCLUSION: The endoscopic approach may reduce the risk of viral transmission to operating room staff by reducing the need for mastoidectomy.","Ayache, Stephane; Kutz, Walter; Isaacson, Brandon; Badr-El-Dine, Mohamed; Nogueira, Joao Flavio; Marchioni, Daniele; Presutti, Livio",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,328

502169,Anxiety is associated with appetitive traits in university students during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a key role in viral infectivity. It is also the major antigen stimulating the host's protective immune response, specifically, the production of neutralizing antibodies. Recently, a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 possessing multiple mutations in the S protein, designated P.1, emerged in Brazil. Here, we characterized a P.1 variant isolated in Japan by using Syrian hamsters, a well-established small animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19). In hamsters, the variant showed replicative abilities and pathogenicity similar to those of early and contemporary strains (i.e., SARS-CoV-2 bearing aspartic acid [D] or glycine [G] at position 614 of the S protein). Sera and/or plasma from convalescent patients and BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccinees showed comparable neutralization titers across the P.1 variant, S-614D, and S-614G strains. In contrast, the S-614D and S-614G strains were less well recognized than the P.1 variant by serum from a P.1-infected patient. Prior infection with S-614D or S-614G strains efficiently prevented the replication of the P.1 variant in the lower respiratory tract of hamsters upon reinfection. In addition, passive transfer of neutralizing antibodies to hamsters infected with the P.1 variant or the S-614G strain led to reduced virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. However, the effect was less pronounced against the P.1 variant than the S-614G strain. These findings suggest that the P.1 variant may be somewhat antigenically different from the early and contemporary strains of SARS-CoV-2.","Imai, Masaki; Halfmann, Peter J; Yamayoshi, Seiya; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Chiba, Shiho; Watanabe, Tokiko; Nakajima, Noriko; Ito, Mutsumi; Kuroda, Makoto; Kiso, Maki; Maemura, Tadashi; Takahashi, Kenta; Loeber, Samantha; Hatta, Masato; Koga, Michiko; Nagai, Hiroyuki; Yamamoto, Shinya; Saito, Makoto; Adachi, Eisuke; Akasaka, Osamu; Nakamura, Morio; Nakachi, Ichiro; Ogura, Takayuki; Baba, Rie; Fujita, Kensuke; Ochi, Junichi; Mitamura, Keiko; Kato, Hideaki; Nakajima, Hideaki; Yagi, Kazuma; Hattori, Shin-Ichiro; Maeda, Kenji; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Miyazato, Yusuke; Valdez, Riccardo; Gherasim, Carmen; Furusawa, Yuri; Okuda, Moe; Ujie, Michiko; Lopes, Tiago J S; Yasuhara, Atsuhiro; Ueki, Hiroshi; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Eisfeld, Amie J; Baczenas, John J; Baker, David A; O039,; Connor, Shelby L; Connor, David H; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Fujimoto, Tsuguto",Proc.

502279,Nationwide suicides due to alcohol withdrawal symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic: A review of cases from media reports,2020,"The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS CoV-2. To date, â¼463,000 people died worldwide due to this disease. Several attempts have been taken in search of effective drugs to control the spread of SARS CoV-2 infection. The main protease (Mpro) from SARS CoV-2 plays a vital role in viral replication and thus serves as an important drug target. This Mpro shares a high degree of sequence similarity (>96%) with the same protease from SARS CoV-1 and MERS. It was already reported that Broussonetia papyrifera polyphenols efficiently inhibit the catalytic activity of SARS CoV-1 and MERS Mpro. But whether these polyphenols exhibit any inhibitory effect on SARS CoV-2 Mpro is far from clear. To understand this fact, here we have adopted computational approaches. Polyphenols having proper drug-likeness properties and two repurposed drugs (lopinavir and darunavir; having binding affinity -7.3 to -7.4 kcal/mol) were docked against SARS CoV-2 Mpro to study their binding properties. Only six polyphenols (broussochalcone A, papyriflavonol A, 3'-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-3',4',7-trihydroxyflavane, broussoflavan A, kazinol F and kazinol J) had interaction with both the catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro and exhibited good binding affinity (-7.6 to -8.2 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamic simulations (100 ns) revealed that all Mpro-polyphenol complexes are more stable, conformationally less fluctuated; slightly less compact and marginally expanded than Mpro-darunavir/lopinavir complex. Even the number of intermolecular H-bond and MM-GBSA analysis suggested that these six polyphenols are more potent Mpro inhibitors than the two repurposed drugs (lopinavir and darunavir) and may serve as promising anti-COVID-19 drugs.

505196,Environmental Enrichment as a Strategy to Confront Social Isolation Under the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Post intubation tracheal rupture is very uncommon but has a great associated morbidity and mortality. Its incidence varies widely between publications and is estimated around 5/100.000 with standard tracheal tube (STT) and around 500-1900/100.000 with double lumen tube (DLT), although probably underestimated. Despite its relatively low incidence, airway management is paramount and could get extremely complex. CASE DESCRIPTION: Previously healthy 36 years old woman admitted at the ICU with bilateral pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency. Intubation and mechanical ventilation were required. Over the next 6 hours the patient status deteriorates and develops subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum with hemodynamic instability. An emergency CT informs of a subcarinal tracheal rupture. With these findings and the general state worsening, a surgical approach is taken. Upon patient's arrival in the operating room, high inspiratory pressures are required and persistent aerial leak in the ventilator system is detected. Peripheral pulse oxymetry stabilizes around 88%. A fibrobronchoscopy is performed to advance the tube cuff lower from the rupture, but it fails as the trachea is filled with blood and dense mucus. As an alternative, the STT is switched with a left 35 Fr DLT with an exchanger in the means of isolating left bronchus and proceed with the surgery. After successfully isolating the left bronchus and positioning the patient for surgery, the DLT migrates and progressive oxygen desaturation and hemodynamic instability follow (with pulse oximetry below 30%, severe bradycardia and hypotension). It is in this critical moment that a 5mm STT is handed to the surgeon to pass it through the rupture thus isolating the left bronchus and allowing ventilation and reversing the critical state. After stabilization and in lateral decubitus, GlideScope was used to advance a 7,5mm STT to the tracheal rupture, where it was grasped and manually advanced to the left bronchus by the surgeon. This allowed effective ventilation and the reparation of the tracheal rupture. DISCUSSION: In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, tracheal complications are on the rise due to prolonged intubation and ventilation times. Although infrequent, tracheal rupture is an extreme example of emergency airway management. This particular case required an unconventional approach as previous measures to te the airway had failed. Diagnosis should be confirmed through fiberoptic bronchoscopy and given the size of the rupture and patient's hemodynamic instability, if performed earlier, it could have given a definitive diagnosis and prevented further instability by advancing the STT bypassing the injury.","Piñero Prieto, D.; Díaz Fernández, A.; Guillén Iranzo, C.; Campos Fernández, N.; Marrero García, R.; Martin Machin, E.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,328

Many respondents consumed more than one CAM products or home remedies but there were no reported acute or severe adverse effects with these products. However, it is essential to ensure the safety of these interventions on long-term use because patients with other comorbidities can have a detrimental effect due to these products or due to drug herb interaction with their ongoing medications.

The knowledge gained from previous human coronavirus outbreaks suggests that pregnant women and their fetuses are particularly susceptible to poor outcomes. The objective of this study was to summarize the clinical manifestations and maternal and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 during pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched databases for all case reports and series from 12 February to 4 April 2020. Multiple terms and combinations were used including COVID-19, pregnancy, maternal mortality, maternal morbidity, complications, clinical manifestations, neonatal morbidity, intrauterine fetal death, neonatal mortality and SARS-CoV-2. Eligibility criteria included peer-reviewed publications written in English or Chinese and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or dual fluorescence PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unpublished reports, unspecified date and location of the study or suspicion of duplicate reporting, cases with suspected COVID-19 that were not confirmed by a laboratory test, and unreported maternal or perinatal outcomes were excluded. Data on clinical manifestations, maternal and perinatal outcomes including vertical transmission were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Eighteen articles reporting data from 108 pregnancies between 8 December 2019 and 1 April 2020 were included in the current study. Most reports described women presenting in the third trimester with fever (68%) and coughing (34%). Lymphocytopenia (59%) with elevated C-reactive protein (70%) was observed and 91% of the women were delivered by cesarean section. Three maternal intensive care unit admissions were noted but no maternal deaths. One neonatal death and one intrauterine death were also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of mothers were discharged without any major complications, severe maternal morbidity as a result of COVID-19 and perinatal deaths were reported. Vertical transmission of the COVID-19 could not be ruled out. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures to prevent neonatal infection are warranted.","Zaigham, Mehreen; Andersson, Ola",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,,328
508493,The impact of COVID-19 on pharmacy students in Sudan: A cross-sectional survey,2020,"The purpose of this paper is to extend to ordinal and nominal outcomes the measures of degree of necessity and of sufficiency defined by the authors for dichotomous and survival outcomes in a previous paper. A cause, represented by certain values of prognostic factors, is considered necessary for an event if, without the cause, the event cannot develop. It is considered sufficient for an event if the event is unavoidable in the presence of the cause. The degrees of necessity and sufficiency, ranging from zero to one, are simple, intuitive functions of unconditional and conditional probabilities of an event such as disease or death. These probabilities often will be derived from logistic regression models; the measures, however, do not require any particular model. In addition, we study in detail the relationship between the proposed measures and the related explained variation summary for dichotomous outcomes, which are the common root for the developments for ordinal, nominal, and survival outcomes. We introduce and analyze the Austrian covid-19 data, with the aim of quantifying effects of age and other potentially prognostic factors on covid-19 mortality. This is achieved by standard regression methods but also in terms of the newly proposed measures. It is shown how they complement the toolbox of prognostic factor studies, in particular when comparing the importance of prognostic factors of different types. While the full model's degree of necessity is extremely high (0.933), its low degree of sufficiency (0.179) is responsible for the low proportion of explained variation (0.193).","Gleiss, Andreas; Henderson, Robin; Schemper, Michael",Stat Med,,328
508722,Employment Patterns of Dental Hygienists in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) vaccine platforms are becoming available and are the most promising strategy to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, numerous uncertainties exist regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, especially in patients with (immune-mediated) kidney diseases on immunosuppressive drugs. Here, members of the Immunonephrology Working Group (IWG) of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) discuss thirteen frequently-asked questions regarding safety and efficacy of the most promising vaccine candidates. Post-marketing surveillance should be performed to estimate the rate of vaccine response (humoral and cellular) of different vaccine platforms, and surveillance of disease activity following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Some of the candidates induce signaling pathways which also promote autoimmune kidney diseases, e.g. type I interferons in systemic lupus erythematosus. Efficacy estimates would thus far favor the use of selected COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or Gam-COVID-Vac. Humoral immune response after vaccination should be monitored using appropriate assays. Even in the absence of neutralizing antibodies patients might be protected by a sufficient cellular immune response capable to reduce severity of COVID-19. A reduced vaccine response after the use of CD20-depleting agents is anticipated, and it is particularly important to discuss strategies to improve vaccine response with these patients. Distancing and shielding measures remain important as not all vaccines fully protect from coronavirus infection. In-depth information about the most pressing vaccine questions is essential to reduce vaccine hesitancy of patients.","Kronbichler, Andreas; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Fernandez-Juárez, Gema Maria; Floege, Jürgen; Goumenos, Dimitrios; Segelmark, Mårten; Tesar, Vladimir; Turkmen, Kultigin; van Kooten, Cees; Bruchfeld, Annette",Nephrol. dial. transplant,,328

511861,Coronavirus Pandemic Anxiety Scale (CPAS-11): development and initial validation,2020,"Several epidemiological models are being used around the world to project the number of infected individuals and the mortality rates of the COVID-19 outbreak. Advancing accurate prediction models is of utmost importance to take proper actions. Due to the lack of essential data and uncertainty, the epidemiological models have been challenged regarding the delivery of higher accuracy for long-term prediction. As an alternative to the susceptible-infected-resistant (SIR)-based models, this study proposes a hybrid machine learning approach to predict the COVID-19, and we exemplify its potential using data from Hungary. The hybrid machine learning methods of adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and multi-layered perceptron-imperialist competitive algorithm (MLP-ICA) are proposed to predict time series of infected individuals and mortality rate. The models predict that by late May, the outbreak and the total morality will drop substantially. The validation is performed for 9 days with promising results, which confirms the model accuracy. It is expected that the model maintains its accuracy as long as no significant interruption occurs. This paper provides an initial benchmarking to demonstrate the potential of machine learning for future research.","Pinter, Gergo; Felde, Imre; Mosavi, Amir; Ghamisi, Pedram; Gloaguen, Richard",Mathematics,,328
512354,WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) vs COVID-19 Uncertainty,2020,"BACKGROUND: Observational studies of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak suggest that a 'cytokine storm' is involved in the pathogenesis of severe illness. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the altered pathological inflammation in COVID-19 are largely unknown. We report here that toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-mediated inflammatory signaling molecules are upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients, compared with healthy controls (HC). METHODS: A total of 48 subjects including 28 COVID-19 patients (8 severe/critical vs. 20 mild/moderate cases) admitted to Chungnam National University Hospital, and age/sex-matched 20 HC were enrolled in this study. PBMCs from the subjects were processed for nCounter Human Immunology gene expression assay to analyze the immune related transcriptome profiles. Recombinant proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) were used to stimulate the PBMCs and monocyte-derived macrophages, and real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the mRNA expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. RESULTS: Among the most highly increased inflammatory mediators in severe/critically ill patients, S100A9, an alarmin and TLR4 ligand, was found as a noteworthy biomarker, because it inversely correlated with the serum albumin levels. We also observed that recombinant S2 and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 significantly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and S100A9 in human primary PBMCs. CONCLUSION: These data support a link between TLR4 signaling and pathological inflammation during COVID-19 and contribute to develop therapeutic approaches through targeting TLR4-mediated inflammation.","Sohn, Kyung Mok; Lee, Sung Gwon; Kim, Hyeon Ji; Cheon, Shinhyea; Jeong, Hyeongseok; Lee, Jooyeon; Kim, In Soo; Silwal, Prashanta; Kim, Young Jae; Paik, Seungwha; Chung, Chaeuk; Park, Chungoo; Kim, Yeon Sook; Jo, Eun Kyeong",J Korean Med Sci,,328
512355,WHO International Health Regulations (IHR) vs COVID-19 Uncertainty,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although there are increasing concerns on mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, no large-scale population-based studies have examined the associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and subsequent mental health. METHODS: This study analysed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the PsyCorona Survey that included 54,845 participants from 112 countries, of which 23,278 participants are representative samples of 24 countries in terms of gender and age. Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to examine associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and self-rated mental health. This robust method considers all reasonable model specifications to avoid subjective analytical decisions while accounting for multiple testing. RESULTS: All 162 multilevel linear regressions in the SCA indicated that higher risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with less positive or more negative emotions (median standardised ß=-0.171, median SE=0.004, P<0.001). Specifically, regressions involving economic risk perception and negative emotions revealed stronger associations. Moreover, risk perception at baseline survey was inversely associated with subsequent mental health (standardised ß=-0.214, SE=0.029, P<0.001). We further used SCA to explore whether this inverse association was mediated by emotional distress. Among the 54 multilevel linear regressions of mental health on risk perception and emotion, 42 models showed a strong mediation effect, where no significant direct effect of risk perception was found after controlling for emotion (P>0.05). LIMITATIONS: Reliance on self-reported data. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception of COVID-19 was associated with emotion and ultimately mental health. Interventions on reducing excessive risk perception and managing emotional distress could promote mental health.","Han, Qing; Zheng, Bang; Agostini, Maximilian; Bélanger, Jocelyn J; Gützkow, Ben; Kreienkamp, Jannis; Reitsema, Anne Margit; van Breen, Jolien A; Collaboration, PsyCorona; Leander, N Pontus",J. affect. disord,,328

In order to fully appraise the available data, we performed a meta-analysis of 18 published studies. METHODS: A thorough systematic search was conducted. The studies enrolling critically ill patients receiving thiamine supplementation was compared with the standard of care (SOC) group. Data was analyzed using RevMan 5.4. Clinical outcomes were pooled using Odds Ratio (OR) and mean differences. RESULT: Eighteen studies (8 RCTs and 10 cohort studies) met the criteria for quantitative synthesis. In the analysis of RCTs, thiamine supplementation showed 42% lower odds of developing ICU delirium (OR 0.58, 95% CI, 0.34-0.98). A reduction in mortaliy was observed on performing fixed effect model analysis however, a level of statistical significance could not be reached on performing randon effect model analysis (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.04). Further sub-group analysis of 13 studies in patients with sepsis, there was no difference in mortality between the two groups (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09). CONCLUSION: Thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients showed a reduction in the incidence of ICU delirium among RCTs. However, there was no significant benefit in terms of overall mortality, and mortality in patients with sepsis. Further, large scale randomized prospective studies are warranted to investigate the role of thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients.","Sedhai, Yub Raj; Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Budhathoki, Pravash; Jha, Vivek; Mandal, Sujit Kumar; Karki, Saurab; Baniya, Ramkaji; Cable, Casey A; Kashiouris, Markos G",J Crit Care,,328

We analyzed the impact of the use of CGRP antagonists in patients with migraine during the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. METHODS: This is a multicentre cross-sectional study. From May to November 2020, through a national survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Neurology, we collected data about the presence of COVID-19 symptoms including headache and their characteristics and severity in patients with migraine treated with anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and compared them with patients with migraine not receiving this treatment. We also conducted a subanalysis of patients with COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: We recruited 300 patients with migraine: 51.7% (155/300) were taking anti-CGRP mAbs; 87.3% were women (262/300). Mean age (standard deviation) was 47.1 years (11.6). Forty-one patients (13.7%) met diagnostic criteria for COVID-19, with no statistically significant difference between patients with and without anti-CGRP mAb treatment (16.1% vs 11.0%, respectively; P=.320). Of the patients with COVID-19, 48.8% (20/41) visited the emergency department and 12.2% (5/41) were hospitalised. Likewise, no clinical differences were found between the groups of patients with and without anti-CGRP mAb treatment.

Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of the acquisition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection (SARS CoV-2) due to their close interaction with infected patients (1, 2). Also, HCWs can serve as reservoirs of SARS CoV-2 cross-transmission both in community and hospital settings (1). However, the extent of COVID-19 infection among HCWs in Sri Lanka is understudied. ObjectivesThis study determined the incidence, demographic characteristics, and risk exposure behavior of HCWs who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 at Base Hospital Wathupitiwala. Furthermore, the rate of acquisition of SARS CoV-2 following COVISHIELD/ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Sinopharm /BBIBP-CorV vaccines in HCWs were studied. MethodsA retrospective cross-sectional descriptive analysis was conducted from May 2021 to August 2021 for a total of 818 HCWs. ResultsHundred and twenty-four HCWs (15.16%) were tested positive for COVID-19. The mean age of infected HCWs was 46.27 years and the majority were females (74.19%). Among all infected persons, 54 (43.55%) were nurses/midwives, 39 (31.45%) were clinical supportive staff and 12(9.68%) were medical officers. The number of infected HCWs rapidly escalated and a total of 64(51.61%) HCWs got an infection during August/2021. No source was identified in most of them (34.68%) followed by community acquisition (33.87%). Thirty-five HCWs (28.23%) had acquired infection during a hospital setting or had a high-risk exposure in recent history. Among hospital-related infections, 37.91% of HCWs had shared meals or shared sleeping rooms with an infected workmate. The majority of the HCWs were tested by the infection control unit as symptomatic screening (70.16%) followed by contact tracing (20.16%). Fifty-six (45.16%) HCWs had a history of single or multiple comorbidities. The vast majority of HCWs (95.97%) presented as mild to asymptomatic disease that followed an uneventful recovery. Body aches, headache, fever, and sore throat were the most commonly reported symptoms among them. Among the five HCWs required therapeutic oxygen supplementation, two unvaccinated HCWs succumbed to the infection. The rate of breakthrough infection among HCWs was 8.93%. The acquisition of disease was significantly higher among unvaccinated HCWs than partially (p<0.0001) or fully vaccinated (p<0.0001) HCWs with either type of vaccine. ConclusionsProtecting HCWs remains a challenge in resource-poor settings. The risk of infection fueled by very contagious circulating variants is continuously high even though vaccination has shown clear benefits in preventing mortality and severe infection. Therefore, all healthcare workers should be vaccinated while ensuring continuous infection control measures in the hospital setting.","Samaranayake, W.A.M.P.; Jayawardhana, G.P.C.; Roshan, A.L.L.; Wijewardene, M.A.M.; Siraj, M.

Methods: COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests, case age distribution, and the difference between 2020 all-cause mortality and the average mortality of the previous 5 years were compared across nations. Patterns in cell phone mobility data, testing strategies, and seniors' care home deaths were also compared. Data for each nation were based on publicly available sources as of July 31, 2020. Results: Compared with its Nordic peers, Sweden had a higher incidence rate across all ages, a higher COVID-19-related death rate only partially explained by population demographics, a higher death rate in seniors' care, and higher all-cause mortality. Sweden had approximately half as much mobility change as its Nordic neighbours until April and followed similar rates as its neighbours from April to July. Denmark led its Nordic peers in testing rates, while Sweden had the highest cumulative test-positivity rate continuously from mid-March. Conclusions: COVID-19 pushed Sweden's health system to its capacity, exposed systemic weaknesses in the seniors' care system, and revealed challenges with implementing effective contact tracing and testing strategies while experiencing a high case burden. Looser government restrictions at the beginning of the outbreak are likely to have played a role in the impact of COVID-19 in Sweden. In an effort to improve epidemic control, Sweden has increased testing rates, implemented more restrictive prevention measures, and increased their intensive care unit bed capacity.","Yarmol-Matusiak, Erica A; Cipriano, Lauren E; Stranges, Saverio",Scand J Public Health,,328

It also brought with it panic and fear, halted many activities, and led to the decline of the global economy. It changed human behavior and forced people to change their lifestyles to avoid infection. One of the most sectors that must be taken into consideration through pandemic coronavirus (COVID-19) around the globe is the air conditioning systems. The HVAC systems depend on the air as a heat transfer medium. The air contains a group of pollutants, viruses, and bacteria, and it affects and destroys human life. The air filter plays a major role as an important component in the air conditioning systems. Thus, it requires more effort by researchers to improve its design to prevent the ultra-size of particles loaded with coronavirus (COVID-19). This paper provides insight into the design of existing combined air-conditioners on their suitability and their impact on the spread of the hybrid coronavirus epidemic and review efforts to obtain a highly efficient air filter to get rid of super-sized particles for protection against epidemic infection. In addition, important guideline recommendations have been made to limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus and to obtain indoor air quality in air-conditioned places.","Elsaid, Ashraf Mimi; Ahmed, M Salem",Environ Res,,328

ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2-Ang 1-7-MasR counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans. ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes. ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury. Current research shows that the poor prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is related to factors such as sex (male), age (>60 years), underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), secondary ARDS, and other relevant factors. Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.","Cheng, Hao; Wang, Yan; Wang, Gui-Qiang",J Med Virol,,328

Tocilizumab has been recently added to the treatment guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data remain conflicting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane central were searched from March 1, 2020, until March 10, 2021, for randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality, mechanical ventilation, and time to discharge. RESULTS: Nine studies (with 6490 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3358 patients received tocilizumab, and 3132 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98, p = 0.02) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.89, p < 0.0001) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo. In addition, there was a trend towards improved median time to hospital discharge (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12-1.45, p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab therapy improves outcomes of mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection compared with standard therapy or placebo. Our findings suggest the efficacy of tocilizumab therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and strengthen the concept that tocilizumab is a promising therapeutic intervention to improve mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients.","Selvaraj, Vijairam; Khan, Mohammad Saud; Bavishi, Chirag; Dapaah-Afriyie, Kwame; Finn, Arkadiy; Lal, Amos; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Lung,,328
519915,Special section on ‘Sociology and the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic’,2020,"PURPOSE: The use of face mask is globally recommended as a preventive measure against COVID-19. However, the intraocular pressure (IOP) changes caused by face masks remain unknown. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of wearing surgical and FFP2/N95 face masks during a 400-m walking protocol on IOP in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. METHODS: Thirteen subjects diagnosed of POAG (21 eyes) were enrolled in this study. IOP was measured at baseline, during the 400-m walking protocol and after 5 min of passive recovery while POAG patients wore a surgical mask, FFP2/N95 mask and no mask in randomized order. From the 21 POAG eyes, we analyzed the IOP changes caused by physical exercise with two face masks and without wearing any face mask. RESULTS: At rest (baseline and recovery measurements), the use of the different face masks did not affect IOP levels (mean differences ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 mmHg). During physical activity, wearing an FFP2/N95 mask caused a small (mean differences ranging from 1 to 2 mmHg), but statistically significant, IOP rise in comparison to both the surgical mask and control conditions (Cohen's d = 0.63 and 0.83, respectively). CONCLUSION: Face masks must be used to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and POAG patients can safely use FFP2/N95 and surgical masks at rest. However, due to the IOP rise observed while walking with the FFP2/N95 mask, when possible, POAG patients should prioritized the use of surgical masks during physical activity.","Janicijevic, Danica; Redondo, Beatríz; Jiménez, Raimundo; Lacorzana, Javier; García-Ramos, Amador; Vera, Jesús",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,328

OBJECTIVE: To describe the imaging manifestations of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy in hospitalized patients, across anatomic sites and modalities, and to identify clinical variables associated with positive imaging findings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of a consecutive series of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital over a 3-week period. Patient demographics, hematologic values, cross-sectional imaging examinations, and clinical outcomes (death and intubation) were collected. Imaging was reviewed for imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess for associations of patient demographics, hematologic markers, and outcomes, with the conduct of imaging and imaging manifestations of coagulopathy. RESULTS: Among 308 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 46% underwent cross-sectional imaging for a total of 332 included cross-sectional imaging examinations. A total of 26% (37/142) of patients demonstrated imaging positive for coagulopathy. The most common such imaging manifestations were pulmonary embolus (n=21) on contrast-enhanced CT or CTA, thrombus in the upper or lower extremity veins (n=13) on Doppler US, end organ infarction in the bowel (n=4) and kidney (n=4) on contrast-enhanced CT, and thrombus or parenchymal infarction in the brain (n=2) on contrast-enhanced CTA or MRI with MRA. Among patients with imaging positive for coagulopathy, 22% (8/37) had multi-site involvement. Thrombi were multifocal in 4 of 5 patients with positive upper and 3 of 8 patients with positive lower extremity examinations and involved both superficial and/or deep veins. In multivariable analysis, intubation (p<0.001) and prolonged prothrombin time (p=0.04) showed a significant association with undergoing imaging; no patient variable was significantly associated with imaging positive for coagulopathy (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Imaging commonly demonstrates manifestations of coagulopathy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In patients with such manifestations, over a fifth demonstrate multi-site involvement. Clinical variables poorly predict which patients have positive imaging, indicating a complementary role of imaging in detecting COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. CLINICAL IMPACT: In patients with COVID-19, CT pulmonary angiogram, extremity Doppler US, contrast-enhanced abdomen CT, and contrast-enhanced brain MRI and MRA may all be appropriate if systemic coagulopathy is suspected, in the absence of imaging contraindications.","O039,; Shea, Aileen; Parakh, Anushri; Hedgire, Sandeep; Lee, Susanna I",,,328

While early karyotyping studies demonstrated aneuploidy with chromosomal complexity and structural rearrangements, further investigations have identified few recurrent genetic alterations with the exception of the tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1. More recent studies utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS; whole-exome sequencing, WES; and whole-genome sequencing, WGS) reveal a genomic landscape predominantly characterized by somatic copy number alterations rather than point/indel mutations. Despite its genomic complexity, OS has shown variable immune infiltrate and limited immunogenicity. In the current chapter, we review the hallmarks of OS genomics across recent NGS studies and the immune profile of OS including a large institutional cohort of OS patients with recurrent and metastatic disease. Understanding the genomic and immune landscape of OS may provide opportunities for translation in both molecularly targeted therapies and novel immuno-oncology approaches.","Wu, Chia-Chin; Livingston, J Andrew",Adv Exp Med Biol,,328
520169,Characteristics associated with changes in food security status among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis often accompanies gastrointestinal motility disorder that contributes to the development of sepsis in turn. Propofol and dexmedetomidine, as widely used sedatives in patients with sepsis, are likely to depress gastrointestinal peristalsis. We queried whether propofol or dexmedetomidine, at sedative doses, aggravated sepsis-induced ileus. METHODS: Sedative/Anesthetic Scores and vital signs of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemic mice were measured during sedation with propofol or dexmedetomidine. Endotoxemic mice were divided into 10% fat emulsion, propofol, saline, and dexmedetomidine group. The gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, tests of colonic motility, gastrointestinal transit and whole gut transit were evaluated at 15 mins and 24 h after intraperitoneal injection of sedatives/vehicles respectively. RESULTS: 40 mg·kg- 1propofol and 80 µg·kg- 1 dexmedetomidine induced a similar depth of sedation with comparable vital signs except that dexmedetomidine strikingly decreased heart rate in endotoxemic mice. Dexmedetomidine markedly inhibited gastric emptying (P = 0.006), small intestinal transit (P = 0.006), colonic transit (P = 0.0006), gastrointestinal transit (P = 0.0001) and the whole gut transit (P = 0.034) compared with the vehicle, whereas propofol showed no depression on all parts of gastrointestinal motility 15 mins after administration. The inhibitive effects of dexmedetomidine in these tests vanished 24 h after the administration. CONCLUSIONS: Deep sedation with dexmedetomidine, but not propofol, significantly inhibited gastrointestinal peristalsis in endotoxemic mice while the inhibitory effect disappeared 24 h after sedation. These data suggested that both propofol and dexmedetomidine could be applied in septic patients while dexmedetomidine should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac disease or ileus.","Chang, Haiqing; Li, Shuang; Li, Yansong; Hu, Hao; Cheng, Bo; Miao, Jiwen; Gao, Hui; Ma, Hongli; Gao, Yanfeng; Wang, Qiang",BMC Anesthesiol,,328

Docetaxel (DTX) is acknowledged as one of the most important chemotherapy agents. The aim of this study was to improve the efficacy of docetaxel by incorporation into the mPEG-PLA nanoparticle (DTX NP) for the treatment of sarcoma. The DTX NP was prepared by emulsion solvent diffusion method and the prescription and preparation process were optimized through a single factor experiment. The optimized DTX NP was characterized by drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, drug release, etc. Then, the pharmacokinetics was conducted on rats and tumor-bearing ICR mice. Finally, the anti-tumor efficacy of DTX NP with different dosages was evaluated on tumor-bearing ICR mice. The optimized DTX NP was characterized by around 100 nm sphere nanoparticles, sustained in vitro drug release with no obvious burst drug release. Compared with DTX injection, the AUC of DTX NP increased by 94.7- and 35.1-fold on the rats and tumor-bearing ICR mice models, respectively. Moreover, the intra-tumoral drug concentration increased by 5.40-fold. The tumor inhibition rate of DTX NP reached 94.66%, which was 1.24 times that of DTX injection (76.11%) at the same dosage, and the bodyweight increase rate was also higher than the DTX injection. The study provided a DTX NP, which could significantly improve the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of DTX as well as reduced its toxicity. It possessed a certain prospect of application for sarcoma treatment.","Chen, Jianhua; Ning, Eerdunbagena; Wang, Zhijun; Jing, Ziqi; Wei, Guijie; Wang, Xue; Ma, Pengkai",Drug Deliv,,328

Both immune and neuronal systems undergo significant postnatal development and are sensitive to developmental programming by environmental experiences. Negative experiences from infection to psychological stress at a range of different time points (in utero to adolescence) can permanently alter the function of the neuroimmune system: given its prominent role in normal brain development and function this dysregulation may increase vulnerability to psychiatric illness. In contrast, positive experiences such as exercise and environmental enrichment are protective and can promote resilience, even restoring the detrimental effects of negative experiences on the neuroimmune system. This suggests the neuroimmune system is a viable therapeutic target for treatment and prevention of psychiatric illnesses, especially those related to stress. In this review we will summarise the main cells, molecules and functions of the immune system in general and with specific reference to central nervous system development and function. We will then discuss the effects of negative and positive environmental experiences, especially during development, in programming the long-term functioning of the neuroimmune system.

We find that the platform is more likely to provide a uniform (differential) pricing strategy with new products when the revenue sharing portion of the consignment contract is sufficiently low (high). Moreover, surprisingly, without blockchain, the platform prefers moderately perceived and true quality secondhand products, instead of extremely high or low quality.

Empirical findings from Nanjing, China",2021-09-24,"Anticoagulation therapy in portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis is still a matter of debate. Therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nadroparin calcium-warfarin sequential (NWS) anticoagulation therapy in cirrhotic patients and to find an optimal anticoagulation strategy. METHODS: Consecutive cirrhotic patients with PVT who have not received anticoagulation therapy were randomly divided into the NWS therapy group (1-month nadroparin calcium by subcutaneous injection followed by 5-month warfarin by oral administration) and control group (no anticoagulation therapy). Overall recanalization rate of PVT and risks of bleeding were evaluated at the sixth month. RESULTS: Among 64 patients, complete or partial recanalization of PVT was observed in 20/32 NSW therapy group patients vs 11/32 control group patients (62.5% vs 34.4%, P = 0.024), with no statistically significant difference in bleeding rate. Child-Pugh score (P = 0.023), D-dimer < 2.00 μg/mL (P = 0.020), and NWS anticoagulation therapy (P = 0.004) were predictors associated with the recanalization. NWS anticoagulation therapy (P = 0.008) was an independent predicting factor of recanalization. In the NWS therapy group, the Child-Pugh score (P = 0.007) and albumin level (P = 0.004) were improved in the sixth month. DISCUSSION: NWS anticoagulation therapy was effective and safe in PVT patients with cirrhosis and could increase the level of albumin. NWS therapy is safe and easily accepted.","Zhou, Ting; Sun, Xin; Zhou, Tao; Li, Yueyue; Chen, Xiaoning; Cheng, Baoquan; Gao, Yanjing",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.14309/ctg.0000000000000228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32858573/,328

Based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019, we used a Joinpoint regression analysis to examine the variations in the trends of TB incidence and mortality, and the age-period-cohort statistical model to evaluate their risks associated with age, period, and cohort in males and females from Cameroon (CAM), Central African Republic (CAR), Chad, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In the four countries, TB incidence and mortality rates displayed decreasing trends in men and women; except for the males from DRC that recorded an almost steady pattern in the trend of TB incidence between 1990 and 2019. TB incidence and mortality rates decreased according to the overall annual percentage changes over the adjusted age category in men and women of the four countries, and CAM registered the highest decrease. Although TB incidence and mortality rates increased with age between 1990 and 2019, the male gender was mainly associated with the upward behaviors of TB incidence rates, and the female gender association was with the upward behaviors of TB mortality rates. Males and females aged between 15–54 and 15–49 years old were evaluated as the population at high risks of TB incidence and mortality respectively in CAM, CAR, Chad, and DRC. The period and cohort relative risks (RRs) both declined in men and women of the four countries although there were some upward behaviors in their trends. Relatively to the period and cohort RRs, females and males from CAM recorded the most significant decrease compared to the rest of the countries. New public health approaches and policies towards young adults and adults, and a particular focus on elderlies’ health and life conditions should be adopted in CAM, CAR, DRC, and Chad to rapidly decrease TB incidence and mortality in both genders of the four countries.","Martial, Nodjimadji Tamlengar; Mubarik, Sumaira; Yu, Chuanhua",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404835/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95967-8,328
595023,PIN62 Recognising the broader value of vaccines in HTA: ready for prime time?,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Effective public health emergency preparedness and response systems are important in mitigating the impact of all-hazards emergencies on population health. The evidence base for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is weak, however, and previous reviews have noted a substantial proportion of anecdotal event reports. To investigate the body of research excluding the anecdotal reports and better understand primary and analytical research for PHEP, a scoping review was conducted with two objectives: first, to develop a thematic map focused on primary research; and second, to use this map to inform and guide an understanding of knowledge gaps relevant to research and practice in PHEP. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted based on established methodology. Multiple databases of indexed and grey literature were searched based on concepts of public health, emergency, emergency management/preparedness and evaluation/evidence. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied iteratively. Primary research studies that were evidence-based or evaluative in nature were included in the final group of selected studies. Thematic analysis was conducted for this group. Stakeholder consultation was undertaken for the purpose of validating themes and identifying knowledge gaps. To accomplish this, a purposive sample of researchers and practicing professionals in PHEP or closely related fields was asked to complete an online survey and participate in an in-person meeting. Final themes and knowledge gaps were synthesized after stakeholder consultation. RESULTS: Database searching yielded 3015 citations and article selection resulted in a final group of 58 articles. A list of ten themes from this group of articles was disseminated to stakeholders with the survey questions. Survey findings resulted in four cross-cutting themes and twelve stand-alone themes. Several key knowledge gaps were identified in the following themes: attitudes and beliefs; collaboration and system integration; communication; quality improvement and performance standards; and resilience. Resilience emerged as both a gap and a cross-cutting theme. Additional cross-cutting themes included equity, gender considerations, and high risk or at-risk populations. CONCLUSIONS: In this scoping review of the literature enhanced by stakeholder consultation, key themes and knowledge gaps in the PHEP evidence base were identified which can be used to inform future practice-oriented research in PHEP.

Since then, the search for new drugs that are effective against the virus has been strengthened. Featuring a relatively low cost of production under well-defined methods of cultivation, fungi have been providing a diversity of antiviral metabolites with unprecedented chemical structures. In this review, we present viral RNA infections highlighting SARS-CoV-2 morphogenesis and the infectious cycle, the targets of known antiviral drugs, and current developments in this area such as drug repurposing. We also explored the metabolic adaptability of fungi during fermentation to produce metabolites active against RNA viruses, along with their chemical structures, and mechanisms of action.

595606,Financial Insecurity During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Spillover Effects on Burnout–Disengagement Relationships and Performance of Employees Who Moonlight,2021-02-18,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated significant alterations in ambulatory heart failure (HF) care, primarily with the introduction of telemedicine. We describe our initial experience caring for patients in the COVID-19 era in the Johns Hopkins Heart Failure Bridge Clinic (JHHFBC), an ambulatory disease management and diuresis clinic aimed at preventing hospitalizations. Methods The JHHFBC sees about 2500 patients per year with 25% of those patients needing intravenous diuretics in the clinic. Starting March 16, 2020, we implemented a COVID-specific workflow incorporating telemedicine, which the clinic had previously not been utilizing. Patient visit outcomes were adjudicated, including change in diuretic dosing, intravenous diuretic administration, and need for hospitalization. Results From March 16, 2020 to April 24, 2020 we had 116 patients seen 164 times (Figure 1). The average age of patients was 61 ± 14 years, 50% female, and 70% Black. Average left ventricular ejection fraction was 25 ± 21% with 45% nonischemic cardiomyopathy, 14% ischemic cardiomyopathy, 6% amyloid, 35% had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The majority of patients were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III (109, 94%). Reasons for clinic referral included an equal frequency of post hospital discharge, worsening HF symptoms and routine follow up. Of the 96 telemedicine visits, 23% resulted in oral diuretic dose adjustment and 6 patients were referred for in-person visits. Of the 68 in-person visits, 34 (50%) resulted in intravenous diuretic administration in clinic, with 8 referrals to the emergency department or for direct admission. There were 2 referrals for cardioversion and 3 referrals to hospice by the clinic. Two of 16 clinic patients that were tested for Covid 19 were positive. Conclusion We found that HF patients could be effectively managed via telemedicine, however a subset still benefit from in-person assessment and access to ambulatory intravenous diuresis to avoid hospitalization. We hope these initial experiences will lend insights to optimization of future outpatient HF care, including the use of telemedicine, even after the current global health emergency.","Cuomo, Kimberly; Menzel, Kathryn; Hubbard, Abby; Riley, Sarah; Umapathi, Priya; Sauer, Erica; Fitts, Falisha; Gilotra, Nisha",Journal of Cardiac Failure,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071916420314135; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1071916420314135,328

The anti-parasitic effects of ursolic acid against T. gondii-infected cells and T. gondii were evaluated through different specific assays, including immunofluorescence staining and animal testing. Ursolic acid effectively inhibited the proliferation of T. gondii when compared with sulfadiazine, and consistently induced anti-T. gondii activity/effect. In particular, the formation of parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) in host cells was markedly decreased after treating ursolic acid, which was effectively suppressed. Moreover, the survival rate of T. gondii was strongly inhibited in T. gondii group treated with ursolic acid, and then 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) against T. gondii was measured as 94.62 μg/mL. The T. gondii-infected mice treated with ursolic acid indicated the same survival rates and activity as the normal group. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid causes anti-T. gondii action and effect by strongly blocking the proliferation of T. gondii through the direct and the selective T. gondii-inhibitory ability as well as increases the survival of T. gondii-infected mice. This study shows that ursolic acid has the potential to be used as a promising anti-T. gondii candidate substance for developing effective anti-parasitic drugs.","Choi, Won Hyung; Lee, In Ah",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ph11020043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29747388/,328

In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? METHOD: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation RESULTS: With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and “extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs”, all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are “incredibly vulnerable to this virus”. CONCLUSIONS: Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.","Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Quezado, Rosa Magda Martins; Mendonça, Elayne Cristina Santos; de Araújo, Tallys Iury; Luz, Dayse Christina Rodrigues Pereira; de Santana, Willma José; Sampaio, Juliana Ribeiro Francelino; Carvalho, Poliana Moreira de Medeiros; Arrais, Tereza Maria Siqueira Nascimento; Landim, José Marcondes Macedo; da Silva, Claúdio Gleideston Lima",Psychiatry Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165178120306119; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112939; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178120306119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32304928/,328

We thus hypothesized that IFN-γ may play a major role in the pathology by triggering immune-mediated alveolar damage. As we assessed or re-assessed some effects of IFN-γ on a number of human lung epithelial and fibroblast cell lines, chosen for their wide use in the literature, we found that alveolar epithelial cells were more sensitive to IFN-γ, in terms of proliferation inhibition and enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis. While similar effects were obtained on fibroblasts, concentrations of IFN-γ 4–8-fold greater were required. In addition, both epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines were able to secrete large quantities of T cell-targeting chemokines, similar to the ones detected in SARS patients. Based on the clinical data collected previously, the available literature and our in vitro experimentation, we propose that IFN-γ may be responsible for acute lung injury in the late phase of the SARS pathology.","Theron, Michel; Huang, Kao-Jean; Chen, Yu-Wen; Liu, Ching-Chuan; Lei, Huan-Yao",Cytokine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466605002437; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466605002437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16129616/,328

Data are scarce about the gastroenterologists and IBD patient’s acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The aim of the study was to evaluate the intention to get vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among IBD patients from gastroenterologists and patient’s perspective. Methods: An online anonymous survey was sent to 8000 patients from ACCU-Spain and 1000 members of the GETECCU. Three invitations were sent between October-December 2020. Descriptive analyses were performed, comparing physicians and patients responses by standard statistical analyses. Results: 144 gastroenterologists [63% female, mean age 43 years (SD 9.5)], and 1302 patients [72% female, mean age 43 years (SD 12)] responded to the survey. 95% of the physicians recommended SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for IBD patients and 87% consider that their vaccination strategies has not changed after the pandemic compared to 12% who considered that they currently refer more patients to vaccination. Regarding to IBD patients, only 43% of patients were willing to receive the vaccine and 43% were not sure. Male sex (p<0.001) and mesalazine treatment (p=0.021) were positively associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine acceptance. After multivariate analysis, only male sex was significantly associated with vaccination intent (OR=1.6; 95% confidence interval=1.2-2.0; p=0.001). Conclusions: Gastroenterologists and patient’s perspective about SARS-CoV-2 are different.

597087,Pharmacy practice in emergency response during the COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons from Australia,2021-08-30,"Attractive political candidates receive more votes on Election Day compared to their less attractive competitors. One well-cited theoretical account for this attractiveness effect (White et al., 2013) holds that it reflects an adaptive psychological response to disease threats. Voters are predicted to upregulate preferences for attractiveness because it constitutes a cue to health. The global COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an ecologically relevant and realistic setting for further testing this prediction. Here, we report the results from six tests of the prediction based on two large and nationally representative surveys conducted in Denmark (n=3,297) at the outbreak of the pandemic and one year later. Utilizing experimental techniques, validated individual difference measures of perceived disease threat and geographic data on COVID-19 severity, we do not find that disease threats like the COVID-19 pandemic upregulate preferences for attractive and healthy political or non-political leaders. Instead, respondents display heightened preferences for health in socially proximate relations (i.e. colleagues). Moreover, individuals who react aversively to situations involving risks of pathogen transmission (scoring high in Germ Aversion) report higher importance of a wide range of leadership traits, rather than for health and attractiveness in particular.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to report the outcomes of screening and recruitment of fecal donors for FMT. METHODS Potential donors were recruited via advertisement through internal mass emails at a university. They were required to undergo a pre-screening telephone interview, a detailed questionnaire, followed by blood and stool investigations. RESULTS From January 2017 to December 2020, 119 potential donors were assessed with 75 failed pre-screening. Reasons for failure included: inability to come back for regular and long-term donation (n = 19), high body mass index (n = 17), underlying chronic illness or on long-term medications (n = 11), being healthcare professionals (n = 10), use of antibiotics within 3 months (n = 5) and others (n = 13). Forty-four donors completed questionnaires and 11 did not fulfill the clinical criteria. Of the remaining 33 potential donors who had stool and blood tests, 21 failed stool investigations (19 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] organisms, one Clostridioides difficile, one C. difficile plus Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus), one failed blood tests (high serum alkaline phosphatase level), one required long-term medication and nine withdrew consent and/or lost to follow-up. In total, only one out of 119 (0.8%) potential donors was successfully recruited as a regular donor. CONCLUSION There was a high failure rate in donor screening for FMT.

In this article, we therefore: i) evaluate methodological imputation alternatives that address the problem of having either zero values or missing values, or both simultaneously; and ii) propose the need to complement the point-to-point identification of the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) with other robust alternatives, to deal with outliers depending on the number of data points. These suggestions have been considered here using statistics for CoDa with isometric log-ratio (ilr) transformation. A selection of illustrative cases is presented to compare performance of different alternatives.","Quispe-Coica, Alejandro; Pérez-Foguet, Agustí",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720340419?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32663686/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720340419; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140519,328
597572,Estimating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnosis and survival of five cancers in Chile from 2020 to 2030: a simulation-based analysis,2021-09-03,"It is widely accepted that the highly volatile capesize market has many peculiarities. Its importance has been recently highlighted by an increase in contribution of the Baltic Capesize Index (BCI) to the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), affecting the progress of the BDI more than any other dry bulk index. This paper investigates the behavior of the capesize market focusing on expectations and time lags. Expectations play a critical role in the freight market both for the short-term and the long-term decision making. In particular, we investigate the relation between time lags and time-charter, trip and spot market rates as well as the average earnings of the capesize vessels of various ages. Time series analysis is used to reach our conclusions. The Hannan – Quinn criterion has been selected to identify the important lags of the capesize freight market for the period 1977–2018 and an Autoregressive (AR) model has been constructed to perform the statistical analysis. The findings indicate that there is a strong correlation between time lags and capesize freight market, forecasting indeed the behavior of the market. At a practical level, better understanding of the behavior of the capesize market can improve the planning decision of ship-owners and charterers alike.","Pelagidis, Theodore; Karaoulanis, Ioannis",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2092521220300559; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2092521220300559,328
597725,Flashing red lights: the global implications of COVID-19 vaccination passports,2021-05-20,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: This review is intended to provide an overview on the history and recent advances of T cell and natural killer (NK) cell-based immunotherapy. While the thymus was discovered as the origin of T cells in the 1960s, and NK cells were first described in 1975, the clinical application of adoptive cell therapies (ACT) only began in the early 1980s with the first lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cell product for the treatment of cancer patients. Over the past decades, further immunotherapies have been developed, including ACT using cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, products based on the NK cell line NK-92 as well as specific T and NK cell preparations. Recent advances have successfully improved the effectiveness of T, NK, CIK or NK-92 cells towards tumor-targeting antigens generated by genetic engineering of the immune cells. Herein, we summarize the promising development of ACT over the past decades in the fight against cancer. ABSTRACT: The promising development of adoptive immunotherapy over the last four decades has revealed numerous therapeutic approaches in which dedicated immune cells are modified and administered to eliminate malignant cells. Starting in the early 1980s, lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells were the first ex vivo generated NK cell-enriched products utilized for adoptive immunotherapy. Over the past decades, various immunotherapies have been developed, including cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, as a peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)-based therapeutic product, the adoptive transfer of specific T and NK cell products, and the NK cell line NK-92. In addition to allogeneic NK cells, NK-92 cell products represent a possible “off-the-shelf” therapeutic concept. Recent approaches have successfully enhanced the specificity and cytotoxicity of T, NK, CIK or NK-92 cells towards tumor-specific or associated target antigens generated by genetic engineering of the immune cells, e.g., to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Here, we will look into the history and recent developments of T and NK cell-based immunotherapy.","Wendel, Philipp; Reindl, Lisa Marie; Bexte, Tobias; Künnemeyer, Leander; Särchen, Vinzenz; Albinger, Nawid; Mackensen, Andreas; Rettinger, Eva; Bopp, Tobias; Ullrich, Evelyn",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807011/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13061481,328

This study applied the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model using its core constructs to predict consumers’ purchase intentions of well-being food, namely Yak-sun. Questionnaires were gathered using a convenient sampling method for those who have experienced Yak-sun food in September of 2014. A total of 269 responses were used for data analysis. The results of the study aligned with past studies that supported the applicability of the TPB model. All constructs including attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were found to have made a significant contribution to the prediction of intention to purchase Yak-sun food among Korean consumers. Perceived behavioral control showed the strongest influence on the behavioral intention of purchasing Yak-sun food.

Although different antivirals are given for the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection, their efficacy is still under evaluation. Here, we have screened existing drugs approved for human use in a variety of diseases, to compare how they counteract SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect and viral replication in vitro. Among the potential 72 antivirals tested herein that were previously proposed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, only 18 % had an IC(50) below 25 µM or 10(2) IU/ml. These included plitidepsin, novel cathepsin inhibitors, nelfinavir mesylate hydrate, interferon 2-alpha, interferon-gamma, fenofibrate, camostat along the well-known remdesivir and chloroquine derivatives. Plitidepsin was the only clinically approved drug displaying nanomolar efficacy. Four of these families, including novel cathepsin inhibitors, blocked viral entry in a cell—type specific manner. Since the most effective antivirals usually combine therapies that tackle the virus at different steps of infection, we also assessed several drug combinations. Although no particular synergy was found, inhibitory combinations did not reduce their antiviral activity. Thus, these combinations could decrease the potential emergence of resistant viruses. Antivirals prioritized herein identify novel compounds and their mode of action, while independently replicating the activity of a reduced proportion of drugs which are mostly approved for clinical use. Combinations of these drugs should be tested in animal models to inform the design of fast track clinical trials.","Rodon, Jordi; Muñoz-Basagoiti, Jordana; Perez-Zsolt, Daniel; Noguera-Julian, Marc; Paredes, Roger; Mateu, Lourdes; Quiñones, Carles; Perez, Carles; Erkizia, Itziar; Blanco, Ignacio; Valencia, Alfonso; Guallar, Víctor; Carrillo, Jorge; Blanco, Julià; Segalés, Joaquim; Clotet, Bonaventura; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.646676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841165/,328

Baikal Skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi) is a perennial herb in the Lamiaceae family and its dried root is used as a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the active ingredients of S. baicalensis have important pharmacological effects including anti-oxidation, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammation. Specifically, it is recently found that S. baicalensis has significant curative effects on the treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In recent years, the market demand for the medicinal products of S. baicalensis is increasing because of its great medicinal values. However, the annual yield of active ingredients originated from the root of S. baicalensis is limited due to that little progress has been made on the traditional processing technology used in the extraction process. A pressing issue faced by both herbalists and scientists is how to improve the processing efficiency, thereby obtaining the maximum yield of products for S. baicalensis. In this study, a systematic analysis on the effects of growth years and post-harvest processing on the contents of medicinal active ingredients of S. baicalensis was conducted. The contents of eight active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, scutellarin, scutellarein, apigenin, and chrysin) in roots of S. baicalensis of different growth years (ranging from 1 year to 15 years) were estimated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and further analyzed to determine the optimal harvest period. In particular, the contents of six active ingredients in different parts (cortex and stele) of the root of S. baicalensis were estimated and compared. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of the contents of active ingredients in fresh-crush and fresh-cut roots of S. baicalensis at room temperature were compared and analyzed to reveal the influence of post-harvest treatment on the contents of active ingredients. In addition, the effects of six different post-harvest treatments on the contents of active ingredients were systematically designed and compared to determine the best primary processing technology. The results showed that the best harvesting period for S. baicalensis should be determined as 2–3 years based on comprehensive evaluation of active ingredient content, annual yield increment, and land use efficiency. The contents of active ingredients including baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin in cortex were significantly higher than those in stele (P ≤ 0.05). The contents of baicalin, wogonoside, and scutellarin in fresh roots of S. baicalensis significantly reduced as the storage time increased, but the reduction of fresh-cutting was significantly lower than that of fresh-crushing. For the effects of different processing treatments, the contents of four main active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin) under drying (D) and cutting-drying (C–D) treatments were significantly higher than those of the other four treatments (P ≤ 0.05). Collectively, the above results will not only provide novel processing methods that will improve the yield of active ingredients for S. baicalensis, but also shed light on the optimization of processing technology for the industrial production of medicinal crops.","Bai, Chengke; Yang, Jingjing; Cao, Bo; Xue, Ying; Gao, Pufan; Liang, Hui; Li, Guishuang",Ind Crops Prod,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112985; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092666902030902X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162677/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092666902030902X,328

These can contaminate the surrounding environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after cleaning operations. METHODS: To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used. RESULTS: On the whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread.","Verani, Marco; Bigazzi, Roberto; Carducci, Annalaura",Am J Infect Control,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2014.03.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655314002491; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655314002491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24818773/,328

601203,The impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on physical domestic violence: Evidence from a list randomization experiment,2021-04-17,"The World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic, with the situation ultimately requiring unprecedented measures to mitigate the effects on public health and the global economy. Although SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is primarily respiratory in nature, multiple studies confirmed its genetic material could be detected in the feces of infected individuals, thereby highlighting sewage as a potential indicator of community incidence or prevalence. Numerous wastewater surveillance studies subsequently confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and wastewater-associated solids/sludge. However, the methods employed in early studies vary widely so it is unclear whether differences in reported concentrations reflect true differences in epidemiological conditions, or are instead driven by methodological artifacts. The current study aimed to compare the performance of virus recovery and detection methods, detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in two Southern Nevada sewersheds from March–May 2020, and better understand the potential link between COVID-19 incidence/prevalence and wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 surrogate recovery (0.34%–55%) and equivalent sample volume (0.1 mL–1 L) differed between methods and target water matrices, ultimately impacting method sensitivity and reported concentrations. Composite sampling of influent and primary effluent resulted in a ∼10-fold increase in concentration relative to corresponding grab primary effluent samples, presumably highlighting diurnal variability in SARS-CoV-2 signal. Detection and quantification of four SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers (up to ∼10(6) gene copies per liter), along with ratios of SARS-CoV-2 to pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), exhibited comparability with public health data for two sewersheds in an early phase of the pandemic. Finally, a wastewater model informed by fecal shedding rates highlighted the potential significance of new cases (i.e., incidence rather than prevalence) when interpreting wastewater surveillance data.","Gerrity, Daniel; Papp, Katerina; Stoker, Mitchell; Sims, Alan; Frehner, Wilbur",Water Res X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398255/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wroa.2020.100086; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589914720300463; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589914720300463,328

In this study, four full-length bat AAV capsid genes were isolated in China, with their amino acid sequences sharing 61% identity with those of AAV2 on average. These capsid genes could package AAV particles in combination with AAV2 rep and ITRs, albeit at a lower efficiency. Bat AAVs could only slightly infect mouse liver but could transduce mouse muscle to some extent after systemic administration with a higher muscle/liver ratio than that of primate AAVs. Bat AAV 10HB showed moderate muscle transduction, similar to that of AAV2, during direct intramuscular injection and, compared with other AAV serotypes, was also relatively efficient in resisting human antibody neutralization after intramuscular injection. Evolutionary analysis revealed a number of codons in bat AAV capsid genes subject to positive selection, with sites corresponding to V259 and N691 in 10HB capsids being localized on the surface of the AAV2 capsid. Mutagenesis studies indicated that the positive selection in bat AAV capsids is driven by their tropism evolution in host species. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that bat AAV 10HB vector has the possible applications for muscular gene therapy, especially in the presence of human AAV neutralizing antibodies.","Li, Ya; Li, Jialu; Liu, Yunbo; Shi, Zhengli; Liu, Haizhou; Wei, Yuquan; Yang, Lin",Gene Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41434-019-0081-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31110296/,328

However, controversial issues such as the timing and pathways of viral emergence, the effectiveness of social distancing and lockdown strategies, and the use of antimalarial drugs as therapy have still not been fully resolved. This serves as a fertile breeding ground for agnotological strategies, whereby scientific studies are deliberately or unintentionally designed to create distractions or draw conclusions that are not supported by research findings.

Therefore, applying effective screening strategies and infection control measures is essential to control the spread of the epidemic within hemodialysis centers. OBJECTIVE: Description and evaluation of the efficacy of systematic screening by rt-PCR and viral cultures, in addition to triage to limit the spread of the epidemic. Evaluation of the performance of these tests using “post-hoc” SARS-CoV-2 serology as a surrogate marker of infection. METHODS: One hundred and forty-four patients undergoing hemodialysis in the Nephrology-Hemodialysis center of CHU Brugmann, Brussels, benefited from systematic virological screening using viral cultures in asymptomatic patients, or molecular tests (rt-PCR) for symptomatic ones, in addition to general prevention measures. Post-hoc serology was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (26.3%) individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen infected patients (44.7%) were asymptomatic and thus detected by viral culture. Our strategy allowed us to detect and isolate 97.4% of the infected patients, as proven by post-hoc serology. Only one patient, missed by clinical screening and sequential viral cultures, had a positive serology. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a control and prevention strategy based on a systematic clinical and virological screening showed its effectiveness in limiting (and shortening) the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic within our hemodialysis unit.

The epidemic spread very fast despite an early and extreme lockdown and infected over 600,000 people, by far the highest number of infections in an African country. To rapidly understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in South Africa, we formed the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA). Here, we analyze 1,365 high quality whole genomes and identify 16 new lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Most of these unique lineages have mutations that are found hardly anywhere else in the world. We also show that three lineages spread widely in South Africa and contributed to ~42% of all of the infections in the country. This included the first identified C lineage of SARS-CoV-2, C.1, which has 16 mutations as compared with the original Wuhan sequence. C.1 was the most geographically widespread lineage in South Africa, causing infections in multiple provinces and in all of the eleven districts in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), the most sampled province. Interestingly, the first South-African specific lineage, B.1.106, which was identified in April 2020, became extinct after nosocomial outbreaks were controlled.

604244,"Purpose in Life, Loneliness, and Protective Health Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic",2021-06-14,"CONTEXT: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has profoundly impacted the provision of pediatric palliative care (PPC) interventions including goals of care discussions, symptom management, and end-of-life care. OBJECTIVE: Gaining understanding of the professional and personal experiences of PPC providers on a global scale during COVID-19 is essential to improve clinical practices in an ongoing pandemic. METHODS: The Palliative Assessment of Needed DEvelopments & Modifications In the Era of Coronavirus Survey-Global survey was designed and distributed to assess changes in PPC practices resulting from COVID-19. Quantitative and qualitative data were captured through the survey. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six providers were included in the final analysis with 59 countries and 6 continents represented (31% from lower- or lower middle-income countries). Nearly half of PPC providers (40%) reported programmatic economic insecurity or employment loss. Use of technology influenced communication processes for nearly all participants (91%), yet most PPC providers (72%) reported receiving no formal training in use of technological interfaces. Respondents described distress around challenges in provision of comfort at the end of life and witnessing patients’ pain, fear, and isolation. CONCLUSIONS: PPC clinicians from around the world experienced challenges related to COVID-19. Technology was perceived as both helpful and a hinderance to high quality communication.

No approved prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are currently available. In this study, we have developed egg yolk antibodies (immunoglobulin Y (IgY)) specific for MERS-CoV spike protein (S1) in order to evaluate their neutralizing efficiency against MERS-CoV infection. S1-specific immunoglobulins were produced by injecting chickens with purified recombinant S1 protein of MERS-CoV at a high titer (5.7 mg/mL egg yolk) at week 7 post immunization. Western blotting and immune-dot blot assays demonstrated that the IgY antibody specifically bound to the MERS-CoV S1 protein. Anti-S1 antibodies were also able to recognize MERS-COV inside cells, as demonstrated by an immunofluorescence assay. Plaque reduction and microneutralization assays showed the neutralization of MERS-COV in Vero cells by anti-S1 IgY antibodies and non-significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected mice during early infection, with a nonsignificant decrease in weight loss. However, a statistically significant (p = 0.0196) quantitative reduction in viral antigen expression and marked reduction in inflammation were observed in lung tissue. Collectively, our data suggest that the anti-MERS-CoV S1 IgY could serve as a potential candidate for the passive treatment of MERS-CoV infection.","Abbas, Aymn T.; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A.; Sohrab, Sayed Sartaj; Tabll, Ashraf A.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Nagata, Noriyo; Azhar, Esam I.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139631/,328

Interview data from 15 BSAGM were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis and identity process theory. The analysis yielded the following three themes: (1) Fear of involuntary disclosure of gay identity; (2) Anxiety about relationships; and (3) Coping and casual sexual encounters. BSAGM who returned to the family home during the lockdown reported fear of involuntary disclosure of their sexual identity, exposure to stigma in relation to their sexuality, and anxiety about their relationships with significant others. In order to cope with the resultant threats to identity, some individuals concealed their sexual identity, which could undermine their sense of identity authenticity, and some reported engaging in casual sexual encounters as a means of coping with identity threat. BSAGM may be at high risk of identity threat during the COVID-19 outbreak with limited access to social and psychological support in relation to their sexuality. This in turn may lead to a reliance on ineffective coping strategies, such as sexual risk-taking.","Jaspal, Rusi",Sex Cult,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-021-09817-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584091/,328

The main objective of this research is to study the psychological impact of the lockdown due to the social emergency situation (COVID-19) in children/adolescents and adults diagnosed with ASD. Participants were 37 caregivers of children/adolescents with ASD, also 35 ASD adults and 32 informants. Evaluation was conducted through a web survey system and included standardized clinical questionnaires (CBCL and SCL-90-R), which were compared with results before lockdown start, and a brief self-reported survey addressing the subjective perception of changes in daily functioning areas. The results revealed a reduction of psychopathological symptoms in both age groups, but only reaching statistical significance in the adult group, except for Somatization, Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive domains. ASD severity Level 2 showed greater improvement after lockdown onset in the children/adolescent group when compared to ASD Level 1 participants. Younger adults (18-25 yoa) reported greater improvement than older adults (=>25 yoa). Survey results indicate an improvement of feeding quality and a reduction in the number of social initiations during the lockdown. Adult ASD participants perceived a decrease in stress levels after the lockdown onset, whereas caregivers reported higher stress levels at the same point in both age groups. Limitations included the small number of participants and a heterogeneous evaluation window between measures. Pyschopathological status after two months of social distancing and lockdown seems to improve in ASD young adult population.","Lugo Marín, Jorge; Gisbert Gustemps, Laura; Setien Ramos, Imanol; Español Martín, Gemma; Ibañez Jimenez, Pol; Forner Puntonet, Mireia; Arteaga-Henríquez, Gara; Soriano Día, Albert; Duque Yemail, Juan David; Ramos Quiroga, Josep Antoni",Res Autism Spectr Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33649707/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2021.101757; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1750946721000325?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1750946721000325,328

Shortages of vaccine supplies and practical deployment rates on the field necessitate prioritization. The global strategy has been to prioritize those with a high personal risk due to their age or comorbidities and those who constitute the essential workforce of the society. Rather than a systematic age-based roll-down, assigning the next priority requires a local strategy based on the vaccine availability, the effectiveness of this specific vaccine, the population size as well as its age-demographics, the scenario of how the pandemic is likely to develop. The Adult (ages 20-60) - Senior (ages over 60) duo from a multigenerational home presents a high-risk demographic, with an estimated 'effective age' of an adult to be 40 years more if they live with an unvaccinated grandparent. Our model suggests that strategically vaccinating the Adults from multigenerational homes in India may be effective in saving the lives of around 70,000 to 200,000 of Seniors, under the different epidemiological scenarios possible with or without strict lockdowns.","Saraswat, B.; Ansumali, S.; Prakash, M.

607495,Improving influenza vaccination rates during COVID-19 pandemic – the need of the hour,2021-04-17,"OBJECTIVES: Asymptomatic patients, together with those with mild symptoms of COVID-19, may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the dynamics of viral shedding during the various phases of the clinical course of COVID-19 remains unclear at this stage. METHODS: A total of 18 patients found positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay, and admitted to Chongqing University Central Hospital between Jan 29 and Feb 5 were enrolled in this study. Medical data, pulmonary CT scan images, and RT-PCR results were periodically collected during the patients’ hospital stay. All participants were actively followed-up for 2 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: A total of nine (50%) asymptomatic patients and nine 9 (50%) mildly mild symptom COVID-19 patients were identified on admission. Six (66.7%) asymptomatic patients on admission developed subjective symptoms during hospitalization were recategorized as ‘pre-symptomatic’. The median duration of viral shedding was 11.5, 28 and 31 days for pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients, separately. Seven (38.9%) patients continued to shed virus after hospital discharge. During the convalescent phase, detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and RNA were simultaneously observed in five (27.8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term viral shedding was presented in patients with mild symptoms and asymptomatic cases, and specific antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 may not guarantee viral clearance after discharge. These observations should be considered when making decisions regarding clinical and public health and strategies for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, Wei; Su, Ying-Ying; Zhi, Shen-Shen; Huang, Jian; Zhuang, Chun-Lan; Bai, Wei-Zhi; Wan, Yan; Meng, Xiao-Rong; Zhang, Lu; Zhou, Ying-Bing; Luo, Yu-Yao; Ge, Sheng-Xiang; Chen, Yao-Kai; Ma, Yu",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32653662/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20304109; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20304109?v=s5,328

However, apart from some changes in protein coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the hosts and viruss perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and viruss internal ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into the differences observed different parts of the world.","Islam, Abul B.M.M.K.; Khan, Md.

610634,Early predictors of mortality for moderate to severely ill patients with Covid-19,2020-08-28,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed risks to public mental health worldwide. University students, who are already recognised as a vulnerable population, are at elevated risk of mental health issues given COVID-19-related disruptions to higher education. To assist universities in effectively allocating resources to the launch of targeted, population-level interventions, the current study aimed to uncover predictors of university students’ psychological wellbeing during the pandemic via a data-driven approach. Methods: Data were collected from 3973 Australian university students ((median age = 22, aged from 18 to 79); 70.6% female)) at five time points during 2020. Feature selection was conducted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to identify predictors from a comprehensive set of variables. Selected variables were then entered into an ordinary least squares (OLS) model to compare coefficients and assess statistical significance. Results: Six negative predictors of university students’ psychological wellbeing emerged: White/European ethnicity, restriction stress, perceived worry on mental health, dietary changes, perceived sufficiency of distancing communication, and social isolation. Physical health status, emotional support, and resilience were positively associated with students’ psychological wellbeing. Social isolation has the largest effect on students’ psychological wellbeing. Notably, age, gender, international status, and educational level did not emerge as predictors of wellbeing. Conclusion: To cost-effectively support student wellbeing through 2021 and beyond, universities should consider investing in internet- and tele- based interventions explicitly targeting perceived social isolation among students. Course-based online forums as well as internet- and tele-based logotherapy may be promising candidates for improving students’ psychological wellbeing.","Liu, Chang; McCabe, Melinda; Dawson, Andrew; Cyrzon, Chad; Shankar, Shruthi; Gerges, Nardin; Kellett-Renzella, Sebastian; Chye, Yann; Cornish, Kim",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206579/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136730,328

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of various treatment modalities in nCOV-2019 patients. Methods: An extensive literature search was conducted before 22 May 2020 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane library databases. Quality assessment was performed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale. A fixed-effect model was applied if I2 <50%, else the results were combined using random-effect model. Risk Ratio (RR) or Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) along-with 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) were used to pool the results. Between study heterogeneity was explored using influence and sensitivity analyses & publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. Results: Eighty-one studies involving 44 in vitro and 37 clinical studies including 8662 nCOV-2019 patients were included in the review. Lopinavir-Ritonavir compared to controls was significantly associated with shorter mean time to clinical improvement (SMD -0.32; 95%CI -0.57 to -0.06) and Remdesivir compared to placebo was significantly associated with better overall clinical improvement (RR 1.17; 95%CI 1.07 to 1.29). Hydroxychloroquine was associated with less overall clinical improvement (RR 0.88; 95%CI 0.79 to 0.98) and longer time to clinical improvement (SMD 0.64; 95%CI 0.33 to 0.94).

In addition, it prevents the spread of this pandemic virus. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be used to distinguish between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 from the computed tomography (CT) imaging. Furthermore, the CAD systems are capable of delivering an accurate faster COVID-19 diagnosis, which consequently saves time for the disease control and provides an efficient diagnosis compared to laboratory tests. In this study, a novel CAD system called FUSI-CAD based on AI techniques is proposed. Almost all the methods in the literature are based on individual convolutional neural networks (CNN). Consequently, the FUSI-CAD system is based on the fusion of multiple different CNN architectures with three handcrafted features including statistical features and textural analysis features such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) which were not previously utilized in coronavirus diagnosis. The SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset is used to test the performance of the proposed FUSI-CAD. The results show that the proposed system could accurately differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images, as the accuracy achieved is 99%. Additionally, the system proved to be reliable as well. This is because the sensitivity, specificity, and precision attained to 99%. In addition, the diagnostics odds ratio (DOR) is ≥ 100. Furthermore, the results are compared with recent related studies based on the same dataset. The comparison verifies the competence of the proposed FUSI-CAD over the other related CAD systems. Thus, the novel FUSI-CAD system can be employed in real diagnostic scenarios for achieving accurate testing for COVID-19 and avoiding human misdiagnosis that might exist due to human fatigue. It can also reduce the time and exertion made by the radiologists during the examination process.","Ragab, Dina A.; Attallah, Omneya",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816957/,328

The specific SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is highly expressed in male gonads. Thus, male reproductive tissues could be a potential target for virus colonization. We performed a comprehensive search in PubMed and Google Scholar to retrieve relevant articles published till 15 April 2021. The keywords used were: male fertility, male reproductive health, semen parameters, sex hormones, SARS-CoV-2, and COVID-19. Validated evidence about the adverse effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on the male reproductive system is limited and few studies have reported semen analysis results or presence of viral RNA in semen samples of infected men. Nevertheless, alterations in reproductive hormones such as decreased level of testosterone (T) with raised luteinizing hormone (LH) have been reported in some patients. Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the male reproduction health remains unclear, evidence suggests that male gonads may be potentially vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

612928,Recommendations to the government following the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-29,"With the ongoing popularization of online services, the digital document images have been used in various applications. Meanwhile, there have emerged some deep learning-based text editing algorithms which alter the textual information of an image . In this work, we present a document forgery algorithm to edit practical document images. To achieve this goal, the limitations of existing text editing algorithms towards complicated characters and complex background are addressed by a set of network design strategies. First, the unnecessary confusion in the supervision data is avoided by disentangling the textual and background information in the source images. Second, to capture the structure of some complicated components, the text skeleton is provided as auxiliary information and the continuity in texture is considered explicitly in the loss function. Third, the forgery traces induced by the text editing operation are mitigated by some post-processing operations which consider the distortions from the print-and-scan channel. Quantitative comparisons of the proposed method and the exiting approach have shown the advantages of our design by reducing the about 2/3 reconstruction error measured in MSE, improving reconstruction quality measured in PSNR and in SSIM by 4 dB and 0.21, respectively. Qualitative experiments have confirmed that the reconstruction results of the proposed method are visually better than the existing approach. More importantly, we have demonstrated the performance of the proposed document forgery algorithm under a practical scenario where an attacker is able to alter the textual information in an identity document using only one sample in the target domain. The forged-and-recaptured samples created by the proposed text editing attack and recapturing operation have successfully fooled some existing document authentication systems.","Zhao, Lin; Chen, Changsheng; Huang, Jiwu",IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00653v1.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1109/tip.2021.3112048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34534085/,328

614240,A Biomedical Knowledge Graph System to Propose Mechanistic Hypotheses for Real-World Environmental Health Observations: Cohort Study and Informatics Application,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Often the first opportunity for clinicians to assess risk of preterm birth is when women present with threatened preterm labour symptoms (such as period-like pain, tightening’s or back ache). However, threatened preterm labour symptoms are not a strong predictor of imminent birth. Clinicians are then faced with a complex clinical dilemma, the need to ameliorate the consequences of preterm birth requires consideration with the side-effects and costs. The QUiPP app is a validated app which can aid clinicians when they triage a women who is in threatened preterm labour. AIM: Our aim was to produce a toolkit to promote a best practice pathway for women who arrive in threatened preterm labour. METHODS: We worked with two hospitals in South London. This included the aid of a toolkit midwife at each hospital. We also undertook stakeholder focus groups and worked with two Maternity Voice Partnership groups to ensure a diverse range of voices was heard in the toolkit development. While we aimed to produce the toolkit in September 2020, we rapidly rolled out and produced the first version of the toolkit in April 2020 due to COVID-19. As the QUiPP app can reduce admissions and hospital transfers, there was a need to enable all hospitals in England to have access to the toolkit as soon as possible. RESULTS: While the rapid rollout of The QUiPP App Toolkit due to COVID-19 was not planned, it has demonstrated that toolkits to improve clinical practice can be produced promptly. Through actively welcoming continued feedback meant the initial version of the toolkit could be continually and iteratively refined. The toolkit has been recommended nationally, with National Health Service England recommending the app and toolkit in their COVID-19 update to the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle and in the British Association of Perinatal Medicine Antenatal Optimisation Toolkit.","Carlisle, Naomi; Watson, Helena A; Shennan, Andrew H",BMJ Open Qual,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958354/,328

The global spread of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has dramatically increased the number of suspected cases with an expanding geographical area. The rapid identification of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic contacts is the priority for clinical management and outbreak control. Suspected cases should be screened for the virus with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) such as real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) under the guidance of laboratory experts. Materials and methods This manuscript details the process of the establishment of a COVID-19 lab, which is a medical college virology lab (Viral Research Diagnostic Lab), in less than a months' time. Detailed data of the tests were studied over the initial one month and reported. Results Within one and a half months of the start of the lab, 3196 tests were conducted, which caters to five adjoining districts in Western Odisha. These included both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (contacts with a travel history from affected areas), and six COVID-19 positive cases were detected. Conclusion Though the establishment of a COVID-19 lab in a short time is a challenge, it can be achieved through determination, teamwork, and support from the authorities.","Behera, Sulin K; Mohapatra, Soumyashree; Pattnaik, Dipankar; Jena, Swetalina; Thakur, Satyabrata; Sahu, Sumanta",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10162; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33014657/,328

This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the confidence and its association with knowledge, attitude and exposure on providing palliative care among medical undergraduates with a self-administered questionnaire to improve the international phenomenon. Full-time local medical undergraduates were recruited to obtain information regarding the demographics, confidence, knowledge, attitude and exposure on palliative care; the information was collected from July 2020 to October 2020. Questions on confidence (10-items), knowledge (20-items), attitude (10-items) and exposure were referenced from validated indexes and designed from literature review. Confidence level was categorized into “Confident” and “Non-confident” as suggested by studies to facilitate data analysis and comparison. Of the 303 participants, 59.4% were “Non-confident” (95% C.I.: 53.8% to 65.0%) in providing palliative care on average. Among medical students, knowledge (p = 0.010) and attitude (p = 0.003) are significantly positively associated with the confidence to provide palliative care, while exposure to death of family/friends (p = 0.024) is negatively associated. This study begins an investigation on the research area in Hong Kong primarily. The confidence of local medical students should be enhanced to provide palliative care in their future. It thus highlights the importance of the medical curriculum and provides insights to remove barriers responsively to improve the overall confidence and the quality of palliative care.","Leung, Shih-Ya; Wong, Eliza Lai-Yi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360364/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158071,328

In this study, we used cloning and bioinformatics to analyze the sequence of RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-β in the immortalized cell lines from Rhinolophus affinis and Rhinolophus sinicus. Then, we treated different bat cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and splenocytes with polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to assess and compare antiviral immune responses between bats and mice. Our results demonstrated that bat RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-β showed close homology with human, mouse, pig and rhesus monkey. RIG-I and STAT-1 were both highly expressed in bat spleen. Furthermore, IFN-β was induced by polyI:C and VSV in both bat and mouse cells.

617653,"A systemic approach to resilience and ecological sustainability during the COVID-19 pandemic: Human, societal, and ecological health as a system-wide emergent property in the Anthropocene",2020-07-18,"Basigin, or CD147, has been reported as a co-receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to invade host cells. Basigin also has a well-established role in Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection of human erythrocytes where it is bound by one of the parasite’s invasion ligands, reticulocyte binding protein homolog 5 (RH5). Here, we sought to validate the claim that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein can form a complex with basigin, using RH5-basigin as a positive control. Using recombinantly expressed proteins, size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance, we show that neither RBD nor full-length spike glycoprotein bind to recombinant human basigin (either expressed in E. coli or mammalian cells). Given the immense interest in SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic targets, we would caution the inclusion of basigin in this list on the basis of its reported direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Importance Reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 remains a global health priority. Critical to these efforts is the identification of host factors that are essential to viral entry and replication. Basigin, or CD147, was previously identified as a possible therapeutic target based on the observation that it may act as a co-receptor for SARS-COV-2, binding to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Here, we show that there is no direct interaction between the RBD and basigin, casting doubt on its role as a co-receptor and plausibility as a therapeutic target.","Ragotte, Robert J.; Pulido, David; Donnellan, Francesca R.; Gorini, Giacomo; Davies, Hannah; Brun, Juliane; King, Lloyd D.

618146,How health capabilities and government restrictions affect the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-country differences in Europe,2021-08-24,"Physicians and scientists around the world are aggressively attempting to develop effective treatment strategies. The treatment goal is to reduce the fatality rate in 15% to 20% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 who develop severe inflammatory conditions that can lead to pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. These conditions are major causes of death in these patients. Convalescent plasma (CP) collected from patients recovered from the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) has been considered as an effective treatment method for COVID-19. Moreover, low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia was historically used to treat pneumonia during the first half of the 20th century. The concept of LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia was first introduced in March 2020. Later scientists from Canada, Spain, United States, Germany and France also confirmed the potential efficacy of LDRT for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. The rationale behind introducing LDRT as an effective treatment method for pneumonia in COVID-19 patients is not only due to its anti-inflammatory effect, but also in optimization of the activity of the immune system. Moreover, LDRT, unlike other treatment methods such as antiviral drugs, does not have the key disadvantage of exerting a significant selective pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hence does not lead to evolution of the virus through mutations. Given these considerations, we believe that a hybrid treatment including both CP and LDRT can trigger synergistic responses that will help healthcare providers in mitigating today's COVID-19 pandemic.","H, Abdollahi; I, Shiri; J J, Bevelacqua; A, Jafarzadeh; A, Rahmim; H, Zaidi; S A R, Mortazavi; S M J, Mortazavi",Journal of biomedical physics & engineering,https://doi.org/10.31661/jbpe.v0i0.2006-1125; https://jbpe.sums.ac.ir/article_46633_8cc1342d5ab6ca9c7fcdb0457485a667.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32802787/,328

Socioeconomic Differences in Marital Stress and Satisfaction During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021-03-31,"OBJECTIVES Lung ultrasound (LUS) might be comparable to chest computed tomography (CT) in detecting parenchymal and pleural pathology, and in monitoring interstitial lung disease. We aimed to describe LUS characteristics of patients during the hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia, and to compare the extent of lung involvement at LUS and chest-CT with inflammatory response and the severity of respiration impairment. METHODS During a 2-week period, we performed LUS and chest CT in hospitalized patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. Dosages of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP), d-dimer, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also obtained. The index of lung function (P/F ratio) was calculated from the blood gas test. LUS and CT scoring were assessed using previously validated scores. RESULTS Twenty-six consecutive patients (3 women) underwent LUS 34 ± 14 days from the early symptoms. Among them, 21 underwent CT on the same day of LUS. A fair association was found between LUS and CT scores (R = 0.45, P = .049), which became stronger if the B-lines score on LUS was not considered (R = 0.57, P = .024). LUS B-lines score correlated with IL-6 levels (R = 0.75, P = .011), and the number of involved lung segments detected by LUS correlated with the P/F ratio (R = 0.60, P = .019) but not with HS-CRP and d-Dimer levels. No correlations were found between CT scores and inflammations markers or P/F.

This review provides categorized literature on the phytochemical and scientifically proven toxicological profiles of A. vera and A. ferox to facilitate their exploitation in therapy. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Original full-text research articles were searched in PubMed, ScienceDirect, Research gate, Google Scholar, and Wiley Online Library using specific phrases. Phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, and anthraquinones were the main phytochemical classes present in all the two Aloe species. Most of the phytochemical investigations and toxicity studies have been done on the leaves. Aloe vera and Aloe ferox contain unique phytoconstituents including anthraquinones, flavonoids, tannins, sterols, alkaloids, and volatile oils. Aloe vera hydroalcoholic leaf extract showed a toxic effect on Kabir chicks at the highest doses. The methanolic, aqueous, and supercritical carbon dioxide extracts of A. vera leaf gel were associated with no toxic effects. The aqueous leaf extract of A. ferox is well tolerated for short-term management of ailments but long-term administration may be associated with organ toxicity. Long-term administration of the preparations from A. vera leaves and roots was associated with toxic effects. SHORT CONCLUSION: This review provides beneficial information about the phytochemistry and toxicity of A. vera and A. ferox and their potential in the treatment of COVID-19 which up to date has no definite cure.

620564,Editorial. Task shifting and task sharing for neurosurgeons amidst the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-04-17,"Drug dosing in clinical practice, which determines optimal efficacy, toxicity or ineffectiveness, is critical to patients’ outcomes. However, many orally administered therapeutic drugs are susceptible to biotransformation by a group of important oxidative enzymes, known as cytochrome P450s (CYPs). In particular, CYP3A4 is a low specificity isoenzyme of the CYPs family, which contributes to the metabolism of approximately 50% of all marketed drugs. Induction or inhibition of CYP3A4 activity results in the varied oral bioavailability and unwanted drug-drug, drug-food, and drug-herb interactions. This review explores the need for addressing intestinal CYP3A4 metabolism and investigates the opportunities to incorporate lipid-based oral drug delivery to enable precise dosing. A variety of lipid- and lipid-polymer hybrid-nanoparticles are highlighted to improve drug bioavailability. These drug carriers are designed to target different intestinal regions, including (1) local saturation or inhibition of CYP3A4 activity at duodenum and proximal jejunum; (2) CYP3A4 bypass via lymphatic absorption; (3) pH-responsive drug release or vitamin-B(12) targeted cellular uptake in the distal intestine. Exploitation of lipidic nanosystems not only revives drugs removed from clinical practice due to serious drug-drug interactions, but also provide alternative approaches to reduce pharmacokinetic variability.","Zhang, Rui Xue; Dong, Ken; Wang, Zhigao; Miao, Ruimin; Lu, Weijia; Wu, Xiao Yu",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452222/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13081261,328

Although reported prevalence estimates of certain mental disorders, substance use, or substance use disorders are not generally higher among racial and ethnic minority groups, persons in these groups are often less likely to receive treatment services (1). Persistent systemic social inequities and discrimination related to living conditions and work environments, which contribute to disparities in underlying medical conditions, can further compound health problems faced by members of racial and ethnic minority groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and worsen stress and associated mental health concerns (2,3). In April and May 2020, opt-in Internet panel surveys of English-speaking U.S. adults aged ≥18 years were conducted to assess the prevalence of self-reported mental health conditions and initiation of or increases in substance use to cope with stress, psychosocial stressors, and social determinants of health. Combined prevalence estimates of current depression, initiating or increasing substance use, and suicidal thoughts/ideation were 28.6%, 18.2%, and 8.4%, respectively. Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic) adults reported a higher prevalence of psychosocial stress related to not having enough food or stable housing than did adults in other racial and ethnic groups.

The aim of this review is to have a comprehensive insight of the different aspects that must be taken into account when working with this kind of sensors.","De Acha, Nerea; Socorro-Leránoz, Abián B.; Elosúa, César; Matías, Ignacio R.",Biosensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/bios11060197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203715/,328
622162,"The Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on Student Well-Being and the Mediating Role of the University Support: Evidence From France, Germany, Russia, and the UK",2021-07-12,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system, causing inflammation and neurodegeneration. People living with MS may experience a variety of symptoms as a consequence of this process, including many “invisible” symptoms that are internally manifested and not seen by others. Of the invisible symptoms of MS, which we have reviewed in a companion article, mood and mental health disorders are of particular concern due to their high prevalence and significant impact on patient quality of life. In this review, we showcase the experiences of patient authors alongside perspectives from healthcare provider authors as we promote awareness of the common mental health conditions faced by those living with MS, such as depression, anxiety, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and suicidal ideation. Many of these conditions stem in part from the increased stress levels and the many uncertainties that come with managing life with MS, which have been exacerbated by the environment created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A patient-centered interdisciplinary approach, routine screening for mental health changes, and referral to specialists when needed can normalize discussions of mental health and increase the likelihood that people living with MS will receive the support and care they need. Management techniques such as robust social support, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and/or pharmacotherapy may be implemented to build resilience and promote healthy coping strategies. Increasingly, patients have access to telehealth options as well as digital apps for mental health management. Taken together, these approaches form an integrative care model in which people living with MS benefit from the care of medical professionals, a variety of support networks/resources, and self-management techniques for optimal mental health care.

Here we analyzed the epidemiological features of China, South Korea, Italy and Spain to find out the relationship of major public health events and epidemiological curves. Study design In this study we describe and analyze the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in and outside China. We use GAM to generate the epidemiological curves and simulate infection curves with reported incubation period. Results The epidemiological curved derived from the GAM suggested that the infection curve can reflect the public health measurements sensitively. Under the massive actions token in China, the infection curve flattened at 23rd of January. While surprisingly, even before Wuhan lockdown and first level response of public emergency in Guangdong and Shanghai, those infection curve came to the reflection point both at 21st of January, which indicated the mask wearing by the public before 21st Jan were the key measure to cut off the transmission. In the countries outside China, infection curve also changed in response to measures, but its rate of decline was much smaller than the curve of China's. Conclusion The present analysis comparing the epidemiological curves in China, South Korea, Italy and Spain supports the importance of mask wearing by the public. Analysis of the infection curve helped to clarify the impact of important public health events, evaluate the efficiencies of prevention measures, and showed wearing masks in public resulted in significantly reduced daily infected cases.","Zeng, Nianyi; Li, Zewen; Ng, Sherrianne; Chen, Dingqiang; Zhou, Hongwei",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590097820300124; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590097820300124,328
622446,"Predicting risk along the suicidality continuum: A longitudinal, nationally representative study of the Irish population during the COVID‐19 pandemic",2021-06-29,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are responsible for more than half of all cases of the common cold and cause billions of USD annually in medical visits and school and work absenteeism. An assessment was made of the cytotoxic and antiviral activities and possible mode of action of the tannin ellagic acid from the leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa toward HeLa cells and three rhinoviruses, HRV-2, -3, and -4. METHODS: The antiviral property and mechanism of action of ellagic acid were evaluated using a sulforhodamine B assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with SYBR Green dye. Results were compared with those of the currently used broad-spectrum antiviral agent, ribavirin. RESULTS: As judged by 50% inhibitory concentration values, natural ellagic acid was 1.8, 2.3, and 2.2 times more toxic toward HRV-2 (38 μg/mL), HRV-3 (31 μg/mL), and HRV-4 (29 μg/mL) than ribavirin, respectively. The inhibition rate of preincubation with 50 μg/mL ellagic acid was 17%, whereas continuous presence of ellagic acid during infection led to a significant increase in the inhibition (70%). Treatment with 50 μg/mL ellagic acid considerably suppressed HRV-4 infection only when added just after the virus inoculation (0 h) (87% inhibition), but not before -1 h or after 1 h or later (<20% inhibition). These findings suggest that ellagic acid does not interact with the HRV-4 particles and may directly interact with the human cells in the early stage of HRV infections to protect the cells from the virus destruction. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis revealed that 50 μg/mL ellagic acid strongly inhibited the RNA replication of HRV-4 in HeLa cells, suggesting that ellagic acid inhibits virus replication by targeting on cellular molecules, rather than virus molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Global efforts to reduce the level of antibiotics justify further studies on L. speciosa leaf-derived materials containing ellagic acid as potential anti-HRV products or a lead molecule for the prevention or treatment of HRV infection.","Park, Sang Wook; Kwon, Min Jung; Yoo, Ji Young; Choi, Hwa-Jung; Ahn, Young-Joon",BMC Complement Altern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885569/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-171,328

This review examines how the position of population groups in vaccine priority lists varies between Federal guidance and State practice. Methods: An online search of State vaccination prioritization plans was conducted. Data were extracted on each population group included and their relative position. A standardized ranking method was applied to provide a directional measure of variability in prioritization between State and Federal guidance, for each population group. Results: Healthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities were largely prioritized in line with Federal guidance. Aside from early education staff, essential workers were often excluded at State level. Almost all States included the 65–74 year age group and most assigned them to a higher position than recommended in Federal guidance. Those with underlying medical conditions were similarly highly prioritized, although there was more variability across States. Some socially vulnerable groups (not included in Federal guidance) were highly prioritized by many States. Conclusions: The prioritization of groups for COVID-19 vaccination has been highly variable despite clear Federal guidance. Future guidance must be relevant to local needs, values, and constraints, to minimize any unwarranted heterogeneity in vaccine access across populations.","Jain, Vageesh; Schwarz, Lara; Lorgelly, Paula",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18073483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33801651/,328
623432,Creativity as a Means to Well-Being in Times of COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Cross-Cultural Study,2021-03-09,"Cancer cell dysregulations result in the abnormal regulation of cellular metabolic pathways. By simulating this metabolic reprogramming using constraint‐based modeling approaches, oncogenes can be predicted, and this knowledge can be used in prognosis and treatment. We introduced a trilevel optimization problem describing metabolic reprogramming for inferring oncogenes. First, this study used RNA‐Seq expression data of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples and their healthy counterparts to reconstruct tissue‐specific genome‐scale metabolic models and subsequently build the flux distribution pattern that provided a measure for the oncogene inference optimization problem for determining tumorigenesis. The platform detected 45 genes for LUAD and 84 genes for LUSC that lead to tumorigenesis. A high level of differentially expressed genes was not an essential factor for determining tumorigenesis. The platform indicated that pyruvate kinase (PKM), a well‐known oncogene with a low level of differential gene expression in LUAD and LUSC, had the highest fitness among the predicted oncogenes based on computation. By contrast, pyruvate kinase L/R (PKLR), an isozyme of PKM, had a high level of differential gene expression in both cancers. Phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PTDSS1), an oncogene in LUAD, was inferred to have a low level of differential gene expression, and overexpression could significantly reduce survival probability. According to the factor analysis, PTDSS1 characteristics were close to those of the template, but they were unobvious in LUSC. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently garnered widespread interest as the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus receptor. Moreover, we determined that ACE2 is an oncogene of LUSC but not of LUAD. The platform developed in this study can identify oncogenes with low levels of differential expression and be used to identify potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.","Wang, You‐Tyun; Lin, Min‐Ru; Chen, Wei‐Chen; Wu, Wu‐Hsiung; Wang, Feng‐Sheng",FEBS Open Bio,https://doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.13231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137202/,328

During the pandemic, we tested a tailored digital health solution, Woebot-SUDs (W-SUDs), for reducing substance misuse. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, we compared W-SUDs for 8 weeks to a waitlist control. U.S. adults (N = 180) who screened positive for substance misuse (CAGE-AID>1) were enrolled June–August 2020. The primary outcome was the change in past-month substance use occasions from baseline to end-of-treatment (EOT). Study retention was 84%. General linear models tested group differences in baseline-to-EOT change scores, adjusting for baseline differences and attrition. RESULTS: At baseline, the sample (age M = 40, SD = 12, 65% female, 68% non-Hispanic white) averaged 30.2 (SD = 18.6) substance occasions in the past month. Most (77%) reported alcohol problems, 28% cannabis, and 45% multiple substances; 46% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Treatment participants averaged 920 in-app text messages (SD = 892, Median = 701); 96% of completed lessons were rated positively; and 88% would recommend W-SUDs. Relative to waitlist, W-SUDs participants significantly reduced past-month substance use occasions (M = −9.1, SE = 2.0 vs. M = −3.3, SE = 1.8; p = .039). Secondary substance use and mood outcomes did not change significantly by group; however, reductions in substance use occasions correlated significantly with increased confidence and fewer substance use problems, cravings, depression and anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related mental health effects (p-value<.05). CONCLUSIONS: W-SUDs was associated with significant reductions in substance use occasions. Reduction in substance use occasions was associated with better outcomes, including improved mental health. W-SUDs satisfaction was high.","Prochaska, Judith J.; Vogel, Erin A.; Chieng, Amy; Baiocchi, Michael; Maglalang, Dale Dagar; Pajarito, Sarah; Weingardt, Kenneth R.; Darcy, Alison; Robinson, Athena",Drug Alcohol Depend,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34507061/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0376871621004816; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871621004816; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108986,328

624927,An evidence-based framework for priority clinical research questions for COVID-19,2020-03-31,"Human beta1-coronavirus (β1CoV) OC43 emerged relatively recently through a single zoonotic introduction. Like related animal β1CoVs, OC43 uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as receptor determinant. β1CoV receptor binding is typically controlled by attachment/fusion spike protein S and receptor-binding/receptor-destroying hemagglutinin-esterase protein HE. We show that following OC43’s introduction into humans, HE-mediated receptor binding was selected against and ultimately lost through progressive accumulation of mutations in the HE lectin domain. Consequently, virion-associated receptor-destroying activity toward multivalent glycoconjugates was reduced and altered such that some clustered receptor populations are no longer cleaved. Loss of HE lectin function was also observed for another respiratory human coronavirus, HKU1. This thus appears to be an adaptation to the sialoglycome of the human respiratory tract and for replication in human airways. The findings suggest that the dynamics of virion-glycan interactions contribute to host tropism. Our observations are relevant also to other human respiratory viruses of zoonotic origin, particularly influenza A virus.","Bakkers, Mark J.G.; Lang, Yifei; Feitsma, Louris J.; Hulswit, Ruben J.G.; de Poot, Stefanie A.H.; van Vliet, Arno L.W.; Margine, Irina; de Groot-Mijnes, Jolanda D.F.; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.M.; Langereis, Martijn A.; Huizinga, Eric G.; de Groot, Raoul J.",Cell Host Microbe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28279346/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2017.02.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312817300707; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312817300707,328

Methods: We conducted a non-interventional, multicenter, point prevalence study of patients hospitalized with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and treatment characteristics within a 24-hour window were evaluated in a random sample of up to 30 patients per site. The primary objective was to describe COVID-19 targeted therapies.

Thus creating an urgent need to develop effective counteragents against novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Many antiviral drugs have been repurposed for treatment but implicated minimal recovery, which further advanced the need for clearer insights and innovation to derive effective therapeutics. Strategically, Noscapine, an approved antitussive drug with positive effects on lung linings may show favorable outcomes synergistically with antiviral drugs in trials. Hence, we have theoretically examined the combinatorial drug therapy by culminating the existing experimental results with in silico analyses. We employed the antitussive noscapine in conjugation with antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Umifenovir, Hydroxychloroquine, Favlplravir and Galidesivir). We found that Noscapine-Hydroxychloroquine (Nos-Hcq) conjugate has strong binding affinity for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which performs key biological function in virus infection and progression. Nos-Hcq was analyzed through molecular dynamics simulation. The MD simulation for 100 ns affirmed the stable binding of conjugation unprecedentedly through RMSD and radius of gyration plots along with critical reaction coordinate binding free energy profile. Also, dynamical residue cross-correlation map with principal component analysis depicted the stable binding of Nos-Hcq conjugate to Mpro domains with optimal secondary structure statistics of complex dynamics. Also, we reveal the drugs with stable binding to major domains of Mpro can significantly improve the work profile of reaction coordinates, drug accession and inhibitory regulation of Mpro.

The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted this model, as social distancing guidelines have precluded in-person patient appointments and forced clinics to reconsider their method of care delivery. The University of California, San Francisco, Craniofacial Center has continued to serve patients during this acute period, adopting a hybrid model in which the vast majority of patients are seen through telehealth and a limited number of patients are evaluated in-person. Surveyed patients and families reported high rates of satisfaction, with time savings cited as a particular benefit. Furthermore, most felt comfortable using the video technology required for their appointment. This experience has demonstrated to us that multidisciplinary craniofacial evaluations can be effectively delivered in a telehealth format and has informed our conception of idealized clinic structure. Moving forward, we intend to utilize telehealth visits for selected components of craniofacial evaluations in an effort to maximize efficiency and minimize burden, including addressing barriers to accessing care. Benefits of a hybrid model will include decongestion of clinics and waiting areas, allowing social distancing, addressing clinic space limits, and increased efficiency by eliminating the need for patient and family movement. Demonstration of the safety and efficacy of telehealth visits, combined with regulatory reform that improves reimbursement and allows for appointments across state lines, will be critical for this model to persist beyond the pandemic.","Badiee, Ryan K.; Willsher, Heidi; Rorison, Eve; Langham, Margaret; Donnelly, Andrea; Rosenbluth, Glenn; Pomerantz, Jason H.",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,https://doi.org/10.1097/gox.0000000000003143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133981/,328

Our objective was to assess the association between viral load and disease severity in COVID-19. In this single center observational study of adults with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the first positive in-hospital nasopharyngeal swab was used to calculate the log10 copies/ml [log10 copy number (CN)] of SARS-CoV-2. Four categories based on level of care and modified sequential organ failure assessment score (mSOFA) at time of swab were determined. Median log10CN was compared between different levels of care and mSOFA quartiles. Median log10CN was compared in patients who did and did not receive influenza vaccine, and the correlation between log10CN and D-dimer was examined. We found that of 396 patients, 54.3% were male, and 25% had no major comorbidity. Hospital mortality was 15.7%. Median mSOFA was 2 (IQR 0–3). Median log10CN was 5.5 (IQR 3.3–8.0). Median log10CN was highest in non-intubated ICU patients [6.4 (IQR 4.4–8.1)] and lowest in intubated ICU patients [3.6 (IQR 2.6–6.9)] (p value < 0.01). In adjusted analyses, this difference remained significant [mean difference 1.16 (95% CI 0.18–2.14)]. There was no significant difference in log10CN between other groups in the remaining pairwise comparisons. There was no association between median log10CN and mSOFA in either unadjusted or adjusted analyses or between median log10CN in patients with and without influenza immunization. There was no correlation between log10CN and D-dimer. We conclude, in our cohort, we did not find a clear association between viral load and disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Though viral load was higher in non-intubated ICU patients than in intubated ICU patients there were no other significant differences in viral load by disease severity.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the Pediatric Endocrinology Department of a third-level University Hospital in Rome, including children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. Personal, anthropometrics data and other information about physical activity, eating habits and psychological aspects were collected. RESULTS: We included in our study 64 participants, of which 33 (51.6%) were patients with overweight and 31 (48.4%) with obesity. We divided patients in two groups: patients with pre-versus post-lockdown Δ-BMI > 0 (31, 48.4%) and patients with Δ-BMI < 0 (33, 51.6%). Our data showed that patients whose BMI increased were more sedentary (p=0.024 for physical activity and p=0.005 for hours spent with videogames) during the pandemic. As for the eating habits more than half of the subjects (67.2%) had increased the consumption of homemade desserts, bread, pasta and pizza, and a worse diet was found in patients with BMI gain (p=0.000). Regarding the psychic condition the 80% of patients reported psychological discomfort, and patients with an increase in BMI had episodes of emotional feeding more frequently (p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic has had disastrous effects not only directly, but also indirectly through the lockdown especially on some categories, such as adolescents with overweight and obesity. The results indicate that it also causes significant changes in lifestyle, physical inactivity and psychological problems among children and adolescents with obesity/overweight.

631475,Correction: A flexible method for optimising sharing of healthcare resources and demand in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-29,"SARS-CoV-2, commonly termed COVID-19 for the illness it causes, has infected >3.2 million people, including >220,000 deaths. Human milk IgG originates mainly from blood, therefore a SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody (Ab) response in milk would be expected (1). However, IgG comprises only ~2% of milk Ab, with most milk Abs originating from mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (1). Therefore, the extent of the milk immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown (2). This response is critical for infants and young children, who tend not to suffer greatly from COVID-19 pathology but are likely responsible for significant virus transmission (3-5). Perhaps even more significant is the fact that milk Abs could be purified and used as a COVID-19 therapeutic, given they would likely be of the secretory (s) class and highly resistant to proteolytic degradation in the respiratory tissue (2, 6). In this preliminary report, 15 milk samples obtained from donors previously-infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as 10 negative control samples obtained prior to December 2019 were tested for reactivity to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by ELISAs measuring IgA, IgG, IgM, and secretory Ab. Eighty percent of samples obtained post-COVID-19 exhibited IgA reactivity, and all these samples were also positive for secretory Ab reactivity, suggesting the IgA is predominantly sIgA. COVID-19 group mean OD values of undiluted milk were significantly greater for IgA (p<0.0001), secretory-type Abs (p<0.0001), and IgG (p=0.017), but not for IgM, compared to pre-pandemic group mean values. Overall, these data indicate that there is strong sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk after infection in the majority of individuals, and that a comprehensive study of this response is highly warranted.","Fox, A.; Marino, J.; Amanat, F.; Krammer, F.; Hahn-Holbrook, J.; Zolla-Pazner, S.; Powell, R.

631531,"COVID-19, health recovery by medicinal plants (health solutions): An overview",2021-09-30,"Liver injury has been widely described in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to study the effect of liver biochemistry alterations, previous liver disease, and the value of liver elastography on hard clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a single-center prospective observational study in 370 consecutive patients admitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical and laboratory data were collected at baseline and liver parameters and clinical events recorded during follow-up. Transient elastography [with Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) measurements] was performed at admission in 98 patients. All patients were followed up until day 28 or death. The two main outcomes of the study were 28-day mortality and the occurrence of the composite endpoint intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were elevated at admission in 130 patients (35%) and 167 (45%) patients, respectively. Overall, 14.6% of patients presented the composite endpoint ICU and/or death. Neither ALT elevations, prior liver disease, liver stiffness nor liver steatosis (assessed with CAP) had any effect on outcomes. However, patients with abnormal baseline AST had a higher occurrence of the composite ICU/death (21% versus 9.5%, p = 0.002). Patients ⩾65 years and with an AST level > 50 U/ml at admission had a significantly higher risk of ICU and/or death than those with AST ⩽ 50 U/ml (50% versus 13.3%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, mild liver damage is prevalent in COVID-19 patients, but neither ALT elevation nor liver steatosis influenced hard clinical outcomes. Elevated baseline AST is a strong predictor of hard outcomes, especially in patients ⩾65 years.","Campos-Varela, Isabel; Villagrasa, Ares; Simon-Talero, Macarena; Riveiro-Barciela, Mar; Ventura-Cots, Meritxell; Aguilera-Castro, Lara; Alvarez-Lopez, Patricia; Nordahl, Emilie A; Anton, Adrian; Bañares, Juan; Barber, Claudia; Barreira-Diaz, Ana; Biagetti, Betina; Camps-Relats, Laura; Ciudin, Andrea; Cocera, Raul; Dopazo, Cristina; Fernandez, Andrea; Jimenez, Cesar; Jimenez, Maria M; Jofra, Mariona; Gil, Clara; Gomez-Gavara, Concepción; Guanozzi, Danila; Guevara, Jorge A; Lobo, Beatriz; Malagelada, Carolina; Martinez-Camprecios, Joan; Mayorga, Luis; Miret, Enric; Pando, Elizabeth; Pérez-Lopez, Ana; Pigrau, Marc; Prio, Alba; Rivera-Esteban, Jesus M; Romero, Alba; Tasayco, Stephanie; Vidal-Gonzalez, Judit; Vidal, Laura; Minguez, Beatriz; Augustin, Salvador; Genesca, Joan",Therap Adv Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.1177/17562848211016567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104210/,328

Apart from providing actionable information to public health authorities on the trend of the pandemic, the daily incidence reflects the process of disease in a susceptible population and thus reflects the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the public health response and diagnosis and reporting. Both daily new cases and daily mortality data in the US exhibit periodic oscillatory patterns. By analyzing NYC and LA testing data, we demonstrate that this oscillation in the number of cases can be strongly explained by the daily variation in testing. This seems to rule out alternative hypotheses such as increased infections on certain days of the week as driving this oscillation. Similarly, we show that the apparent oscillation in mortality in the US data is mostly an artifact of reporting, which disappears in datasets that record death by episode date, such as the NYC and LA datasets. Periodic oscillations in COVID-19 incidence and mortality data reflect testing and reporting practices and contingencies. Thus, these contingencies should be considered first prior to suggesting social or biological mechanisms.","Bergman, Aviv; Sella, Yehonatan; Agre, Peter; Casadevall, Arturo",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.20123786; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.08.20123786v1?rss=1,328

633204,What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency medicine residency training: an observational study,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND: Transmission of viral diseases (e.g., influenza A H1N1) via respiratory droplets takes place mainly in confined spaces, including in aircraft during commercial air travel. The adoption of hygiene measures may help to prevent disease spread aboard aircraft. This review summarizes the evidence on hand hygiene and the use of facemasks as viral disease prevention measures in aircraft. METHODS: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to 10 June 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses criteria. A population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) approach was used to define the review question. RESULTS: We included four studies published between 2007 and 2020, all targeting influenza virus disease, in the qualitative synthesis. Three studies used mathematical models to simulate single- or multiple-direction flights, and two of them showed that facemask (e.g., N95 respirator) use considerably reduced infection probability. In the third study, hand cleaning by 20 to 60% of people at any time in all airports (including on aircraft) reduced the measure of airports’ power to spread the disease across the globe by ~ 24 to 69%. The fourth study was a case-control study designed to trace an influenza outbreak in two flights during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic. The study showed that none (0%) of nine infected passengers compared to 15 (47%) of 32 healthy control passengers in the aircraft cabin during one of these flights wore a facemask (odds ratio, 0.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.0–0.7). In contrast, both case and control passengers appeared to be equally compliant in self-assessed hand hygiene. CONCLUSIONS: Facemask use combined with hand hygiene may minimize the chance of droplet-transmitted virus spread by air travelers. Thus, it is necessary that hygiene measures become an integral part of standard procedures in commercial air travel.

Without effective treatments, outbreaks in such facilities will become commonplace and will result in severe morbidity and mortality. The effectiveness of doxycycline (DOXY) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) combination therapy in high risk COVID-19 patients in long-term care facilities is not yet understood. Objective: The goal of this analysis is to describe outcomes after use of DOXY-HCQ combination in high-risk COVID-19 patients in LTCF. Design: Case-series analysis. Setting: Three (3) LTCFs in New York. Participants: From March 19 to March 30, 2020, fifty-four (54) patients, residents of three (3) LTCFs in New York and diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19, were included in this analysis. Exposure: All patients who were diagnosed (confirmed or presumed) with COVID-19 received DOXY-HCQ combination therapy along with standard of care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Patients characteristics, clinical recovery, radiological improvements, medication side-effects, hospital transfer, and death were assessed as outcome measures. Results: A series of fifty-four (54) high-risk patients, who developed a sudden onset of fever, cough, and shortness of breath (SOB) and were diagnosed or presumed to have COVID-19, were started with a combination of DOXY-HCQ and 85% (n=46) patients showed clinical recovery defined as: resolution of fever and SOB, or a return to baseline setting if patients are ventilator-dependent. A total of 11% (n=6) patients were transferred to acute care hospitals due to clinical deterioration and 6% (n=3) patients died in the facilities. Naive Indirect Comparison suggests these data were significantly better outcomes than the data reported in MMWR (reported on March 26, 2020) from a long-term care facility in King County, Washington where 57% patients were hospitalized, and 22% patients died.

Drug repurposing represents a fast and low-cost approach to the development of new medical treatment options. The direct antiviral agent remdesivir has been reported to exert antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Whereas remdesivir only has a very short half-life time and a bioactivation, which relies on pro-drug activating enzymes, its plasma metabolite GS-441524 can be activated through various kinases including the adenosine kinase (ADK) that is moderately expressed in all tissues. The pharmacokinetics of GS-441524 argue for a suitable antiviral drug that can be given to patients with COVID-19. Here, we analyzed the antiviral property of a combined treatment with the remdesivir metabolite GS-441524 and the antidepressant fluoxetine in a polarized Calu-3 cell culture model against SARS-CoV-2. The combined treatment with GS-441524 and fluoxetine were well-tolerated and displayed synergistic antiviral effects against three circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro in the commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Thus, combinatory treatment with the virus-targeting GS-441524 and the host-directed drug fluoxetine might offer a suitable therapeutic treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Brunotte, Linda; Zheng, Shuyu; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Tang, Jing; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula; Schloer, Sebastian",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575474/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13091400,328

Regional anesthesia (RA) minimizes the need for airway manipulation and the risks of cross infection to other patients, and the healthcare personnel. In this context, for prioritizing RA over general anesthesia, wherever possible, a structured algorithmic approach is outlined. The role of percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen (oxygen saturation), blood pressure and early use of point-of-care ultrasound in differential diagnosis and specific management is detailed. The perioperative anesthetic implications of multisystem manifestations of COVID-19, anesthetic management options, the scope of RA and considerations for its safe conduct in operating rooms is described. An outline for safe and rapid training of healthcare personnel, with an Entrustable Professional Activity framework for ascertaining the practice readiness among trained residents for RA in COVID-19, is suggested.

These trends have led to a national and global focus on nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions to improve population health. A well-trained public health and community nutrition workforce is critical to manage and contribute to these efforts. The study describes the current public health and community nutrition workforce and factors influencing registered dietitian nutritionists (RDNs) to work in these settings and characterizes RDN preparedness, training, and competency in public health and community nutrition. The study was comprised of a cross-sectional, online survey of mostly US RDNs working in public health/community nutrition and semistructured telephone interviews with US-based and global public health and community nutrition experts. RStudio version 1.1.442 was used to manage and descriptively analyze survey data. Thematic analysis was conducted to evaluate expert interviews. Survey participants (n = 316) were primarily women (98%) and White (84%) with the RDN credential (91%) and advanced degrees (65%). Most reported that non-RDNs are performing nutrition-related duties at their organizations. Respondents generally rated themselves as better prepared to perform community nutrition vs public health functions. Interviews were conducted with 7 US-based experts and 5 international experts. Experts reported that non-RDNs often fill nutrition-related positions in public health, and RDNs should more actively pursue emerging public health opportunities. Experts suggested that RDNs are more desirable job candidates if they have advanced public health degrees or prior experience in public health or community nutrition and that dietetic training programs need to more rigorously incorporate public health training and experience. Significant opportunity exists to improve the preparedness and training of the current dietetic workforce to increase capacity and meet emerging needs in public health and community nutrition.","El-Kour, Tatyana Y.; Kelley, Kathryn; Bruening, Meg; Robson, Shannon; Vogelzang, Jody; Yang, Jimin; Jimenez, Elizabeth Yakes",J Acad Nutr Diet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267220311965; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212267220311965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344516/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2020.08.078,328

COVID-19 has rapidly become a public health emergency of international concern. Although remarkable scientific achievements have been reached since the beginning of the pandemic, the knowledge behind this novel coronavirus, in terms of molecular and pathogenic characteristics and zoonotic potential, is still relatively limited. Today, there is a vaccine, or rather several vaccines, which, for the first time in the history of highly contagious infectious diseases that have plagued mankind, has been manufactured in just one year. Currently, four vaccines are licensed by regulatory agencies, and they use RNA or viral vector technologies. The positive effects of the vaccination campaign are being felt in many parts of the world, but the disappearance of this new infection is still far from being a reality, as it is also threatened by the presence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that could undermine the effectiveness of the vaccine, hampering the immunization control efforts. Indeed, the current findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is adapting to transmission in humans more efficiently, while further divergence from the initial archetype should be considered. In this review, we aimed to provide a collection of the current knowledge regarding the molecular, phylogenetic, and pathogenetic insights into SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose multiple genomic and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) transcripts hijack the host cell’s machinery, located across distinct cytotopic locations. Subcellular localization of its viral RNA could play important roles in viral replication and host antiviral immune response. Here we perform computational modeling of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA localization across eight subcellular neighborhoods. We compare hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the human transcriptome and other coronaviruses and perform systematic sub-sequence analyses to identify the responsible signals. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models, we predict that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and all sgRNAs are enriched in the host mitochondrial matrix and nucleolus. The 5’ and 3’ viral untranslated regions possess the strongest and most distinct localization signals. We discuss the mitochondrial localization signal in relation to the formation of double-membrane vesicles, a critical stage in the coronavirus life cycle.

638702,Kawasaki-like disease: emerging complication during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-05-13,"Viral glycoproteins fold and oligomerize in the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell. They employ the cellular machinery and receive assistance from cellular folding factors. During the folding process, they are retained in the compartment and their structural quality is checked by the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum. A special characteristic that distinguishes viral fusion proteins from most cellular proteins is the extensive conformational change they undergo during fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. Many viral proteins fold in conjunction with and dependent on a viral partner protein, sometimes even synthesized from the same mRNA. Relevant for folding is that viral glycoproteins from the same or related virus families may consist of overlapping sets of domain modules. The consequences of these features for viral protein folding are at the heart of this review.","Braakman, Ineke; Van Anken, Eelco",Traffic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11208140/,328
639767,Evaluating different national strategies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic before mass vaccination,2021-05-15,"As researchers across the globe have focused their attention on understanding SARS-CoV-2, the picture that is emerging is that of a virus that has serious effects on the vasculature in multiple organ systems including the cerebral vasculature. Observed effects on the central nervous system include neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. The spike protein, which plays a key role in receptor recognition, is formed by the S1 subunit containing a receptor binding domain (RBD) and the S2 subunit. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is ubiquitously expressed throughout various vessel calibers in the frontal cortex. Moreover, ACE2 expression was upregulated in cases of hypertension and dementia. ACE2 was also detectable in primary hBMVECs maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis of cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48 h exposure window. Introduction of spike proteins to invitro models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) showed significant changes to barrier properties. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluidic model of the human BBB, a platform that more closely resembles the physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Evidence provided suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","Buzhdygan, Tetyana P.; DeOre, Brandon J.; Baldwin-Leclair, Abigail; Bullock, Trent A.; McGary, Hannah M.; Khan, Jana A.; Razmpour, Roshanak; Hale, Jonathan F.; Galie, Peter A.; Potula, Raghava; Andrews, Allison M.; Ramirez, Servio H.",Neurobiol Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096999612030406X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096999612030406X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053430/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105131,328

The distribution of N. caninum in tissues of adult cattle is unknown and the parasite has not been demonstrated histologically in tissues of cows. In the present study the distribution of N. caninum in different tissues of adult cattle was evaluated by bioassays in dogs. Seventeen dogs (2–3 month-old) were fed different tissues of 4 naturally exposed adult cattle (indirect fluorescent antibody test N. caninum titer ≥400): 5 were fed with masseter; 5 with heart, 3 with liver, 4 with brain, and 3 pups were used as non-infected control. Two dogs fed masseter, 2 fed heart, 1 fed liver, and 3 fed brain shed oocysts, and all dogs presented no seroconvertion to N. caninum during the observation period of 4 weeks. The oocysts were confirmed as N. caninum based on the detection of N. caninum-specific DNA by PCR and sequencing. The results indicate that dogs can be infected by N. caninum with different tissues of infected cattle.","Cavalcante, G.T.; Monteiro, R.M.; Soares, R.M.; Nishi, S.M.; Alves Neto, A.F.; Esmerini, P. de O.; Sercundes, M.K.; Martins, J.; Gennari, S.M.",Vet Parasitol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401711001543; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2011.02.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21450407/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401711001543,328

METHODS: We assemble a county-level dataset that contains COVID-19 confirmed cases through June 28, 2020 and various sociodemographic measures from multiple sources. In addition to an aspatial regression model, we conduct spatial lag, spatial error, and spatial autoregressive combined models to systematically examine the role of spatial structure in shaping geographical disparities in COVID-19 period prevalence. RESULTS: The aspatial ordinary least squares regression model tends to overestimate the COVID-19 period prevalence among counties with low observed rates, but this issue can be effectively addressed by spatial modeling. Spatial models can better estimate the period prevalence for counties, especially along the Atlantic coasts and through the Black Belt. Overall, the model fit among counties along both coasts is generally good with little variability evident, but in the Plain states, model fit is conspicuous in its heterogeneity across counties. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial models can help partially explain the geographic disparities in COVID-19 period prevalence. These models reveal spatial variability in model fit including identifying regions of the country where fit is heterogeneous and worth closer attention in the immediate short term.","Sun, Feinuo; Matthews, Stephen A.; Yang, Tse-Chuan; Hu, Ming-Hsiao",Ann Epidemiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104727972030274X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736059/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S104727972030274X,328

641549,Community-academic partnerships to promote health literacy and address social needs among low-income families during COVID-19,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND: The second largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak began in the Democratic Republic of Congo in July 2018 in North Kivu Province. Data suggest the outbreak is not epidemiologically linked to the 2018 outbreak in Equateur Province, and that independent introduction of Ebola virus (EBOV) into humans occurred. We tested for antibodies to ebolaviruses in febrile patients seeking care in North Kivu Province prior to the EVD outbreak. METHODS: Patients were enrolled between May 2017 and April 2018, before the declared start of the outbreak in eastern DRC. Questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and behavioural information to identify risk factors for exposure. Biological samples were evaluated for ebolavirus nucleic acid, and for antibodies to ebolaviruses. Prevalence of exposure was calculated, and demographic factors evaluated for associations with ebolavirus serostatus. RESULTS: Samples were collected and tested from 272 people seeking care in the Rutshuru Health Zone in North Kivu Province. All patients were negative for filoviruses by PCR. Intial screening by indirect ELISA found that 30 people were reactive to EBOV-rGP. Results were supported by detection of ebolavirus reactive linear peptides using the Serochip platform. Differential screening of all reactive serum samples against the rGP of all six ebolaviruses and Marburg virus (MARV) showed that 29 people exhibited the strongest reactivity to EBOV and one to Bombali virus (BOMV), and western blotting confirmed results. Titers ranged from 1:100 to 1:12,800. Although both sexes and all ages tested positive for antibodies, women were significantly more likely to be positive and the majority of positives were in February 2018. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first documented evidence of exposure to Ebola virus in people in eastern DRC. We detected antibodies to EBOV in 10% of febrile patients seeking healthcare prior to the declaration of the 2018–2020 outbreak, suggesting early cases may have been missed or exposure ocurred without associated illness. We also report the first known detection of antibodies to BOMV, previously detected in bats in West and East Africa, and show that human exposure to BOMV has occurred. Our data suggest human exposure to ebolaviruses may be more frequent and geographically widespread.","Goldstein, Tracey; Belaganahalli, Manjunatha N.; Syaluha, Eddy K.; Lukusa, Jean-Paul K.; Greig, Denise J.; Anthony, Simon J.; Tremeau-Bravard, Alexandre; Thakkar, Riddhi; Caciula, Adrian; Mishra, Nischay; Lipkin, W.

642268,Medical students’ perceptions and motivations during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND: There was a significant decrease in stroke admissions during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are concerns that stroke patients have not sought medical attention and in the months after the lockdown suffer recurrent severe strokes. The aims of this study were to investigate how stroke admission rates and distributions of severity varied before, during and after the lockdown in a representative Norwegian hospital population. METHODS: All patients discharged from Akershus University Hospital with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or acute stroke from January to September 2020 were identified by hospital chart review. RESULTS: We observed a transient decrease in weekly stroke admissions during lockdown from an average of 21.4 (SD 4.7) before to 15.0 (SD 4.2) during and 17.2 (SD 3.3) after (p < 0.011). The proportion of mild ischemic and haemorrhagic strokes was also lower during lockdown with 66% before, 57% during and 68% after (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: The period of COVID-19 lockdown was associated with a temporary reduction in total admissions of strokes. In particular, there were fewer with TIA and mild stroke. Given the need to prevent the worsening of symptoms and risk of recurrence, it is necessary to emphasise the importance to seek medical care even in states of emergency.","Kristoffersen, Espen Saxhaug; Jahr, Silje Holt; Faiz, Kashif Waqar; Thommessen, Bente; Rønning, Ole Morten",Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428057/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05039-y,328

642544,People with disability and the COVID-19 pandemic: The need for empiric research,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers can be used to detect the presence of endothelial and/or alveolar epithelial injuries in case of ARDS. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (VCAM-1), P-selectin and E-selectin are biomarkers of endothelial injury, whereas the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) reflects alveolar epithelial injury. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether the plasma concentration of the above-mentioned biomarkers was different 1) in survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19-related ARDS and 2) in COVID-19-related and classical ARDS. METHODS: This prospective study was performed in two COVID-19-dedicated Intensive Care Units (ICU) and one non-COVID-19 ICU at Ferrara University Hospital. A cohort of 31 mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS and a cohort of 11 patients with classical ARDS were enrolled. Ang-2, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin, E-selectin and RAGE were determined with a bead-based multiplex immunoassay at three time points: inclusion in the study (T1), after 7 ± 2 days (T2) and 14 ± 2 days (T3). The primary outcome was to evaluate the plasma trend of the biomarker levels in survivors and non-survivors. The secondary outcome was to evaluate the differences in respiratory mechanics variables and gas exchanges between survivors and non-survivors. Furthermore, we compared the plasma levels of the biomarkers at T1 in patients with COVID-19-related ARDS and classical ARDS. RESULTS: In COVID-19-related ARDS, the plasma levels of Ang-2 and ICAM-1 at T1 were statistically higher in non-survivors than survivors, (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively), whereas those of P-selectin, E-selectin and RAGE did not differ. Ang-2 and ICAM-1 at T1 were predictors of mortality (AUROC 0.650 and 0.717, respectively). At T1, RAGE and P-selectin levels were higher in classical ARDS than in COVID-19-related ARDS. Ang-2, ICAM-1 and E-selectin were lower in classical ARDS than in COVID-19-related ARDS (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 ARDS is characterized by an early pulmonary endothelial injury, as detected by Ang-2 and ICAM-1. COVID-19 ARDS and classical ARDS exhibited a different expression of biomarkers, suggesting different pathological pathways.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of vaccination coverage and intention to vaccinate among college students. College students (N = 457) enrolled in the Spring 2021 semester at a university in New Jersey completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, COVID-19 and vaccination history, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 vaccine information, and vaccine attitudes. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with vaccination, and the intention to vaccinate among non-vaccinated students. Results indicate that 23% (n = 105) of participants reported being vaccinated already. Among non-vaccinated students, 52.8% indicated their intention to receive the vaccine when it is made available to college students. Students who were health care workers (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 4.17, p < 0.001), had a family member who had received a COVID-19 vaccine (aOR = 5.03, p < 0.001), exhibited greater positive attitudes regarding vaccination (aOR = 1.12, p < 0.001), and received a seasonal flu vaccine (aOR = 1.97, p < 0.05) were more likely to have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Among non-vaccinated students, those who discussed COVID-19 vaccine information with others (aOR = 5.38, p < 0.001), and exhibited more overall positive attitudes regarding vaccination (aOR = 2.69, p < 0.001), were more likely to indicate their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

Here, we report that negative-strand RNA paramyxoviruses, Nipah virus (NiV), and measles virus (MeV), can also trigger the cGAS/STING axis. Although mice deficient for MyD88, TRIF, and MAVS still moderately control NiV infection when compared with wild-type mice, additional STING deficiency resulted in 100% lethality, suggesting synergistic roles of these pathways in host protection. Moreover, deletion of cGAS or STING resulted in decreased type I interferon production with enhanced paramyxoviral infection in both human and murine cells. Finally, the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of STING, observed during viral infections, confirmed the activation of cGAS/STING pathway by NiV and MeV. Our data suggest that cGAS/STING activation is critical in controlling paramyxovirus infection and possibly represents attractive targets to develop countermeasures against severe disease induced by these pathogens.","Iampietro, Mathieu; Dumont, Claire; Mathieu, Cyrille; Spanier, Julia; Robert, Jonathan; Charpenay, Aude; Dupichaud, Sébastien; Dhondt, Kévin P.; Aurine, Noémie; Pelissier, Rodolphe; Ferren, Marion; Mély, Stéphane; Gerlier, Denis; Kalinke, Ulrich; Horvat, Branka",iScience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142033/,328

643457,Assessing the impact of Ramadan fasting on COVID-19 mortality in the UK,2021-03-27,"INTRODUCTION: This article provides insight into a rare instance of a collaborative governance approach to sex work that led to the decriminalisation, design and implementation of the sex work policy governance framework in New Zealand with the Prostitution Reform Act 2003. METHODS: Drawing on a sample of 17 interviews conducted between the years 2012 and 2019 in addition to associated archival material originating from government and non-government sectors including sex worker representative organisations. RESULTS: It finds that non-sex workers’ endorsement for the decriminalisation of sex work was motivated by the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective (NZPC) and occurred primarily within a human rights and harm minimisation framework. But that during the lobbying and parliamentary process, amendments to the Bill emerged that contradicted the NZPC’s main goal which was for sex work to be recognised as a legitimate labour activity and for all sex workers to benefit from decriminalisation and policy reform. CONCLUSIONS: As such, this article broadens the scope of analysis related to the sex worker rights movement by examining how and why sex workers and their allies came to communicate and act on the impetus for sex work law reform and how it affected policy outcomes. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Those involved in collaborative governance sex work law reform projects could consider adopting Östegren’s typology of repressive, restrictive or integrative approaches to sex work law reform in negotiations that concern regulation and policies.","Aroney, Eurydice",Sex Res Social Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777259/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-021-00564-z,328

There were significant trends for increasing hospital LOS with increasing CCI, ASCCI, and ASECI scores (OR 57.500, P = 0.001, 95%CI 5.687-581.399; OR 71.500, P = 0.001, 95%CI 5.689-898.642; and OR 19.556, P = 0.001, 95%CI 3.315-115.372, respectively). The result was similar for the outcome of critical illness (OR 21.333, P = 0.001, 95%CI 3.565-127.672; OR 13.000, P = 0.009, 95%CI 1.921-87.990; OR 11.333, P = 0.008, 95%CI 1.859-69.080, respectively). Conclusions: This study established prognostic scoring models based on comorbidities and clinical information, which may help with the graded management of patients according to prognosis score and remind physicians to pay more attention to patients with high scores.","Zhou, Wei; Qin, Xiaoyi; Hu, Xiang; Lu, Yingru; Pan, Jingye",Int J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32922189/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.50007,328
643780,Distressed but happy: health workers and volunteers during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-05-19,"Rationale: Pulmonary vascular endotheliitis, perivascular inflammation, and immune activation are observed in COVID-19 patients. While the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly infects lung epithelial cells, whether it also infects endothelial cells (ECs) and to what extent SARS-CoV-2-mediated pulmonary vascular endotheliitis is associated with immune activation remain to be determined. Methods: To address these questions, we studied SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 (K18) mice, a severe COVID-19 mouse model, as well as lung samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected nonhuman primates (NHP) and patient deceased from COVID-19. We used immunostaining, RNAscope, and electron microscopy to analyze the organs collected from animals and patient. We conducted bulk and single cell (sc) RNA-seq analyses, and cytokine profiling of lungs or serum of the severe COVID-19 mice. Results: We show that SARS-CoV-2-infected K18 mice develop severe COVID-19, including progressive body weight loss and fatality at 7 days, severe lung interstitial inflammation, edema, hemorrhage, perivascular inflammation, systemic lymphocytopenia, and eosinopenia. Body weight loss in K18 mice correlated with the severity of pneumonia, but not with brain infection. We also observed endothelial activation and dysfunction in pulmonary vessels evidenced by the up-regulation of VCAM1 and ICAM1 and the downregulation of VE-cadherin. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in capillary ECs, activation and adhesion of platelets and immune cells to the vascular wall of the alveolar septa, and increased complement deposition in the lungs, in both COVID-19-murine and NHP models. We also revealed that pathways of coagulation, complement, K-ras signaling, and genes of ICAM1 and VCAM1 related to EC dysfunction and injury were upregulated, and were associated with massive immune activation in the lung and circulation. Conclusion: Together, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 causes endotheliitis via both infection and infection-mediated immune activation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 disease.","Qin, Zhongnan; Liu, Fengming; Blair, Robert; Wang, Chenxiao; Yang, Haoran; Mudd, Joseph; Currey, Joshua M; Iwanaga, Naoki; He, Jibao; Mi, Ren; Han, Kun; Midkiff, Cecily C.; Alam, Mohammad Afaque; Aktas, Bertal H; Heide, Richard S Vander; Veazey, Ronald; Piedimonte, Giovanni; Maness, Nicholas J; Ergün, Süleyman; Mauvais-Jarvis, Franck; Rappaport, Jay; Kolls, Jay K.; Qin, Xuebin",Theranostics,https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.61810; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335981/,328

This pandemic had a negative impact on stroke care worldwide. The World Stroke Organization (WSO) has raised concerns due to the lack of available care and compromised acute stroke services globally. The numbers of thrombolysis and thrombectomy therapies are declining. As well as, the rates and door-to treatment times for thrombolysis and thrombectomy therapies are increasing. The stroke units are being reallocated to serve COVID-19 patients, and stroke teams are being redeployed to COVID-19 centers. Covid 19 confirmed cases and deaths are rising day by day. This pandemic clearly threatened and threatening all stroke care achievements regionally. Managing stroke patients during this pandemic is even more challenging at our region. The Middle East and North Africa Stroke and Interventional Neurotherapies Organization (MENA-SINO) is the main stroke organization regionally. MENA-SINO urges the need to developing new strategies and recommendations for stroke care during this pandemic. This will require multiple channels of interventions and create a protective code stroke with fast triaging path. Developing and expanding the tele-stroke programs are urgently required. There is an urgent need for enhancing collaboration and cooperation between stroke expertise regionally and internationally. Integrating such measures will inevitably lead to an improvement and upgrading of the services to a satisfactory level.","Hashmi, Amal Al; Ozdemir, Atilla Ozcan; Shuaib, Ashfaq; AlJehani, Hosam; Mansour, Ossama; Alhazzani, Adel; Aladhem, Farid; Farhoudi, Mehdi; John, Seby; Saqqur, Maher",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720305991?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720305991; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33066945/,328

Acknowledging the critical role of the EKC for policy formulation and development strategies, this study has examined the validity of the EKC hypothesis by exploring the relationship between economic growth, urbanization, energy consumption, trade openness, human capital and ecological footprints for the period 1972–2018 in Bangladesh. The autoregressive distributive lag bounds testing approach is applied for this purpose, taking into account the structural break in the time series. A fully modified OLS estimation has also been applied as the robustness check of the results. Results from the empirical analysis confirm the existence of the EKC in Bangladesh in both the long run and short run. The causal nexus among the variables is examined by applying the Vector Error Correction Granger causality test. The causality test result shows that economic growth and urbanization cause ecological footprints in both the short run and the long run. Based on this result, it can be inferred that economic growth activities in Bangladesh can be continued and extended with minimal ecological cost through structural economic change and proper environmental management.

This study aimed to assess the challenges faced by women who used RMNCH services in Nigeria’s epicentre, their satisfaction with care received during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors associated with their satisfaction. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Lagos, southwest Nigeria among 1,241 women of reproductive age who had just received RMNCH services at one of twenty-two health facilities across the primary, secondary and tertiary tiers of health care. The respondents were selected via multi-stage sampling and face to face exit interviews were conducted by trained interviewers. Client satisfaction was assessed across four sub-scales: health care delivery, health facility, interpersonal aspects of care and access to services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship between personal characteristics and client satisfaction. RESULTS: About 43.51% of respondents had at least one challenge in accessing RMNCH services since the COVID-19 outbreak. Close to a third (31.91%) could not access service because they could not leave their houses during the lockdown and 18.13% could not access service because there was no transportation. The mean clients’ satisfaction score among the respondents was 43.25 (SD: 6.28) out of a possible score of 57. Satisfaction scores for the interpersonal aspects of care were statistically significantly lower in the PHCs and general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals. Being over 30 years of age was significantly associated with an increased clients’ satisfaction score (ß = 1.80, 95%CI: 1.10–2.50). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown posed challenges to accessing RMNCH services for a significant proportion of women surveyed. Although overall satisfaction with care was fairly high, there is a need to provide tailored COVID-19 sensitive inter-personal care to clients at all levels of care.","Balogun, Mobolanle; Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi; Sekoni, Adekemi; Boateng, Godfred O.; Yesufu, Victoria; Wright, Ololade; Ubani, Osinachi; Abayomi, Akin; Afolabi, Bosede B.; Ogunsola, Folasade",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961682/,328

The purpose of this study was to determine complications associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for all operations done from March 16-June 30, 2020. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a single-institution, retrospective observational analysis of data for all surgical procedures and all SARS-CoV-2 tests done in the medical center from March 16-June 30, 2020. The charts of all SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who had a surgical procedure during the study time period were retrospectively reviewed to assess the outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2,208 operations during that time, 29 (1.3%) patients were SARS-CoV-2-positive and were asymptomatic at the time of their operations. Twenty-four (82.7%) of the 29 required urgent or emergent procedures. The median time between availability of test results and operations for these patients was 0.63 + 1.94 days. With median follow-up of 89 days, none of the 29 patients died from SARS-CoV-2-related causes, and none developed clinically evident thromboembolism or required re-intubation secondary to SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia.

Therefore, this substitution may provide an advantage for viral spreading. To explore the mechanism, we analyzed 18 viral isolates containing S proteins with either G614 or D614 (S-G614 and S-D614, respectively). The plaque assay showed a significantly higher virus titer in S-G614 than in S-D614 isolates. We further found increased cleavage of the S protein at the furin substrate site, a key event that promotes syncytium formation, in S-G614 isolates. The enhancement of the D614G substitution in the cleavage of the S protein and in syncytium formation has been validated in cells expressing S protein. The effect on the syncytium was abolished by furin inhibitor treatment and mutation of the furin cleavage site, suggesting its dependence on cleavage by furin. Our study pointed to the impact of the D614G substitution on syncytium formation through enhanced furin-mediated S cleavage, which might increase the transmissibility and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 strains containing S-G614.","Cheng, Ya-Wen; Chao, Tai-Ling; Li, Chiao-Ling; Wang, Sheng-Han; Kao, Han-Chieh; Tsai, Ya-Min; Wang, Hurng-Yi; Hsieh, Chi-Ling; Lin, You-Yu; Chen, Pei-Jer; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Yeh, Shiou-Hwei",mBio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311586/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00587-21,328

There are currently no efficacious drugs targeting coronavirus disease 2019, therefore, it is an urgent requirement for the development of drugs to control this emerging disease. Owing to the importance of nucleocapsid protein, the present study focuses on targeting the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 to identify the potential compounds by computational approaches such as pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics. We found three molecules (ZINC000257324845, ZINC000005169973 and ZINC000009913056), which adopted a similar conformation as guanosine monophosphate (GMP) within the N-terminal domain active site and exhibiting high binding affinity (>−8.0 kcalmol(−1)). All the identified compounds were stabilized by hydrogen bonding with Arg107, Tyr111 and Arg149 of N-terminal domain. Additionally, the aromatic ring of lead molecules formed π interactions with Tyr109 of N-terminal domain. Molecular dynamics and Molecular mechanic/Poisson–Boltzmann surface area results revealed that N-terminal domain – ligand(s) complexes are less dynamic and more stable than N-terminal domain – GMP complex. As the identified compounds share the same corresponding pharmacophore properties, therefore, the present results may serve as a potential lead for the development of inhibitors against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

This could be especially significant in the optimization of reovirus strains for virotherapeutic applications, either as gene vectors or oncolytic viruses. The genome of a mutant virus exhibiting increased sensitivity to interferon was completely sequenced and compared with its parental virus. Viruses corresponding to either the parental or mutant viruses were then rescued by reverse genetics and shown to exhibit the expected phenotypes. Systematic rescue of different viruses harboring either of the four parental genes in a mutant virus backbone, or reciprocally, indicated that a single amino acid substitution in one of λ2 methyltransferase domains is the major determinant of the difference in interferon sensitivity between these two viruses.","Sandekian, Véronique; Lemay, Guy",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25985441/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215002317; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215002317,328
651747,Using Latent Class Analysis to Identify the Complex Needs of Youth on Probation,2020-05-19,"BACKGROUND: The announcement of a national lockdown in South Africa had country-wide impact on the delivery of health services. Strategies included prioritisation of patients and protecting patients who were considered at risk, resulting in the need for cancellation and temporary termination of many outpatient therapy services. This necessitated the urgent need to come up with a way of delivering physiotherapy rehabilitation services to patients in a more non-traditional format. Telerehabilitation allows for the provision of services by using electronic communication, thus ensuring that patients are still able to access necessary rehabilitation services. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a prospective, mixed method study with participants recruited from the outpatient physiotherapy department of Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH). Telerehabilitation services will be provided via the patients’ preferred method of communication. On discharge, participants and therapists will be asked about their experiences of telerehabilitation. DISCUSSION: Because of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients are unable to receive traditional face-to-face physiotherapy services. Telerehabilitation offers a suitable alternative to treatment, but the feasibility, outcome and experiences of offering these services in the public health system have not been studied. CONCLUSION: This study will determine whether telerehabilitation is a feasible service that can be offered in the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as post-pandemic, to enable physiotherapists to access those patients who are often unable to attend physiotherapy because of transport costs and various other reasons for non-attendance. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results of this study may indicate a way of managing patients in situations where face to face therapy cannot be undertaken.

SARS-CoV-2 is a beta CoV of the Coronaviridae family which usually causes respiratory symptoms that resemble common cold. Multiple countries have experienced multiple waves of the disease and scientific experts are consistently working to find answers to several unresolved questions, with the aim to find the most suitable ways to contain the virus. Furthermore, potential therapeutic strategies and vaccine development for COVID-19 management are also considered. Currently, substantial efforts have been made to develop successful and safe treatments and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Some vaccines, such as inactivated vaccines, nucleic acid-based, and vector-based vaccines, have entered phase 3 clinical trials. Additionally, diverse small molecule drugs, peptides and antibodies are being developed to treat COVID-19.

655225,Immunity credentials using self-sovereign identity for combating COVID-19 pandemic,2021-03-22,"Many antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have multiple antimicrobial immunity effects. One such class of peptides is temporins. Temporins are the smallest (AMPs) found in nature and are highly active against gram-positive bacteria. Nowadays, there was a rapid increase in the availability of the 3D structure of proteins in PDB (protein data bank). The conserved residues and 3D structural conformations of temporins (AMPs) were still unknown. The present study explores the sequence analysis, alpha-helical structural conformations of temporins. The sequence of temporins was deracinated from APD3 database, the three-dimensional structure was constructed by homology modeling studies. The sequence analysis results show that the conserved residues among the peptide sequences, the maximum of the sequences are 70% alike to each other. The secondary structure prediction results revealed that 99% of temporin (AMPs) exhibited in alpha-helical form. The 3D structure speculated using RAMPAGE exposes the alpha-helical conformation in all temporins (AMPs). The phylogenetic analysis reveals the evolutionary relationships of temporins (AMPs), which are branched into seven clusters.

655301,Feeding Children and Maintaining Food Service Operations during COVID-19: A Mixed Methods Investigation of Implementation and Financial Challenges,2021-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests an association between acute pancreatitis and COVID-19. Our objective is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether COVID-19 affects the severity and outcomes associated with acute pancreatitis. METHODS: Cochrane guidelines and PRISMA statement were followed for this review. Digital dissertation bases were searched and all studies comparing the outcomes of acute pancreatitis amongst patients with and without COVID-19 were included. We compared the etiology, severity, length of hospital stay and mortality associated with acute pancreatitis in patients with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Four observational studies with a total of 2,419 patients were included in the review. Presence of COVID-19 significantly increased the odds of mortality (OR 4.10, 95% CI 2.03-8.29) in patients with acute pancreatitis. These patients also had an increased incidence of severe pancreatitis (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.19-10.32), necrotizing pancreatitis (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.19-2.85) and a longer length of hospital stay (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.50-5.52), compared to non-COVID patients. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to have an unknown or idiopathic etiology of acute pancreatitis (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.32-12.29), compared to non-COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 adversely impacts the morbidity and mortality associated with acute pancreatitis. SARS-CoV-2 may be a causative agent for acute pancreatitis. Further population-based studies are needed to confirm or refute these findings.","Mutneja, Hemant Raj; Bhurwal, Abhishek; Arora, Shilpa; Goel, Akshay; Vohra, Ishaan; Attar, Bashar M",Scand J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465256/; https://doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2021.1971757,328

We carried out a multicentre, large-sample questionnaire survey in Chongqing (China). The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star was used to distribute a questionnaire with self-designed items to obtain general information, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). A total of 848 neonatal nurses participated. The results showed that 104 nurses (12.3%) had depression symptoms, 133 (15.7%) had anxiety symptoms, and 45 (5.3%) had stress symptoms. However, the DASS-21 score of the majority of nurses was normal.

655681,Safeguarding Children in a Pandemic: Pandemonium with Possibility?,2020-09-30,"Introduction: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness resulting from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019. Many patients with blood cancer have underlying immune dysfunction, and many are treated with chemotherapies and immunotherapies that are themselves profoundly immunosuppressive. Additionally, patients with blood cancer are often older, may have comorbid illness including hypertension and diabetes, and may be especially susceptible to complications of COVID-19 include hypercoagulability and thrombosis. For patients with hematologic malignancies, overall risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection, and how this risk varies as a function of age, disease status, type of malignancy, and cancer therapy, has not yet been well defined. Methods: The ASH Research Collaborative COVID-19 Registry for Hematology was developed to study features and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with underlying blood disorders, such as hematologic malignancies. The Registry opened for data collection on April 1, 2020. The Registry is a global effort and is housed on a secure data platform hosted by Prometheus Research, an IQVIA company. The Registry collects data from patients of all ages with a current or history of hematological disease, and either a laboratory-confirmed or presumptive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data are made available and regularly updated on the ASH Research Collaborative website to guide the provider and patient communities. Data presented here are limited to malignant hematologic diseases only. Contributors are individual providers or designees submitting data on behalf of providers. Results: At the time of this analysis, data from 250 patients with blood cancers from 74 sites around the world had been entered into the Registry. The most commonly represented malignancies were acute leukemia (33%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and myeloma or amyloidosis (16%). Patients presented with a myriad of symptoms, most frequently fever (73%), cough (67%), dyspnea (50%), and fatigue (40%). Use of COVID-19-directed therapies such as hydroxychloroquine (N=76) or azithromycin (N=59) was common. Overall mortality was 28%. Patients with a physician-estimated prognosis from the underlying hematologic malignancy of less than 12 months at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis and those with relapsed/refractory disease experienced a higher proportion of moderate/severe COVID-19 disease and death. In some instances, death occurred after a decision was made to forego ICU admission in favor of a palliative approach. Conclusions: Taken together, these data support the emerging consensus that patients with hematologic malignancies experience significant morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. However, we see no reason, based on our data, to withhold intensive therapies from patients with underlying hematologic malignancies and favorable prognoses, if aggressive supportive care is consistent with patient preferences. Batch submissions from sites with high incidence of COVID-19 infection are ongoing. The Registry has been expanded to include non-malignant hematologic diseases, and the Registry will continue to accumulate data as a resource for the hematology community.

656202,Benefit-risk analysis of health benefits of routine childhood immunisation against the excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the Covid-19 pandemic in Africa,2020-05-26,"Introduction: Chemokines play important roles in inflammation and in immune responses. This article will discuss the current literature on the C–C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), and whether it is a therapeutic target in the context of various allergic, autoimmune or infectious diseases. Areas covered: Small-molecule inhibitors, chemokine and chemokine receptor-deficient mice, antibodies and modified chemokines are the current tools available for CCL5 research, and there are several ongoing clinical trials targeting the CCL5 receptors, CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5. There are fewer studies specifically targeting the chemokine itself and clinical studies with anti-CCL5 antibodies are still to be carried out. Expert opinion: Although clinical trials are strongly biased toward HIV treatment and prevention with blockers of CCR5, the therapeutic potential for CCL5 and its receptors in other diseases is relevant. Overall, it is not likely that specific targeting of CCL5 will result in new adjunct strategies for the treatment of infectious diseases with a major inflammatory component. However, targeting CCL5 could result in novel therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases, where it may decrease inflammatory responses and fibrosis, and certain solid tumors, where it may have a role in angiogenesis.","Marques, Rafael Elias; Guabiraba, Rodrigo; Russo, Remo Castro; Teixeira, Mauro Martins",Expert Opin Ther Targets,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24090198/; https://doi.org/10.1517/14728222.2013.837886,328
657306,Comparison of Predictive Models and Impact Assessment of Lockdown for COVID-19 over the United States,2021-06-11,"Intestinal epithelial cells are the targets for transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus (TGEV) infection. It is urgent to develop a novel candidate against TGEV entry. Bacillus subtilis is a probiotic with excellent anti-microorganism properties and one of its secretions, surfactin, has been regarded as a versatile weapon for most plant pathogens, especially for the enveloped virus. We demonstrate for the first time that B. subtilis OKB105 and its surfactin can effectively inhibit one animal coronavirus, TGEV, entering the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Then, several different experiments were performed to seek the might mechanisms. The plaque assays showed that surfactant could reduce the plaque generation of TGEV in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, after incubation with TGEV for 1.5 h, B. subtilis could attach TGEV particles to their surface so that the number of virus to bind to the host cells was declined. Furthermore, our data showed that the inhibition of B. subtilis was closely related to the competition with TGEV for the viral entry receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and aminopeptidase N (APN) protein. In addition, Western blotting and apoptosis analysis indicated that B. subtilis could enhance the resistance of IPEC-J2 cells by up-regulating the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-6 and reducing the percentage of apoptotic cells. Taken together, our results suggest that B. subtilis OKB105 and its surfactin can antagonize TGEV entry in vitro and may serve as promising new candidates for TGEV prevention.","Wang, Xiaoqing; Hu, Weiwei; Zhu, Liqi; Yang, Qian",Biosci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270576/; https://doi.org/10.1042/bsr20170082,328

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed a sample (based on consecutive referrals) of five groups of people in late 2020: a group of the general population from Shiraz (without a history of any chronic medical or psychiatric problems), patients with epilepsy, patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), patients with cardiac problems, and patients with psychiatric problems. The survey included four general questions and three COVID-19 specific questions. RESULTS: 582 people participated. In Total, 66 (11.3%) people expressed that they were not willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Psychiatric disorders (OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 1.31-7.60; p = 0.006) and male sex (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.23-3.58; p = 0.010) were significantly associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSION: Vaccine hesitancy is a global issue. Patients with psychiatric disorders had the highest rate of vaccine hesitancy. Previous studies have shown that depression and anxiety are associated with a reduced adherence to the recommended medical advices. Why male sex is associated with vaccine hesitancy is not clear. Researchers should investigate the rates and the factors affecting the vaccine hesitancy in their corresponding communities.","Asadi-Pooya, Ali A; Barzegar, Zohreh; Sadeghian, Saeid; Nezafat, Abdullah; Shahisavandi, Mina; Nabavizadeh, Seyed Ali",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629142/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.311,328
658558,Observational study of UK mobile health apps for COVID-19,2020-06-24,"Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been successfully utilized in the clinical treatment of several rheumatologic (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis) and inflammatory diseases (e.g. hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). Based on the growing evidence that moderate and severe COVID-19 infections are associated with a dysregulated inflammatory state, this class of medications has been repurposed as a potential therapy for COVID-19, an infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2. RECENT FINDINGS: Three JAK inhibitors have been evaluated in human studies of COVID-19: Baricitinib, Tofacitinib, and Ruxolitinib. Most published studies are observational, but three randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trials have been completed: two large trials (N = 2,558 patients) with baricitinb demonstrated significant faster improvement in clinical status and reduction in the recovery time, as well as, significant reduction in the progression to invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality. One smaller randomized trial (N = 289) involving tofacitinib showed significant reduction in the progression to invasive ventilation or death. Notably, these three randomized placebo-controlled trials with close to 3,000 patients did not reveal any safety concerns associated with JAK inhibitors in terms of secondary infections or venous thromboembolism. Based on this high-quality evidence, both the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the National Institutes of Health guidelines recommend using baricitinib as part of the treatment approach for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. SUMMARY: JAK inhibitors are novel treatment agents in the field of infectious diseases. One JAK inhibitor, baricitinib has demonstrated significant clinical and survival benefits in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in phase III randomized placebo-controlled trials. Baricitinib is already recommended for clinical practice by multiple guidelines.","Florescu, Diana F.; Kalil, Andre C.",Curr Opin Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34353999/,328

These three lectins have inhibited propagation of influenza viruses with a similar extent, 50% of inhibition-dose was around ten nanomolar concentration. An immunofluorescent microscopy, a microarray analysis, and several infection experiments with different time periods of lectin addition or using the competitor substrates indicated that binding of these lectins with high-mannose glycan on HA protein of influenza virus could block the virus entry into the host cells, thereby resulting in inhibition of the virus propagation.

(2) For 17 years, the pandemics generally began at the 50th week every year showing over 1.0 patient/clinic, reached the peak at 5th week the following year, and ended over 10–15th week. Two big A/H3N2 pandemics were seen in 1989/1990 and 1997/1998 seasons, claiming over 1 million patients in Japan. (3) As herald strains, A/H3N2 strains (A/Sydney-like) were found in October 1999, and B strains (B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-like) were detected in July and November 1998 and, in August and December 2000 in Shizuoka. B/Shizuoka/1/98 strain was registered internationally as a vaccine-recommended strain. (4) A/H3N2 and B viruses were detected in 55–78% of flu patients (almost under 10 years) with encephalopathy in 1999/2000 and 78–91% in 2000/2001 by MDCK and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. (5) High hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers over 40 in 250 persons were shown against A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2), A/Yokohama/8/98 (H3N2), A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and A/Moscow/10/99 (H1N1) strains, while low titers showed against A/Beijing/262/95 (H1N1) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), and B/Beijing/243/97, B/Shangdong/7/97 and B/Yamanashi/106/98 strains in 1998–2000. (6) In anti-HA titers against A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B subtypes, clear generation gaps were observed between children (0–19 years), adults (20–59 years) and old men (over 60 years). (7) The pandemics are dependent on host immunity (acquired and vaccinated) and climatic conditions (low temperature, low humidity and limited rainfall), considering highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses (A/H5N1, A/H7N7) like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus in 2002–2003.","Miyamoto, Hideki; Sahara, Keiji; Sugieda, Masaaki",Int Congr Ser,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531513104002122; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ics.2004.02.081; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0531513104002122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288142/,328

The clinical picture of these different pneumonias can be very similar, but viral infection is more common in the pediatric and geriatric populations, leukocytes are not generally elevated, fever is variable, and upper respiratory tract symptoms often occur; procalcitonin levels are not generally affected. For years, the diagnosis of viral pneumonia was based on cell culture and antigen detection, but since the introduction of polymerase chain reaction techniques in the clinical setting, identification of these pathogens has increased and new microorganisms such as human bocavirus have been discovered. In general, influenza virus type A and syncytial respiratory virus are still the main pathogens involved in this entity. However, in recent years, outbreaks of deadly coronavirus and zoonotic influenza virus have demonstrated the need for constant alert in the face of new emerging pathogens. Neuraminidase inhibitors for viral pneumonia have been shown to reduce transmission in cases of exposure and to improve the clinical progress of patients in intensive care; their use in common infections is not recommended. Ribavirin has been used in children with syncytial respiratory virus, and in immunosuppressed subjects. Apart from these drugs, no antiviral has been shown to be effective. Prevention with anti-influenza virus vaccination and with monoclonal antibodies, in the case of syncytial respiratory virus, may reduce the incidence of pneumonia.","Galván, José María; Rajas, Olga; Aspa, Javier",Arch Bronconeumol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300289615001076; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300289615001076,328

Here, to meet this urgent demand, we report a homogeneous immunoassay to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This serological assay, called SATiN, is based on a tri-part Nanoluciferase (tNLuc) approach, in which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and protein G, fused respectively to two different tNLuc tags, are used as antibody probes. Target engagement of the probes allows reconstitution of a functional luciferase in the presence of the third tNLuc component. The assay is performed directly in the liquid phase of patient sera and enables rapid, quantitative and low-cost detection. We show that SATiN has a similar sensitivity to ELISA, and its readouts are consistent with various neutralizing antibody assays. This proof-of-principle study suggests potential applications in diagnostics, as well as disease and vaccination management.","Yao, Zhong; Drecun, Luka; Aboualizadeh, Farzaneh; Kim, Sun Jin; Li, Zhijie; Wood, Heidi; Valcourt, Emelissa J.; Manguiat, Kathy; Plenderleith, Simon; Yip, Lily; Li, Xinliu; Zhong, Zoe; Yue, Feng Yun; Closas, Tatiana; Snider, Jamie; Tomic, Jelena; Drews, Steven J.; Drebot, Michael A.; McGeer, Allison; Ostrowski, Mario; Mubareka, Samira; Rini, James M.; Owen, Shawn; Stagljar, Igor",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22102-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753733/,328

Previous studies have proposed using thermography, which relies on infrared imaging, to measure respiratory rate (RR). These systems lack support from real-world feasibility testing for widespread acceptance. This study enrolled 101 spontaneously ventilating patients in a post-anesthesia recovery unit. Patients were placed in a 45° reclined position while undergoing pulse oximetry and bioimpedance-based RR monitoring. A thermography camera was placed approximately 1 m from the patient and pointed at the patient’s face, recording continuously at 30 frames per second for 2 min. Simultaneously, RR was manually recorded. Offline imaging analysis identified the nares as a region of interest and then quantified nasal temperature changes frame by frame to estimate RR. The manually calculated RR was compared with both bioimpedance and thermographic estimates. The Pearson correlation coefficient between direct measurement and bioimpedance was 0.69 (R(2) = 0.48), and that between direct measurement and thermography was 0.95 (R(2) = 0.90). Limits of agreement analysis revealed a bias of 1.3 and limits of agreement of 10.8 (95% confidence interval 9.07 to 12.5) and − 8.13 (− 6.41 to − 9.84) between direct measurements and bioimpedance, and a bias of −0.139 and limits of agreement of 2.65 (2.14 to 3.15) and − 2.92 (− 2.41 to 3.42) between direct measurements and thermography. Thermography allowed tracking of the manually measured RR in the post-anesthesia recovery unit without requiring patient contact.

Viral replication requires a 3C-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)) which processes the 200 kDa viral polyprotein into six functional proteins. The 3CL(pro) has attracted much interest due to its potential as a target for antiviral drugs. A system for growing high-quality crystals of native Southampton norovirus 3CL(pro) (SV3CP) has been established, allowing the ligand-free crystal structure to be determined to 1.3 Å in a tetrameric state. This also allowed crystal-based fragment screening to be performed with various compound libraries, ultimately to guide drug discovery for SV3CP. A total of 19 fragments were found to bind to the protease out of the 844 which were screened. Two of the hits were located at the active site of SV3CP and showed good inhibitory activity in kinetic assays. Another 5 were found at the enzyme’s putative RNA-binding site and a further 10 were located in the symmetric central cavity of the tetramer.","Guo, Jingxu; Douangamath, Alice; Song, Weixiao; Coker, Alun R.; Edith Chan, A.W.; Wood, Steve P.; Cooper, Jonathan B.; Resnick, Efrat; London, Nir; von Delft., Frank",J Struct Biol X,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32743543/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590152420300131; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590152420300131?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yjsbx.2020.100031,328

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (eu-DKA) is a rare life-threatening complication associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitor that may be unnoticed, particularly in a pandemic setting, due to the absence of significant hyperglycemia, delaying its treatment. In this report, we describe a case of a 56-year-old patient who presented an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis during a SARS-CoV-2 infection and was diagnosed with SGLT2-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. COVID-19 may increase patients’ insulin demand, present gastrointestinal symptoms, and increase the production of ketone bodies. This situation can be worsened in susceptible diabetic patients on SLGT2 inhibitors, due to the persistent glycosuria, which can cause volume depletion. Recently some authors recommended that insulin-deficient patients or those using SGLT2 inhibitors should monitor for ketosis using available home testing kits in case of infections and should discontinue the medication in case of COVID-19. Given the increased use of this drug class in the management of type 2 DM patients due to its reduction of cardiovascular risk, we set out to emphasize the importance for the medical community to consider the possibility of eu-DKA on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using SLGT2 inhibitors, so physicians can provide these patients with appropriate therapy promptly.","Batista, Daniel Valente; Vieira, Carla Antoniana Ferreira de Almeida; Costa, Thomaz Alexandre; Lima, Eduardo Gomes",Diabetol Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13340-020-00473-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33133998/,328

Section one (6 questions) included socio‐demographic information section two (11 questions) composed of dietary behavior information including a) Mediterranean diet (MD) adherence using 14‐scaled items with a MD screener tool ranging from 0 to 14 b) and sections three (12 questions) composed of lifestyle habit changes such as physical activity, sleeping behavior, and smoking habit. The total number of included respondents was 2,137. The results showed that 12.0% (256) of participants stated that their lifestyle was improved, whereas 50.9% (1,087) declared their lifestyle deteriorated. In particular, the frequency of physical activity was decreased (McNemar value = 60.53, p <.001) and sleeping hours were significantly increased during lockdown (McNemar value = 447.93, p <.001). Regarding eating habits, it was noticed that 29.3% and 14.3% felt that appetite increased and decreased, respectively. The appetite change during lockdown was significantly associated with age (p =.0001), gender (p =.001), city (p =.007), and BMI (p =.001). Similarly, 32.4% reported weight gain.

The present study evaluated the antiviral activity of bufotenine against different genetic lineages of rabies virus (RABV, a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus), canine coronavirus (CCoV, a positive-sense RNA virus) and two double-stranded DNA viruses (two strains of herpes simplex virus type 1/HSV-1 [KOS and the acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strain 29R] and canine adenovirus 2, CAV-2). The maximal non-toxic bufotenine concentrations in Vero and BHK-21 cells were determined by MTT assays. The antiviral activity of bufotenine against each virus was assessed by examination of reductions in infectious virus titres and plaque assays. All experiments were performed with and without bufotenine, and the results were compared. Bufotenine demonstrated significant RABV inhibitory activity. No antiviral action was observed against CCoV, CAV-2 or HSV-1. These findings indicate that the antiviral activity of bufotenine is somewhat linked to the particular infectious dose used and the genetic lineage of the virus, although the mechanisms of its effects remain undetermined.","Barboza, Camila Mosca; Pimenta, Daniel Carvalho; Vigerelli, Hugo; de Cássia Rodrigues da Silva, Andréa; Garcia, Jaíne Gonçalves; Zamudio, Raphaela Mello; Castilho, Juliana Galera; Montanha, Jarbas Alves; Roehe, Paulo Michel; de Carvalho Ruthner Batista, Helena Beatriz",Braz J Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42770-021-00612-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562234/,328

670233,The Endemic Amid the Pandemic: Seeking Help for Violence Against Women in the Initial Phases of COVID-19,2021-03-10,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced many higher education institutions (HEIs) across the world to cancel face-to-face teaching, close campus facilities, and displace staff and students to work and learn from home. Given the persistent nature of the pandemic, many HEIs have continued to deliver courses online and/or use a blended learning approach. However, there are concerns around differences in student access to digital learning resources while at home, including high quality broadband connectivity. This is important, since variation in connectivity may impact the type of online/blended model that faculty can deliver or constrain student engagement with online content. In this context, this paper combines national data on the domiciles of students enrolled in Irish HEIs with detailed spatial data on broadband coverage to estimate the number of higher education students ‘at risk’ of poor access to high quality internet connectivity. Overall it finds that one-in-six students come from areas with poor broadband coverage, with large disparities by geography and by HEI. It also finds that students from the poorest broadband coverage areas are more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged. As a result, this paper recommends that HEIs use their detailed registration data to help identify and support at-risk students. In particular, the results suggest that some HEIs may need to prioritise access to campus facilities and services to less well-off students living in poor broadband coverage areas.

Game mechanics, which are directly linked to human desires, stand out as training, evaluation, and improvement tools. Immersive virtual reality (VR) facilitates training without risk to participants, evaluates the impact of an incorrect action/decision, and creates a smart training environment. The present study analyzes the user experience in a gamified virtual environment of risks using the HTC Vive head-mounted display. The game was developed in the Unreal game engine and consisted of a walk-through maze composed of evident dangers and different signaling variables while user action data were recorded. To demonstrate which aspects provide better interaction, experience, perception and memory, three different warning configurations (dynamic, static and smart) and two different levels of danger (low and high) were presented. To properly assess the impact of the experience, we conducted a survey about personality and knowledge before and after using the game. We proceeded with the qualitative approach by using questions in a bipolar laddering assessment that was compared with the recorded data during the game. The findings indicate that when users are engaged in VR, they tend to test the consequences of their actions rather than maintaining safety. The results also reveal that textual signal variables are not accessed when users are faced with the stress factor of time. Progress is needed in implementing new technologies for warnings and advance notifications to improve the evaluation of human behavior in virtual environments of high-risk surroundings.","Cavalcanti, Janaina; Valls, Victor; Contero, Manuel; Fonseca, David",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300401/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21144663,328

Services are reassessed after the COVID-10 pandemic using personal interviews with experts from healthcare facilities, regulatory authorities, and service providers. The results show that 92.1% of healthcare facilities were connected to public water networks, 12.9% of them purchased water tanks, and 10.8% of them depended on harvested rainwater which may cause contamination and waterborne diseases. Regardless the source of freshwater, the water quality has to be regularly examined and compared to local guidelines and international standards for health promotion. Almost 63.4% of healthcare facilities were not connected to wastewater networks and used either tight or porous cesspits. Once these cesspits are filled off, wastewater is randomly disposed into nearby valleys causing adverse environmental impacts on air, water, and land resources. Medical wastewater of hazardous substances should be treated before discharged to wastewater networks.

In the present study, we established a high-throughput FRET technique for screening for anti-SARS-CoV 3CL protease drugs. Of a thousand existing drugs examined, hexachlorophene was identified as the most potent in inhibiting SARS-CoV 3CL protease. Further characterization showed that it was effective at micromolar concentrations (K(i) = 4 μM). The binding mode was competitive, and the inhibitory effect was dependent on preincubation time. Two other drugs, triclosan and nelfinavir, were about 10 times less potent. The structure-based search and biological evaluation of various hexachlorophene analogues were described. These analogues gave optimal inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CL protease with IC(50) values ranging from 7.6 to 84.5 μM. Optimization of hexachlorophene analogues was shown to provide several active 3CL protease inhibitors that function as potential anti-SARS agents.","Liu, Yu-Chih; Huang, Vicky; Chao, Ti-Chun; Hsiao, Chwan-Deng; Lin, Atsui; Chang, Ming-Fu; Chow, Lu-Ping",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X0501051X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15950190/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X0501051X,328

However, the effect of a prior diagnosis of heart failure (HF) with reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction on COVID-19 outcomes has not yet been established. Methods and Results: We retrospectively studied all adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to our institution from March 1st to 2nd May 2020. Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of HF. We used competing events survival models to examine the association between HF and death, need for intubation, or need for dialysis during hospitalization. Of 4043 patients admitted with COVID-19, 335 patients (8.3%) had a prior diagnosis of HF. Patients with HF were older, had lower body mass index, and a significantly higher burden of co-morbidities compared to patients without HF, yet the two groups presented to the hospital with similar clinical severity and similar markers of systemic inflammation. Patients with HF had a higher cumulative in-hospital mortality compared to patients without HF (49.0% vs. 27.2%, p < 0.001) that remained statistically significant (HR = 1.383, p = 0.001) after adjustment for age, body mass index, and comorbidities, as well as after propensity score matching (HR = 1.528, p = 0.001). Notably, no differences in mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, or renal replacement therapy were observed among HF patients with preserved or reduced ejection fraction.

There is an urgent need for novel antiviral drugs for therapeutic or prophylactic application. Cathepsin L is a key host cysteine protease utilized by coronaviruses for cell entry and is recognized as a promising drug target. The marine natural product, gallinamide A and several synthetic analogues, were identified as potent inhibitors of cathepsin L activity with IC50 values in the picomolar range. Lead molecules possessed selectivity over cathepsin B and other related human cathepsin proteases and did not exhibit inhibitory activity against viral proteases Mpro and PLpro.

DESIGN: We estimated the prevalence of palliative care need by analysing the proportion of deaths from defined chronic progressive illnesses. We described linear projections up to 2040 using national death registry data and official mortality forecasts. An expert consultation and subsequent online consensus survey generated recommendations on meeting future palliative care need. SETTING: Scotland, population of 5.4 million. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents in Scotland over 11 years (2007 to 2017). The consultation had 34 participants; 24 completed the consensus survey. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Estimates of past and future palliative care need in Scotland from 2007 up to 2040. Multimorbidity was operationalised as two or more registered causes of death from different disease groups (cancer, organ failure, dementia, other). Consultation and survey data were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: We project that by 2040, the number of people requiring palliative care will increase by at least 14%; and by 20% if we factor in multimorbidity. The number of people dying from multiple diseases associated with different disease groups is projected to increase from 27% of all deaths in 2017 to 43% by 2040. To address increased need and complexity, experts prioritised sustained investment in a national digital platform, roll-out of integrated electronic health and social care records; and approaches that remain person-centred. CONCLUSIONS: By 2040 more people in Scotland are projected to die with palliative care needs, and the complexity of need will increase markedly. Service delivery models must adapt to serve growing demand and complexity associated with dying from multiple diseases from different disease groups. We need sustained investment in secure, accessible, integrated and person-centred health and social care digital systems, to improve care coordination and optimise palliative care for people across care settings.","Finucane, Anne M; Bone, Anna E; Etkind, Simon; Carr, David; Meade, Richard; Munoz-Arroyo, Rosalia; Moine, Sébastien; Iyayi-Igbinovia, Aghimien; Evans, Catherine J; Higginson, Irene J; Murray, Scott A",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536318/,328

Effective mucosal immunity by vaccination should provide protection at this primary infection site. Our aim was to develop a new vaccination strategy that elicits a mucosal immune response. A new strain of Enterococcus faecium, a non pathogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with strong cell adhesion ability, was identified and used as a vaccine vector to deliver two model antigens. Specifically, sigma (σ) C protein of avian reovirus (ARV), a functional homolog of mammalian reovirus σ1 protein and responsible for M-cell targeting, was administered together with a subfragment of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Next, the effect of immunization route on the immune response was assessed by delivering the antigens via the LAB strain. Intranasal (IN) immunization induced stronger humoral responses than intragastic (IG) immunization. IN immunization produced antigen specific IgA both systemically and in the lungs. A higher IgA titer was induced by the LAB with ARV σC protein attached. Moreover, the serum of mice immunized with LAB displaying divalent antigens had much stronger immune reactivity against ARV σC protein compared to IBV-S1. Our results indicate that ARV σC protein delivered by LAB via the IN route elicits strong mucosal immunity. A needle-free delivery approach is a convenient and cost effective method of vaccine administration, especially for respiratory infections in economic animals. Furthermore, ARV σC, a strong immunogen of ARV, may be able to serve as an immunoenhancer for other vaccines, especially avian vaccines.","Lin, Kuan-Hsun; Hsu, Ai-Ping; Shien, Jui-Hung; Chang, Tien-Jye; Liao, Jiunn-Wang; Chen, Jeng-Rung; Lin, Chuen-Fu; Hsu, Wei-Li",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.04.043; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X12005749; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12005749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531554/,328

The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the effects of EPs 7630 on chemokine production in nasal mucosa and clinical parameters of patients with acute postviral rhinosinusitis (APRS). METHODS: Twenty-six (n = 26) APRS patients and 25 (n = 25) control subjects were included in this prospective study. We measured the concentrations of thirteen chemokines in nasal secretions of APRS patients and controls by flow cytometry. The patients with APRS were treated by EPs 7630 20 mg oral tablets, three times daily for 10 days. We compared the chemokine levels in nasal secretions, nasal symptoms and endoscopic findings in patients, before and after therapy. RESULTS: We found higher Total Symptom Score (TSS) and higher concentrations of MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-3α, ENA-78 and IL-8 in nasal secretions of APRS patients than in controls. After therapy by EPs 7630, we found significant improvement in all symptoms and endoscopic findings of APRS. The concentrations of MCP-1, IP-10 and MIP-1β were significantly increased and levels of MIP-1α, ENA-78, GROα and IL-8 significantly decreased in nasal fluid samples after therapy. No adverse effects were reported during the treatment.

To the best of our knowledge, there are few case reports of the same presentation. CASE PRESENTATION: An otherwise healthy 44-year-old white male from Egypt presented to the hospital with severe epigastric pain and over ten attacks of nonprojectile vomiting (first, gastric content, then bilious). Acute pancreatitis was suspected and confirmed by serum amylase, serum lipase, and computed tomography scan that showed mild diffuse enlargement of the pancreas. The patient did not have any risk factor for acute pancreatitis, and extensive investigations did not reveal a clear etiology. Given a potential occupational exposure, a nasopharyngeal swab for polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was done, which was positive despite the absence of the typical symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 such as fever and respiratory symptoms. The patient was managed conservatively. For pancreatitis, he was kept nil per os for 2 days and received intravenous lactated Ringer’s (10 ml per kg per hour), nalbuphine, alpha chymotrypsin, omeprazole, and cyclizine lactate. For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, he received a 5-day course of intravenous azithromycin (500 mg per day). He improved quickly and was discharged by the fifth day. We know that abdominal pain is not a rare symptom of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and we also know that elevated levels of serum amylase and lipase were reported in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 patients, especially those with severe symptoms. However, the association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and idiopathic acute pancreatitis is rare and has been reported only a few times. CONCLUSION: We believe further studies should be conducted to determine the extent of pancreatic involvement in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 patients and the possible causality between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and acute pancreatitis. We reviewed the literature regarding the association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and acute pancreatitis patients. Published data suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 possibly could be a risk factor for acute pancreatitis.","Eldaly, Abdullah S.; Fath, Ayman R.; Mashaly, Sarah M.; Elhadi, Muhammed",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503570/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-021-03026-7,328

Incarcerated individuals are a vulnerable population for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in prisons is crucial for curbing transmission both within correctional facilities and in the surrounding community. Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify transmission scenarios that could underly rapid, widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection among inmates in Marion Correctional Institution (MCI). Design. Publicly available data reported by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections (ODRC) was analyzed using mathematical and statistical models. Setting. We consider SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics among MCI inmates prior to and including April 16, 2020. Participants. This study uses de-identified, publicly available SARS-CoV-2 test result data for MCI inmates. Exposures. Inmates at MCI were considered exposed to potential infection with SARS-CoV-2. Main outcome and measures. Results from mass testing conducted on April 16, 2020 were analyzed together with time of first reported SARS-CoV-2 infection among MCI inmates. Results. Rapid, widespread infection of MCI inmates was reported, with nearly 80% of inmates infected within three weeks of first reported inmate case. These data are consistent with (i) a basic reproduction number greater than 14, together with a single initially infected inmate, (ii) an initial super-spreading event resulting in several hundred initially infected inmates, together with a basic reproduction number of approximately three, and (iii) earlier undetected circulation of virus among inmates prior to April. Conclusions and relevance. Mass testing data are consistent with extreme transmissibility, super-spreading events, or undetected circulation of virus among inmates.

681276,Willingness of Healthcare Students in Vietnam to Volunteer During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women have been classified as at risk for COVID-19 due to previous experience with influenza and other coronaviruses. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for the complications and death in women of childbearing age and pregnant women with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from the beginning of the epidemic in Mexico until May 25, 2020. All women of childbearing age (13-49 years) from the open national COVID-19 database from the Ministry of Health of Mexico were considered for eligibility. SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed or ruled out by RT-qPCR. We performed a bivariate and multivariable analysis to estimate mortality risk. RESULTS: Ten (2.2%) pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 died. Positive pregnant patients did not have a higher risk of complications (admission to the ICU, pneumonia, or requirement for mechanical ventilation) or death than the controls. In the multivariate analysis, only history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease remained independently associated with death in the positive cohort. Seven (0.6%) pregnant women with a negative test died. In bivariate analysis, pregnant patients with a positive test had a higher risk of death than pregnant patients with a negative test (relative risk (RR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-10.12), but no higher risk was found than in non-pregnant women with a positive test (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.44-1.53), and 60-day mortality did not significantly differ among pregnant patients with or without a positive test (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.12-1.30) or between COVID-19-positive patients who were pregnant or not pregnant (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.35-1.56). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant patients do not have a greater risk of complications or death from COVID-19 than non-pregnant patients. The presence of diabetes mellitus and chronic disease increases the risk of death in women of childbearing age, but not specifically in pregnant patients.","Ríos-Silva, Mónica; Murillo-Zamora, Efrén; Mendoza-Cano, Oliver; Trujillo, Xóchitl; Huerta, Miguel",Journal of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110595/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.020512,328
682108,Understanding the Covid-19 pandemic through the lens of population health science,2020-07-15,"The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was notable for a record-setting 30 named storms while, contemporaneously, the COVID-19 pandemic was circumnavigating the globe. The active spread of COVID-19 complicated disaster preparedness and response actions to safeguard coastal and island populations from hurricane hazards. Major hurricanes Eta and Iota, the most powerful storms of the 2020 Atlantic season, made November landfalls just two weeks apart, both coming ashore along the Miskito Coast in Nicaragua's North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region. Eta and Iota bore the hallmarks of climate-driven storms, including rapid intensification, high peak wind speeds, and decelerating forward motion prior to landfall. Hurricane warning systems, combined with timely evacuation and sheltering procedures, minimized loss of life during hurricane impact. Yet these protective actions potentially elevated risks for COVID-19 transmission for citizens sharing congregate shelters during the storms and for survivors who were displaced post-impact due to severe damage to their homes and communities. International border closures and travel restrictions that were in force to slow the spread of COVID-19 diminished the scope, timeliness, and effectiveness of the humanitarian response for survivors of Eta and Iota. Taken together, the extreme impacts from hurricanes Eta and Iota, compounded by the ubiquitous threat of COVID-19 transmission, and the impediments to international humanitarian response associated with movement restrictions during the pandemic, acted to exacerbate harms to population health for the citizens of Nicaragua.","Shultz, Director James M.; Berg, Senior Fellow Ryan C.; Kossin, James P.; Burkle Jr, Professor Senior Fellow and Scientist Frederick; Maggioni, Alessandra; Escobar, Victoria A.

To facilitate speedy and smooth recovery during this time period, an added responsibility is placed upon rehabilitation center counselors, staff and management. In this paper we expose the role that psychiatric rehabilitation plays during the COVID-19 crisis. Since COVID-19 pandemic has remarkably raised mental health concerns, one of the high risks and possibly neglected groups includes individuals undergoing mental health rehabilitation, the impact on which can be significant as compared to the rest of the population. In order to ensure that individuals on the road to recovery are not alone and forgotten during the times of coronavirus crisis they should be provided with adequate resources, such as online meetings and group therapy sessions, assessment, treatment and support by telephone and video consultation and getting the medications they need to recover. This article highlights how the coronavirus pandemic, that has hit hard the health care and all categories of patients affected by mental disorders, is likely to be particularly dramatic for mental health rehabilitation centers. Indeed, the COVID-19 crisis has severely tested the health systems worldwide, reducing sometimes the quality and quantity of care offered to psychiatric patients both hospitalized and not in rehabilitation centers. The main goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance, often underestimated, of mental health rehabilitation centers, on which one should invest for the both future of psychological and psychiatric rehabilitation and the current crisis as well.","Aamir, Alifiya; Awan, Sana; de Filippis, Renato; Diwan, Mufaddal Najmuddin; Ullah, Irfan",J Psychosoc Rehabil Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40737-020-00203-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106766/,328

683813,Personal and social changes in the time of COVID-19,2021-03-09,"Introduction: Latinas are among the groups most affected by diabetes health disparities, yet they often benefit less from diabetes interventions even when these are culturally adapted. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore readiness of Latinas enrolled in a diabetes prevention program to adopt recommended preventive behaviors, and to identify factors associated with the adoption and maintenance of these recommended lifestyle changes. Insights gained will be used to inform future efforts at reducing diabetes disparities and the burden of chronic diseases among Latinas. Methods: Nine focus group discussions (FGDs) and 3 key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted after the completion of a culturally adapted diabetes prevention program led by Latino community health workers. A grounded theory approach by Charmaz informed by the transtheoretical model guided the questions. Discussions and interviews were audio-taped with participants’ permission, transcribed, coded, and themed. Results: Forty low-income Latinas contributed to FGDs and KIIs. Baseline readiness to engage in new behaviors varied. Negative personal and family health events and physician referral impacted most readiness to enroll and to adopt preventive behaviors. Built environment, financial constraints, and threat of social alienation constituted major barriers to behavior adoption and maintenance, while physician involvement, awareness of diabetes complications, and social support partially mitigated these impediments. Conclusions: Our results suggest that timing of enrollment, physician-patient dynamics, and the emotional personal/family cost of behavior modification should all be considered when planning diabetes prevention programs for low-income Latinas. Besides appropriately timing referrals to accessible culturally informed prevention programs, health educators and health care providers should be aware of the potentially negative impact of behavior modification on family dynamics and be prepared to address resulting repercussions. Future research on Latinas should also include and report data on physician involvement, family context, and social determinants of health for more consistent program comparisons.","Joachim-Célestin, Maud; Gamboa-Maldonado, Thelma; Dos Santos, Hildemar; Montgomery, Susanne B.",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720945423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32755275/,328
683902,Examining risk factors related to digital learning and social isolation: Youth visual acuity in COVID-19 pandemic,2021-08-21,"Introduction: Adult kidney transplant (KT) recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are susceptible to a more serious COVID-19 disease compared to immunocompetent patients, including more severe pneumonia, longer duration of illness and worse patient prognosis. Moreover, a high risk of allograft damage, possibly leading to allograft loss, has been reported. In contrast, data regarding the clinical course of infected pediatric KT recipients are scarce. Herein, we describe the clinical features, management and outcome of 2 deceased-donor KT pediatric recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, occurred during early and late post-transplant period. Method(s): The two cases concerned a 13-year-old boy with Senior-Loken syndrome and an 18-year-old girl, with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, who received KT 3 months and 7 years before SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively. The boy had received induction therapy with basiliximab, followed by triple maintenance therapy, including oral cyclosporine (70 mg twice per day), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (500 mg twice per day) and daily methylprednisolone (10 mg), while the girl's current immunosuppressive treatment consisted in tacrolimus (1.5 mg twice per day), MMF (750 mg twice per day) and methylprednisolone (8 mg) every other day. Allograft function was stable in both patients. Result(s): Close contact with confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in both patients. The boy was asymptomatic, while the girl presented sore throat, tiredness and fever with maximum temperature 38.6 C, which lasted for 48 hours. Chest X-ray was normal in both patients. Initial laboratory findings were common in both patients and included mild lymphocytopenia (920/muL and 868/muL respectively), normal C-reactive protein and liver enzyme levels, and stable serum creatinine and urea levels. MMF was discontinued, while steroid dose was increased by twice in both patients. Due to fever, a 3-day course of azithromycin was administered to the female patient. Normalization of total lymphocyte count permitting the progressive re-initialization of MMF and reduction of steroid dose was observed at 14th and 5th day of the disease respectively. Graft function remained stable in both patients. Conclusion(s): The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection during both early and late post-transplant period seems favorable in pediatric KT recipients. Immunosuppression interruption may be beneficial for preventing acute disease complications. Optimal treatment strategies need to be established.

This study aimed to explore the experience and opinions of adults, with celiac disease, toward face-to-face clinic appointments and alternatives, such as telehealth. Semistructured qualitative interviews with 37 patients were undertaken (75% White Caucasians, 25% South Asians; 29 patients were not adhering to the gluten-free diet). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by NVivo. Frequently reported issues with face-to-face appointments included travel and car parking costs, needing to take time off work, and frequent changes to appointment time. In addition, South Asian patients highlighted issues with linguistics barriers. Telephone consultations were considered acceptable and practical by the majority of patients based on ease and convenience. Online video consultations were favored by just 9 patients, however it is acknowledged that since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a greater exposure to this type of technology.

684837,Socio-Educational Support Deficits in the Emancipation of Protected Youth in Spain,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected people’s mental health resulting in severe psychological consequences. One of the leading causes of long-term disability worldwide is aphasia. The language changes experienced by a person with aphasia (PWA) often have a sudden and long-lasting negative impact on social interaction, quality of life, and emotional wellbeing. The main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the different psychosocial dimensions which affect PWA. METHODS: This retrospective study included 73 PWA and 81 elderly matched controls. All patients were in the chronic phase. They were all discharged from rehabilitation services, which left them with different degrees of language deficits (i.e., severe vs. mild vs. moderate). All participants were administered the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) through an online survey. PWA also took part in the stroke and aphasia quality of life scale questionnaire (SAQOL-39). RESULTS: Although the comparison between two different time points [one month before (T0) and one month after the lockdown (T1)] led to a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms in both groups (PWA vs. control), lower rates of depression and anxiety were found in PWA compared to the healthy group. Significant deterioration was also present in PWA in the communication and psychosocial scales of the SAQOL-39 test, which correlated with the observed changes in the psychological domains. Interestingly, the results were not significantly influenced by the degree of aphasia severity. Similarly, in both groups, none of the demographic variables (gender, age, and educational level) significantly affected the scores in the different subscales. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence which, at first glance, seems to suggest that PWA have been partially spared from the impact of COVID-19, actually masks a dramatic situation that has always characterized this population. Indeed, given that PWA already live in a state of social isolation and emotional instability, these conditions might have, paradoxically, limited the effects of the coronavirus. However, as our results showed a deterioration in the emotional state and communication skills of our patients, possible solutions are discussed in order to prevent further decline of their cognitive abilities.","Pisano, Francesca; Giachero, Alberto; Rugiero, Cristian; Calati, Melanie; Marangolo, Paola",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.564717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33329196/,328

The prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults is underestimated. Meteorological variations and air pollution are likely to play a role in these infections. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to determine the number of emergency visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and to evaluate the association between ILI/SARI, RVI prevalence, and meteorological factors/air pollution, in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, from November 2008 to October 2010. METHODS: Eleven thousand nine hundred and fifty-three hospitalizations (adults and children) for respiratory symptoms were correlated with meteorological parameters and air pollutants. In a subset of adults, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and analyzed through IFI test. The data were analyzed using time-series analysis. RESULTS: Influenza-like illness and SARI were diagnosed in 3698 (30·9%) and 2063 (17·7%) patients, respectively. Thirty-seven (9·0%) samples were positive by IFI and 93 of 410 (22·7%) were IFI and/or PCR positive. In a multivariate logistic regression model, IFI positivity was statistically associated with absolute humidity, use of air conditioning, and presence of mold in home. Sunshine duration was significantly associated with the frequency of ILI cases. For SARI cases, the variables mean temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity, and mean concentration of pollutants were singnificant. CONCLUSIONS: At least 22% of infections in adult patients admitted to ER with respiratory complaints were caused by RVI. The correlations among meteorological variables, air pollution, ILI/SARI cases, and respiratory viruses demonstrated the relevance of climate factors as significant underlying contributors to the prevalence of RVI.","Silva, Denise R; Viana, Vinícius P; Müller, Alice M; Livi, Fernando P; Dalcin, Paulo de Tarso R",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24034701/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12158,328
685922,Is Exposure to Epidemic Associated with Older Adults’ Health Behavior? Evidence from China’s 2002-2004 SARS Outbreak,2020-08-22,"The exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) and its constituents is an important factor to be considered when evaluating their potential health risk. Transition metals found in PM are known to contribute significantly to the exacerbation of respiratory ailments. Exposure to these constituents results in the induction of oxidative stress in the bronchial epithelium, thus promoting the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Therefore, it is important to know the contributions of PM(2.5) constituents to further investigate their relationship with toxic responses and associated health risks. PM(2.5) samples from three rural (Humacao, Guayama, and Guayanilla) and two urban (more populated) sites (Bayamón and Ponce) from Puerto Rico were analyzed for various inorganic constituents. A total of 59 trace elements were analyzed, of which eight were considered with the greatest toxic potential. The highest annual average concentration of PM(2.5) was reported at the urban site of Ponce (5.82 ± 1.40 μg m(−3)), while Bayamón’s average concentration was not as high (4.69 ± 1.30 μg m(−3)) compared to concentrations at the rural sites Humacao, Guayama, and Guayanilla (4.33 ± 1.20 μg m(−3), 4.93 ± 1.50 μg m(−3), and 4.88 ± 1.20 μg m(−3) respectively. The concentration at the Ponce site exhibited the highest summer value (7.57 μg m(−3)) compared to that of all the rural sites (~ 6.40 μg m(−3)). The lowest summer PM(2.5) values were obtained at the Humacao site with an average of 5.76 μg m(−3). Average Cu and Zn concentrations were 3- and 2-fold higher at the urban sites (0.68 ng m(−3) and 6.74 ng m(−3) respectively) compared to the rural sites (0.17 ng m(−3) and 4.11 ng m(−3)). Relative toxicity of inorganic PM extract indicates Bayamón (urban) and Guayama with similar low LC(50) followed by Humacao, Guayanilla, and finally Ponce (urban) with the highest LC(50). Of the eight potential toxic metals considered, only Fe was found to be higher at the rural sites. To our understanding, there are different sources of emission for these metals which potentially indicate main anthropogenic sources, together with the trade winds adding periodically volcanic and African Dust Storm particulates that affect Puerto Rico. These results are the first of their kind to be reported in Puerto Rico.","Jirau-Colón, Héctor; Toro-Heredia, Jannette; Layuno, Josué; Calderon, Enrique Dionisio; Gioda, Adriana; Jiménez-Vélez, Braulio D.",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389579/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11673-4,328

The actions to face the pandemic began with preventive measures in the community, continued in the isolation centers and ended again in the community with actions of surveillance and follow up of recovered patients. Following the principle of territoriality, laboratories of molecular diagnosis were created in the provinces that did not have it.

There exists no disease-specific quality-of-life (QOL) measure for PNH. Its QOL effects resemble those of hematologic cancers, which supports the use of cancer-specific QOL measures in PNH clinical trials. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 has published norms for many European and North American countries, but not for Asian countries. We investigated differences by Asian ethnicity in scores and item function on the EORTC QLQ-C30. METHODS: This secondary analysis focused on two non-inferiority PNH trials (301 and 302) comparing eculizumab and ravulizumab (n = 441). Analysis of covariance examined the main effect of Asian ethnicity on baseline EORTC QLQ-C30 scores, after adjusting for propensity scores encompassing trial, demographic and clinical factors. Mixed modeling of longitudinal data compared subscale scores in Asian vs. non-Asian patients, after propensity adjustment. Differential item function (DIF) was examined using ordinal regression models at baseline and longitudinally, to predict item score from total score, ethnicity, and their interaction to test for uniform DIF (significant main effect for Asian) and non-uniform DIF (significant Asian-by-total-score interaction). RESULTS: Of the 15 baseline domains, Asian patients scored slightly better on role and emotional functioning and slightly worse on constipation and diarrhea (0.22 < Cohen's d < 0.36). In longitudinal models, Asians reported slightly higher appetite loss, diarrhea, and financial difficulties than non-Asians (R2 increment < 0.0005). There was negligible uniform and non-uniform DIF, i.e., R2 0 to 0.018, far below Zumbo's (1999) criterion of 0.13. On average there were larger differences from norms for Asians (mean = 0.05, sd = 0.44) than non-Asians (mean = -0.07, sd = 0.36), but the size and direction of the differences varied considerably by domain, age, and gender. CONCLUSION: When compared to norms, Asian patients showed no systematic biases. DIF results supported this finding. We conclude that Asian ethnicity does not impact interpretation of EORTC QLQ-C30 scores.","Schwartz, Carolyn E; Stark, Roland B; Borowiec, Katrina; Myren, Karl-Johan",Health Qual Life Outcomes,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-021-01860-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583705/,328
687480,"Survey of Telehealth Adoption by Neuro-ophthalmologists During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Benefits, Barriers, and Utility",2020-07-07,"Atomic structures of several proteins from the coronavirus family are still partial or unavailable. A possible reason for this gap is the instability of these proteins outside of the cellular context, thereby prompting the use of in-cell approaches. In situ cross-linking and mass spectrometry (in situ CLMS) can provide information on the structures of such proteins as they occur in the intact cell. Here, we applied targeted in situ CLMS to structurally probe Nsp1, Nsp2, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and obtained cross-link sets with an average density of one cross-link per 20 residues. We then employed integrative modeling that computationally combined the cross-linking data with domain structures to determine full-length atomic models. For the Nsp2, the cross-links report on a complex topology with long-range interactions. Integrative modeling with structural prediction of individual domains by the AlphaFold2 system allowed us to generate a single consistent all-atom model of the full-length Nsp2. The model reveals three putative metal binding sites and suggests a role for Nsp2 in zinc regulation within the replication–transcription complex. For the N protein, we identified multiple intra- and interdomain cross-links. Our integrative model of the N dimer demonstrates that it can accommodate three single RNA strands simultaneously, both stereochemically and electrostatically. For the Nsp1, cross-links with the 40S ribosome were highly consistent with recent cryogenic electron microscopy structures. These results highlight the importance of cellular context for the structural probing of recalcitrant proteins and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted in situ CLMS and integrative modeling.","Slavin, Moriya; Zamel, Joanna; Zohar, Keren; Eliyahu, Tsiona; Braitbard, Merav; Brielle, Esther; Baraz, Leah; Stolovich-Rain, Miri; Friedman, Ahuva; Wolf, Dana G.; Rouvinski, Alexander; Linial, Michal; Schneidman-Duhovny, Dina; Kalisman, Nir",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373319/; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2103554118,328

A reduction in the degree and nature of such cellular responses is expected following recovery. We aimed to investigate the immune responses in moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients and recovered patients. METHODS: Moderate COVID‐19 patients (n = 34) at Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, and COVID‐19 recovered patients (n = 15) from the mild disease who were considered for convalescent plasma (COPLA) donation at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, New Delhi and healthy individuals (n = 10), were recruited. We have assessed 21 plasma cytokines using cytokine bead array, performed proteomics on serum proteins, and analyzed immune cells using a detailed multicolor flow cytometry. RESULTS: A significant increase in inflammatory markers such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1‐α, monocyte chemotactic protein‐1, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, vascular endothelial growth factor‐A, and Leptin was observed in the moderate patients. Nonsurvivors additionally showed increased interleukin (IL)‐6 levels. Consistently, the proteomics analysis showed the signatures of cytokine production and interferon‐γ response, and increased level of acute‐phase protein SAA1 in the serum of COVID‐19 patients. Despite the sustained expression of MIPs, the recovered COPLA donors showed a surge in MCSF and IL‐18 levels. Both the groups had increased CCR2, CX3CR1 positive monocytes, low CD8(+) T cells, A proliferation‐inducing ligand, and B‐cell activating factor receptor(+) B cells compared with healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have recovered and considered for COPLA donations still have compromised immunity with sustained expression of inflammatory monocytes and activated T cells.","Singh, Ravinder; Hemati, Hamed; Bajpai, Meenu; Yadav, Pushpa; Maheshwari, Ashish; Kumar, Suresh; Agrawal, Sonal; Sevak, Jayesh Kumar; Islam, Mojahidul; Mars, Jaswinder Singh; Sarin, Shiv K; Trehanpati, Nirupama",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34363351/,328

690694,Looking inside the ‘black box’ of vaccine hesitancy: unlocking the effect of psychological attitudes and beliefs on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and implications for public health communication,2021-03-08,"The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile smoking cessation intervention in Puerto Rico. This was a single-arm pilot study with 26 smokers in Puerto Rico who were enrolled in Decídetexto, a mobile smoking cessation intervention. Decídetexto incorporates three integrated components: (1) a tablet-based software that collects smoking-related information to develop an individualized quit plan, (2) a 24-week text messaging counseling program with interactive capabilities, and (3) pharmacotherapy support. Outcome measures included self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at Months 3 and 6, pharmacotherapy adherence, satisfaction with the intervention, and changes in self-efficacy. The average age of the participants was 46.8 years (SD 12.7), half of them (53.8%) were female. Most participants (92.3%) smoked daily and half of them (53.8%) used menthol cigarettes. All participants requested nicotine patches at baseline. However, only 13.0% of participants used the patch >75% of days. At Month 3, 10 participants (38.4%) self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (88.5% follow-up rate). At Month 6, 16 participants (61.5%) self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (76.9% follow-up rate). Most participants (90%, 18/20) reported being satisfied/extremely satisfied with the intervention at Month 6. Self-efficacy mean scores significantly increased from 40.4 (SD 12.1) at baseline to 57.9 (SD 11.3) at Month 3 (p < 0.01). The study suggests that Decídetexto holds promise for further testing among Puerto Rican smokers.","Cartujano-Barrera, Francisco; Peña-Vargas, Cristina I.; Arana-Chicas, Evelyn; Pérez-Ramos, José G.; Mattei, Josiemer; Hurtado-de-Mendoza, Alejandra; Costas-Muñiz, Rosario; Jiménez, Julio; Cupertino, Ana Paula; Castro, Eida M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33546156/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041379,328
690724,Attitude of Medical Students About Their Role and Social Accountability in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-01,"A taxonomic review of the waspfish genus Neocentropogon Matsubara 1943 (Tetrarogidae), diagnosed by the following combination of characters: body sparsely covered with small embedded cycloid scales, palatine teeth present, XIII–XVI dorsal-fin spines, the first dorsal fin originating above the orbit, five pelvic-fin soft rays, and membrane of lower four pectoral-fin rays deeply incised, resulted in the recognition of six species: Neocentropogon aeglefinus (Weber 1913), Neocentropogon affinis (Lloyd 1909a), Neocentropogon japonicus Matsubara 1943, Neocentropogon mesedai Klausewitz 1985, Neocentropogon profundus (Smith 1958), and Neocentropogon trimaculatus Chan 1966. Neocentropogon trimaculatus (anti-tropically distributed in East Asia and Australia) can be distinguished from its congeners by the presence of three dark blotches on the body (vs. absent or a single blotch); N. affinis (eastern Indian Ocean) and N. aeglefinus (Philippines to Australia) differ from other congeners in having a black blotch behind the opercle (vs. blotch absent), with the former distinguishable from the latter by dorsal rows of dark spots on the body, and pectoral and caudal fins (vs. spots absent), and 79–96 scale rows in the longitudinal series (vs. 94–137); N. mesedai (Red Sea) differs from N. profundus (southwestern Indian Ocean) and N. japonicus (northwestern Pacific Ocean) in having the lowermost four pectoral-fin rays elongated and XIII (vs. XIV–XVI) dorsal-fin spines, the latter species being separated by the symphyseal knob condition (unremarkable, N. profundus vs. pronounced, N. japonicus), dark dorsal spots on the body (vs. absent), and 5 anal-fin soft rays (vs. 6 or 7). Keys to the genera of Tetrarogidae and species of Neocentropogon are given, including taxonomic status of Vespicula Jordan and Richardson 1910 and Pseudovespicula Mandrytsa 2001.","Chungthanawong, Sirikanya; Motomura, Hiroyuki",Ichthyol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33642897/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10228-020-00796-w,328
