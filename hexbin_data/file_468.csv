Air samples were collected, using six-stage Andersen sampler from five different public buildings in one large Chinese community. The mean indoor concentrations of the total and respirable airborne S. aureus were 72 and 50 CFU/m(3) in the general hospital, 72 and 49 CFU/m(3) in the kindergarten, 76 and 52 CFU/m(3) in the hotel, 84 and 57 CFU/m(3) in the movie theater, and 55 and 40 CFU/m(3) in the university classroom. Respirable S. aureus amounted to approximately 57–73 % of the total S. aureus concentrations. Mean total and respirable concentrations of airborne MRSA were 32 and 20 CFU/m(3) in the general hospital, 20 and 13 CFU/m(3) in the kindergarten, 23 and 16 CFU/m(3) in the hotel, 33 and 20 CFU/m(3) in the movie theater, and 24 and 17 CFU/m(3) in the university classroom. Respirable MRSA amounted to approximately 61–72 % of the total MRSA concentrations. The ratios of indoor and outdoor concentration for airborne S. aureus and MRSA were more than 1.0 in all the investigated public buildings. The size distribution results showed relatively high collection rates on stage 4 (2.1–3.3 μm) for both airborne culturable S. aureus and MRSA regardless of the type of public buildings.","Li, Xiaoxia; Qiu, Yuyu; Yu, Ailian; Shi, Weifeng; Chen, Guomin; Zhang, Zhong; Liu, Dunjiang",Aerobiologia (Bologna),468,5

HIV-1 gp120 binding proteins of the CD4-negative and Gal-C-negative, non-productively infectable human glioblastoma cell line D54 were purified by affinity chromatography over a gp120-conjugated sepharose column and identified by peptide microsequencing. The binding capacity and specificity of this column was controlled using extracts of CD4-positive cells. Two of seven prominent proteins eluted from the gp120 affinity column specifically bound gp120 in Western blot overlay experiments and were identified by subsequent immunoblotting and microsequencing as ezrin and moesin, members of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family of cellular structural membrane proteins. Antibodies to ezrin and moesin specifically recognized the eluted gp120 binding proteins confirming their identification. Ezrin and moesin are structural proteins binding to the cellular membrane and to several cytoskeletal and transmembrane proteins. Our results suggest that ezrin and moesin might play a role as gp160/gp120 binding proteins during the uptake, the assembly or the budding of HIV.","Hecker, Claudia; Weise, Christoph; Schneider-Schaulies, Jürgen; Holmes, Harvey C; ter Meulen, Volker",Virus Res,468,1

The goal of the human MHC project is to predict the binding strength of any given peptide/MHC complex. This prediction allows the design of peptide‐based vaccines. The prediction requires representative binding data from MHC alleles from all the nine HLA supertypes. Here, we describe the genetic construction, protein production and purification as well as the establishment‐binding assays for two recombinant MHC supertype alleles, HLA‐B*1501 and HLA‐B*5801. Methods: Using the Quikchange Multisite Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), codon‐optimized genes encoding HLA‐B*1501 and HLA‐B*5801 are created. The two MHC I molecules are fermented and purified by ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The binding (KD) of natural T‐cell epitopes, as well as predicted peptide ligands, is described by radioactive immunoassays (RIAs) and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The MHC molecules are biotinylated during expression. Results: The expression of MHC I resulted in multiple disulfide bond isomers, which are separated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and used in subsequent binding studies resulting in the determination of KD for various peptide ligands ranging from strong binders (KD < 50 nM) to low binders (KD > 5 µM). Tetramerization is visualized by SDS‐PAGE. Conclusion: An effective method for the production of highly pure MHC I molecules has been applied to HLA‐B*1501 and HLA‐B*5801, and RIA and ELISA binding assays for those alleles have been established, showing the binding of various peptide ligands to the MHC I molecules.","Røder, G.; Lamberth, K.; Buus, S.",Scand J Immunol,468,1

To bridge this gap, telementoring has emerged. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of telementoring compared with on-site mentoring. METHODS A search was done up to March 2015. Studies were included if they used telementoring between surgeons during a clinical encounter and if they compared on-site mentoring and telementoring. RESULTS A total of 11 studies were included. All reported no difference in complication rates, and 9 (82%) reported similar operative times; 4 (36%) reported technical issues, which was 3% of the total number of cases in the 11 studies. No study reported on higher levels of evidence for effectiveness of telementoring as an educational intervention. CONCLUSION Studies reported that telementoring is associated with similar complication rates and operative times compared with on-site mentoring. However, the level of evidence to support the effectiveness of telementoring as a training tool is limited. There is a need for studies that provide evidence for the equivalence of the effectiveness of telementoring as an educational intervention in comparison with on-site mentoring.","Bilgic, Elif; Turkdogan, Sena; Watanabe, Yusuke; Madani, Amin; Landry, Tara; Lavigne, Daniel; Feldman, Liane S; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical innovation,468,7

This paper reports on responses of zirconia materials with distinct microstructures to nanoindentation associated with diamond machining using a Berkovich diamond indenter. In-situ nanoindentation was performed in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and in-process filmed to record small contact events. Indentation morphology was SEM-mapped at high-magnifications. Although both pre-sintered porous and sintered dense zirconia materials mechanically revealed the quasi-plastic behavior in indentation, there were distinct responses of the two materials to quasi-plasticity at the microstructural level. For pre-sintered porous zirconia, the quasi-plasticity was attributed to shear faults resulting from breaking pore networks as microstructurally discrete interfaces, to lead to compression, fragmentation, pulverization and microcracking of zirconia crystals in indentation imprints. In contrast, sintered dense zirconia had shear band-induced quasi-plastic deformation, accompanied with localized tensile microfracture. A material index associated with the mechanical properties ranked the lower quasi-plasticity for pre-sintered porous zirconia than its sintered dense state, predicting more machining-induced damage in the former than the latter. Significantly higher indentation imprint volumes induced in indented pre-sintered porous zirconia than sintered dense state previses higher machining efficiency for the former than the latter. The microstructure-dependent indentation mechanisms provide the fundamental knowledge into micromechanics of abrasive machining of zirconia materials and may lead to a new microstructural design for zirconia materials to achieve a balanced machining efficiency and damage control.","Juri, Afifah Z; Basak, Animesh K; Yin, Ling",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,468,7

The glycans attached to the two glycoproteins are N-linked and are complex and high mannose types, respectively. Here, we show that treatment with the N-linked glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin in YHV-infected black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) resulted in less severe yellow head disease and reduced mortality when compared with untreated control shrimp. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis also revealed lower YHV copy numbers in the haemolymph of treated than control shrimp. This was concurrent with less intense immuno-reactions in tissues of treated versus untreated shrimp using mAbs against all three YHV structural proteins. In addition, transmission electron microscopy of lymphoid organ tissue of the treated and untreated shrimp [eight collected at 36 h and eight at 48 h post-infection (p.i.)] revealed only unenveloped nucleocapsids in all but one of the treated shrimp (collected at 48 h p.i.). By contrast, all the untreated shrimp showed a mixture of many unenveloped and enveloped virions. These results were supported by purification of YHV from the cell-free haemolymph of treated and untreated shrimp followed by YHV structural protein analysis by SDS-PAGE. It revealed three expected structural protein bands (116, 64 and 20 kDa) from the untreated shrimp but no structural protein bands from the tunicamycin-treated shrimp (confirmed by Western blot analysis). Overall, the results indicated that blocking glycosylation with tunicamycin inhibited the formation of mature YHV virions and their subsequent release into shrimp haemolymph, reducing the severity of disease.","Soowannayan, Chumporn; Chanarpakorn, Nhuengtida; Phanthura, Mongkhol; Deekhlai, Nattawoot; Kunasol, Chanon; Sriurairatana, Siriporn",The Journal of general virology,468,12

Using these data and virus characteristics, we developed and evaluated linear and nonlinear models for predicting inactivation rate constants. Multiple linear regressions performed best for predicting the inactivation kinetics of (+) ssRNA and dsDNA viruses, with cross-validated root mean squared relative prediction errors similar to those associated with experimental rate constants. We tested the models by predicting and measuring inactivation rate constants of a (+) ssRNA mouse coronavirus and a dsDNA marine bacteriophage; the predicted rate constants were within 7% and 71% of the experimental rate constants, respectively, indicating that the prediction was more accurate for the (+) ssRNA virus than the dsDNA virus.

Although ultrasound is identified as a core competency in intensive care unit (ICU) training, there remains significant variability and inconsistencies in the delivery of ultrasound training. The goal of this narrative review is to explore areas of consensus and highlight areas where consensus is lacking to bring attention to future directions of ultrasound training in critical care medicine. RECENT FINDINGS There exists considerable variation in competencies identified as basic for CCUS. Recent efforts by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine serve as the most up to date iteration however implementation is still limited by regional expertise and practice patterns. Major barriers to ultrasound training in the ICU include a lack of available experts for bedside teaching and a lack of familiarity with new technology. SUMMARY Though international uptake of CCUS has made many gains in the past 20 years, further adoption of technology will be required to overcome the traditional barriers of CCUS training. Although the availability and time constraints of experts will remain a limitation even with wireless capabilities, the ability to expand beyond the physical constraints of an ultrasound machine will vastly benefit efforts to standardize training and improve access to knowledge.","Cheng, Jason; Arntfield, Robert",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,468,19

During the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle, GBF1 performs a critical function at the onset of genome replication but is dispensable when the replication is established. To better understand how GBF1 regulates HCV infection, we have looked for interactions between GBF1 and HCV proteins. NS3 was found to interact with GBF1 in yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays and to interfere with GBF1 function and alter GBF1 intracellular localization in cells expressing NS3. The interaction was mapped to the Sec7 domain of GBF1 and the protease domain of NS3. A reverse yeast two-hybrid screen to identify mutations altering NS3-GBF1 interaction yielded an NS3 mutant (N77D, Con1 strain) that is nonreplicative despite conserved protease activity and does not interact with GBF1. The mutated residue is exposed at the surface of NS3, suggesting it is part of the domain of NS3 that interacts with GBF1. The corresponding mutation in strain JFH-1 (S77D) produces a similar phenotype. Our results provide evidence for an interaction between NS3 and GBF1 and suggest that an alteration of this interaction is detrimental to HCV genome replication.IMPORTANCE Single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses rely to a significant extent on host factors to achieve the replication of their genome. GBF1 is such a cellular protein that is required for the replication of several RNA viruses, but its mechanism of action during viral infections is not yet defined. In this study, we investigated potential interactions that GBF1 might engage in with proteins of HCV, a GBF1-dependent virus. We found that GBF1 interacts with NS3, a nonstructural protein involved in HCV genome replication, and our results suggest that this interaction is important for GBF1 function during HCV replication. Interestingly, GBF1 interaction with HCV appears different from its interaction with enteroviruses, another group of GBF1-dependent RNA viruses, in keeping with the fact that HCV and enteroviruses use different functions of GBF1.","Lebsir, Nadjet; Goueslain, Lucie; Farhat, Rayan; Callens, Nathalie; Dubuisson, Jean; Jackson, Catherine L; Rouillé, Yves",Journal of virology,468,19

Although interim analyses of clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, a serious but rare adverse event, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), has been reported following COVID-19 vaccination. AREAS COVERED This review, using data from both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed studies, aimed to provide updated information about the critical issue of COVID-19 vaccine-related TTS. EXPERT OPINION : The exact epidemiological characteristics and possible pathogenesis of this adverse event remain unclear. Most cases of TTS developed in women within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccine on the receipt of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines. In countries with mass vaccination against COVID-19, clinicians should be aware of the relevant clinical features of this rare adverse event and perform related laboratory and imaging studies for early diagnosis. Non-heparin anticoagulants, such as fondaparinux, argatroban, or a direct oral anticoagulant (e.g., apixaban or rivaroxaban) and intravenous immunoglobulins are recommended for the treatment of TTS. However, further studies are required to explore the underlying mechanisms of this rare clinical entity.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Ko, Wen-Chien; Chen, Chih-Jung; Chen, Po-Yen; Huang, Yhu-Chering; Lee, Ping-Ing; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Expert review of vaccines,468,19

The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the structure and format of any type of exercise-based, multimodal rehabilitation programs used in individuals with cancer and the evidence base for their real-world effectiveness on metrics of physical (e.g., cardiorespiratory fitness, blood pressure) and psychological (e.g., health-related quality of life) health. Very few of the 33 included exercise-based, multimodal rehabilitation programs employed intervention components, education topics, and program support staff that were multi-disciplinary or cancer-specific. In particular, a greater emphasis on nutrition care, and the evaluation and management of psychosocial distress and CVD risk factors, with cancer-specific adaptations, would broaden and maximize the holistic health benefits of exercise-based rehabilitation. Despite these opportunities for improvement, exercise-based, multimodal rehabilitation programs utilized under real-world settings in individuals with cancer produced clinically meaningful and large effect sizes for cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak, ±2.9 mL/kg/min, 95% CI = 2.6 to 3.3) and 6-minute walk distance (+47 meters, 95% CI = 23 to 71), and medium effect sizes for various measures of cancer-specific, health-related quality of life. However, there were no changes to blood pressure, body mass index, or lung function. Overall, these findings suggest that exercise-based, multimodal rehabilitation is a real-world therapy that improves physical and psychological health among individuals with cancer, but the holistic health benefits of this intervention would likely be enhanced by addressing nutrition, psychosocial concerns, and risk factor management through education and counselling with consideration of the needs of an individual with cancer.","Rickard, Julia N; Eswaran, Arun; Small, Stephanie D; Bonsignore, Alis; Pakosh, Maureen; Oh, Paul; Kirkham, Amy A",Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,468,25

Although spinal fusion with maximum possible resection of the cele might be indicated in these special cases, reports describing operative procedures are lacking. CLINICAL PRESENTATION We present a young woman with NF1 and lower back pain due to lumbar anterior MC, extensive osteolysis, and deformation of the lumbar spine. After Harrington spondylodesis from T12 to S1 in 1989, she developed lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and transcutaneous migration of the spondylodesis. Thus the left pole of the spondylodesis was shortened below the level of L5 in 2005. Years later, the patient presented with lower back pain and wound infection. Imaging revealed the MC and avulsion of the right S1 screw with lumbosacral pseudarthrosis and spondyloptosis, and transcutaneous migration of the right spondylodesis pole. Three-stage surgery was indicated with explantation of the Harrington system in the first step and posterior fusion from T10 to S2 in the second step. Finally, vertebral resection, gathering of the cele, and implantation of a customized titanium cage was achieved through an anterior transabdominal approach. Postoperatively, the patient reported sufficient reduction of lower back pain. CONCLUSIONS Lumbar anterior MC is rare in patients with NF1 and may cause spinal instability. When surgery is indicated, long-range spinal fusion and reduction of the cele should be considered. Surgery may be challenging requiring a staged operative procedure and an interdisciplinary collaboration.","Brokinkel, Benjamin; Schroeteler, Juliane; Kasprzak, Bernd; Brentrup, Angela; Ewelt, Christian; Stummer, Walter; Klingenhoefer, Mark","Journal of neurological surgery.

High-flow oxygen is effective in cluster headache and has shown promise in animal models of migraine, but has not been adequately studied in patients with migraine. Methods In this randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled trial, adult migraineurs self-administered high-flow oxygen or medical air at 10-15 l/min via face mask in blinded fashion starting soon after symptom onset for 30 minutes, for a total of four migraine attacks. Participants recorded the severity of headache, nausea, and visual symptoms on visual analog scales periodically up to 60 minutes. Results We enrolled 22 individuals (mean age 36 years, 20 women) who self-treated 64 migraine attacks (33 oxygen, 31 air). The pre-specified primary endpoint (mean decrease in pain score from baseline to 30 minutes) was 1.38 ± 1.42 in oxygen-treated and 1.22 ± 1.61 in air-treated attacks ( p = 0.674). Oxygen therapy resulted in relief (severity score 0-1) of pain (24% versus 6%, p = 0.05), nausea (42% versus 23%, p = 0.08) and visual symptoms (36% versus 7%, p = 0.004) at 60 minutes. Exploratory analysis showed that in moderately severe attacks (baseline pain score <6), pain relief was achieved in six of 13 (46%) oxygen versus one of 15 (7%) air ( p = 0.02). Gas therapy was used per protocol in 91% of attacks. There were no significant adverse events. Conclusion High-flow oxygen may be a feasible and safe strategy to treat acute migraine. Further studies are required to determine if this relatively inexpensive, widely available treatment can be used as an adjunct or alternative migraine therapy.","Singhal, Aneesh B; Maas, Matthew B; Goldstein, Joshua N; Mills, Brittany B; Chen, David W; Ayata, Cenk; Kacmarek, Robert M; Topcuoglu, Mehmet A",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,468,5

For those with complicated diverticulitis, minimally invasive surgery is known to be technically challenging due to inflamed tissue, distorted pelvic anatomy, and obliterated tissue planes, resulting in high conversion rates. We aim to illustrate the stepwise approach and modifications required to successful complete the robotic Natural-orifice IntraCorporeal anastomosis with transrectal specimen Extraction (NICE) procedure in this cohort. METHODS Consecutive, elective, unselected patients presenting with complicated diverticulitis defined as fistula, abscess and stricture underwent the NICE procedure over a 24-month period. Demographic and intraoperative data were collected, and video recordings were reviewed and edited on encrypted server. RESULTS A total of 60 patients (50% female) underwent the NICE procedure for complicated diverticulitis with a mean age of 58.9 years and mean BMI of 30.7 kg/m2. The mean operative time was 231.6 min. All cases (100%) were achieved with intracorporeal anastomosis using a circular stapling device. All but one patient (98.3%) had successful transrectal extraction of the specimen. Forty-four (73%) of the specimens required a specimen-thinning maneuver to successfully extract the specimen and there were no conversions. We identified seven key technical modifications and considerations to facilitate successful completion of the procedure which are illustrated, including early release of the disease, mesentery-sparing dissection, dual instrument control of the mesenteric vasculature, release of the rectal reflection, use of NICE back table, specimen-thinning maneuver, and closure of the rectal cuff. CONCLUSION We present a stepwise approach with key modifications to successfully achieve totally robotic intracorporeal resection for those presenting with complicated diverticulitis. This approach may help overcome the technical challenges and provide a foundation for reproducible results.","Haas, Eric M; de Paula, Thais Reif; Luna-Saracho, Roberto; Smith, Melissa Sara; LeFave, Jean-Paul J",Surgical endoscopy,468,1

During COVID-19 pandemic, the constant fear of going outside and to use health services may have had an impact in the number of visits to Community Pharmacies. This research aimed to study self-medication habits of the Portuguese population during the current pandemic, more specifically, to understand which non-prescription drugs and food supplements were taken and the situations that conduced to the use of self-medication. Methods An online structured survey was conducted, with data obtained anonymously and included 170 participants (≥18 years). Data were processed using SPSS v26. Results Participants in this study were mainly female (81.2%), with a mean age of 38.01 ± 1.16 years old and most (84.7%) over 12 years of schooling. Answers allowed to verify that the current pandemic didn't affect that much the frequency of visits to Pharmacy and the situations where people used self-medication were mainly minor, such as headaches (54.1%) and muscle pains (26.5%). The medications used more often were analgesics (60.0%) and anti-inflammatory (40.0%). However, many people indicated that they didńt seek for more information about medicines (49.4%) and/or supplements (7.6%) used during this period. In general, people visited the Pharmacy with a similar frequency and purpose as the previous year. Conclusions Despite all the changes, the current pandemic has not negatively affected the practice of self-medication. The role of Pharmacy professionals in the rational use of the drugs, particularly those used in self medicated situations is essential, especially when the population shows low health literacy regarding the use of medicines.","Campos, Erica Espírito-Santo Margarida Nascimento Tânia",European Journal of Public Health,468,8

Antibodies against these transporters are very important for investigating their expressions and functions. With the cytokine gene as a molecular adjuvant, genetic immunization-based antibody production offers several advantages including high specificity and high recognition to the native protein compared with current methods. We fused high antigenicity fragments of the three transporters to the plasmids pBQAP-TT containing T-cell epitopes and flanking regions from tetanus toxin, respectively. Gene gun immunization with these recombinant plasmids and two other adjuvant plasmids, which express granulocyte/ macrophage colony-stimulating factor and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, induced high level immunoglobulin G antibodies, respectively. The native corresponding proteins of URAT1, OAT1 and OAT3, in human kidney can be recognized by their specific antibodies, respectively, with Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Besides, URAT1 expression in Xenopus oocytes can also be recognized by its corresponding antibody with immuno-fluorescence.

Among the changes that the adolescent must face are: accepting their own body, acquiring a social role, establishing new relationships with peers,achieving emotional independence from parents. All of this is not always easy and many times they face a so difficult path that can produce the onset of some mental pathologies. Typical disorders that adolescents can face are the ones related to food. In these pathologies there is an isolation of the soul which corresponds to an alienation from the body: what remains in this loneliness is the gap between the idealized body and the objectified body. In this process of identity determination the idealized body is not able to relate to the real body (Cuzzolaro 2017). The dimension of their own body and the ability to meet the other bodies in the world are compromised; the only possible knowledge is represented by the impoverishment of their own subjectivity and by the attempt to recover it at an abstract level.

Although suicidality is linked to depression, not all depressed college students experience suicidal ideation (SI). The primary aim of this study was to determine potential factors that may distinguish college students with depressive symptoms with and without SI. METHODS A total of 287 undergraduate college students with substantial depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] total score >13) with and without SI were compared across psychiatric and functional outcome variables. Independent sample t tests were conducted for each outcome variable using the suicide item of the BDI as a dichotomous (ie, zero vs nonzero score) grouping variable. RESULTS Relative to students with substantial depressive symptoms without SI, those with SI were more symptomatic overall, having significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and anxiety. However, contrary to our expectations, nonsuicidal and suicidal students did not differ on measures of everyday functioning (ie, cognitive and physical functioning and grade point average). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that SI among college students is associated with increased subjective distress but may not adversely impact physical or cognitive functioning or academic performance.","Nyer, Maren; Holt, Daphne J; Pedrelli, Paola; Fava, Maurizio; Ameral, Victoria; Cassiello, Clair F; Nock, Matthew K; Ross, Margaret; Hutchinson, Dori; Farabaugh, Amy",Annals of clinical psychiatry : official journal of the American Academy of Clinical Psychiatrists,468,24

Epidemiological studies have also suggested that air pollution exposure is associated with increased cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-associated mortality, although the molecular mechanisms by which pollutant exposure affects viral infection and pathogenesis of COVID-19 remain unknown. In this review, we suggest potential molecular mechanisms that could account for this association. We have focused on the potential effect of exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ), ozone (O3 ), and particulate matter (PM) since there are studies investigating how exposure to these pollutants affects the life cycle of other viruses. We have concluded that pollutant exposure may affect different stages of the viral life cycle, including inhibition of mucociliary clearance, alteration of viral receptors and proteases required for entry, changes to antiviral interferon production and viral replication, changes in viral assembly mediated by autophagy, prevention of uptake by macrophages, and promotion of viral spread by increasing epithelial permeability. We believe that exposure to pollutants skews adaptive immune responses toward bacterial/allergic immune responses, as opposed to antiviral responses. Exposure to air pollutants could also predispose exposed populations toward developing COIVD-19-associated immunopathology, enhancing virus-induced tissue inflammation and damage.","Woodby, Brittany; Arnold, Michelle M; Valacchi, Giuseppe",Ann N Y Acad Sci,468,13

Men chronically exposed to training for endurance sports exhibit persistently reduced basal free and total testosterone concentrations without concurrent luteinizing hormone elevations. These men are deemed to have the ""Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition"" (EHMC). Broadly, dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal regulatory axis is associated with either of these states. In women this effect on the axis is linked to the existence of a low energy availability (LEA) state, research in men relative to LEA is ongoing. The exact physiological mechanism inducing the reduction of testosterone in these men is currently unclear but is postulated to be a dysfunction within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal regulatory axis. The potential exists for the reduced testosterone concentrations within EHMC men to be disruptive and detrimental to some anabolic-androgenic testosterone-dependent physiological processes. Findings, while limited, suggest spermatogenesis problems may exist in some cases; thus, infertility risk in such men is a critical concern. Present evidence suggests the EHMC condition is limited to men who have been persistently involved in chronic endurance exercise training for an extended period of time, and thus is not a highly prevalent occurrence. Nevertheless, it is critical that endocrinologist and fertility clinicians become more aware of the existence of EHMC as a potential problem-diagnosis in their male patients who exercise.","Lane, Amy R; Magallanes, Carlos A; Hackney, Anthony C",Arch Med Deporte,468,1

Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models. This systematic review aimed at summarising the literature on neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older over-60 patients with COVID-19 following a cognitive neuroscientific perspective, to clarify the most vulnerable brain areas and speculate on the possible cognitive consequences.","Manca, R.; De Marco, M.; Ince, P.

Evidence so far suggests that learning has suffered as a result. Here, it is investigated whether forms of computer-assisted learning mitigated the decrements in learning observed during the lockdown. Method Performance of 53,656 primary school students who used adaptive practicing software for mathematics was compared to performance of similar students in the preceding year. Results During the lockdown progress was faster than it had been the year before, contradicting results reported so far. These enhanced gains were correlated with increased use, and remained after the lockdown ended. This was the case for all grades but more so for lower grades and for weak students, but less so for students in schools with disadvantaged populations. Conclusions These results suggest that adaptive practicing software may mitigate, or even reverse, the negative effects of school closures on mathematics learning.","Meeter, Martijn",Trends in neuroscience and education,468,16

The rise of the US$20 billion emotional AI industry will transform the future workplace. Yet, besides no international consensus on the principles or standards for such technologies, there is a lack of cross-cultural research on future job seekers' attitude toward such use of AI technologies. This study collects a cross-sectional dataset of 1,015 survey responses of international students from 48 countries and 8 regions worldwide. A majority of the respondents (52%) are concerned about being managed by AI. Following the hypothetico-deductivist philosophy of science, we use the MCMC Hamiltonian approach and conduct a detailed comparison of 10 Bayesian network models with the PSIS-LOO method. We consistently find having a higher income, being male, majoring in business, and/or self-rated familiarity with AI correlate with a more positive view of emotional AI in the workplace. There is also a stark cross-cultural and cross-regional difference. Our analysis shows people from economically less developed regions (Africa, Oceania, Central Asia) tend to exhibit less concern for AI managers. And for East Asian countries, 64% of the Japanese, 56% of the South Korean, and 42% of the Chinese professed the trusting attitude. In contrast, an overwhelming majority of 75% of the European and Northern American possesses the worrying/neutral attitude toward being managed by AI.

Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main purposes are either stealing users’ private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a long time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious developers are mainly located in the US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community. Till now, over 30 research institutes around the world have requested our dataset for COVID-19 themed research.","Wang, Liu He Ren Wang Haoyu Xia Pengcheng Li Yuanchun Wu Lei Zhou Yajin Luo Xiapu Sui Yulei Guo Yao Xu Guoai",Empirical Software Engineering,468,16

Information about the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who were not admitted to hospital is limited. Some risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 are controversial (eg, smoking). Moreover, the impact of city closure on mortality and admission rates is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors of mortality associated with COVID-19 infection among a sample of patients in Wuhan whose conditions were reported on social media. METHODS: We enrolled 599 patients with COVID-19 from 67 hospitals in Wuhan in the study; 117 of the participants (19.5%) were not admitted to hospital. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, and radiological features of the patients were extracted from their social media posts and coded. Telephone follow-up was conducted 1 month later (between March 15 and 23, 2020) to check the clinical outcomes of the patients and acquire other relevant information. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 who died (72 years, IQR 66.5-82.0) was significantly higher than that of patients who recovered (61 years, IQR 53-69, P<.001). We found that lack of admission to hospital (odds ratio [OR] 5.82, 95% CI 3.36-10.1; P<.001), older age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.1; P<.001), diffuse distribution (OR 11.09, 95% CI 0.93-132.9; P=.058), and hypoxemia (odds ratio 2.94, 95% CI 1.32-6.6; P=.009) were associated with increasing odds of death. Smoking was not significantly associated with mortality risk (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.44-1.85; P=.78). CONCLUSIONS: Older age, diffuse distribution, and hypoxemia are factors that can help clinicians identify patients with COVID-19 who have poor prognosis. Our study suggests that aggregated data from social media can also be comprehensive, immediate, and informative in disease prognosis.","Liu, Dong; Wang, Yuyan; Wang, Juan; Liu, Jue; Yue, Yongjie; Liu, Wenjun; Zhang, Fuhai; Wang, Ziping",J Med Internet Res,468,16

Data was collected through in-house computerized system and SPSS version 19 was used for analysis. Of 143492 pediatric admissions, 32 (21 males and 11 females) patients with a median (IQR) age of 4.5 years (0-16) had CVST. This is equivalent to 18.5 CVST events per million pediatric admissions.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: On 15 April 2020, together with the German Society of Pathology and the Federal Association of German Pathologists, the German Registry of COVID-19 Autopsies (DeRegCOVID) was launched ( www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de ). Building on this, the German Network for Autopsies in Pandemics (DEFEAT PANDEMIcs) was established on 1 September 2020. RESULTS: The main goal of DeRegCOVID is to collect and distribute de facto anonymized data on potentially all autopsies of people who have died from COVID-19 in Germany in order to meet the need for centralized, coordinated, and structured data collection and reporting during the pandemic. The success of the registry strongly depends on the willingness of the respective centers to report the data, which has developed very positively so far and requires special thanks to all participating centers. The rights to own data and biomaterials (stored decentrally) remain with each respective center. The DEFEAT PANDEMIcs network expands on this and aims to strengthen harmonization and standardization as well as nationwide implementation and cooperation in the field of pandemic autopsies. CONCLUSIONS: The extraordinary cooperation in the field of autopsies in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic is impressively demonstrated by the establishment of DeRegCOVID, the merger of the registry of neuropathology (CNS-COVID19) with DeRegCOVID and the establishment of the autopsy network DEFEAT PANDEMIcs.

Patients with lung cancer have consistently been reported to suffer from an increased risk of death compared with other cancers. This is possibly due to the combination of specific pathophysiological aspects, including underlying pulmonary compromise due to smoking history and the increased specific pressures on respiratory healthcare services caused by the related pandemic. Rationally and safely treating patients with lung cancer during the pandemic has become a continuous challenge over the last year. Deciding whether to offer, modify, postpone or even cancel treatments for this particular patient's population has become the crucial recurrent dilemma for lung cancer professionals. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted agents represent distinct risks factors in the context of COVID-19 that should be balanced with the short-term and long-term consequences of delaying cancer care. Despite the rapid and persistent trend of the pandemic, declared by WHO on March 11, 2020, and still ongoing at the time of writing (January 2021), various efforts were made by oncologists worldwide to understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Adapted recommendations of our evidence-based practice guidelines have been developed for all stakeholders. Different small and large-scale registries, such as the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) and Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration quickly collected data, supporting cancer care decisions under the challenging circumstance created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several recommendations were developed as guidance for prioritizing the various aspects of lung cancer care in order to mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 healthcare crisis, potentially reducing the morbidity and mortality of our patients from COVID-19 and from cancer. These recommendations helped inform decisions about treatment of established disease, continuation of clinical research and lung cancer screening. In this review, we summarize available evidence regarding the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and patients.","Passaro, Antonio; Bestvina, Christine; Velez Velez, Maria; Garassino, Marina Chiara; Garon, Edward; Peters, Solange",J. immunotherap. cancer,468,20

Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly non-uniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform healthcare planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.","Thomas, Loring J.; Huang, Peng; Yin, Fan; Luo, Xiaoshuang Iris; Almquist, Zack W.; Hipp, John R.; Butts, Carter T.",,468,29

Design: A convenience sample of 201 older adults aged 65 and over was interviewed. Using bootstrapping, we tested the strength and significance of the indirect effect of depressive symptoms and malnutrition (mediators) on the relationship between feelings of loneliness and subjective age. Results: The relationship between feelings of loneliness and subjective age during the COVID-19 pandemic was mediated by malnutrition, but not by depressive symptoms. In addition, the participants felt older during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preceding period. Conclusions: An association was found among feelings of loneliness, malnutrition, and subjective age. To overcome these feelings in times of crisis like the pandemic, it is essential to develop new communication methods (technologies for managing and addressing the needs of the older population; technologies to encourage social engagement, and technologies for managing and providing remote medical services) for and with older adults that are effective in reducing loneliness, and to promote good nutrition. Possible practical solutions include new social network technologies for reducing loneliness combined with continued reliance on phone communication as an intervention of psychological support to promote a healthy lifestyle and prevent malnutrition.","Vitman Schorr, Adi; Yehuda, Itamar; Tamir, Snait",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),468,26

This caused prolonged stay on board or at home for seafarers, who should be recognized as 'key' workers regarding their essential role in maintaining the flow of vital goods. OBJECTIVE: Using a general inductive approach, this qualitative study aims to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic reflects on seafarers' well-being. The study focused on obtaining personal experiences from seafarers on board, and seafarers at home, relating to the current world pandemic. METHODS: A convenience sample consisting of 752 seafarers from the international seafarers' population participated in an online study in spring 2020. The questionnaire used included questions relating to basic sociodemographic and work characteristics, and one open question which addressed seafarers' personal experiences. The data obtained was analysed by thematic analysis. RESULTS: The emerged themes included mental, physical, social and economic well-being. Most of the answers of seafarers located on board related to threatened mental, physical and social well-being, while seafarers at home reported mostly on threats to their economic well-being. CONCLUSION: Seafarers' well-being is seriously threatened by preventive measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results are discussed in relation to earlier findings in the area of occupational stress in seafaring. Overall, the data obtained portrays existing underlying occupational structures in the seafaring sector, which are rendered more visible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In short, seafarers describe their reality as far away from the concept of 'key' or 'essential' workers.","Sliskovic, Ana",Work,468,5

Objectives: To assess the exposure, infection, and persistence by SARS-CoV-2 of dogs and cats living in the same households of humans that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate clinical and laboratory alterations associated with animal infection. METHODS: Animals living with COVID-19 patients were longitudinally followed and had nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal and rectal swabs collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, blood samples were collected for laboratory analysis, and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) to investigate specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. RESULTS: Between May and October 2020, 39 pets (29 dogs and 10 cats) of 21 patients were investigated. Nine dogs (31%) and four cats (40%) from 10 (47.6%) households were infected with or seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. Animals tested positive from 11 to 51 days after the human index COVID-19 case onset of symptoms. Three dogs tested positive twice within 14, 30, and 31 days apart.

RESULTS: Four weeks after diagnosis of his recurrence he underwent a total laryngectomy, wide-local skin excision and reconstruction with a pectoralis major pedicled flap. He recovered well initially following his operation, however unfortunately contracted nosocomial SARS-Cov2 and succumbed from respiratory complications during his post-operative recovery. CONCLUSION: Stomal recurrence after temporary tracheostomy for oral cavity malignancies are very rare. Previously reported management of these can vary from surgical to palliative treatment. Methods to prevent these include delaying tracheostomy until after surgical resection, packing the pharynx during resection and adjuvant radiotherapy.","Hintze, J M; Fitzgerald, C; Lang, B; O039,; Shea, J; Barry, C; Brennan, S; Lennon, P",Oral Oncol,468,20

Methods: The study population included a random list of 3000 individuals with T2D derived from 30,748 individuals who had visited a large tertiary diabetes center during the past year. The survey was carried out through a telephonic interview. A structured questionnaire was used to collect information on changes in lifestyle, access and challenges to diabetes care and use of technologies such as telemedicine facilities and use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), etc. Results: Of the 2510 individuals successfully interviewed (83.7% response rate), 382 (15.2%) reported having attempted to consult their health care providers during the lockdown, of whom only 30.6% utilized the telemedicine facility. However, 96 (82%) of those who utilized the telemedicine facility (n = 117) were happy with their experience and 68 (58.1%) were willing to continue to use the facility in the future. Only 11.4% of participants utilized online support for management of diabetes. Use of SMBG increased significantly from 15.5% to 51.3% during the lockdown. There was an improvement in glycemic control during the lockdown (HbA1c:before vs. during lockdown: 8.2% ± 1.9% vs. 7.7% ± 1.7%, P < 0.001) in a nonrandomly selected subset of subjects (n = 205). Conclusions: Acceptance of telemedicine facilities remains suboptimal in this Asian Indian population, in spite of high levels of satisfaction among those who utilized it. The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have not adversely affected metabolic control in our patients, and indeed there appears to be an improvement in HbA1c levels. Greater accessibility and acceptance of technology could help individuals with diabetes to maintain better contact with their physicians and ensure better metabolic control in the future.","Anjana, Ranjit Mohan; Pradeepa, Rajendra; Deepa, Mohan; Jebarani, Saravanan; Venkatesan, Ulagamathesan; Parvathi, Somasundaram Jaya; Balasubramanyam, Muthuswamy; Radha, Venkatesan; Poongothai, Subramani; Sudha, Vasudevan; Shanthi Rani, Coimbatore Subramanian; Ranjani, Harish; Amutha, Anandakumar; Manickam, Nagaraj; Unnikrishnan, Ranjit; Mohan, Viswanathan",Diabetes Technol Ther,468,1

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals' perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals' threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P<.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals. To boost individuals' motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals' perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.","Farooq, Ali; Laato, Samuli; Islam, A K M Najmul",J Med Internet Res,468,16

These included support for daily needs, mental and general health services, communication, information and coordination, which were examined by gender, age, education level, having been affected by COVID-19, and trust in government´s success in addressing unexpected health threats. RESULTS: ´Trust in the government´ showed the greatest odds of positive perception for the ten measures studied. Odds of positive perception of communication significantly varied by gender, education level, and having been affected by COVID-19, whereas for information and coordination of disease control, odds significantly varied by gender and having been affected by COVID-19. Odds of positive perception for access to mental health services significantly varied by gender and education level. Age was not significant. CONCLUSION: Public perception of the government's pandemic response in Spain varied by socio-demographic and individual variables, particularly by reported trust in the government. Fostering public trust during health threats may improve perception of response efforts. Future efforts should tailor interventions that consider gender, education level, and whether people have been affected by COVID-19.","White, Trenton M; Cash-Gibson, Lucinda; Martin-Moreno, Jose M; Matesanz, Rafeal; Crespo, Javier; Alfonso-Sanchez, Jose L; Villapol, Sonia; El-Mohandes, Ayman; Lazarus, Jeffrey V",Eur. j. public health,468,21

STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cross-sectional explorative survey using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of 40 questions that were subdivided into 4 subjects; workload, specialist training aspects in obstetrics and gynaecology, health and safety of the trainee and women's health and maternal health issues. Inclusion criteria consisted of being a trainee in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ObGyn) at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe or trainees who had recently finished their training during the time of the outbreak. Taking part in the survey was voluntary. The questionnaire was shared on the website of the European Network for Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (ENTOG), ENTOG social media, in the ENTOG-newsletter and through the national representatives of ENTOG. RESULTS: 110 ObGyn trainees from 25 different countries responded to the questionnaire. Almost all trainees (95 %, N = 105) reported an effect on their training due to COVID-19 pandemic. Training was interrupted in 21 % of cases (n = 23). Trainees observed a decrease in educational activities or lectures and a decrease in number of patients. The possibility of training surgical skills decreased, because 67 % (N = 74) trainees reported that surgeries were cancelled. Trainees expressed concerns about reaching the goals of their ObGyn specialist training in 60 % (n = 66) of cases. A decrease in workload was experienced during the first COVID-19 wave in Europe by 60 % (n = 66) of trainees. On average these trainees worked 33 % less hours compared to a normal workweek. Although 22 % (n = 24) were expected to be available continuously for 24 h a day and 7 days a week for unscheduled duties, 15 % (n = 16) were deployed to work on special COVID-units. Concerning preparation, 45 % of the trainees (n = 50) had not received any training for treating COVID-positive patients. Trainees claimed to have enough personal protective equipment (PPE), although problems were reported. Any form of psychosocial support was arranged for 65 % of trainees (n = 71) by the hospital or department. The results of the survey suggest that obstetric care was not affected much (92 % (n = 102) of the respondents said at least necessary care continued) while patients in need for reproductive medicine were affected the most; out of the 110 departments 58 % (n = 60) were closed and 35 % (n = 36) reduced their activities. Access to family planning and benign gynaecology were also significantly reduced; 77 % and 87 % respectively of the departments were less accessible or only open to emergency cases. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous effect on the ObGyn training in Europe. Exposure to learning opportunities, surgeries and teaching has been decreased during the outbreak and may result in a decrease in quality of care provided to women in the future if impairment of training is not recovered.","Boekhorst, Ferry; Khattak, Hajra; Topcu, Elif Goknur; Horala, Agnieszka; Gonçalves Henriques, Manuel",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,468,6

Under the juridical normative type of research, the results of this research found the emergence of legal consequences due to industrial relations disputes for employment relations actors if the agreement on THR Payment is not achieved. This research has also found that the Minister Circular Letter on THR Payment basically contradicted the principle of legal certainty because the status does not belong to the statutory regulations, meaning that it has no force to be applied as statutory regulations do. Based on the Statutory regulation, the minister Circular Letter's legal status only applies to internal institutions which issue and belongs to technical and administrative arrangements.

Despite being are a source of rich information, graphs are limited to pairwise interactions. However, several real world networks such as social networks, neuronal networks etc. involve simultaneous interactions between more than two nodes. Simplicial complexes provide a powerful mathematical way to model such interactions. Now, the spectrum of the graph Laplacian is known to be indicative of community structure, with nonzero eigenvectors encoding the identity of communities. Here, we propose that the spectrum of the Hodge Laplacian, a higher-order Laplacian applied to simplicial complexes, encodes simplicial communities. We formulate an algorithm to extract simplicial communities (of arbitrary dimension). We apply this algorithm on simplicial complex benchmarks and on real data including social networks and language-networks, where higher-order relationships are intrinsic. Additionally, datasets for simplicial complexes are scarce. Hence, we introduce a method of optimally generating a simplicial complex from its network backbone through estimating the \textit{true} higher-order relationships when its community structure is known. We do so by using the adjusted mutual information to identify the configuration that best matches the expected data partition. Lastly, we demonstrate an example of persistent simplicial communities inspired by the field of persistence homology.","Krishnagopal, Sanjukta; Bianconi, Ginestra",,468,5

Lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine show in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have been used for the treatment of COVID-19. Both, lopinavir and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. The impact of a triple therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) on kidney function in COVID-19 is currently not known. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed both non-ICU and ICU patients with COVID-19 receiving triple therapy for the incidence of AKI. Patients receiving standard therapy served as a control group. All patients were hospitalized at the University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany, between March and April 2020. A matched-pair analysis for the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 was performed to control for the severity of illness among non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. RESULTS: In non-ICU patients, the incidence of AKI was markedly increased following triple therapy (78.6% vs. 21.4% in controls, p = 0.002), while a high incidence of AKI was observed in both groups of ICU patients (triple therapy: 80.0%, control group: 90.5%). ICU patients treated with triple therapy showed a trend towards more oliguric or anuric kidney injury. We also observed a linear correlation between the duration of the triple therapy and the maximum serum creatinine level (p = 0.004, R2 = 0.276, R = 0.597). CONCLUSION: Triple therapy is associated with an increase in the incidence of AKI in non-ICU COVID-19 patients. The underlying mechanisms may comprise a CYP3A4 enzyme interaction, and may be relevant for any future therapy combining hydroxychloroquine with antiviral agents.","Schneider, Johanna; Jaenigen, Bernd; Wagner, Dirk; Rieg, Siegbert; Hornuss, Daniel; Biever, Paul M; Kern, Winfried V; Walz, Gerd",PLoS One,468,33

We compare the pandemic with other large-scale collective action problems - such as climate change, antimicrobial resistance and biodiversity loss - which are identified by the number of actors involved (the more actors, the larger the scale); the problem's complexity; and the spatial and temporal distance between the actors causing and being affected by the problem. The greater the extent of these characteristics, the larger the scale of the collective action problem and the smaller the probability of spontaneous collective action. We argue that by unpacking the social dilemma logic underlying the spread of the COVID-19 virus, we can better understand the great variation in policy responses worldwide, e.g., why some countries are adopting harsher policies and enforcing them, while others tend to rely more on recommendations. We claim that one key factor is trust and, more precisely, reciprocal trust, both horizontally among people and also vertically between people and their governments - and vice versa. Citizens must trust that the recommendations they receive from the public authorities are correct, that these are in their (or the collective's) best interest, and that most others will follow the recommendations. Simultaneously, government authorities must trust that their citizens will transform the recommendations into collective action. When this situation is present, we argue that governments enjoy a large degree of collective action capital, which potentially open up for a wider palette of policy options.","Harring, Niklas; Jagers, Sverker C; Löfgren, Åsa",World Dev,468,26

Hydroxychloroquine has been proposed as a postexposure therapy to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), but definitive evidence is lacking. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, cluster-randomized trial involving asymptomatic contacts of patients with polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-confirmed Covid-19 in Catalonia, Spain. We randomly assigned clusters of contacts to the hydroxychloroquine group (which received the drug at a dose of 800 mg once, followed by 400 mg daily for 6 days) or to the usual-care group (which received no specific therapy). The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 within 14 days. The secondary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined by symptoms compatible with Covid-19 or a positive PCR test regardless of symptoms. Adverse events were assessed for up to 28 days. RESULTS: The analysis included 2314 healthy contacts of 672 index case patients with Covid-19 who were identified between March 17 and April 28, 2020. A total of 1116 contacts were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine and 1198 to receive usual care. Results were similar in the hydroxychloroquine and usual-care groups with respect to the incidence of PCR-confirmed, symptomatic Covid-19 (5.7% and 6.2%, respectively; risk ratio, 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.42]). In addition, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission than usual care (18.7% and 17.8%, respectively). The incidence of adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than in the usual-care group (56.1% vs. 5.9%), but no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Postexposure therapy with hydroxychloroquine did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic Covid-19 in healthy persons exposed to a PCR-positive case patient.

We have recently shown that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein promotes an inflammatory cytokine IL-6/IL-6R induced trans-signaling response and alarmin secretion. Virus infected or spike transfected human epithelial cells exhibited an increase in senescence state with the release of senescence associated secretory proteins (SASP) related inflammatory molecules. Introduction of BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153 to senescent epithelial cells reversed this effect and reduced SASP related inflammatory molecule release in TMNK-1 or EAhy926 as representative human endothelial cell line, when exposed to cell culture medium (CM) derived from A549 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, also exhibited a senescence phenotype with enhanced p16, p21, SA-ß-galactosidase expression, and triggered SASP pathways. Inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling by Tocilizumab and inhibition of inflammatory receptor signaling by the BTK inhibitor Zanubrutinib, prior to exposure of CM to endothelial cells, inhibited p21 and p16 induction. We also observed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A549 spike transfected and endothelial cells exposed to spike transfected CM. ROS generation in endothelial cell lines was reduced after treatment with Tocilizumab and Zanubrutinib. Cellular senescence was associated with an increased level of the endothelial adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 with in vitro leukocyte attachment potential. Inhibition of senescence or SASP function prevented VCAM-1/ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte attachment. Taken together, we identified that the exposure of human endothelial cells to cell culture supernatant derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression displayed cellular senescence markers, leading to enhanced leukocyte adhesion. Importance: The present study was aimed at examining the underlying mechanism of extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein associated pathogenesis, with the notion that infection of the pulmonary epithelium can lead to mediators that drive endothelial dysfunction. We utilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in cultured cells of human hepatocytes (Huh7.5) and pneumocytes (A549) to generate conditioned culture media (CM). Endothelial cell lines (TMNK-1 or EAhy926) treated with CM exhibited increase in cellular senescence markers by a paracrine mode, and lead to leukocyte adhesion. Overall, the link between these responses in endothelial cell senescence, and a potential contribution to microvascular complication in productively SARS-CoV-2 infected humans is implicated. Furthermore, the use of inhibitors (BTK, IL-6 and BRD4) showed reverse effect in the senescent cells. These results may support the selection of potential adjunct therapeutic modalities to impede SARS-CoV-2 associated pathogenesis.","Meyer, Keith; Patra, Tapas; Ray, Ranjit",J Virol,468,21

Here we describe an AI strategy, retro drug design, or RDD, to generate novel small molecule drugs from scratch to meet predefined requirements, including but not limited to biological activity against a drug target, and optimal range of physicochemical and ADMET properties. Traditional predictive models were first trained over experimental data for the target properties, using an atom typing based molecular descriptor system, ATP. Monte Carlo sampling algorithm was then utilized to find the solutions in the ATP space defined by the target properties, and the deep learning model of Seq2Seq was employed to decode molecular structures from the solutions. To test feasibility of the algorithm, we challenged RDD to generate novel drugs that can activate {\mu} opioid receptor (MOR) and penetrate blood brain barrier (BBB). Starting from vectors of random numbers, RDD generated 180,000 chemical structures, of which 78% were chemically valid. About 42,000 (31%) of the valid structures fell into the property space defined by MOR activity and BBB permeability. Out of the 42,000 structures, only 267 chemicals were commercially available, indicating a high extent of novelty of the AI-generated compounds. We purchased and assayed 96 compounds, and 25 of which were found to be MOR agonists. These compounds also have excellent BBB scores. The results presented in this paper illustrate that RDD has potential to revolutionize the current drug discovery process and create novel structures with multiple desired properties, including biological functions and ADMET properties. Availability of an AI-enabled fast track in drug discovery is essential to cope with emergent public health threat, such as pandemic of COVID-19.","Wang, Yuhong; Michael, Sam; Huang, Ruili; Zhao, Jinghua; Recabo, Katlin; Bougie, Danielle; Shu, Qiang; Shinn, Paul; Sun, Hongmao",,468,16

METHODS: The Vascular Surgery Group of Regione Lombardia Register, a real-word, multicenter, retrospective register was interrogated. All patients admitted with vascular disease were included. Patients' data on demographics, COVID-19 positivity, comorbidities and outcomes were extrapolated. Two cohorts were obtained: patients admitted to HH or SH. Primary endpoint was 30- day mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were 30-day complications and amputation (in case of peripheral artery disease [PAD]) rates. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to compare HH and SH groups and predictors of poor outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 659 vascular patients in 4 HH and 27 SH were analyzed. Among these, 321 (48.7%) were admitted to a HH. No difference in COVID-19 positive patients was described (21.7% in HH vs 15.9% in SH; p=.058).

However, few data are available on their longitudinal kinetics, compared with genomic RNA (gRNA), in clinical samples. METHODS: We analyzed 536 samples from 205 patients with COVID-19 from placebo-controlled, outpatient trials of peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda; n = 177) and favipiravir (n = 359). Nasal swabs were collected at 3 time points in the Lambda (days 1, 4, and 6) and favipiravir (days 1, 5, and 10) trials. N-gene gRNA and sgRNA were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To investigate the decay kinetics in vitro, we measured gRNA and sgRNA in A549(ACE2+) cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, following treatment with remdesivir or dimethylsulfoxide control. RESULTS: At 6 days in the Lambda trial and 10 days in the favipiravir trial, sgRNA remained detectable in 51.6% (32/62) and 49.5% (51/106) of the samples, respectively. Cycle threshold (Ct) values for gRNA and sgRNA were highly linearly correlated (marginal R(2) = 0.83), and the rate of increase did not differ significantly in the Lambda trial (1.36 cycles/d vs 1.36 cycles/d; P = .97) or the favipiravir trial (1.03 cycles/d vs 0.94 cycles/d; P = .26). From samples collected 15–21 days after symptom onset, sgRNA was detectable in 48.1% (40/83) of participants. In SARS-CoV-2-infected A549(ACE2+) cells treated with remdesivir, the rate of Ct increase did not differ between gRNA and sgRNA. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical samples and in vitro, sgRNA was highly correlated with gRNA and did not demonstrate different decay patterns to support its application as a viability marker.","Verma, Renu; Kim, Eugene; Martínez-Colón, Giovanny Joel; Jagannathan, Prasanna; Rustagi, Arjun; Parsonnet, Julie; Bonilla, Hector; Khosla, Chaitan; Holubar, Marisa; Subramanian, Aruna; Singh, Upinder; Maldonado, Yvonne; Blish, Catherine A; Andrews, Jason R",Open Forum Infect Dis,468,24

Various porcine pathogens target macrophages, which are classical innate immune cells. Although macrophages basically protect the host from pathogens, they also seem to contribute to infectious processes. Therefore, cultured macrophages can be used to develop in vitro models for studying not only genes associated with porcine innate immunity but also the infectious processes of porcine pathogens. However, the availability of porcine macrophage cell lines is limited. In this study, we describe a novel immortalized porcine kidney-derived macrophage (IPKM) cell line, which was generated by transferring the SV40 large T antigen (SV40LT) and porcine telomerase reverse transcriptase (pTERT) genes into primary porcine kidney-derived macrophages using lentiviral vectors. The IPKM displayed a typical macrophage morphology and was routinely passaged (doubling time: about 4 days). These cells were immunostained for macrophage markers. In addition, they exhibited substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads and released inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Furthermore, the maturation and secretion of interleukin-1β were observed after nigericin-induced inflammasome activation in LPS-primed IPKM. These findings suggest that IPKM exhibit the typical inflammatory characteristics of macrophages. By transferring the SV40LT and pTERT genes using lentiviral vectors, we also successfully immortalized macrophages derived from the peripheral blood of a low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient pig. These results suggest that the co-expression of SV40LT and pTERT is an effective way of immortalizing porcine macrophages.","Takenouchi, Takato; Kitani, Hiroshi; Suzuki, Shunichi; Nakai, Michiko; Fuchimoto, Dai-ichiro; Tsukimoto, Mitsutoshi; Shinkai, Hiroki; Sato, Mitsuru; Uenishi, Hirohide",Front Vet Sci,468,20

High-resolution CARS microscopy combined with multimodal imaging has allowed for dynamic monitoring of cellular processes such as lipid metabolism and storage, the movement of organelles, adipogenesis and host-pathogen interactions and can also be used to track molecules within cells and tissues. The CARS imaging modality provides a unique tool for biological chemists to elucidate the state of a cellular environment without perturbing it and to perceive the functional effects of added molecules.","Pezacki, John Paul; Blake, Jessie A; Danielson, Dana C; Kennedy, David C; Lyn, Rodney K; Singaravelu, Ragunath",Nat Chem Biol,468,16

How patients and surgeons perceive telemedicine is unknown. We examined patient and provider satisfaction with postoperative telehealth visits following cardiac surgery. METHODS: Between April 2020 and September 2020, patients who underwent open cardiac surgery and had a postoperative appointment via telemedicine were administered a patient satisfaction survey over the phone. Time of survey administration ranged from 1 to 4 weeks following their appointment. Surgeons also completed a satisfaction survey following each telemedicine appointment they conducted. RESULTS: Fifty patients were surveyed. Of these, 36 (72%) had a postoperative appointment over the telephone, and 14 (28%) had a postoperative appointment via video‐chat. Overall, patients expressed satisfaction with the care that they received via our two telemedicine modalities (mean Likert scale agreement 4.8, SD 0.5). Despite this, 46% of patients said they would prefer their next postoperative appointment to be via telemedicine even if there was not a stay‐at‐home order in place. All surgeons surveyed reported (agree/strongly agree) that they would prefer to see their postoperative patients using telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight acceptability of continuing telemedicine use in the postoperative care of cardiac surgery patients.","Sallam, Aminah; Shang, Michael; Vallabhajosyula, Ishani; Mori, Makoto; Chinian, Rachel; Assi, Roland; Bonde, Pramod; Geirsson, Arnar; Vallabhajosyula, Prashanth",J Card Surg,468,1

Due to the key roles of the inflammasomes in the induction of inflammation, it has been hypothesized that the molecules may be the main parts of immune responses against viral infections and the tissue damage. Because some cases of viral hepatitis infections, including hepatitis B and C, are diagnosed as chronic and may be associated with various complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several studies focused on the roles played by the inflammation on the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis. Based on the roles played by inflammasomes in induction of inflammation, it has been hypothesized that inflammasomes may be the main parts of the puzzle of the viral hepatitis complications.

Unscheduled care can include attending emergency departments, ambulance callouts, out-of-hours care, and non-elective hospital admissions. A large proportion of non-elective hospital admissions involve people with diabetes, with significant health and economic burden. AIM: To identify precipitating factors influencing diabetes-related unscheduled hospital admissions, exploring potential preventive strategies to reduce admissions. DESIGN & SETTING: Thirty-six people with type 1 (n = 11) or type 2 (n = 25) diabetes were interviewed. They were admitted to hospital for unscheduled diabetes-related care across three hospitals in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland. Participants were admitted for peripheral limb complications (n = 17), hypoglycaemia (n = 5), hyperglycaemia (n = 6), or for comorbidities presenting with erratic blood glucose levels (n = 8). METHOD: Factors precipitating admissions were examined using framework analysis. RESULTS: Three aspects of care influenced unscheduled admissions: perceived inadequate knowledge of diabetes complications; restricted provision of care; and complexities in engagement with self-care and help-seeking. Limited specialist professional knowledge of diabetes by staff in primary and community care, alongside inadequate patient self-management knowledge, led to inappropriate treatment and significant delays. This was compounded by restricted provision of care, characterised by poor access to services — in time and proximity — and poor continuity of care. Complexities in patient engagement, help-seeking, and illness beliefs further complicated the progression to unscheduled admissions. CONCLUSION: Dedicated investment in primary care is needed to enhance provision of and access to services. There should be increased promotion and earlier diabetes specialist team involvement, alongside training and use of technology and telemedicine, to enhance existing care.","Perrin, Nikki ED; Heaton, Janet; MacRury, Sandra M; Friel, Kathleen M; Coates, Vivien",BJGP open,468,26

In the search for a cure of COVID-19, drug repurposing is a fast and cost-effective approach to identify anti-COVID-19 drugs from existing drugs. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been a main target for drug designs to block spike protein binding to ACE2 proteins. In this study, we probed the conformational plasticity of the RBD using long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, from which, representative conformations were identified using clustering analysis. Three simulated conformations and the original crystal structure were used to screen FDA approved drugs (2466 drugs) against the predicted binding site at the ACE2-RBD interface, leading to 18 drugs with top docking scores. Notably, 16 out of the 18 drugs were obtained from the simulated conformations, while the crystal structure suggests poor binding. The binding stability of the 18 drugs were further investigated using MD simulations. Encouragingly, 6 drugs exhibited stable binding with RBD at the ACE2-RBD interface and 3 of them (gonadorelin, fondaparinux and atorvastatin) showed significantly enhanced binding after the MD simulations. Our study shows that flexibility modeling of SARS-CoV-2 RBD using MD simulation is of great help in identifying novel agents which might block the interaction between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD for inhibiting the virus infection.","Kumar, Vikash; Liu, Haiguang; Wu, Chun",Comput Biol Med,468,16

The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines represent a new class of vaccine products, which consist of synthetic mRNA strands encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, packaged in lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA to cells. This review digs deeper into the scientific breakthroughs of the last decades that laid the foundations for the rapid rise of mRNA vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic. As well as providing momentum for mRNA vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 represents an ideal case study allowing to compare design-activity differences between the different mRNA vaccine candidates. Therefore, a detailed overview of the composition and (pre)clinical performance of the three most advanced mRNA vaccines is provided and the influence of choices in their structural design on to their immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile is discussed in depth. In addition to the new fundamental insights in the mRNA vaccines' mode of action highlighted here, we also point out which unknowns remain that require further investigation and possibly, optimization in future mRNA vaccine development.","Verbeke, Rein; Lentacker, Ine; De Smedt, Stefaan C.; Dewitte, Heleen",J Control Release,468,20

However, delirium identification is important as it can serve as a key marker for hospital providers to identify COVID patients at risk for poor outcomes including ICU stay and death.(2) COVID delirium has been difficult to manage because some COVID treatment methods are inherently deliriogenic and some medications traditionally used to manage delirium have been rendered ineffective among this population. Inpatient neurology and psychiatry practitioners are having to postulate new treatment techniques; one such medication algorithm can be found within this piece. It is important that delirium doesn't get lost in the chaos that is management of the COVID patient.","Woolley, Brittany",Geriatr Nurs,468,23

This paper explores ethical issues in making use of digital phenotype data in the arena of digital health interventions. Products and services based on digital wellbeing technologies typically include mobile device apps as well as browser-based apps to a lesser extent, and can include telephony-based services, text-based chatbots, and voice-activated chatbots. Many of these digital products and services are simultaneously available across many channels in order to maximize availability for users. Digital wellbeing technologies offer useful methods for real-time data capture of the interactions of users with the products and services. It is possible to design what data are recorded, how and where it may be stored, and, crucially, how it can be analyzed to reveal individual or collective usage patterns. The paper also examines digital phenotyping workflows, before enumerating the ethical concerns pertaining to different types of digital phenotype data, highlighting ethical considerations for collection, storage, and use of the data. A case study of a digital health app is used to illustrate the ethical issues. The case study explores the issues from a perspective of data prospecting and subsequent machine learning. The ethical use of machine learning and artificial intelligence on digital phenotype data and the broader issues in democratizing machine learning and artificial intelligence for digital phenotype data are then explored in detail.","Mulvenna, Maurice D.; Bond, Raymond; Delaney, Jack; Dawoodbhoy, Fatema Mustansir; Boger, Jennifer; Potts, Courtney; Turkington, Robin",Philos Technol,468,8
