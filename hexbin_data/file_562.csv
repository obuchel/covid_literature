4850,Attenuated Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines in Asthmatic Children,1974,"Transmission of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in utero following oronasal inoculation of pregnant mice was found to depend upon MHV strain and host genotype. Virulent, polytropic MHV-JHM was recovered from multiple maternal tissues, including liver and uterus, as well as placenta and fetus in susceptible BALB/cByJ mice. Fetuses were infected during all 3 trimesters of pregnancy. Low virulence, polytropic MHV-S infected fetuses in a low percentage of susceptible BALB/cByJ dams. Infection of resistant CD-1 mice with MHV-JHM was limited, with no fetal infection. Enterotropic MHV-Y was largely restricted to intestine of BALB/cByJ and CD-1 dams, with minimal dissemination and no fetal infection. Maternally-derived MHV IgG antibody was detectable in pup sera through 4 weeks of age. Antibody titers were generally lower in second litters of the same dam. Cross-fostering experiments showed that antibody was transferred via colostrum and not in utero, and that pups were capable of absorption through 2 weeks of age. Pups nursing immune dams were protected against MHV challenge at 1 and 2 weeks of age, compared to pups nursing naive dams. Immunity to MHV challenge was cross-protective against both antigenically homotypic and heterotypic strains of MHV.","Barthold, S.

8507,"Highlights of international conference of immunogenomics and immunomics, October 8–12, 2006 Budapest, Hungary",2007-04-30,BACKGROUND/AIMS: The clinical pattern of cryptosporidial diarrhea suggests an enterotoxic mechanism. No evidence for this mechanism has been reported thus far. This study aimed to look for enterotoxic effect elaborated by Cryptosporidium. METHODS: The effects on human intestinal transport of stool supernatant of diarrheal calves infected with Cryptosporidium parvum were examined. Aliquots of centrifuged and filtered stools were added to the mucosal or serosal side of human jejunum obtained from patients undergoing surgery and mounted in Ussing chambers. Electrical parameters were recorded. Stool supernatants of uninfected calves served as a control. RESULTS: The mucosal addition of 2.5 mg protein of fecal supernatant from diarrheal calves induced a prompt and significant increase in short circuit current with no effects on tissue conductance. The serosal addition of this material and the addition of control supernatant to either side did not induce modifications of electrical parameters. The enterotoxic effect was dose-dependent and saturable. It was reversible by withdrawing the supernatant from the incubation medium. The electrical effect was chloride- and calcium-dependent and was sensitive to heating. CONCLUSIONS: An enterotoxic activity is present in the stools of Cryptosporidium-infected calves. This activity may be responsible for secretory diarrhea in humans.,"Guarino, Alfredo; Canani, Roberto Berni; Pozio, Edoardo; Terracciano, Luigi; Albano, Fabio; Mazzeo, Mario",Gastroenterology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130324/,562
25216,A Review of Microblogging Marketing Based on the Complex Network Theory,2011-11-12,"Fifteen years ago, the “tragedy of the anticommons” article warned that excessive patenting of biotech products and research methods could deter rather than stimulate invention, but little evidence was offered. Here, subsequent changes in patent law, public research support, and surveys of researchers are summarized. Results indicate the anticipated anticommons has not materialized significantly, and while ongoing monitoring is warranted, declining public research funding may necessitate more patenting to stimulate private investment.","Lesser, William",From Agriscience to Agribusiness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121752/,562
26701,Modeling Disease Spread at Global Mass Gatherings: Data Requirements and Challenges,2016-05-17,"Viral diseases remain a major cause of death worldwide. Despite advances in vaccine and antiviral drug technology, each year over three million people die from a range of viral infections. Predominant viruses include human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis viruses, and gastrointestinal and respiratory viruses. Now more than ever, robust, easily mobilised and cost-effective antiviral strategies are needed to combat both known and emerging disease threats. RNA interference and small interfering (si)RNAs were initially hailed as a ‘‘magic bullet’’, due to their ability to inhibit the synthesis of any protein via the degradation of its complementary messenger RNA sequence. Of particular interest was the potential for attenuating viral mRNAs contributing to the pathogenesis of disease that were not able to be targeted by vaccines or antiviral drugs. However, it was soon discovered that delivery of active siRNA molecules to the infection site in vivo was considerably more difficult than anticipated, due to a number of physiological barriers in the body. This spurred a new wave of investigation into nucleic acid delivery vehicles which could facilitate safe, targeted and effective administration of the siRNA as therapy. Amongst these, cationic polymer delivery vehicles have emerged as a promising candidate as they are low-cost and easy to produce at an industrial scale, and bind to the siRNA by nonspecific electrostatic interactions. These nanoparticles (NPs) can be functionally designed to target the infection site, improve uptake in infected cells, release the siRNA inside the endosome and facilitate delivery into the cell cytoplasm. They may also have the added benefit of acting as adjuvants. This chapter provides a background around problems associated with the translation of siRNA as antiviral treatments, reviews the progress made in nucleic acid therapeutics and discusses current methods and progress in overcoming these challenges. It also addresses the importance of combining physicochemical characterisation of the NPs with in vitro and in vivo data.","Reynolds, Nicholas; Dearnley, Megan; Hinton, Tracey M.",Polymeric Gene Delivery Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123685/,562
26851,Software Support for Common Criteria Security Development Process on the Example of a Data Diode,2014,"Nutrition exists when food security is combined with a sanitary environment, adequate health services, and proper care and feeding practices to ensure a healthy life for all household members. Despite increased attention to undernutrition, it remains a devastating multi-faceted problem for infants, young children, and women around the world, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and long-term disability. Undernutrition can also lead to poor health into adulthood, which affects social and economic development of nations. On the other end of the malnutrition spectrum, overweight and obesity are growing problems, linked to changing diets and activity patterns, which also lead to serious health problems and impact the economies of nations. This chapter attempts to unpack the importance of food and agriculture policies on nutrition outcomes and why engagement of food and public health systems remain critically important. External pressures, such as climate variability and population growth, that tax these systems are discussed, as well as the globalization of our food system and why that has shifted dietary patterns and nutrition and health status trends. The multi-sectoral integration of food and health systems and its importance to improve nutrition is demonstrated through three models. Three very brief case studies are presented that help exemplify some of the food and health system trends that influence policy and ultimately, nutrition outcomes.","Fanzo, Jessica",International Food Law and Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123872/,562

Das Rezept für eine dauerhafte und erfolgreiche Krisenprävention lautet: Jeden Tag nach vorne schauen, Risiken wahrnehmen, richtig abschätzen und möglichst neutralisieren. Systematische Verfahren zur Früherkennung von Warnsignalen spielen dabei eine wichtige Rolle. Krisenpotenziale erkennen und antizipieren, Infrastrukturen schaffen, Abläufe einüben und Mitarbeiter schulen sind gute Voraussetzungen, um in krisenhaften Situationen souverän zu agieren, statt in einen Schockzustand zu verfallen. Leider sind noch zu viele Unternehmen und Organisationen von diesem Ideal weit entfernt. Krisen gefährden außerdem immer das Image und die Reputation eines Unternehmens. In diesem Zusammenhang darf das mediale Interesse nicht unterschätzt werden. Die Mediengesellschaft, in der wir leben, liebt und produziert deswegen unentwegt große und kleine Krisen, indem sie schlicht jede Gelegenheit zur Berichterstattung nutzt. Schließlich ist die Krise – mehr noch als die bloß schlechte Nachricht – ein hervorragend verkäufliches Gut (Mörle 2004). Leider verfügen noch zu wenig Unternehmen über professionelle Konzepte, die auch den Aspekt der Krisenkommunikation hinreichend berücksichtigen.

33051,Non-Functional Requirements Orienting the Development of Socially Responsible Software,2020-05-05,"Splicing systems are generative mechanisms introduced by Tom Head in 1987 to model the biological process of DNA recombination. The computational engine of a splicing system is the “splicing operation”, a cut-and-paste binary string operation defined by a set of “splicing rules”, quadruples [Formula: see text] where [Formula: see text] are words over an alphabet [Formula: see text]. For two strings [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], applying the splicing rule r produces the string [Formula: see text]. In this paper we focus on a particular type of splicing systems, called (i, j) semi-simple splicing systems, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], wherein all splicing rules r have the property that the two strings in positions i and j in r are singleton letters, while the other two strings are empty. The language generated by such a system consists of the set of words that are obtained starting from an initial set called “axiom set”, by iteratively applying the splicing rules to strings in the axiom set as well as to intermediately produced strings. We consider semi-simple splicing systems where the axiom set is a regular language, and investigate the descriptional complexity of such systems in terms of the size of the minimal deterministic finite automata that recognize the languages they generate.","Kari, Lila; Ng, Timothy",Developments in Language Theory,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247869/,562
33052,Can We Design Software as We Talk?: A Research Idea,2020-05-05,"A distance between two languages is a useful tool to measure the language similarity, and is closely related to the intersection problem as well as the shortest string problem. A parsing expression grammar (PEG) is an unambiguous grammar such that the choice operator selects the first matching in PEG while it can be ambiguous in a context-free grammar. PEGs are also closely related to top-down parsing languages. We consider two problems on parsing expression languages (PELs). One is the r-shortest string problem that decides whether or not a given PEL contains a string of length shorter than r. The other problem is the edit-distance problem of PELs with respect to other language families such as finite languages or regular languages. We show that the r-shortest string problem and the edit-distance problem with respect to finite languages are NEXPTIME-complete, and the edit-distance problem with respect to regular languages is undecidable. In addition, we prove that it is impossible to compute a length bound [Formula: see text] of a PEG G such that L(G) has a string w of length at most [Formula: see text].","Cheon, Hyunjoon; Han, Yo-Sub",Developments in Language Theory,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247870/,562

It is demonstrated that their expressive power is located strictly between the local tree grammars and the regular tree grammars. A decision procedure for the problem of determining whether a tree substitution grammar generates a local tree language is provided. Unfortunately, the class of tree substitution languages is neither closed under union, nor intersection, nor complements. Indeed unions of tree substitution languages even generate an infinite hierarchy.

33074,Scheduling Processes Without Sudden Termination,2020-05-05,"We study the problem of finding a given [Formula: see text] matrix as a submatrix of a given Boolean matrix. Three variants are considered: search for a matching submatrix of any area, of minimum area, or of maximum area. The problem relates to 2D pattern matching, and to fields such as data mining, where the search for submatrices plays an important role. Besides these connections, the problem itself is very natural and its investigation helps to demonstrate differences between search tasks in one-dimensional and multidimensional topologies. Our results reveal that the problem variants are of different complexities. First, we show that given an [Formula: see text] Boolean matrix, the any variant can be solved in [Formula: see text] time for any given [Formula: see text] matrix, but requires various strategies for different [Formula: see text] matrices. This contrasts with the complexity of the task over matrices with entries from the set [Formula: see text], where the problem is Triangle Finding-hard and hence no algorithm with similar running time is known for it. Then, we show that the minimization variant in the case of Boolean matrices can also be solved in [Formula: see text] time. Finally, in contrast, we prove Triangle Finding-hardness for the maximization variant and show that there is a rectangular matrix multiplication-based algorithm solving it in [Formula: see text] time.","Průša, Daniel; Wehar, Michael",Developments in Language Theory,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7247910/,562

50503,Research on the Algorithm of Text Data Classification Based on Artificial Intelligence,2020-06-13,"This chapter explains why gender diversity is beneficial for organizations and institutions. The discussion begins with defining gender diversity in a way that goes beyond the discourse around men and women to include non-binary gender identities, cultural symbols, and archetypes. It provides a focus on the need to include those marginalized at the leadership level and at all levels of privilege and power in society. It illustrates the unconscious bias of decision makers which hampers diversity and inclusion. The chapter argues that the different genders come from different social contexts and experience distinctly different challenges, and thus lead in different ways. As a result, different leadership styles, lenses and approaches to policy and to how people work and engage with one another emerge from homophily compared to diversity in leadership teams and networks. Diversity enhances innovation and the ability of human and biological systems to thrive and evolve. Furthermore, diversity is important for organizations to grasp and embrace the diverse needs and interests of those served. Gender diversity therefore is essential not only for equality but for leadership effectiveness and organizational impact, thereby enhancing psychological, societal, and planetary health. Finally, the chapter provides recommendations for organizations and institutions to uncover unconscious bias and take the appropriate steps to enhance gender diversity, equality, and inclusion.","Krause, Wanda; Hartney, Elizabeth",Exploring Gender at Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991186/,562

A world where music does not have an environmental impact is a world without music. I do not want a world without music, and it is not my intention to ruin one of life’s great pleasures – the enjoyment of music – by pointing out its environmental impact. But music can be framed not just in terms of its value, but also its cost - including the whole range of production and consumption behaviours that those who participate in music often take for granted. This chapter therefore explores three key sectors of the music industries – recorded music, live music, and musical instruments – and considers them from the perspective of environmental sustainability and political ecology. It also offers a critique of the assumption that the growth of these industries is an unquestionable good.","Brennan, Matt",Cultural Industries and the Environmental Crisis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991203/,562
50519,Study on the Preparation of the Precursor of the Li-ion Screen Based on Big Data Analysis,2020-06-13,"Emma, an elementary school technology specialist, learns that she is inheriting $20,000. She now has the pleasant problem of deciding what to do with it. Her first thought was to invest it all in technology stocks. But then she learned some basic rules about investing which stressed to start early, buy and hold, and to diversify. That last rule – to diversify – discouraged Emma from placing all of the money into one sector. Different forms of saving involve a tradeoff between risk and reward. You should identify the level of risk that fits your comfort zone. Some teachers make the mistake of keeping all of their money in the safest forms of assets. The safest kinds of savings include savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market mutual funds, and bonds. To gain greater returns, however, requires allocating some savings into higher risk assets including stocks and real estate. How do we get a good return while managing the risk? Investing in diversified mutual funds might be just the ticket. Remember, setting up an emergency fund in a savings account of money market mutual fund is like an insurance policy. It allows you to handle financial emergencies without dipping into retirement savings.","Hunt Ferrarini, Tawni; Niederjohn, M.

Many people today spend a large part of their life at work. In some cases, many are working 40 hours a week plus. Today, both men and women are in the workforce. Single People, Single people with children, and Married couples with or without children are working and trying to balance home and work–life while paying the bills. Due to changes in the economy and increases in the cost of living, many people have to work to support their families. There is also a segment of the population that must care for elderly parents. Research shows that some women indicate that the care of family has affected their ability to advance in their careers. How are workers managing it all? What role do employers play? How are families affected? What are some of the options to help with work–life balance? What about work–life integration? How do men and women see the work–life balance?

During the time I was there, I frequently grabbed a Coke during the lunch break. One day I was surprised to find that I was asked to double the regular price on account for the unusual heat. It was an interesting, textbook-like price differentiation practice, which I had only read about so far. A long time ago, the Coca-Cola Company tested vending machines which automatically adjusted prices according to the temperature in several markets. The initiative failed miserably due to bad publicity, as consumers felt ripped off by such a pricing scheme. Even if customers accept pricing by temperature, it might not be in the best interest of the company to implement this, because the optimal price depends on the underlying demand curve. In hindsight, I am not regretful about paying the extra price for the Coke in Tehran.

Some elements of continuity remained in US policy throughout: antagonism towards Cuba, preoccupation with the ‘drugs war’, and the question of immigration. Britain retained a certain scepticism about these concerns, and in the 1980s tensions with Washington arose over both the Malvinas/Falklands war and the US invasion of Grenada. After 1989 US dominance in Latin America was challenged from within the region, especially from Venezuela and other left-wing governments (the so-called ‘Pink Tide’), from the rise of China, and from the growing globalisation of trade, industry, and finance.

Policy-makers should, therefore, plan and implement pro-growth structural changes to institutions and culture that account for their coevolution process.

The objective of the present study was to explore whether parents’ perceived increases in and overall levels of parenting stress during the pandemic were associated with feeding practices and perceptions of child eating behaviors. METHODS: Parents (n = 284) of children 4–6 years completed a cross-sectional online survey between March and April 2020. Perceived changes in parenting stress during the onset of the pandemic, levels of parenting stress during the pandemic, child feeding practices, and children's eating behaviors were assessed. We used ordinal linear regression to examine whether changes in and levels of parenting stress predicted use of controlling or responsive feeding practices and perceptions of child eating behaviors. RESULTS: The majority (63.7%, n = 181) of parents indicated their family was moderately or extremely emotionally affected by the pandemic and 56.7% (n = 161) indicated pandemic-related precautions had been moderately or extremely challenging. Perceived increases in parenting stress during the onset of the pandemic were associated with more frequent use of food as a reward (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.04–1.26) and for emotional regulation (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.04–1.23), as well as greater child food responsiveness (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.84–0.99) and slow eating (OR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.84–1.00). Higher overall levels of parenting stress were associated with more frequent use of food as a reward (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.08) and for emotional regulation (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03–1.08) but also with use of pressuring feeding practices (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01–1.06) and encouraging a balanced diet (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01–1.06). Higher overall levels of parenting stress were associated with greater child food fussiness (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.08), enjoyment of food (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.07), and satiety responsiveness (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93–0.98). CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, parenting stress predicted parents’ use of food for emotional and behavioral regulation and various domains of children's eating behaviors.

Methods All 32 pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital in Wuhan during the outbreak from January 20 to March 18, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed for the clinical records, laboratory tests, chest CT scans, and neonatal outcomes. Results There were 17 of the 32 patients (53%) with no subjective symptoms before admission, and 13 (41%) remained asymptomatic throughout hospitalization. There were 28 patients (88%) showing typical radiographic evidence of pneumonia on chest CT. The patients with COVID-19 were found in an increased risk of thromboembolism with much higher D-dimer levels than uninfected pregnant women. One neonate with asphyxia and positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was reported. Conclusions The considerable asymptomatic proportion of pregnant women with COVID-19 indicates symptom-based screening would miss a number of cases.

MOH published articles in newspapers, prepared guidelines and hospitals were assigned to admit patients of H1N1. All the patients suspected of H1N1 were admitted and isolated as per the guidelines. This report describes clinical features and outcomes of 65 laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. METHODS From July to October 2009, 101 cases suspected of suffering from Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) virus were admitted and isolated in Al Nahdha Hospital in Muscat. All the patients on admission were tested for H1N1, by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immediately on admission, all of them were treated with Oseltamivir and antibiotics. RESULTS Of the 65 confirmed cases of H1N1, 53.84% were males. Age of patients varied from 14 to 60 years, while 53.7% were aged between 31 to 55 years. Results showed that 70.8% had underlying co-morbidity; among which diabetes mellitus and respiratory illness were common. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (95%) and cough (94%). Also, 20% of the patients had leucopenia and 10.8% leucocytosis. Deranged LFT was observed in 26 (42.6%) of cases while 14 (21.5%) had hypokalemia. One patient (0.01%) with underlying severe co-morbidity died. Two patients (3.1%) had ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome); both recovered. Radiological infiltration was documented in 84.6% of cases, with lower zone involvement as the common finding. Hospital stay was between 1 to 12 days, 49.2% of patients were discharged within 3 days. CONCLUSION Mainly adult population was affected during this epidemic. H1N1 infection can lead to severe illness. Incidence of H1N1 was higher in patients with underlying co-morbidity.

86407,Circulating neutrophil transcriptome may reveal intracranial aneurysm signature.,2018,"BACKGROUND Cognitive Adaptation Training is a psychosocial intervention that focuses on reducing the negative effects of cognitive disorders, especially executive functions such as planning and targeted action. International research has shown that Cognitive Adaptation Training enhances multiple aspects of daily functioning in people with severe mental illnesses. Despite this evidence, implementation of the intervention into routine care remains a challenge. OBJECTIVE In this implementation research, a newly developed implementation program based on previous experience and scientific literature, is tested. The primary aim of this research is to assess the effectiveness of the implementation program. The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the factors that impede or facilitate the implementation of Cognitive Adaptation Training. METHODS To test the effectiveness of the implementation program, a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing the implementation program to a single training program in four mental health institutions in The Netherlands. Focus groups, semistructured interviews, and questionnaires were used at multiple levels of service delivery (service user, professional, team, organization) to identify factors that may hamper or facilitate implementation. The RE-AIM framework was applied to measure the implementation effectiveness. Following this framework, the primary outcomes were Reach, Intervention Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. These are assessed before, during, and after implementation. The research had a total duration of 14 months, with a follow-up measurement at 14 months. Data will be analyzed using multilevel modeling. RESULTS The study was funded in April 2018. Data collection occurred between November 2018 and January 2020. In total, 21 teams of 4 mental health institutions agreed to participate. Data analysis is ongoing and results are expected to be published in December 2020. CONCLUSIONS This implementation research may provide important information about the implementation of psychosocial interventions in practice and may result in a program that is useful for Cognitive Adaptation Training, and possibly for psychosocial interventions in general.

METHODS To this end, the sleep characteristics of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., 2018 National Health Interview Survey, n = 19,433) were compared to the sleep characteristics of a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults recruited via Luc.id, an online survey sampling company, during the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., 2020 Luc.id, n = 2059). RESULTS While average sleep duration did not change between 2018 and 2020, the prevalence of both shorter and longer than recommended sleep duration were greater in 2020. Moreover, the number of days with difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and not feeling rested was greater in 2020 than 2018. Adults younger than 60 had larger differences than those 60 or older. CONCLUSIONS Sleep health in U.S. adults was worse in 2020 than in 2018, particularly in adults younger than 60. Findings highlight sleep as target in future research and interventions seeking to understand and reduce the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hisler, Garrett C; Twenge, Jean M",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773474/,562
93673,Opportunities for computer support for systematic reviewing - a gap analysis.,2018,"Vaccines are typically injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly for stimulation of immune responses. The success of this requires efficient drainage of vaccine to lymph nodes where antigen presenting cells can interact with lymphocytes for generation of the wanted immune responses. The strength and the type of immune responses induced also depend on the density or frequency of interactions as well as the microenvironment, especially the content of cytokines. As only a minute fraction of peripherally injected vaccines reaches the lymph nodes, vaccinations of mice and humans were performed by direct injection of vaccine into inguinal lymph nodes, i.e. intralymphatic injection. In man, the procedure is guided by ultrasound. In mice, a small (5-10 mm) incision is made in the inguinal region of anesthetized animals, the lymph node is localized and immobilized with forceps, and a volume of 10-20 μl of the vaccine is injected under visual control. The incision is closed with a single stitch using surgical sutures. Mice were vaccinated with plasmid DNA, RNA, peptide, protein, particles, and bacteria as well as adjuvants, and strong improvement of immune responses against all type of vaccines was observed. The intralymphatic method of vaccination is especially appropriate in situations where conventional vaccination produces insufficient immunity or where the amount of available vaccine is limited.","Johansen, Pål; Kündig, Thomas M",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/51031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513675/,562
94125,China's vaccine gambit.,2020-12-11,"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, millions of infants are unprotected against immune-preventable diseases due to interruptions in vaccination services. The direct effects of the pandemic, as well as the non-pharmacological interventions for its containment, mitigation and suppression adopted by many countries, have affected their vaccination programs. We conducted an ecological study analyzing the performance of the vaccination program in the Dominican Republic before (2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020). We compared annual public coverage data, analyzed trends and changes in coverage, dropout rate, and number of partially and unvaccinated infants by geographic area and COVID-19 incidence rate. Compared to baseline, coverage for all vaccines decreased by 10.4 (SD, 3.6) percent; among these, coverage for the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine decreased from 90.1% in 2019 to 81.1% in 2020. The number of partially vaccinated (n = 34,185) and unvaccinated (n = 5,593) infants increased 66% and 376%, respectively. The slight increase in the annual dropout rate (1.1%) was directly proportional to the number of COVID-19 cases per month. We found a significant association between the annual absolute change of Penta3 and the subnational Human Development Index. The pandemic significantly weakened the performance of the routine vaccination program. Interventions are needed to recover and maintain lost vaccination coverage, reducing the risk of outbreaks of preventable diseases, especially in those provinces with less human development.","Colomé-Hidalgo, Manuel; Campos, Juan Donado; Gil de Miguel, Ángel",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1972708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34644243/,562
94953,The Pharmacological Activities of Licorice.,2015,"BACKGROUND Wilms tumor is the most frequent renal malignancy in children. YTHDF1 is associated with the development of several kinds of cancers, yet whether common variants of the YTHDF1 gene influence Wilms tumor risk is unknown. We present, here, a hospital-based case-control study specifically designed to investigate the role of YTHDF1 genetic variants on Wilms tumor. METHODS We successfully genotyped samples of 408 Wilms tumor cases and 1198 controls which were collected from five hospitals across China. The unconditional logistic regression was adopted to analyze the contributions of YTHDF1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the risk of Wilms tumor. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were generated to evaluate the conferring risk of YTHDF1 gene SNPs (rs6011668 C>T, rs6090311 A>G). RESULTS Neither of the two SNPs could contribute to the risk of Wilms tumor. A negative association was also detected in the combined effects of protective genotypes on Wilms tumor risk. The stratification analysis revealed that compared with those with CC genotype, rs6011668 CT/TT genotype was associated with increased Wilms tumor risk in those ≤18 months (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.02-2.30, p = 0.038), and with decreased Wilms tumor risk in those >18 months (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50-0.97, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION Our present work sheds some light on the potential role of YTHDF1 gene polymorphisms on Wilms tumor risk.","Liu, Yanfei; Lin, Huiran; Hua, Rui-Xi; Zhang, Jiao; Cheng, Jiwen; Li, Suhong; Zhou, Haixia; Zhuo, Zhenjian; Bian, Jun",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151473/,562

We describe our technique for THA via the HAA in hips with Crowe type-IV developmental dysplasia and report the mid-term outcomes of cases that were performed over 5 consecutive years. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated a continuous series of 8 hips (6 patients) with Crowe type-IV dysplasia; the patient ages ranged from 44 ± 20 years (range, 17 to 65 years) at the index THA. All of the patients received uncemented implants via the HAA on a traction table to restore the hip center of rotation to the true acetabulum. Femoral head autografts (FHAs) were used to increase acetabular coverage in 6 hips, and subtrochanteric shortening osteotomies (SSOs) were performed in 5 hips. Patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. RESULTS There were no revisions, deaths, dislocations, or infections. Two hips (25%) had intraoperative complications, and 1 hip (13%) had a postoperative complication that required reoperation without implant removal. All of the hips were assessed clinically and radiographically at 4 ± 1 years (range, 2 to 6 years). The modified Harris hip score (mHHS) improved from 33 ± 7 to 90 ± 7, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) improved from 53 ± 14 to 89 ± 6; the postoperative leg-length discrepancy was 3.2 mm (range, -10 to 20 mm). None of the hips had osteolysis or radiolucent lines of >2 mm. CONCLUSIONS THA via the HAA on a traction table for hips with Crowe type-IV dysplasia yielded satisfactory mid-term outcomes. Both FHA and SSO can be adequately performed via the HAA to help restore the hip center of rotation to the true acetabulum. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Therapeutic Level IV.

131478,Embroidered archimedean spiral electrodes for contactless prosthetic control.,2017,"BACKGROUND Hemorrhage is a leading cause of potentially preventable death in both civilian and military trauma patients. Animal data have shown that hemostatic bandages reduce hemorrhage and improve survival. This article reports recent clinical observations regarding the efficacy and evolution of use of two new hemostatic bandages employed in the global war on terrorism. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort review of soldiers treated with either the QuikClot or HemCon hemostatic bandages between April and October 2006. Hemostatic dressings were placed on wounds either in the field or at the combat support hospital (CSH). RESULTS During the 6-month study period, 1691 trauma patients were admitted to the CSH. Fifty uses of hemostatic dressings in 44 patients (2.6% of admissions) were identified. Forty patients were treated with HemCon dressings, three patients with QuikClot, and one with both QuikClot and HemCon. Eighteen percent of the dressings were used in the field, predominantly on extremity wounds (7/8). In contrast, most dressings used in the CSH were for truncal wounds (26/36 patients). Hemostatic dressings were applied to extremity wounds in prehospital and hospital settings, either alone or in conjunction with tourniquets. In surviving patients (95%), the treating surgeon determined that the hemorrhage was either stopped or greatly decreased by use of hemostatic dressings. Two of the four patients treated with QuikClot had burns from exothermic reactions, while no adverse reactions were noted with HemCon. CONCLUSIONS Hemostatic agents stop or decrease bleeding. Whereas HemCon appears to be safe, QuikClot may produce superficial burns. These new hemostatic agents have a place in the surgical armamentarium to assist in controlling internal hemorrhage from truncal and pelvic hemorrhage, especially during damage-control surgery.","Cox, E Darrin; Schreiber, Martin A; McManus, John; Wade, Charles E; Holcomb, John B",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01988.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19954487/,562

The concept of senescence is evolved, and the novel understanding of senescence-associated reprogramming/stemness has emerged. This new concept emphasizes senescence as not only cell cycle arrest but describes that subsets of senescent cells induced by chemotherapy can re-enter cell cycles, proliferate rapidly, and acquire ""stemness"" status. Cancer therapeutics, including chemo-radiation triggers toxicity effects through damaging mitochondria, primarily through the upregulation of mtROS production leading to subsequent mtDNA and telomeric DNA damage elicitng DNA damage responses (DDR). The ultimate goal of this review is to highlight the new concept of senescence-associated stemness that is induced by cancer treatment and its adverse effects on the vascular system. We will describe how chemo-radiation exerts toxicity effects by simultaneously producing reactive oxygen species in mitochondria and promoting DDR in the nucleus. We discuss the potential of clinical targeting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase which might prevent downstream mitochondrial dysfunction and confer protection to cancer survivors. Overall we emphasize the importance of recognizing the consequences of cardio-toxic effects of several cancer treatments and therefore developing personalized therapeutic approaches to screen for inflammatory and cardiac testing for better patient survival.","Dominic, Abishai; Hamilton, Dale; Abe, Jun-Ichi",Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-020-02313-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079380/,562
162224,Student Response Systems in Remote Teaching,2021,"Background: It is well-documented that the mental health of pregnant and postpartum women is essential for maternal, child, and family well-being. Of major public health concern is the perinatal mental health impacts that may occur during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is essential to explore the symptom experience and predictors of mental health status, including the relationship between media use and mental health. Materials and Methods: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the experiences of pregnant and postpartum women (n = 524) in the United States in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online observational study collected psychosocial quantitative and qualitative survey data in adult pregnant and postpartum (up to 6 months postdelivery) women in April-June 2020. Results: Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate predictors of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The most common predictors were job insecurity, family concerns, eating comfort foods, resilience/adaptability score, sleep, and use of social and news media. Qualitative themes centered on pervasive uncertainty and anxiety; grief about losses; gratitude for shifting priorities; and use of self-care methods including changing media use. Conclusions: This study provides information to identify risk for anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms in perinatal women during acute public health situations. Women with family and job concerns and low resilience/adaptability scores seem to be at high risk of psychological sequelae. Although use of social media is thought to improve social connectedness, our results indicate that increased media consumption is related to increased anxiety symptoms.","Kinser, Patricia A; Jallo, Nancy; Amstadter, Ananda B; Thacker, Leroy R; Jones, Evelyn; Moyer, Sara; Rider, Amy; Karjane, Nicole; Salisbury, Amy L",Journal of women's health,https://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2020.8866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33844945/,562
162276,Mitigating Cognitive and Behavioural Biases During Pandemics Responses,2021,"BACKGROUND Single-legged hop tests are commonly used assessments in return to sport (RTS) testing after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Although these tests are commonly used, their predictive validity has not yet been established. PURPOSE To determine the strength of association between hop testing and RTS, knee reinjury, subjective report of knee function, and posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis (PTOA) after primary ACLR. Secondarily, to determine whether hop testing is able to predict a favorable result on the same outcome variables. STUDY DESIGN Systematic review. METHODS A systematic, computer-assisted literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed when conducting and reporting this review. Primary outcome variables for this review were self-report of knee function, return to preinjury level of activity, presence of reinjury, and presence of PTOA. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence tool was used to assess the level of evidence for each included study. Quality assessment of each included study was performed through use of a modified Downs and Black scale. Available metrics were tabulated based on outcome variables. RESULTS Overall, 21 studies (4476 patients) met inclusion for this review. The majority of evidence (95.2%) was of moderate to high methodologic quality. The most commonly associated outcome measure was the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.20 to 0.60. The strength of association between the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and hop testing ranged from -0.10 to 0.62 in 4 studies. In all, 10 studies examined the relationship between hop testing and RTS, with variable association statistics reported. No meaningful association was found between hop testing and knee reinjury in 2 studies. Worse preoperative hop testing was associated with PTOA in 1 study. CONCLUSION Hop testing appears to possess fair association to subjective report of knee function measured by the KOOS and IKDC and a patient's ability to RTS after ACLR. Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between hop testing and PTOA and knee reinjury. Predictive validity cannot be established based on available literature.","Losciale, Justin M; Bullock, Garrett; Cromwell, Christina; Ledbetter, Leila; Pietrosimone, Laura; Sell, Timothy C",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546519838794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063403/,562

OBJECTIVES The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of epidural-related intrapartum fever on maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHODS OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, the Cochrane Library, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, and clinical trial registries were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational cohort studies from inception to November 2018. A total of 761 studies were identified with 100 eligible for full-text review. Only articles investigating the relationship between EA and maternal fever during labor were eligible for inclusion. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool and National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool. Two meta-analyses - one each for the RCT and observational cohort groups - were performed using the random-effects model of Mantel-Haenszel to produce summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% CI. RESULTS Twelve RCTs and 16 observational cohort studies involving 579,157 parturients were included. RRs for maternal fever for the RCT and cohort analyses were 3.54 (95% CI 2.61-4.81) and 5.60 (95% CI 4.50-6.97), respectively. Meta-analyses of RR for maternal infection in both groups were infeasible given few occurrences. Meta-analysis of data from observational studies showed an increased risk for maternal antibiotic treatment in the epidural group (RR 2.60; 95% CI 1.31-5.17). For both analyses, neonates born to women with an epidural were not evaluated more often for suspected sepsis. Neither analysis reported an increased rate of neonatal bacteremia or neonatal antibiotic treatment after EA, although data precluded conclusiveness. CONCLUSION EA increases the risk of intrapartum fever and maternal antibiotic treatment. However, a definite conclusion on whether EA increases the risk for a proven maternal and/or neonatal bacteremia cannot be drawn due to the low quality of data. Further research on whether epidural-related intrapartum fever is of infectious origin or not is therefore needed.","Jansen, Sophie; Lopriore, Enrico; Naaktgeboren, Christiana; Sueters, Marieke; Limpens, Jacqueline; van Leeuwen, Elisabeth; Bekker, Vincent",Neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000504805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31991422/,562

Most currently-used tools use short-term and surrogate outcomes. We explored the evidence base in the literature on available pre-treatment, prognostic models built around long-term survival and assess the accuracy, generalisability and clinical availability of these models. DESIGN Systematic literature review, pre-specified and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018086394). DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase and The Cochrane Library were searched from January 2000 through February 2018, using previously-tested search terms. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Inclusion required a multivariable model prognostic model for non-metastatic prostate cancer, using long-term survival data (defined as ≥5 years), which was not treatment-specific and usable at the point of diagnosis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Title, abstract and full-text screening were sequentially performed by three reviewers. Data extraction was performed for items in the CHecklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies checklist. Individual studies were assessed using the new Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool. RESULTS Database searches yielded 6581 studies after deduplication. Twelve studies were included in the final review. Nine were model development studies using data from over 231 888 men. However, only six of the nine studies included any conservatively managed cases and only three of the nine included treatment as a predictor variable. Every included study had at least one parameter for which there was high risk of bias, with failure to report accuracy, and inadequate reporting of missing data common failings. Three external validation studies were included, reporting two available models: The University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score and the Cambridge Prognostic Groups. Neither included treatment effect, and both had potential flaws in design, but represent the most robust and usable prognostic models currently available. CONCLUSION Few long-term prognostic models exist to inform decision-making at diagnosis of non-metastatic prostate cancer.

162773,ISG15 drives immune pathology and respiratory failure during viral infection,2020-04-14,"This article explores how competing actors established, spread, and challenged visual representations of the Chinese nation during the COVID-19 pandemic. It asks: how do official gatekeepers of meaning in China imbue their visual construction of a crisis-hit nation with pathos?;and what happens when their critics utilize the resulting repertoire of visual cues for their own ends? To answer these questions, the article first examines the visual libraries of nationalism and national crisis from which Chinese propaganda drew during the COVID-19 outbreak. It then analyses the struggles that ensued over such representations, specifically the use of national flags and the sentiments they elicit. The analysis traces representations of the flag of the People?s Republic of China (PRC) from an initial satirical portrayal in a Danish broadsheet to the angry Chinese backlashes that followed on social media, and it shows how the tensions over such portrayals became part of a meme war over the sovereignty of Hong Kong. The analysis shows how representations of the nation can become a matter of existential anxieties during a time of crisis, especially in highly networked communication environments where authoritative official actors and their supporters are no longer in control of the symbols they established as part of their ?emotional governance?.","Schneider, Florian",China Information,https://doi.org/10.1177/0920203x211034692,562
162853,An evaluation method of urban epidemic emergency response capability based on fuzzy logic,2021,"Objective: We aimed to evaluate the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of children with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), and to determine variations of the clinical presentation of the disease by age. Method: A total of 104 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged between 0-18 years were retrospectively analyzed. The study period was between March 15, 2020 and July 1, 2020. A confirmed COVID-19 was defined as a child who has positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The patients were analyzed in terms of demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging features, and clinical outcomes. Results: The median age (inter-quartile range) of the patients was 11.8 (8.4) years, and 53 (51%) were male. Ninety-eight (94%) of the patients had an epidemiological risk factor. The most frequent symptoms were cough (62%), fever (42%), and fatigue (33%). Seven patients (7%) were asymptomatic, 84 (81%) were mild, 9 (9%) were moderate, and 4 (4%) were in severe or critical condition. Ninety-eight (94%) of the patients underwent a chest x-ray, and 12% had pneumonia. The patients younger than 5 years were more likely to have fever (p = 0.019), rhinorrhea (p = 0.041), and diarrhea (p = 0.035). Muscle/join pain (26%), loss of smell/taste (20%), and headache (19%) were striking extrapulmonary symptoms in older patients. Only 8% of the patients were hospitalized, and 4% were admitted to the intensive care unit. No death occurred. Conclusion: The most of the pediatric COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms without pneumonia. They may not present with fever or cough which are considered characteristic symptoms of the disease and the frequency of signs and symptoms may vary by age. Children younger than 5 years old are more likely to have fever, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea. School-age children and adolescents may present with extrapulmonary symptoms such as muscle/join pain, smell/taste loss, and headache.","Besli, G. E.; Demir, S.

Cooperative Extension offers a potentially powerful context for DPP implementation, with a capacity to reach large and diverse populations. There is a critical need to understand the impact of the DPP when implemented with fidelity in Extension, as well as implementation barriers and facilitators. The objective of the present study was to evaluate barriers and facilitators of DPP implementation in Extension in Georgia. The present study was part of a 12-month, multi-site, hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial. The implementation evaluation utilized 3 qualitative semi-structured interviews (post-recruitment and mid- and post-implementation) with 12 Extension professionals implementing the DPP in 13 counties across all regions of Georgia. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to identify barriers and facilitators of DPP implementation in Extension. Interviews were coded deductively by 2 independent analysts based on CFIR constructs. Constructs were then rated (-2 to +2) to indicate their influence on implementation. Constructs with a strong influence on implementation were then evaluated for their influence on RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework domains. Preliminary analyses suggest that program length (Time [-2]) and the Intervention's Source (+2) from CDC had strong influences on Reach of the program;the DPP's Evidence Strength and Quality (+2) and the Tension for Change (+2) for more evidence-based Extension programming had strong positive influences on Adoption;and Networks and Communications (+2) had a strong positive influence on Implementation, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extension's infrastructure, culture, and need for evidence-based programming make it well-suited for DPP implementation. Results of this study can inform implementation strategies to improve the public health impact of DPP implementation in Extension in the future. University of Georgia Interdisciplinary Seed Grant.

The current review sought to synthesise empirical (qualitative and quantitative) evidence on this topic to inform the development of future mental health and wellbeing interventions for Australian adults. Systematic searches of health and behavioural science databases were conducted to identify studies on protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing in Australian adults. A total of 38 studies were included based on the following criteria: studies conducted in Australia from 2009 to present;articles written in English;articles which reported on empirical research, articles that were peer-reviewed, and research where study participants were Australian adults (>18 years). Data extraction was conducted using Covidence, and design quality was assessed according to the Levels of Evidence hierarchy. There was consistent evidence that components of social capital, physical and other lifestyle factors, individual attributes and creative arts constitute protective factors for mental and psychological wellbeing in Australian adults. The high prevalence of cross-sectional and self-report studies suggests more randomised and longitudinal research is needed. Additional qualitative research would facilitate a more detailed understanding of participants' lived experiences and perspectives. Existing evidence indicates a significant, positive relationship between social capital, physical and other lifestyle factors, individual attributes and creative arts engagement, and mental and psychological wellbeing among particular groups of Australian adults. Implications are considered for the development of interventions that promote mental health and wellbeing across a wide range of Australian regions and populations.

It becomes an unacceptable global threat to human lives. The COVID-19 has been known only worldwide in the last few months, but it is spreading in a speed of light from Wuhan, China, to the rest of the world. About 2 crore of people have been infected and more than 7 lakh of people have died worldwide till now due to the deadly SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are still no drugs exclusively available in the market for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, though supportive treatment of hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, favipiravir, and remdesivir have shown clinical evidences to treat COVID-19. Therefore, it is utmost importance for the medicinal chemists to design and discover novel drugs urgently to rescue or to protect the humanity worldwide from this deadly virus. However, lack of experimental evidences and understanding the behavior of the SARS-CoV-2 within this short period may hinder the process of drug discovery. Still a ray of hope resides in the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) as these are homologous. Therefore, depending on the established viral target proteins (spike protein, ACE-2, 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, helicase, as well as other viral proteins), novel chemical entities may be designed. In this context, several computational modeling approaches (generally structure-based modeling techniques) may be utilized which are cost-effective and less time-consuming. Different structure-based modeling techniques, namely, homology modeling, robust molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and structure-based pharmacophore mapping followed by in silico virtual screening, may be effective and fruitful approaches to design compounds against SARS-CoV-2. In this chapter, various structure-based drug design and discovery strategies from target identification that could be optimized against SARS-CoV-2 have been discussed in detail. Additionally, ongoing and previously reported computational modeling techniques performed by different groups of researchers on various SARS-CoV-2 target proteins have been highlighted elaborately. In addition to the identification techniques of drugs, this chapter also discloses their binding mode of action along with the pharmacokinetics and toxicity criteria computed by modeling techniques. This chapter, therefore, may be a stepping-stone for the researchers to open up a new horizon in the discovery of novel anti-coronavirus drugs in the future.","Adhikari, N.; Amin, S.

163332,Design and Development of Android Application for Virtual Birthday Present,2021,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is still threatening the world because of a possible resurgence. In the current situation that effective medical treatments such as antiviral drugs are not discovered yet, dynamical features of the epidemics should be clarified for establishing strategies for tracing, quarantine, isolation, and regulating social behavior of the public at appropriate costs. Here we propose a network model for SARS epidemics and discuss why superspreaders emerged and why SARS spread especially in hospitals, which were key factors of the recent outbreak. We suggest that superspreaders are biologically contagious patients, and they may amplify the spreads by going to potentially contagious places such as hospitals. To avoid mass transmission in hospitals, it may be a good measure to treat suspected cases without hospitalizing them. Finally, we indicate that SARS probably propagates in small-world networks associated with human contacts and that the biological nature of individuals and social group properties are factors more important than the heterogeneous rates of social contacts among individuals. This is in marked contrast with epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases or computer viruses to which scale-free network models often apply.","Masuda, Naoki; Konno, Norio; Aihara, Kazuyuki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0401598v3.pdf,562

163383,Masked face recognition using principal component analysis and deep learning,2021,"At least 62 million K-12 students in North America—disproportionately low-income children of color— have been physically out of school for over a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These children are at risk of significant academic, social, mental, and physical harm now and in the long-term. We review the literature about school safety and the conditions that shape families’ and teachers’ choices to return to in-person schooling. We identify four causes of schooling hesitancy in the U.S. even where schools can be safely reopened: high community transmission rates;the politicization of school re-openings;long-term racialized disinvestment in urban districts;and parents’ rational calculations about their family's vulnerability due to the social determinants of health. Given the deep interconnections between the social determinants of health and of learning, and between schooling hesitancy and community vulnerability, stark inequities in in-person schooling access and take-up are likely to persist. We recommend that school districts invest in scientifically-based facilities upgrades, increased nursing and counseling staffing, and preparation for schools to serve as pediatric vaccination sites. School districts should also apply lessons from public health about addressing vaccine hesitancy to the challenge of schooling hesitancy by investing time in humble listening to parents and teachers about their concerns.","Levinson, Meira Geller Alan C.; Allen, Joseph G.",The Lancet Regional Health - Americas,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100032,562
163444,Entity-Based Knowledge Graph Information Retrieval for Biomedical Articles,2021,"While modern clinical practices like cesarean sections and perinatal antibiotics have improved infant survival, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics alters intestinal microbiota and causes dysbiosis. Infants exposed to perinatal antibiotics have an increased likelihood of life-threatening infections, including pneumonia. Here, we investigated how gut microbiota sculpt pulmonary immune responses, promoting recovery and resolution of infection in newborn rhesus macaques. Early-life antibiotic exposure, mirroring current clinical practices, interrupted the maturation of intestinal commensal bacteria and disrupted the developmental trajectory of the pulmonary immune system as assessed by single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of the pulmonary immune response. Early-life antibiotic exposure rendered newborn macaques susceptible to bacterial pneumonia, mediated by profound changes in neutrophil senescence, inflammatory signaling, and macrophage dysfunction. Pathogenic reprogramming of pulmonary immunity was reflected by a hyperinflammatory signature in all pulmonary immune cell subsets. Distinct patterns of immunoparalysis, including dysregulated antigen presentation in alveolar macrophages, impaired costimulatory function in T helper cells, and dysfunctional cytotoxic responses in natural killer (NK) cells, were coupled with a global loss of tissue-protective, homeostatic pathways in lungs of dysbiotic newborns. Fecal microbiota transfer corrected the broad immune maladaptations and protected against severe pneumonia. These data demonstrate the importance of intestinal microbiota in programming pulmonary immunity. Gut microbiota promote balance between pathways driving tissue repair and inflammatory responses, thereby leading to clinical recovery from infection in infants.

163484,Realtime Face Mask Detection using Machine Learning,2021,"Objective: To investigate dynamics in a core aspect of gender (in)equality in intimate relationships - namely couples' division of housework and childcare - during the Corona crisis. Background: The present study responds to public concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic might have triggered a backlash in gender equality. Method: Our descriptive analysis is based on pre-release data from the German Family Panel (pairfam;Wave 12) and its supplementary COVID-19 web-survey (n=3,108). Results: We observe no fundamental changes in established aggregate-level patterns of couples' division of labor, but some shift towards the extremes ('traditional' and `role reversal') of the distribution. Regarding changes within couples, there is an almost equal split between those in which the female partner's share in housework and childcare increased and those in which it decreased. Particularly in previously more egalitarian arrangements, a substantial proportion of women is now more likely to be primarily responsible for everything. If male partners increased their relative contribution to housework and childcare, they rarely moved beyond the threshold of an equal split. Changes in employment hours were associated with adaptations of men's, but not women's, relative contribution to domestic and family responsibilities. Conclusion: Our findings neither support the notion of a 'patriarchal pandemic', nor do they indicate that the Corona crisis might have fostered macro-level trends of gender convergence. We rather observe heterogeneous responses of couples to the 'Corona shock'.","Hank, K.; Steinbach, A.",Jfr-Journal of Family Research,https://doi.org/10.20377/jfr-488,562

These structures are deep and respond quickly, making them difficult to study during ongoing speech. Recent techniques begin to address this problem, but yield temporally broad responses with consequently ambiguous neural origins. Here we describe a method that pairs re-synthesized “peaky” speech with deconvolution analysis of EEG recordings. We show that in adults with normal hearing, the method quickly yields robust responses whose component waves reflect activity from distinct subcortical structures spanning auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands, and discuss important practical considerations such as talker choice. The peaky speech method holds promise as a tool for investigating speech encoding and processing, and for clinical applications.","Polonenko, Melissa J; Maddox, Ross K",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.20.258301,562

Stress severity also correlates with all burnout parameters: exhaustion (r=0.737, p=0.000), depersonalization (r=0.342, p=0.000), and belief in personal achievement (r=-0.417, p=0.000). The perception of pandemics as threatening events is significantly associated with exhaustionm (r=0.458, p=0.000), depersonalization (r=0.133, p= 0.036), and belief in personal achievement (r=-0.152, p=0.016).The feeling of uncertainty from the pandemic is statistically significantly associated with exhaustion (r=0.242, p=0.000), while the feeling of control over the pandemic is positively associated with belief in personal achievements (r=0.129, p=0.042) and negatively associated with exhaustion (r=-0.161, p=0.011) and depersonalization (r=-0.125, p=0.049).ConclusionsUncertainty and a sense of threat from the coronavirus and the pandemic are significant factors of stress and emotional burnout for health workers.

Mobile robotic systems inherently offer the potential for minimizing the amount of direct human-to-human interactions within the parcel delivery process. In this paper, we apply a system-level perspective for identifying key challenges and promising solution approaches for modeling, analysis, and optimization of UAV-aided parcel delivery. We present a system-of-systems model for UAV-enhanced parcel delivery to cope with higher capacity requirements induced by the COVID-19. The proposed system-of-systems consists of various complex aspects such as assigning and distributing delivery jobs, establishing and maintaining reliable communication links between the vehicles, as well as path planning and mobility control. In a proof of concept evaluation, we simulate the logistics performance and network communications of a hybrid delivery fleet composed of ground and aerial vehicles operating under pandemic induced constraints, such as the prioritization of time-critical deliveries like medical goods. Results indicate that network requirements for reliable communications within the delivery fleet can be met by existing network communications approaches. Furthermore, gains in delivery capacity induced by drone usage and a trade-off caused by prioritizing time-critical goods, therefore, resulting in a penalty for regular deliveries, are observed. © 2021 IEEE.","Patchou, M.; Sliwa, B.; Wietfeld, C.","15th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference, SysCon 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/syscon48628.2021.9447142,562
163834,Propagation Prediction of COVID-19 Based on Immune Differential Evolution Algorithm and Dynamic DSEIR Model,2021,"In a recent study, we reported that certain anti-spike antibodies of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV viruses can have a pathogenic effect through binding to sick lung epithelium cells and misleading immune responses to attack self-cells. We termed this new pathogenic mechanism “Antibody Dependent Auto-Attack” (ADAA). This study explores a drug candidate for prevention and treatment of such ADAA-based diseases. The drug candidate is a formulation comprising N-acetylneuraminic acid methyl ester (NANA-Me), an analog of N-acetylneuraminic acid. NANA-Me acts through a unique mechanism of action (MOA) which is repairment of the missing sialic acid on sick lung epithelium cells. This MOA can block the antibodies’ binding to sick cells, which are vulnerable to pathogenic antibodies. Our in vivo data showed that the formulation significantly reduced the sickness and deaths caused by pathogenic anti-spike antibodies. Therefore, the formulation has the potential to prevent and treat the serious conditions caused by pathogenic antibodies during a COVID-19 infection. In addition, the formulation has potential to prevent and treat the adverse reactions of COVID-19 vaccines because the vaccines can induce similar antibodies, including pathogenic antibodies. The formulation will be helpful in increasing the safety of the vaccines without reducing the vaccine’s efficacy. Compared to existing antiviral drugs, the formulation has a unique MOA of targeting receptors, broad spectrum of indications, excellent safety profile, resistance to mutations, and can be easily produced.","Wang, Huiru; Wu, Xiancong; Zhang, Yuekai; Chen, Qiuchi; Dai, Lin; Chen, Yuxing; Liu, Xiaoling",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.13.452194,562

A total of 136 segmented chest X-rays from two public databases were used to train and evaluate the classification methods. The PyRadiomics library was used to extract first and second-order statistical texture features in the right (R), left (L), and in superior, middle and bottom lung zones for each lung side. For performing feature selection, data was split in training (80%) and test (20%) sets. Stratified K-folds (K=5) was used within the training dataset for cross-validation. The most relevant radiomic features were selected after measuring validation accuracy and relative feature importance. Support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), and logistic regression (LR) were analyzed as potential classifiers.

Standard epidemic models fail to capture the potential complexity of this scenario by (1) neglecting the higher-order structure of contacts which typically occur through environments like workplaces, restaurants, and households; and by (2) assuming a linear relationship between the exposure to infected contacts and the risk of infection. Here, we leverage a hypergraph model to embrace the heterogeneity of environments and the heterogeneity of individual participation in these environments. We find that combining heterogeneous exposure with the concept of minimal infective dose induces a universal nonlinear relationship between infected contacts and infection risk. Under nonlinear infection kernels, conventional epidemic wisdom breaks down with the emergence of discontinuous transitions, super-exponential spread, and hysteresis.","St-Onge, Guillaume; Sun, Hanlin; Allard, Antoine; H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Bianconi, Ginestra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07229v3.pdf,562
163906,Cyber Security Education and Future Provision,2021,"ABSTRACT Objectives: Canadians want to live and die in their home communities. Unfortunately, Canada has the highest proportion of deaths in acute care facilities as compared to other developed nations. This study aims to identify the essential components required to best support patients and families with palliative care needs in their communities to inform system changes and empower family physicians (FPs) in providing community-based palliative care for patients. Design: Appreciative Inquiry (AI) methodology with individual interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed iteratively for emerging themes and used to develop -possibility statements- to frame discussion in subsequent focus groups. A conceptual framework emerged to describe the Destiny state as per AI methods. Setting: Family physicians, palliative home care providers, patients and bereaved caregivers were recruited in the urban and surrounding rural health authority zones of Calgary, Canada. Participants: 9 females and 9 males FPs (range of practice years 2-42) in interviews; 8 bereaved caregivers, 1 patient, 26 Palliative Home Care team members in focus groups. Interviews and focus groups were recorded digitally and transcribed with consent. Results: The identified themes that transcended all three groups created the foundation for the conceptual framework. Enhanced communication and fostering team relationships between all care providers with the focus on the patient and caregivers was the cornerstone concept. The family physician/patient relationship must be protected and encouraged by all care providers, while more system flexibility is needed to respond more effectively to patients. These concepts must exist in the context that patients and caregivers need more education regarding the benefits of palliative care, while increasing public discourse about mortality. Conclusions: Key areas were identified for how the patient's team can work together effectively to improve the patient and caregiver palliative care journey in the community with the cornerstone element of building on the trusting FP-patient longitudinal relationship.","Tan, A.; Spice, R.; Sinnarajah, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.21249226v1?rss=1,562

164384,Digital Media and COVID-19: Challenges for People’s Consolidation During Pandemic Crises,2021,"The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a broad inhibitor of virus replication. Its best-characterized function is to bind CpG dinucleotides present in viral RNA and, through the recruitment of TRIM25, KHNYN and other cellular RNA degradation machinery, target them for degradation or prevent their translation. ZAP’s activity requires the N-terminal RNA binding domain that selectively binds CpG-containing RNA. However, much less is known about the functional contribution of the remaining domains. Using ZAP-sensitive and ZAP-insensitive human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), we show that the catalytically inactive poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) domain of the long ZAP isoform (ZAP-L) is essential for CpG-specific viral restriction. Mutation of a crucial cysteine in the C-terminal CaaX box that mediates S-farnesylation and, to a lesser extent, the inactive catalytic site triad within the PARP domain, disrupted the activity of ZAP-L. Addition of the CaaX box to ZAP-S partly restored antiviral activity, explaining why ZAP-S lacks CpG-dependent antiviral activity despite conservation of the RNA-binding domain. Confocal microscopy confirmed the CaaX motif mediated localization of ZAP-L to vesicular structures and enhanced physical association with intracellular membranes. Importantly, the PARP domain and CaaX box together modulate the interaction between ZAP-L and its cofactors TRIM25 and KHNYN, implying that its proper subcellular localisation is required to establish an antiviral complex. The essential contribution of the PARP domain and CaaX box to ZAP-L’s CpG-directed antiviral activity was further confirmed by inhibition of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication. Thus, compartmentalization of ZAP-L on intracellular membranes provides an essential effector function in the ZAP-L-mediated antiviral activity. Author summary Cell-intrinsic antiviral factors, such as the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), provide a first line of defence against viral pathogens. ZAP acts by selectively binding CpG dinucleotide-rich RNAs, which are more common in some viruses than their vertebrate hosts, leading to their degradation. Here, we show that the ability to target these foreign elements is not only dependent on ZAP’s N-terminal RNA-binding domain, but additional determinants in the central and C-terminal regions also regulate this process. The PARP domain and its associated CaaX box, are crucial for ZAP’s CpG-specific activity and required for optimal binding to cofactors TRIM25 and KHNYN. Furthermore, a CaaX box, known to mediate post-translational modification by a hydrophobic S-farnesyl group, caused re-localization of ZAP from the cytoplasm and increased its association with intracellular membranes. This change in ZAP’s distribution was essential for inhibition of both a ZAP-sensitized HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Our work unveils how the determinants outside the CpG RNA-binding domain assist ZAP’s antiviral activity and highlights the role of S-farnesylation and membrane association in this process.","Kmiec, Dorota; Lista-Brotos, Maria-José; Ficarelli, Mattia; Swanson, Chad M; Neil, Stuart JD",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.22.449398,562

By recording the oxygen saturation levels in real-time, this system uses an adaptive learning controller (ALC) to vary the oxygen delivered to the patient and maintain it in an optimum range. In the presented approach, the PID controller gain is tuned with the learning technique to provide improved response time and a proactive approach to oxygen control for the patient. A case study is performed by monitoring the time varying health vitals across different age groups to gain a better understanding of the relationship between these parameters for COVID-19 patients. This information is then used to improve the standard of care supplied to patients and reducing the time to recovery. Results show that ALC controlled the oxygen saturation within the target range of 90% to 94% SpO2, 77% and 80.1% of the time in patients aged 40 to 50-year-old and 50 to 60-year- old, respectively. It also had faster time to recovery to target SpO2 range when the concentration dropped rapidly or when the patient became hypoxic as compared to manual control of the oxygen saturation by the healthcare staff.","Farhi, L.; Rehman, R.; Khan, M.","Proceedings of the 14th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies, Vol 3: Bioinformatics",https://doi.org/10.5220/0010381701840190,562

Researches have been conducted on IoT network single failures, but multiple node-link failures have not received enough attention. The model was experimented on node-link failures at various locations on big networks. The proposed model could generate excellent alternate routes and the bandwidth needed for rapid rerouting of multimedia traffic. As multiple node-link failures increase, bandwidth usage also increases which slows down multimedia traffic routing. The proposed model outperforms common proactive and reactive models, in terms of throughput and running time. The survival solution paths show that the proposed model works well in avoiding data loss in transit in spite of multiple node-link failures.

Such designs are susceptible to bias from selection of cases reported. Few studies have assessed absolute and relative risks for COVID-19 outcomes in population-based cohorts of patients with inflammatory joint diseases, nor compared these risks to those in the general population. Objectives: To estimate all-cause mortality, absolute and relative risks for severe COVID-19 in patients with chronic inflammatory joint diseases, compared over time and to the general population. Methods: We updated a multi-register nationwide linkage (“ARTIS”) on adults with RA, PsA, AS, SpA or JIA and population referents (matched on sex, age, and region), with data on hospitalizations, admission to intensive care (ICU), and deaths due to COVID-19. We calculated all-cause mortality March-September 2015-2020, and absolute and relative risks for COVID-19 outcomes March-September 2020. Patients were compared to population referents using hazard ratios (HR) from Cox models adjusted for comorbidities and socio-economy. Results: We identified 110567 individuals with inflammatory joint disease (53455 with RA) in Sweden on March 1st 2020, and 484277 matched general population subjects. In all cohorts, the absolute risk of death from any cause in 2020 was higher than 2015-2019 (Figure 1), with a peak in mid-April, but the relative risks of death (vs. the general population) 2020 remained similar to HRs for 2015-2019 (HR for 2020 in Table 1). Among all individuals with inflammatory joint disease in 2020, the risk for hospitalization, admission to ICU, and death due to COVID-19 was 0.5%, 0.04% and 0.1%, respectively (Table 1). HRs (vs. the general population) were elevated for almost all outcomes. HRs for COVID-19 related outcomes (Table 1) were higher than for non-COVID-19 outcomes;adjustment for co-morbidities and socio-economy explained much of these increases, somewhat less so for the former.

165262,Nursing Care in Pediatric Covid-19 Pneumonia,2021,"In the past decade, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become a timely and cost-effective alternative to bacterial identification. The MALDI-ToF MS technique analyzes the total protein of culturable microorganisms at the species level and produces a mass spectra based on peptides which is compared to a database of identified profiles. Consequently, unique signatures of each microorganism are produced allowing identification at the species and, more importantly, strain level. Our present study proposes that the MALDI-ToF MS can be further used to screen functional and metabolic differences. While other studies applied the MALDI-ToF technique to identify subgroups within species, we investigated how various environmental factors could alter the unique bacterial signatures. We found that genetic and phenotypic differences between microorganisms belonging to the same species can be reflected in peptide-mass fingerprints generated by MALDI-ToF MS. These results suggest that MALDI-ToF MS can screen intra-species phenotypic differences of several microorganisms.","Chac, Denise; Kordahi, Melissa; Brettner, Leandra; Verma, Arushi; McCleary, Paul; Crebs, Kelly; Yee, Cara; DePaolo, R.

165335,Fourth International Workshop on Dependable and Secure Machine Learning - DSML 2021,2021,"We produce a kinematic analysis of AGN-hosting cluster galaxies from a sample 33 galaxy clusters selected using the X-ray Clusters Database (BAX) and populated with galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8). The 33 galaxy clusters are delimited by their relative intensity of member galaxy substructuring as a proxy to core merging to derive two smaller sub-samples of 8 dynamically active (merging) and 25 dynamically relaxed (non-merging) states. The AGN were selected for each cluster sub-sample by employing the WHAN diagram to the strict criteria of log$_{10}$([NII]/H$\alpha$)$\geq-0.32$ and EW$_{\mathrm{H}\alpha}$ $\geq$ 6{\AA}, providing pools of 70 merging and 225 non-merging AGN sub-populations. By co-adding the clusters to their respective dynamical states to improve the signal-to-noise of our AGN sub-populations we find that merging galaxy clusters on average host kinematically active AGN between 0-1.5 $r_{200}$ as $r_{200}\rightarrow0$, where their velocity dispersion profile (VDP) presents a significant deviation from the non-AGN sub-population VDP by $\gtrsim3\sigma$. This result is indicative that the AGN-hosting cluster galaxies have recently coalesced onto a common potential. Further analysis of the composite distributions illustrate non-merging AGN-hosting sub-populations have, on average, already been accreted and predominantly lie within backsplash regions of the projected phase-space. This suggests merging cluster dynamical states hold relatively younger AGN sub-populations kinematically compared with those found in non-merging cluster dynamical states.","Bilton, Lawrence E.; Pimbblet, Kevin A.; Gordon, Yjan A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04498v1.pdf,562

The article employs a mixed-method approach to analyze news reports, using quantitative statistics and qualitative semantic materials that complement each other. The study found that the media construct a stereotypical image of female healthcare workers absent from public participation. Media reports on the actual number of female healthcare workers involved in treating COVID-19 patients are lower than those about men. Reports focusing exclusively on female staff tend to focus on their private affairs, that is, on their non-professional identities and characteristics, and show an excessive gaze on the female body. To understand this phenomenon prevailing in Chinese media, it is necessary to highlight the predicament of Chinese women in society as well as acknowledge the work of contemporary Chinese feminism in raising awareness on Chinese women’s experiences.","Yang, Yi Liu Xunqian",Journalism and Media,https://doi.org/10.3390/journalmedia2030021,562

165414,A Crowdsourcing-based QoE evaluation of an immersive VR autonomous driving experience,2021,"The purpose of this systematic review is twofold: 1) to identify, evaluate, and synthesize the heretofore disparate scientific literatures regarding the effects of direct exposure to microgravity on the musculoskeletal system, taking into account for the first time both bone and muscle systems of both humans and animals;and 2) to investigate the efficacy and limitations of exercise countermeasures on the musculoskeletal system under microgravity in humans. The Framework for Scoping Studies (Arksey and O'Malley 2005) and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins JPT 2011) were used to guide this review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was utilized in obtaining the combined results (Moher, Liberati et al. 2009). Data sources, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for published articles through October 2019 using the Mesh terms of microgravity, musculoskeletal system, and exercise countermeasures. A total of 84 references were selected, including 40 animal studies and 44 studies with human participants. The heterogeneity in the study designs, methodologies, and outcomes deemed this review unsuitable for a meta-analysis. Thus, we present a narrative synthesis of the results for the key domains under five categories: 1) Skeletal muscle responses to microgravity in humans 2) Skeletal muscle responses to microgravity in animals 3) Adaptation of the skeletal system to microgravity in humans 4) Adaptation of the skeletal system to microgravity in animals 5) Effectiveness of exercise countermeasures on the human musculoskeletal system in microgravity. Existing studies have produced only limited data on the combined effects on bone and muscle of human spaceflight, despite the likelihood that the effects on these two systems are complicated due to the components of the musculoskeletal system being anatomically and functionally interconnected. Bone is directly affected by muscle atrophy as well as by changes in muscle strength, notably at muscle attachments. Given this interplay, the most effective exercise countermeasure is likely to be robust, individualized, resistive exercise, primarily targeting muscle mass and strength.","Moosavi, Darya Wolovsky David Depompeis Angela Uher David Lennington David Bodden Roddy Garber Carol Ewing",Physiological Research,https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.934550,562

165436,Comparing Traditional and Neural Approaches for Detecting Health-Related Misinformation,2021,"Korean CDC experts first reported the likelihood of reactivation in COVIOD-19 patients. They hypothesized that like childhood chicken pox infections which lie dormant for tens of years only to cause shingles in seniors, SARS-CoV-2 can reactivate. However, as testing for the virus had been flawed at that time, U.S. infectious disease experts were skeptical about the reports of second COVID-19 infections. New reports have addressed the urgent need to conduct large-scale studies to better understand the potential recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some case studies show possible reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in a family cluster. Given this consideration, major space stressors such as microgravity and space radiation and their interactions which are not fully known, so far can increase the risk of reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in future space missions, an event that can easily impact the success of any space mission. Since about 80% of infected people are either asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, in a near future, it would be likely that astronauts who start their mission even after complex medical examinations, experience reactivation of the virus during their mission. Moreover, we have previously addressed the potential higher fatality of COVID-19 infections in space due to 1) uselessness of social distancing due to microgravity 2) immune system dysregulation 3) possibly higher mutation rates of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as a RNA virus 4) higher risk of reactivation of the virus 5) existence of strong selective pressure and 6) decreased maximum oxygen uptake. © 2021 IEEE.","Mortazavi, S.

165459,"Application of Design Thinking in the Education Segment, Regarding the Human-Computer Interactions",2021,"The design of vaccines against highly mutable pathogens, such as HIV and influenza, requires a detailed understanding of how the adaptive immune system responds to encountering multiple variant antigens (Ags). Here, we describe a multiscale model of B cell receptor (BCR) affinity maturation that employs actual BCR nucleotide sequences and treats BCR/Ag interactions in atomistic detail. We apply the model to simulate the maturation of a broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb) against HIV. Starting from a germline precursor sequence of the VRC01 anti-HIV Ab, we simulate BCR evolution in response to different vaccination protocols and different Ags, which were previously designed by us. The simulation results provide qualitative guidelines for future vaccine design and reveal unique insights into bnAb evolution against the CD4 binding site of HIV. Our model makes possible direct comparisons of simulated BCR populations with results of deep sequencing data, which will be explored in future applications. Author Summary Vaccination has saved more lives than any other medical procedure, and the impending end of the COVID-19 pandemic is also due to the rapid development of highly efficacious vaccines. But, we do not have robust ways to develop vaccines against highly mutable pathogens. For example, there is no effective vaccine against HIV, and a universal vaccine against diverse strains of influenza is also not available. The development of immunization strategies to elicit antibodies that can neutralize diverse strains of highly mutable pathogens (so-called ‘broadly neutralizing antibodies’, or bnAbs) would enable the design of universal vaccines against such pathogens, as well as other viruses that may emerge in the future. In this paper, we present an agent-based model of affinity maturation – the Darwinian process by which antibodies evolve against a pathogen – that, for the first time, enables the in silico investigation of real germline nucleotide sequences of antibodies known to evolve into potent bnAbs, evolving against real amino acid sequences of HIV-based vaccine-candidate proteins. Our results provide new insights into bnAb evolution against HIV, and can be used to qualitatively guide the future design of vaccines against highly mutable pathogens.","Sprenger, Kayla G.; Conti, Simone; Ovchinnikov, Victor; Chakraborty, Arup K.; Karplus, Martin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.458482,562
165544,Explainable Deep Neural Models for COVID-19 Prediction from Chest X-Rays with Region of Interest Visualization,2021,"The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2) has raised important questions about viral origin, mechanisms of zoonotic transfer to humans, whether companion or commercial animals can act as reservoirs for infection, and why there are large variations in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibilities across animal species. Powerful in silico modelling methods can rapidly generate information on newly emerged pathogens to aid countermeasure development and predict future behaviours. Here we report an in silico structural homology modelling, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulation study of the key infection initiating interaction between the spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 and its target, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from multiple species. Human ACE2 has the strongest binding interaction, significantly greater than for any species proposed as source of the virus. Binding to pangolin ACE2 was the second strongest, possibly due to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) being identical to pangolin CoV spike RDB. Except for snake, pangolin and bat for which permissiveness has not been tested, all those species in the upper half of the affinity range (human, monkey, hamster, dog, ferret) have been shown to be at least moderately permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting a correlation between binding affinity and permissiveness. Our data indicates that the earliest isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were surprisingly well adapted to human ACE2, potentially explaining its rapid transmission.","Piplani, Sakshi; Singh, Puneet Kumar; Winkler, David A.; Petrovsky, Nikolai",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199v2.pdf,562

Expression of Nsp14, a protein involved in viral RNA replication, provoked a dramatic remodeling of the transcriptome that strongly resembled that observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Nsp14 expression altered the splicing of more than 1000 genes and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of circRNAs, which are linked to innate immunity. These effects were independent of Nsp14 exonuclease activity and the co-factor Nsp10. Activation of the NFkB pathway and increased expression of CXCL8 occurred early upon Nsp14 expression. IMPDH2, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of guanine biosynthesis, was identified as a key mediator of the effect. Nsp14 expression caused an increase in GTP cellular levels, and the effect of Nsp14 was strongly decreased in presence of an IMPDH2 inhibitor. Together, our data demonstrate an unknown role for Nsp14 with implications for therapy.","Zaffagni, Michela; Harris, Jenna M; Patop, Ines L; Pamudurti, Nagarjuna Reddy; Nguyen, Sinead; Kadener, Sebastian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.02.450964,562

This significant societal problem poses difficult challenges to stakeholders given the complex and dynamic nature of drug supply chains. OSCM scholars are well positioned to provide answers, introducing new research directions for OSCM in the process. Design/methodology/approach: To substantiate this, the authors carried out a review of stakeholder reports from six European countries and the academic literature. Findings: There is little academic research and no fundamental agreement among stakeholders about causes of shortages. Stakeholders have suggested many government measures, but little evidence exists on their comparative cost-effectiveness. Originality/value: The authors discuss three pathways of impactful research on drug shortages to which OSCM could contribute: (1) Developing an evidence-based system view of drug shortages;(2) Studying the comparative cost-effectiveness of key government interventions;(3) Bringing supply chain risk management into the government and economics perspectives and vice versa.

Emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19 can be spread through airborne transmission, particularly in indoor environments with poor ventilation. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can play a role in mitigating airborne virus transmission. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature examining the effectiveness of HVAC design features in reducing virus transmission; here we report results for ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Following international standards for systematic reviews, we conducted a comprehensive search and synthesized findings from 32 relevant studies published between 1936 and 2020. Research demonstrates that: viruses and bacteriophages are inactivated by UV radiation; increasing UV dose is associated with decreasing survival fraction of viruses and bacteriophages; increasing relative humidity is associated with decreasing susceptibility to UV radiation; UV dose and corresponding survival fraction are affected by airflow pattern, air changes per hour, and UV device location; and UV radiation is associated with decreased transmission in both animal and human studies. This comprehensive synthesis of the scientific evidence examining the impact of UV radiation on virus transmission can be used to guide implementation of systems to mitigate airborne spread and identify priorities for future research.","Thornton, G.

166320,User Experience: The Motivation and Promotion of Livestreaming Innovation in Chinese Marketing,2021,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is imposing a severe worldwide lock-down. Contact tracing based on smartphones' applications (apps) has emerged as a possible solution to trace contagions and enforce a more sustainable selective quarantine. However, a massive adoption of these apps is required to reach the critical mass needed for effective contact tracing. As an alternative, geo-location technologies in next generation networks (e.g., 5G) can enable Mobile Operators (MOs) to perform passive tracing of users' mobility and contacts with a promised accuracy of down to one meter. To effectively detect contagions, the identities of positive individuals, which are known only by a Governmental Authority (GA), are also required. Note that, besides being extremely sensitive, these data might also be critical from a business perspective. Hence, MOs and the GA need to exchange and process users' geo-locations and infection status data in a privacy-preserving manner. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol that enables multiple MOs and the GA to share and process users' data to make only the final users discover the number of their contacts with positive individuals. The protocol is based on existing privacy-enhancing strategies that guarantee that users' mobility and infection status are only known to their MOs and to the GA, respectively. From extensive simulations, we observe that the cost to guarantee total privacy (evaluated in terms of data overhead introduced by the protocol) is acceptable, and can also be significantly reduced if we accept a negligible compromise in users' privacy.","Andreoletti, Davide; Ayoub, Omran; Giordano, Silvia; Tornatore, Massimo; Verticale, Giacomo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10168v1.pdf,562

Aims : The aims are to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the care of children with heart disease in India in terms of number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, catheter-based interventions, and cardiac surgeries. Settings and Design : This is a retrospective, multicentric, observational study. Methods : We collected monthly data on the number and characteristics of outpatient visits, hospitalizations, catheter-based interventions, and cardiac surgeries and major hospital statistics, over a period of 5 months (April to August 2020), which coincided with the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India and compared it with data from the corresponding months in 2019. Results : The outpatient visits across the 24 participating pediatric cardiac centers decreased by 74.5% in 2020 (n = 13,878) as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 (n = 54,213). The reduction in the number of hospitalizations, cardiac surgeries, and catheterization procedures was 66.8%, 73.0%, and 74.3%, respectively. The reduction in hospitalization was relatively less pronounced among neonates as compared to infants/children (47.6% vs. 70.1% reduction) and for emergency surgeries as compared to elective indications (27.8% vs. 79.2%). The overall in-hospital mortality was higher in 2020 (8.1%) as compared to 2019 (4.8%), with a higher postoperative mortality (9.1% vs. 4.3%). Conclusions : The current COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the delivery of pediatric cardiac care across India with two-third reduction in hospitalizations and cardiac surgeries. In an already resource-constrained environment, the impact of such a massive reduction in the number of surgeries could be significant over the coming years. These findings may prove useful in formulating strategy to manage subsequent waves of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Choubey, Mrigank Ramakrishnan Sivasubramanian Sachdeva Sakshi Mani Kalaivani Gangopadhyay Debasree Sivakumar Kothandam Kappanayil Mahesh Jayranganath Mahimarangaiah Koneti Nageswara Awasthy Neeraj Bobhate Prashant Gupta Saurabh Azad Sushil Dhulipudi Bhargavi Sonawane Bhushan Bandopadhyay Biswajit Chinnaswamy Muthukumaran Das Debasis Sivalingam Devaprasath Ramamurthy Harpanahalli Nayak Hemant Mishra Jayashree Muthusamy Kalyanasundaram Chakrabarti Manisha Islam Nurul Mahawar Prashant Shah Prashant Rajan Saileela Remadevi Kavasseri Shaad Abqari Chaudhary Shiv Kasturi Soumya Kumar Raghavannair Saxena Anita Iyer Krishna Sharma Rajesh Kumar Raman Sitaraman Radhakrishnan Kothari Shyam Kulkarni Snehal Rao Suresh For the Pcsi-Covid-study group",Annals of Pediatric Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4103/apc.apc_133_21,562
166438,Infection prevention and control using UV-disinfectant bot for COVID,2021,"Objective To describe the characteristics of COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections among systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD) patients. Methods We identified SARDs patients in a large healthcare system with COVID-19 vaccination at least 14 days prior to a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test. Details of the SARD diagnosis, vaccination status, and COVID-19 infection were extracted. Results Of 340 confirmed COVID-19 infections among SARDs patients between December 11th, 2020 (date of first COVID-19 vaccine approval in the US) and July 30th, 2021, we identified 16 breakthrough infections. Seven (44%) received the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, five (31%) received the Moderna vaccine, and four (25%) received the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The most common SARDs included rheumatoid arthritis (6, 38%), inflammatory myopathy (3, 19%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (3, 19%). Rituximab (5, 31%), glucocorticoids (4, 25%), and mycophenolate mofetil (4, 25%) were the most frequent treatments. Among the breakthrough infections, 15 (93%) were symptomatic, six (38%) were hospitalized, one (6%) required mechanical ventilation, and two (13%) died. Conclusions Symptomatic, including severe, breakthrough infections were observed in SARDs patients; many were on treatments associated with attenuated antibody responses to vaccination. Further studies are needed to determine the rate of breakthrough infection associated with SARD treatments and other features.","Cook, C.; Patel, N.; D'Silva, K.; Hsu, T.

166548,Healthcare Robotic Telepresence,2021,"The social distancing rules during the Covid-19 quarantine period posed new challenges in the teaching of physics especially for the laboratory sessions. One solution, that permitted students to carry on the experimental work during this period, was the 'do it at home' activities using simple materials for setting up the experiment and a smartphone as a measuring device. In this line of reasoning an educational intervention was designed and carried out in a junior high school of Athens. After discussing the criteria for selecting the 'do it at home' activities assigned to the students the chosen experiments are presented, and the distance education tools that were used for carrying out the intervention are described. The findings and the conclusions were drawn both by the papers submitted by pupils and from a questionnaire that students answered online a few days after the completion of the whole action. Students enjoyed the experimental work and they managed to carry out quite successfully all the required steps despite a few difficulties they had encountered. It is worth mentioning that such 'do it at home' experiments could also be possibly used at periods when there is a normal access to a school physics lab and not only in the context of a distance learning environment. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Tzamalis, P.

166699,CNN-based Transfer Learning for Covid-19 Diagnosis,2021,"The System of National Accounts (SNA) has adapted, and will adapt, as economic, social and environmental conditions change. The revision process of the SNA2008, which is now underway, will take place in the context of developments such as globalization, digitalization, climate change, biodiversity loss, inequality as well as the COVID19-pandemic. The new SNA will have to make clear how the economy relates to concepts such as wellbeing, sustainability and equity and will also need to be linked to major global initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I propose a broad accounting framework for Wellbeing, Sustainability and Equity (WiSE). This provides a wider context for the System of National Accounts (SNA) and links to the other frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals, and other global initiatives such as the Better Life Initiative (OECD), Changing Wealth of Nations (World Bank) and the Inclusive Wealth Index (UN). The WiSE framework is not a new system, but rather a combination of existing accounting frameworks which have been proposed in the last five decades. The paper starts off by formulating principles to guide the work on the broader framework. Subsequently, seven accounts are proposed which quantify the various dimensions of the economic, societal and environmental systems. This interdisciplinary accounting framework involves knowledge from many scientific disciplines and multiple units are used (mass, energy, people, time, money etc). The most controversial part of any discussion about the future of the SNA is the valuation of non-market phenomena such as unpaid household work/care or environmental damages. This paper argues that the discussion is too focused on methods derived from welfare economics. Rather than valuation we should be focusing on evaluation methods from many scientific disciplines which help to assess progress towards wellbeing, sustainability and equity. This interdisciplinary perspective should also guide our thinking to select key indicators to replace GDP.

166707,Monitoring of epidemic outbreaks using social media data,2021,"Fixed-duration treatment with venetoclax (Ven), a highly selective Bcl-2 inhibitor combined with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, showed high efficacy inducing high rates of deep responses with undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD) in patients with previously treated and untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The efficacy and safety of the Ven and rituximab (VenR) combination have been investigated in a multicenter, prospective study of the GIMEMA group that included young patients with previously untreated CLL (LLC 1518, VERITAS, NCT03455517). The primary endpoint of this study was the CR rate assessed according to the iwCLL criteria. Inclusion criteria were: treatment requirement per iwCLL criteria, age ≤65 years, cumulative Illness rating scale score ≤6, creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min, and an unfavorable biologic profile with IGHV unmutated and or TP53 disruption. Treatment consisted of the Ven dose ramp-up (from 20 to 400 mg daily, during 5-weeks) followed by Ven 400 mg daily, combined with R for six 28-day courses (375 mg/m2, course 1;500 mg/m2, courses 2-6). Patients continued with Ven single agent, 400 mg daily, until month 13. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis measures included hydration, allopurinol, or rasburicase. All patients received Pneumocystis Jirovecii prophylaxis. G-CSF was given in patients with recurrent and severe granulocytopenia. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the CTCAE criteria v.5, TLS events were classified according to Howard's criteria. Response was assessed at months 7 and 15 and included clinical examination, PB evaluation, BM aspirate, BM biopsy, and CT scan. MRD was checked centrally in the PB and BM by a 6/4-color flow-cytometry assay with a sensitivity of at least 10-4 according to the internationally standardized European Research Initiative on CLL. Quantitative MRD results assessed by flow-cytometry were categorized as uMRD (uMRD4;<10-4), intermediate MRD, or high MRD (≥10-2). MRD was further evaluated by allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR with a sensitivity up to 10-5 in the PB and BM of patients who showed uMRD4 by flow-cytometry. During the follow-up, MRD was monitored every 6 months. Between October 2018 and May 2020, 77 patients with CLL were included in this study. Two patients were off study before the start of treatment (withdrawal of consent, 1;Covid-19 infection, 1) and were not included in the analysis. The median age was 53.5 years (range 38-65). Binet stage B/C was present in 84% of patients, increased beta-2 microglobulin in 41%. Seventy-one (96%) of patients were IGHV unmutated, while 3 (4%) were IGHV mutated and showed TP53 mutation (Table 1). At the data cutoff of June 30, 2020, 65 (87%) patients completed the ramp-up phase. The planned 400 mg dose of Ven was reached within 5 weeks in 78.5% of patients. Response was assessed in 34 patients at the end of the VenR combination therapy. A response was achieved by 32 (94%) patients. Responses included 20 (59%) CRs, 1 CRi (3%) and 11 (32%) PRs due to residual enlarged nodes (median maximum size, 1.9 cm). Treatment failure due to toxicity was recorded in 2 (6%) patients. Overall, a response with uMRD4 by flow-cytometry in the PB was observed in 26 (76.5%) cases, and in the PB and BM, in 17 (50.0%). The rates of patients with CR and uMRD4 by flow-cytometry in the PB, and both in the PB and BM, were 44%, and 35%, respectively (Table 2). No detectable disease by PCR, both in the PB and BM, was observed in 4 (12%) patients. With a median follow-up of 4.5 months from the start of therapy, no patient has progressed or died. Fifty-three percent of patients were hospitalized during the first seven days of the Ven ramp-up phase. A transient laboratory TLS was observed in 3 patients. Treatment was discontinued after the first dose of Ven in 1 patient with evidence of laboratory TLS associated with severe neurologic toxicity due to the concomitant administration of fentanyl. Selected grade ≥3 AEs included neutropenia in 10 patients (ramp-up phase, 5) and neutropenic fever in 4. Gra e ≥3 infection was recorded in 3 patients and was the reason for treatment discontinuation in 1 who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. In conclusion, the preliminary results of this study demonstrate the high efficacy of the front-line VenR combination, which resulted in a high proportion of CRs and responses with uMRD4 in young patients with CLL and an unfavorable biologic profile.

The significance of relative humidity is below the 95% confidence level and does not show a preferred value.

166840,A Novel Privacy-Preserving Approach for Physical Distancing Measurement Using Thermal Sensor Array,2021,"In this investigation, the positive impact of COVID-19 lockdown on heavy metals concentration and biological parameters in the shallow groundwater samples of Coimbatore city of South India was ascertained. The groundwater samples (n=15) were obtained from shallow open wells during before lockdown (24–25 February 2020) and after lockdown (2–3 June 2020) periods. These samples were analysed for heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb) and biological parameters (E. coli, Fecal coliforms, Fecal streptococci and Total coliforms). Fe concentration was within the permissible limit but, the concentrations of Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb were above the allowable limits for drinking uses as per the WHO. However, after lockdown the number of samples crossing the cutoff limit had considerably decreased (Mn: from 2 to 0 mg/L;Ni: from 13 to 10 mg/L;Cr: 7 to 5 mg/L and Pb: from 13 to 8 mg/L). The heavy metal pollution index (HPI) revealed that 176.75 km² (67.4%) and 85.35 km² (32.6%) areas fell under unsuitable and very poor categories, respectively, during the pre-lockdown period, whereas 138.23 km² (52.6%), 118.98 km² (45.3%) and 4.89 km² (2.1%) areas fell under very poor, poor and good categories, respectively, during the post-lockdown period. Similarly, Total coliform, Fecal coliform and E. coli had decreased distinctly due to the pandemic lockdown. Therefore, the shutdown of small and large-scale industries during the lockdown period had improved the groundwater quality. The health risk assessment showed that 93%, 87% and 80% of pre-lockdown samples, and 87%, 80% and 73% of post-lockdown samples possessed non-carcinogenic risks (HI &gt; 1) for children, female and male categories, respectively.","Aravinthasamy, P.; Karunanidhi, D.; Shankar, K.; Subramani, T.; Setia, Raj Bhattacharya Prosun Das Sayani","Environmental nanotechnology, monitoring &amp; management",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2021.100472,562

166962,The First International Conference on Advances in Computational Science and Engineering (ICACSE 2020),2021,"Infection from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide and the world health organisation has listed it with the highest priority for the need of new antimicrobial therapies. P. aeruginosa strains responsible for the poorest clinical outcomes express either ExoS or ExoU, which are injected into target host cells via the type III secretion system (T3SS). ExoS is a bifunctional cytotoxin that promotes intracellular survival of invasive P. aeruginosa by preventing targeting of the bacteria to acidified intracellular compartments and lysosomal degradation. ExoU is a potent phospholipase which causes rapid destruction of host cell plasma membranes, leading to acute tissue damage and bacterial dissemination. Fluoroquinolones are usually employed as a first line of therapy as they have been shown to be more active against P. aeruginosa in vitro than other antimicrobial classes. However, their overuse over the past decade has caused alarming rates of antibiotic resistance to emerge. In certain clinical situations, aminoglycosides have been shown to be more effective then fluoroquinolones, despite their reduced potency towards P. aeruginosa in vitro. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin and gentamycin) on T3SS expression and toxicity, in corneal epithelial cell infection models. We discovered tobramycin disrupted T3SS expression and inhibited both ExoS and ExoU mediated cytotoxicity, protecting infected HCE-T cells even at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin, however, upregulated the T3SS and in particular did not subvert the cytotoxic effects of ExoS and ExoU.","Foulkes, Daniel M.; McLean, Keri; Sloniecka, Marta; Byrne, Dominic; Haneef, Atikah S.; Winstanley, Craig; Berry, Neil; Fernig, David G.; Kaye, Stephen B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.11.463927,562
167084,Themed Entertainment in the Age of Coronavirus,2021,"SARS CoV-2 variants raise significant concerns due to their ability to cause vaccine breakthrough infections. Here, we sequence-characterized the spike gene, isolated from a breakthrough infection, that corresponded to B.1.617.3 lineage. Delineating the functional impact of spike mutations using reporter pseudoviruses (PV) revealed that N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific E156G/Δ157-158 contributed to increased infectivity and reduced sensitivity to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Covishield™)-elicited neutralizing antibodies. A six-nucleotide deletion (467-472) in the spike coding region introduced this change in the NTD. We confirmed the presence of E156G/Δ157-158 in the RT-PCR-positive cases concurrently screened, in addition to other circulating spike (S1) mutations like T19R, T95I, L452R, E484Q, and D614G. Notably, E156G/Δ157-158 was present in more than 85% of the sequences reported from the USA, UK, and India in August 2021. The spike PV bearing combination of E156G/Δ157-158 and L452R further promoted infectivity and conferred immune evasion. Additionally, increased cell-to-cell fusion was observed when spike harbored E156G/Δ157-158, L452R, and E484Q, suggesting a combinatorial effect of these mutations. Notwithstanding, the plasma from a recovered individual robustly inhibited mutant spike PV, indicating the increased breadth of neutralization post-recovery. Our data highlights the importance of spike NTD-specific changes in determining infectivity and immune escape of variants.","Mishra, Tarun; Joshi, Garima; Kumar, Atul; Dalavi, Rishikesh; Pandey, Pankaj; Shukla, Sanjeev; Mishra, Ram Kumar; Chande, Ajit",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463028,562

As a proof of concept and demonstration of technological feasibility, we developed PAGEANT (Personal Access to Genome & Analysis of Natural Traits), usable through Graphical User Interface or command line-based version, aiming to serve as a protocol and prototype that guides the overarching design of genetic reporting tools. PAGEANT is structured across five core modules, summarized by five Qs: (1) Quality assurance of the genetic data; (2) Qualitative assessment of genetic characteristics; (3) Quantitative assessment of health risk susceptibility based on polygenic risk scores and population reference; (4) Query of third-party variant databases (e.g., ClinVAR and PharmGKB); and (5) Quick Response code of genetic variants of interest. Literature review was conducted to compare PAGEANT with academic and industry tools. For 2,504 genomes made publicly available through the 1,000 Genomes Project, we derived their genomic characteristics for a suite of qualitative and quantitative traits.

Recent modeling efforts, however, prioritize predictive accuracy at the expense of model interpretability. Here, we present LANTERN (https://github.com/usnistgov/lantern), a hierarchical Bayesian model that distills genotype-phenotype landscape (GPL) measurements into a low-dimensional feature-space that represents the fundamental biological mechanisms of the system while also enabling straightforward, explainable predictions. Across a benchmark of large-scale datasets, LANTERN equals or outperforms all alternative approaches, including deep neural networks. LANTERN furthermore extracts useful insights into the landscape including its inherent dimensionality, a latent space of additive mutational effects, and novel metrics of landscape structure. LANTERN facilitates straightforward discovery of fundamental mechanisms in GPLs, while also reliably extrapolating to unexplored regions of genotypic-space.","Tonner, Peter D.; Pressman, Abe; Ross, David",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.11.448129,562

To inform optimal primary care for patients with shoulder pain, the study aims to (i) to investigate the short- and long-term outcomes (overall prognosis) of shoulder pain, (ii) estimate costs of care, (iii) develop a prognostic model for predicting individuals level and risk of pain and disability at 6 months, (iv) investigate experiences and opinions of patients and healthcare professionals regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and management of shoulder pain. Methods and analysis PANDA-S is a longitudinal clinical cohort with linked qualitative study. At least 400 people presenting to general practice and physiotherapy services in the UK will be recruited. Participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Short-term data will be collected weekly between baseline and 12 weeks via SMS text or software application (App). Participants will be offered clinical (physiotherapist) and ultrasound (sonographer) assessments at baseline. Qualitative interviews with 15 dyads of patients and their healthcare professional (GP or physiotherapist). Short and long-term trajectories of shoulder pain and disability (using SPADI) will be described, using latent class growth analysis. Health economic analysis will estimate direct costs of care and indirect costs related to work absence and productivity losses. Multivariable regression analysis will be used to develop a prognostic model predicting future levels of pain and disability at 6-months using penalisation methods to adjust for overfitting. The added predictive value of pre-specified physical examination tests and ultrasound findings will be examined. For the qualitative interviews an inductive, exploratory framework will be adopted using thematic analysis to investigate decision making and perspectives of patients and clinicians on the importance of diagnostic and prognostic information when negotiating treatment and referral options.","Wynne-Jones, G.; Myers, H.; Hall, A.; Littlewood, C.; Hennings, S.; Saunders, B.; Bucknall, M.; Jowett, S.; Riley, R.; Wathall, S.; Heneghan, C.; Cook, J.; Pincus, T.; Mallen, C.; Roddy, E.; Foster, N.; Beard, D.; Lewis, J.; Rees, J.; Higginbottom, A.; van der Windt, D.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.26.21257208v1?rss=1,562

Analysis of Perceived Health in Adults and Older People",2021,"A number of recent retrospective studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater are associated with COVID-19 cases in the corresponding sewersheds. Implementing high-resolution, prospective efforts across multiple plants depends on sensitive measurements that are representative of COVID-19 cases, scalable for high throughput analysis, and comparable across laboratories. We conducted a prospective study across eight publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). A focus on SARS-CoV-2 RNA in solids enabled us to scale-up our measurements with a commercial lab partner. Samples were collected daily and results were posted to a website within 24-hours. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in daily samples correlated to incidence COVID-19 cases in the sewersheds; a 1 log10 increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in settled solids corresponds to a 0.58 log10 (4X) increase in sewershed incidence rate. SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals measured with the commercial laboratory partner were comparable across plants and to measurements conducted in a university laboratory when normalized by pepper mild mottle virus PMMoV RNA. Results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA should be detectable in settled solids for COVID-19 incidence rates > 1/100,000 (range 0.8 - 2.3 cases per 100,000).

This article applies time-series analysis to historical data on cybercrime and fraud reported to Action Fraud in the United Kingdom to examine whether any potential increases are beyond normal crime variability. Furthermore, the discrepancies between fraud types and individual and organizational victims are also analyzed. The results show that while both total cybercrime and total fraud increased beyond predicted levels, the changes in victimization were not homogeneous across fraud types and victims. The implications of these findings on how changes in routine activities during COVID-19 have influenced cybercrime and fraud opportunities are discussed in relation to policy, practice, and academic debate.

167506,IOT based Temperature Monitoring System,2021,"ABSTRACT The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was devastating in Peru, which suffered a high death rate and severe economic disruption. These results occurred despite ambitious response measures, revealing widespread institutional weaknesses across the country’s levels of government. We analyze responses across the four levels of government, with emphasis on local governance in rural areas, to understand how institutions and contexts shape crisis management outcomes. We focus on the Arequipa region, drawing from 44 interviews with officials and community members. We found that the crisis provoked a reversion to the norm across multiple scales, though with significant differentiation. The national government fell back on a centralized, militarized approach that effectively reclaimed power but was ineffective in confronting the pandemic. Counter the overarching recentralization trend, in rural peripheries where state power was always partial, norms of informal local governance were reinforced and intensified. The de facto autonomy in rural areas elicited a mix of paralysis and improvisation, with outcomes that varied widely from place to place and over time. These bifurcated results in the face of crisis reveal important weaknesses in Peru’s governance structures and institutions and show how pre-existing habits and norms were reproduced in the face of crisis, rather than reformed or transcended.","Cáceres Cabana, Yezelia Danira Malone Aaron Zeballos Eliseo Zeballos Huamani Huaranca Narvi Oshin Tinta Marleny Ttito Gonzales Beltran Soulange Annette Arosquipa Abel Andia Pinedo Garcia Danny David",Applied Geography,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.102519,562

As contexts of crisis increase in frequency, the ability of organizations to adapt and effectively respond to crises has become a key necessity for organizational survival and continuity. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the repercussions of crises may be curtailed through a multidimensional crisis management approach. Design/methodology/approach This paper applies a narrative literature review and concept mapping to synthesize and establish relationships between the literature in the domains of leadership, knowledge management, learning and contexts of crisis. The output of this methodological orientation is the Integrated Crisis Management Framework, presenting a conceptualized overview of the symbiotic and intertwined manner through which leadership, knowledge management and learning contribute towards effective crisis management. Findings According to the analysis and the conceptual underpinnings of this paper, in contexts of crisis, leadership is generally responsible for aggregating crisis management strategies and establishing employee motivation. Knowledge management, on the other hand, provides the infrastructure necessary for calculated yet rapid decision-making. Similarly, in times of crisis, learning is a prerequisite for the development of a ""learningful"" organization, which contributes towards crisis management by serving as the organization's ""memory"" - where lessons learned from previous crises suffice to guide future crisis response. Originality/value The literature in crisis management reveals that existing crisis management models and frameworks generally consider crisis from a unidimensional perspective, neglecting to account for the multifaceted nature of crises, and the numerous attributes necessary to overcome contexts of crisis. To address this gap in the literature, this paper proposes a multidimensional conceptualization of crisis management through combining three core elements, including leadership, learning and knowledge management. The novelty of this paper is an Integrated Crisis Management Framework, and eight empirical propositions, which act as an impetus for future research.","Buhagiar, K.; Anand, A.",International Journal of Organizational Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijoa-03-2021-2672,562

The degradation of the cutting wheel significantly affects the LCD panel quality. Currently, there is few effective approaches that can detect the degradation of the cutting wheel at the working station for health monitoring purpose, due to the small size of the component and the complex manufacturing operation. That leads to high economic costs in the production lines in the real industries. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network-based method for defect detection of the cutting wheels using the industrial images. An end-to-end health monitoring system is built based on machine vision, which directly takes the raw images as inputs, and outputs the detection results. That facilitates the industrial applications since little prior knowledge on image processing and fault detection is required. The experiments on a real-world cutting wheel degradation dataset are carried out for validation. High fault diagnosis testing accuracies are obtained, that indicates the proposed method offers an effective and promising approach for the cutting wheel health monitoring problem.","Yang, Shaojie; Li, Xiang; Jia, Xiaodong; Wang, Yinglu; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315808; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315808,562
167892,The Future of Livestreaming: Strategy and Predictive Analysis for Future Operations of Facebook Live,2021,"Background: Ghana developed an Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRP) in response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) pandemic. A key strategy in the EPRP is to mobilize national resources and put in place strategies for improved risk and behavioral change communication. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised on social media about COVID-19 misinformation and misconceptions. This study used social media content to determine the types, forms and the effects of the myths, misconceptions and misinformation in Ghana's COVID-19 containment. Method: The study was conducted in three phases involving the use of both primary and secondary data. Review of social media information on COVID-19 was done. This was complemented with document review and interviews with key stakeholders with expertise in the management of public health emergencies and mass communication experts (N = 18). All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using NVivo 12. Results: The study showed a changing pattern in the misconceptions and misinformation about COVID-19. Initially myths were largely on causes and vulnerability. It was widely speculated that black people had some immunity against COVID-19. Also, the condition was perceived to cause severe disease among the elderly. These misconceptions served as risk attenuators among Ghanaians, especially the younger generation. As the infection evolved in the country, another misconception emerged that the hot climate in Africa inhibited viral replication and transmission only to be followed by speculations and conjectures that COVID-19 was being used as a biological weapon to target developed economics. For the management of COVID-19, the use of local remedies such as Neem tree (Azadirachta indica) and herbal preparation also emerged. Myths about the efficacy of locally manufactured gin (akpeteshie) and hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis led to abuse of such substances. Interview segments revealed the use of myths to propagate political agenda in the country. Conclusion: The study concludes that COVID-19 misconceptions and misinformation are widespread and cover the course of the condition. These myths necessitate culturally sensitive health communication strategies that take into account local perceptions of COVID-19 in order to tackle the circulation of misconceived messages about the pandemic in Ghana.","Tabong, P.

They had an average age of 36.52 years with a sex ratio (M/F) of 0.41. The mean STAI score was 43.12 while the PHQ score was 7.46, indicating that 30.8% of the participants suffered from depression. Both scores were correlated to female sex (p=0.01 for STAI and p=0.02 for PHQ), a history of anxiety (p<0.001) and depressive disorders (p<0.001) and to poor sleep quality (p<0.001). The STAI score was also associated with a family history of high blood pressure (p=0.004), while the PHQ score was correlated to a family history of diabetes (p=0.02), a widowed or divorced marital status (p<0.001) and to a single lifestyle (p=0.03). Furthermore, the two scores (STAI-Y and PHQ 9) were also associated (p<0.001;r=0.67).ConclusionsThe psychological impact of Coronavirus epidemic seems not negligible requiring psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups.","Regaieg, N.; Elleuch, M.; Hentati, S.; Masmoudi, J.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.739,562
168408,Psychological and Pedagogical Support of Students with Special Educational Needs in a Higher Education Institution,2021,"Perceiving the spatial location and physical dimensions of objects that we touch is crucial for goal-directed actions. To achieve this, our brain transforms skin-based coordinates into a reference frame by integrating visual and proprioceptive cues, a process known as tactile remapping. In the current study, we examine the role of proprioception in the remapping process when information from the more dominant visual modality is withheld. We developed a new visual-to-touch sensory substitution device and asked participants to perform a spatial localization task in three different arm postures that included posture switches between blocks of trials. We observed that in the absence of visual information novel proprioceptive inputs can be overridden after switching postures. This behavior demonstrates effective top-down modulations of proprioception and points to the unequal contribution of different sensory modalities to tactile remapping.","Yizhar, Or; Buchs, Galit; Heimler, Benedetta; Friedman, Doron; Amedi, Amir",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.364752,562

What accounts for these stark differences in country performances? In this article, we argue that a salient feature of economic and health performance is the degree of trust populations have in their governments. We set up a heuristic analytical framework that models this relation, under particular assumptions about what drives government and individual behavior, in order to better understand the mechanisms that may be at work. We identify three key roles that trust in government may play in enforcing social distancing policies, conveying credible information for individual decision-making, and shaping government attitudes towards risk. We argue that these implications are consistent with the empirical evidence. We also discuss the relevance of other forms of trust, namely, interpersonal trust and trust in science.","Abi-Rached, Joelle M.; Dlwan, Ishac",Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics,https://doi.org/10.23941/ejpe.vl4il.580,562
168470,Study of a Dual-Function Intelligent Electronic Pin to Help Compliance with Security Measures Related to Covid-19,2021,"This paper presents a federated learning (FL) framework that uses multiple self-reporting crowdsourcing mobile and web apps to collaboratively construct a fine-grained COVID-19 vulnerability prediction map. The use of FL provides a reliable prediction by aggregating training results from multiple apps, while at the same time circumventing data privacy regulations that prevent user information from multiple apps to be shared with each other. Such a fine-grained vulnerability map identifies early on high-risk areas, helping to reduce the spread of the disease. To mitigate data bias from each self-reporting app, an adaptive worker selection algorithm that leverages neighbouring datasets to obtain a balanced data distribution is proposed. Further, a differential privacy scheme is adopted to protect user information. The simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms the widely used FedAvg FL algorithm by 6% on prediction accuracy while preserving user privacy. © 2021 IEEE.","Chen, J.

168498,Remote Collaboration Potential in STEM Education using Bare Machine Computing Research,2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 testing is one of the options to combat COVID-19 in Kenya. In the first COVID-19 year there was limited tapping of the private sector's potential to scale up testing in Kenya. In April 2020, we initiated a unique public-private partnership (PPP) project in Kisumu County connecting the private sector to centralized testing supported by the ministry of health (MoH), COVID-Dx, to accelerate the local response to COVID-19. Within COVID-Dx, we aimed to demonstrate this PPP's performance as a replicable model for effective public-private collaboration in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic in similar settings. METHODS: KEMRI, Department of Health Kisumu County, PharmAccess Foundation, and local faith-based and private healthcare facilities collaborated in COVID-Dx. COVID-Dx was implemented from June 01, 2020, to March 31, 2021, in Kisumu County, Kenya. Trained laboratory technologists in participating healthcare facilities collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from patients meeting the MoH COVID-19 case definition. Samples were tested at the central laboratory in KEMRI via SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Healthcare workers in participating facilities collected data using the digitized MoH COVID-19 Case Identification Form. We shared aggregated results from these data via (semi-) live dashboard to all relevant stakeholders. We did descriptive statistical analyses using Stata 16 to inform project processes. RESULTS: Nine facilities participated in the project. A total of 4,324 PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were done, with 425 positives. We noted differences in positivity rates between the facilities. Healthcare workers were the largest group tested in the project, 1009, representing 43% of the Kisumu healthcare workforce. CONCLUSION: COVID-Dx can serve as a model for PPPs scale-up testing, especially LMICs, and digitizing the MoH case report form improved reporting efficiency, demonstrating that digital is the way forward. The COVID-Dx PPP has led to another collaboration with Kisumu County aimed towards extending the COVID-Dx model to other counties.","van Duijn, S.; Barsosio, H. C.; Omollo, M.; Milimo, E.; Odero, I.

The attractiveness of the flipped classroom is increasing, due to the Covid-19 situation and the promptly switch to the online teaching approach by many institutions. Based on the researchers' preliminary investigation, the utilization of flipped classrooms approach among educators is still not fully exploited. This initial and seed research aims to investigate students' and educators' point of view concerning the application of the flipped classroom concept. This qualitative research is based on interviews of focus groups, observations and mini structured surveys that aim to answer the main research question how the students and educator view flipped classroom. The researchers collected data from some 300 students and about ten educator form information systems and engineering disciplines. The research results reveal that students, as well as educators, are aware of flipped classrooms but more training in the tools and concepts of the flipped classroom is required. Flipped classrooms can bring enormous benefits to students, institutions and educators. The outcomes of this research work showed that students and educators prefer the flipped classroom approach in some aspects. (C) 2021 The Authors.

As a result, many small-scale food producers faced difficulties growing, harvesting, and selling their goods. This participatory research examines local small-scale farmers’ challenges as farmers but also as consumers and their coping strategies during the month of April and one week in June 2020. The study was initiated and conceptualized in collaboration with small-scale farmer members of an existing research network in selected urban and rural areas in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia. Participants co-designed the research, collected and uploaded data through digital survey tools, and contributed to data analysis and interpretation. A common observation across regions is that the measures imposed in response to COVID-19 highlighted and partly exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities among food system actors. Strict lockdowns in Cape Town, South Africa, and Masvingo, Zimbabwe, significantly restricted the production capacity of small-scale farmers in the informal economy and created more food insecurity for them. In Maputo, Mozambique, and Toraja and Java, Indonesia, local food systems continued to operate and were even strengthened by higher social capital and adaptive capacities.","Paganini, Nicole Adinata Kustiwa Buthelezi Nomonde Harris David Lemke Stefanie Alberto Luis Koppelin Jennifer Abdulrazak Karriem Ncube Fezile Enzo Nervi Aguirre Ramba Tandu Raimundo Inês Sulejmanović Nedim Swanby Haidee Tevera Daniel Stöber Silke",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208556,562

Individuals and groups were compelled to construct theories of common sense about the disease to communicate and guide practices. The theory of social representations provides powerful concepts to analyse the psychosocial construction of COVID-19. This study aimed to understand the social representations of COVID-19 constructed by middle-class Brazilian adults and their ideological implications, providing a social-psychological analysis of these phenomena while the pandemic is still ongoing. We adopted a qualitative approach based on semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted online in April-May 2020. Participants were 13 middle-class Brazilians living in urban areas. We analysed the interviews with thematic analysis and a phenomenological approach. The social representations were organised around three themes: 1) a virus originated in human actions and with anthropocentric meanings (e.g., a punishment for the human-led destruction of the environment);2) a dramatic disease that attacks the lungs and kills people perceived to have ""low immunity"";and 3) a disturbing pandemic that was also conceived as a correction event with positive consequences. The social representations included beliefs about the individualistic determination of immunity, the attribution of divine causes to the pandemic, and the need for the moral reformation of humankind. The discussion highlights the ideological implications of these theories of common sense. Socially underprivileged groups are at greater COVID-19-related risk, which the investigated social representations may contribute to conceal and naturalise.","Souza, L. G.

I show this in a simple economic model of an epidemic in which agents choose social activity under health state uncertainty. In the model, susceptible and asymptomatic agents are more socially active when they think they might be immune. And this increased activity escalates infections, deaths, and welfare losses. Antibody testing, however, prevents this escalation by revealing that those agents are not immune. Through this mechanism, I find that antibody testing prevents about 12% of COVID-19 related deaths within 12 months.","Guimaraes, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.06.21251251v1?rss=1,562

169241,Video shot boundary detection using principal component analysis (PCA) and deep learning,2021,"This paper examines the impact of the pandemic on both the author’s subjectivity, and the intersubjectivity of dyadic work. The prevailing mood of futility is well-captured by Albert Camus in his essay, “The Myth of Sisyphus”. Here Camus introduces the idea of absurdity, exemplified by our own unthinkable cosmic mortality or finitude. In this paper, absurdity is seen as a symbolic death, or traumatic loss, a temporal collapse into re-experienced despair or overwhelm. The stresses of COVID are shown to evoke a return to archaic overburdening and threatened loss of selfhood, reminiscent of the author’s upbringing as a “parentified” child in an alcoholic surround, which resulted in an affective quarantining, provoked again in current clinical entanglements. The end of personal office visits, with some patients halting treatment altogether, become Sisyphean losses for the author, and a threat to developmental strivings, both personal and professional. Patients are also shaken by the loss of intimate contact, along with other losses undermining to relationality. Such jarring finitude, uncertainty, and loss are viewed here through the lens of phenomenological-contextualism. Clinical vignettes are presented against the pandemic’s backdrop, as the stresses and shocks experienced by the analyst become a window into patients’ dread and overwhelm, leading to expansions of the analytic alliance.","Haber, Darren","Psychoanalysis, Self and Context",https://doi.org/10.1080/24720038.2021.1923719,562
169270,Automated Adaptations for Improving the Accessibility of Public E-Services Based on Annotations,2021,"PurposeReshoring is one of the supply chain risk management techniques suggested in literature. However, literature suggests that the decision-making involved in reshoring is complex and not fully understood. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, reshoring may represent a way to reduce reliance on global sources and improve resilience of their supply chains. This paper aims to explore if the pandemic is driving reshoring decisions and if the pandemic will actually lead to companies reshoring parts of their supply chain.Design/methodology/approachThis paper critically engages with senior(-most) supply chain managers from three manufacturing companies as they proceed through reshoring decision-making. This enables to develop experiential knowledge about reshoring decision-making processes and their context, as well as insights into the relevance of existing knowledge about reshoring. While not a full multiple case study, the opportunity to engage directly with senior(-most) supply chain managers as they consider reshoring, enables near real-time learning. Not only is reshoring a very timely topic literature has also called for more event-based empirical research. Further to that, it is hoped that this can complement this special issue and support, in a timely manner, the many researchers that are actively studying the impact of the pandemic on supply chains.FindingsReshoring was being actively considered by all three companies during the research process in Q3 and Q4 of 2020. During this period the pandemic has not yet led to substantial implementation of reshoring, at least by the companies studied in this paper. In response to tariffs on Chinese imports, companies had been diversifying their supply base away from China, but doing so by developing alternative, global sources. Additionally, companies are using alternative risk management techniques, such as supplier collaboration, in the short to medium term. Reshoring decision-making is indeed found to be complex and requires a longer-term time horizon for decision-making and implementation. Logistical challenges and growth in demand do drive a willingness of consumers to pay a premium for locally sourced products. However, when supply normalizes these considerations might lose relevance well before reshoring decision-making and implementation can be completed.Originality/valueThis paper studies reshoring in a real-world setting, learning directly from insights from industry as they emerge. This paper develops four extensions to existing knowledge, develop these in frameworks and hope that this will support ongoing consideration in industry and support the many researchers that are active in this domain today. This paper also suggests several directions for further research.","Remko van, Hoek Dobrzykowski David",Supply Chain Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/scm-09-2020-0498,562

The research conducted to date has focused mainly on the somatic complications of the disease, while only a few studies look at the potential direct mental health effects of the virus and its neurotropic potential. Views: The COVID-19 pandemic is also a psychologically significant stressor, affecting not only every aspect of an individual's life, but also economic and social sectors around the world. The deterioration of mental health can be caused not only by the fear of illness, death, or job loss, and uncertainty about the future, but also social isolation resulting from the loss of structured educational activities, professional activities and sanitary regime. We are slowly beginning to see the progressing effect of the current pandemic - not only the increasing symptoms of panic, anxiety and depression, but also somatization disorders, disadaptive syndromes, chronic fatigue syndrome, psychoactive substance abuse, and possibly also fixed post-pandemic personality disorders. Nosophobia, when it comes to the pandemic, takes the form of ""coronaphobia'. Conclusions: The protracted duration of the pandemic poses a threat to mental health. It causes a growing failure of psychological mechanisms for coping with the current situation. The study attempts to identify especially mentally vulnerable social groups, including the impact on health protection professionals from the perspective of a physician specializing in psychiatry. Disturbing social phenomena, highlighted by the pandemic, were identified, and practical aspects of the pandemic discussed - the new tasks that psychiatrists and psychologists face.","Pajor, P.",Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii,https://doi.org/10.5114/ppn.2021.108475,562

The complications related to coronavirus itself, physically inactive period due to symptoms of disease and lockdown may also influence the functional capacities of COVID-19 survivors negatively. It may lead to obstructions in engaging with previous activities of daily living. As a physiotherapy intervention, exercise treatment is one of the novel approaches to support these individuals after the COVID-19 treatment. However, there is limited access to physiotherapy and rehabilitation services during pandemic conditions because of lockdown, especially for infected patients. For increasing accessibility to physiotherapy and rehabilitation care, the World Confederation of Physical Therapy has published a report advising the home-based exercise interventions via Telerehabilitation. Up to date, there is no published framework for structured exercise programs for this population, yet. Since the individual differences in functional levels and possible differences in the severity of coronavirus infection, the physiotherapy, and rehabilitation exercise program should be structured individually for COVID-19 survivors.

However, little is known about the underlying patterns of these declines. Using new district-level data from Massachusetts, we find that these declines were concentrated in traditional districts while charter, virtual, and vocational districts increased their enrollment. Though the enrollment declines in traditional districts were widespread, we also find that the percent declines were significantly larger in smaller districts and those serving higher concentrations of White and economically disadvantaged students. The implications for understanding the pandemic?s effects on learning opportunities and the anticipated fiscal stress on public schools are discussed.","Dee, Thomas S.; Murphy, Mark",Educational Researcher,https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189x211034481,562
169868,SteriLightVent - Hybrid UV lighting decontamination device,2021,"In the period of self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic the time of contact of children and adolescents with technical means of Internet access has significantly increased, and accordingly time of contact of the students with device screens also increased. In turn, this significantly affected the health of students. Not all countries of the world have hygienic regulations in this area. Nevertheless, almost all countries of the world are trying to find ways to optimize the length of screen time for children and adolescents and are preparing recommendations to prevent negative health consequences. For the purposes of this study, we have reviewed the literature of recent years, reflecting the results of both individual and national studies focused primarily on identifying the causes of deterioration of the health of children and adolescents under the influence of digital technologies. The most significant changes, that can be caused by increase in screen time are disorders of mental health and sleep. Further consequences are disorders in the musculoskeletal system coupled with pain syndrome, metabolic disorders and obesity, hypodynamia. The indirect consequences are behavioural disorders and, in a broader sense, problems in the socialization of the child. It is currently not possible to exclude the use of various technical means. Moreover, they are used not only for entertainment, but also for educational purposes, and during the COVID-19 pandemic, they have often become the only means of any external communication and activities. In these conditions, it is necessary not only to know about the causes and consequences of the negative impact of technical means and various indicators, including screen time, but also to have an idea of approaches and ways to prevent their negative impact. © 2021 IEEE.","Mukhametzyanov, I.","1st International Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning in Higher Education, TELE 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/tele52840.2021.9482573,562

As part of their responses to a critical situation, healthcare professionals necessarily improvise. Some of these local improvisations have the potential to contribute to important innovations for health and social care systems with relevance beyond the particular service area and crisis in which they were developed.FindingsThis paper explores some key drivers of improvised innovation that may arise in response to a crisis. We highlight how services that are not considered immediate priorities may also emerge as especially fertile areas in this respect.ConclusionHealth managers and policymakers should monitor crisis-induced improvisations to counteract the potential deterioration of non-prioritised services and to identify and share useful innovations.

169929,Proposal of a Tele-Immersion Visiting System,2022,"Background: Medical professionals are aware that patients continue to use the internet as a medical information source. With the advent of government campaigns to increase awareness of data privacy and information sources, we investigate how the landscape of internet postings has changed for CF and how this could affect patients seeking online medical information. Methods: Key phrases relating to CF were identified by a CF multidisciplinary team and entered in Google Alerts with prospective tracking for 6 months in 2015. Alerts were also created for 3 non-orphan lung diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung fibrosis). These steps were repeated again in 2019 and the data compared. Results: In 2015, Asthma received the highest mean number of alerts per day (31.7), followed by CF (16.1), then COPD (14.6), and Lung Fibrosis (5.1). This changed in 2019 where CF was the highest with 19.5, followed by Asthma (11.5), COPD (10.3), and Lung Fibrosis (7.4). In both years, the USA generated (56%) the highest number of alerts for CF. There was an increased number of blocked articles in 2019 (540). In 2015, News (58%) was the most common category for CF alerts, but this changed to Financial/Marketing (35%) in 2019. In 2015 there was a small number of Social Media alerts recorded for all lung conditions;however, in 2019, there were none for the comparative lung conditions and only 3 for CF. Alert frequency for CF-related terms also increased in 2019. Conclusion: The landscape for internet postings for CF has changed. CF is now more commonly reported than other lung conditions and the ‘business of CF’ is now more frequently reported online while content from the general public has decreased (or is private). Medical professionals need to remain vigilant and increase awareness of information-dilution by monetary based media. A limitation of this study is that it predated the COVID-19 pandemic and it is suggested that future works revisit this at an appropriate time.","Vagg, T.; Ronan, N.

Much of this alteration involves increased use of the internet as a teaching tool in a variety of capacities. The evolving higher education landscape has resulted in many university faculty members reevaluating basic teaching concepts such as content delivery formats. These include delivering content either synchronously or asynchronously. Although existing literature examines the effectiveness of both synchronous and asynchronous delivery, very little exists pertaining to the role of internet access in higher education, even as rural America falls behind in broadband access. This accessibility increases in importance as more courses are taught online, with the digital divide introducing barriers for many rural students. As faculty work to maintain their own personal teaching styles while being cognizant of student needs, it is important to evaluate content delivery as a function of rural broadband availability.","Boerngen, Maria A.; Rickard, Justin W.",Natural Sciences Education,https://doi.org/10.1002/nse2.20044,562
169994,Surviving the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Role of Digital Innovation and Transformation,2021,"Background The key role of inflammation in the progression of COVID-19 was evident right from the beginning of the pandemic. Consequently, many authors studied the onset and evolution of the cytokine storm. In contrast, other inflammatory mediators such as oxylipins have received almost no attention. Methods We conducted a monocentric observational and retrospective study (IMPRE-COVID-19) with patients (aged [≥] 18 years) admitted to Pisa University Hospital with COVID-19 related pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in a nasopharyngeal swab, while pneumonia was demonstrated by CT scan. Oxylipin plasma levels were analysed in a convenient sample of 52 patients randomly selected from those that had a complete set of cytokine values evaluated for clinical purposes. In 12 cases, plasma samples collected on different days were available at the BMS Multispecialistic Biobank of Pisa University Hospital and were analysed to understand the evolution of the oxylipin levels during hospitalization. The two datasets that included oxylipin and cytokine values were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA), computation of Fisher s canonical variable, and a multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Findings Between March and April 2020, 52 patients were enrolled of which 28 were hospitalised in COVID-19 wards, 20 in ICUs, and 4 who were initially hospitalised in the wards and who were then transferred to the ICUs due to deteriorating health conditions. Plasma samples collected on different days were available from 7 patients in the wards, 1 from an ICU, and 4 from patients who were hospitalised in both. The mean age of participants was 61 years (SD 16), 11 were females (21%), and 41 were males (79%), without significant differences between groups in terms of age and gender. PCA of oxylipin data led to a clear differentiation of samples collected in COVID-19 wards and ICUs. This differentiation had not been obtained with cytokine data. In addition, borderline samples were from patients hospitalised in COVID-19 wards that were about to be transferred to the ICUs, thus suggesting that differentiation is not a consequence of a different treatment, but somehow related to a diverse evolution of the pathology. Computation of Fisher s canonical variable identified the original input variables that were the most effective in discriminating between the two classes. The combination of the two datasets did not improve the discrimination, thus suggesting that oxylipins are more informative than cytokines for this purpose. A multivariate class model built using the four lowest-order principal components as the input variables, and COVID-19 ward samples as the target class, produced a ROC curve with a resulting area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0{middle dot}92 - which is much higher than most AUC outcomes obtained for individual oxylipins. Interpretation After analysing the metabolic pathways of the most informative oxylipins, we speculate that more severe COVID-19 is associated with a selective deficiency of pro-resolving oxylipins leading to ineffective resolutive mechanisms of inflammation, likely worsened by endothelial damage. We believe that our oxylipin data suggest the possibility to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in individual patients at an early stage.

170043,Identifiability as an “Antidote”: Exploring Emotional Contagion and the Role of Anonymity in Twitter Discussions on Misinformation,2021,"Background: Patients (pts) with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased susceptibility to seasonal influenza and its complications.1 In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to better understand acute respiratory viral RNA infections, such as influenza, in pts with RA. Objectives: To present a comprehensive summary of data on influenza adverse events (AEs) occurring in the tofacitinib RA clinical programme. Methods: Influenza AEs were evaluated in pts with RA from 21 Phase (P)1-3b/4 trials and two open-label, long-term extension (LTE) studies from 2005-2019. These were analysed as two cohorts: P2-3b/4 cohort (pts who received tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg twice daily [BID] as monotherapy or with conventional synthetic [cs]DMARDs, adalimumab, methotrexate or placebo, in P2-3b/4 controlled studies) and Overall cohort (pts who received ≥1 tofacitinib dose, as monotherapy or with csDMARDs, in P1-3b/4 and LTE studies;data were summarised by average tofacitinib dose [average tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID based on average total daily dose of <15 or ≥15 mg, respectively]). Incidence rates (IRs;unique pts with events/100 pt-years of exposure;censored at day of first event or up to last dose +28 days) were evaluated for influenza AEs, influenza complication AEs, influenza-like illness (all composites of several MedDRA preferred/verbatim terms) and overall influenza AEs (composite of all preferred/verbatim terms included under influenza AEs, influenza complication AEs and influenza-like illness). In the Overall cohort, the incidence of serious non-influenza AEs within 28 days of the start of an overall influenza AE and time taken to resolution of overall influenza AEs by action taken were summarised descriptively. Results: In total, 7964 pts were included;517 (6.5%) pts reported overall influenza AEs, three of which occurred outside the risk period. In the P2-3b/4 cohort (N=6690), IRs for influenza AEs, influenza-like illness and overall influenza AEs generally appeared similar across treatment arms (Figure 1a). In the Overall cohort, IRs for influenza AEs and influenza-like illness were similar between tofacitinib doses (Figure 1b), and IRs for overall influenza AEs were similar between tofacitinib doses and pt age groups (Figure 1c). No influenza complication AEs (eg pneumonia/encephalitis influenzal) were reported in either cohort. Among pts with overall influenza AEs, nine (1.7%) had serious overall influenza AEs (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=6;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=3). Of these pts, eight (1.5%) were hospitalised (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=6;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=2) and two (0.4%) died (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=1;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=1). Both deaths occurred in pts with H1N1 Influenza A. Twelve (2.3%) pts had a serious non-influenza AE within 28 days of the start of the overall influenza AE (average tofacitinib 5 mg BID, n=6;average tofacitinib 10 mg BID, n=6). The most common serious non-influenza AEs (one event each in average tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID groups) were acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. In most pts with overall influenza AEs, no change to tofacitinib treatment was made (70.2%, n=363) or treatment was stopped temporarily (28.2%, n=146) for a mean duration of 11.0 days. The mean number of days to resolution of overall influenza AEs was numerically similar, ranging from 10.4-11.8 days across tofacitinib doses, irrespective of these actions. Conclusion: This post hoc analysis of influenza AEs across the tofacitinib RA clinical programme, over 14-15 influenza seasons, showed generally similar rates between treatment groups, and between tofacitinib doses and pt age groups. Limitations include varying exposure across treatment arms in the P2-3b/4 cohort. Most influenza AEs were non-serious (98.3%), and were not associated with changes to tofacitinib treatment.","Winthrop, K.; Yndestad, A.; Henrohn, D.; Jo, H.; Marsal, S.; Galindo-Izquierdo, M.; Diehl, A.; Shapiro, A.; Cohen, S.

170143,Estimation of Learners’ Engagement Using Face and Body Features by Transfer Learning,2021,"Ethnic and religious minorities have been disproportionately affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and are less likely to accept coronavirus vaccinations. Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish neighbourhoods in England experienced high incidences of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020-21 and measles outbreaks (2018-19) due to suboptimal childhood vaccination coverage. The objective of our study was to explore how the coronavirus vaccination programme (CVP) was co-delivered between public health services and an Orthodox Jewish health organisation. Methods included 28 semi-structured interviews conducted virtually with public health professionals, community welfare and religious representatives, and household members. We examined CVP delivery from the perspectives of those involved in organising services and vaccine beneficiaries. Interview data was contextualised within debates of the CVP in Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish print and social media. Thematic analysis generated five considerations: i) Prior immunisation-related collaboration with public health services carved a role for Jewish health organisations to host and promote coronavirus vaccination sessions, distribute appointments, and administer vaccines ii) Public health services maintained responsibility for training, logistics, and maintaining vaccination records; iii) The localised approach to service delivery promoted vaccination in a minority with historically suboptimal levels of coverage; iv) Co-delivery promoted trust in the CVP, though a minority of participants maintained concerns around safety; v) Provision of CVP information and stakeholders response to situated (context-specific) challenges and concerns. Drawing on this example of CVP co-delivery, we propose that a localised approach to delivering immunisation programmes could address service provision gaps in ways that involve trusted community organisations. Localisation of vaccination services can include communication or implementation strategies, but both approaches involve consideration of investment, engagement and coordination, which are not cost-neutral. Localising vaccination services in collaboration with welfare groups raises opportunities for the on-going CVP and other immunisation programmes, and constitutes an opportunity for ethnic and religious minorities to collaborate in safeguarding community health.","Kasstan, B.; Mounier-Jack, S.; Letley, L.; Gaskell, K.

170163,Pandemic Panic: The Effect of Disaster-Related Stress on Negotiation Outcomes,2021,"Domestic violence and gender-based violence has been studied and recognised for many years in Greece. Adequate legislation on the criminalization of domestic violence has been implemented since 2006 (Law 3500/2006 on the Confrontation of Domestic Violence). A network of support services has also operated across the country for many years, staffed with professionals trained in the gender-sensitive perspective. However, Greece still faces the impact of the economic crisis that started in 2010 and the critical aspects of the crisis from the reduction of the public budget imposed by the European institutions in the lives of the individuals, the victims and the providers of the social services have not been fully assessed yet. The COVID-19 pandemic created problems in the victims' access to social services and not only. The shadow pandemic describes the alarm on the increase of domestic violence during the pandemic and the isolation of the victims from the providers of social and psychological support. Addressing both the issue of domestic violence through a victim-centered approach before and during the pandemic in Greece and the need for the implementation of evidence-based policies are the general aims of the paper. To this, we present few findings from an original victimological online research on domestic violence during the first lockdown in the country (March to May 2020) and we justify the need for the implementation of evidencebased policies in the criminal justice system in Greece.","Artinopoulou, V.",Temida,https://doi.org/10.2298/tem2101003a,562
170190,Near-lossless compression for multichannel EEG using empirical mode decomposition,2020,"Social distancing as a form of nonpharmaceutical intervention has been enacted in many countries as a form of mitigating the spread of COVID-19. There has been a large interest in mathematical modeling to aid in the prediction of both the total infected population and virus-related deaths, as well as to aid government agencies in decision making. As the virus continues to spread, there are both economic and sociological incentives to minimize time spent with strict distancing mandates enforced, and/or to adopt periodically relaxed distancing protocols, which allow for scheduled economic activity. The main objective of this study is to reduce the disease burden in a population, here measured as the peak of the infected population, while simultaneously minimizing the length of time the population is socially distanced, utilizing both a single period of social distancing as well as periodic relaxation. We derive a linear relationship among the optimal start time and duration of a single interval of social distancing from an approximation of the classic epidemic SIR model. Furthermore, we see a sharp phase transition region in start times for a single pulse of distancing, where the peak of the infected population changes rapidly; notably, this transition occurs well before one would intuitively expect. By numerical investigation of more sophisticated epidemiological models designed specifically to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, we see that all share remarkably similar dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one-shot changes, and hence lead us to conclude that these features are universal in epidemic models. On the other hand, the nonlinearity of epidemic models leads to non-monotone behavior of the peak of infected population under periodic relaxation of social distancing policies. This observation led us to hypothesize that an additional single interval social distancing at a proper time can significantly decrease the infected peak of periodic policies, and we verified this improvement numerically. While synchronous quarantine and social distancing mandates across populations effectively minimize the spread of an epidemic over the world, relaxation decisions should not be enacted at the same time for different populations.","Sadeghi, Mahdiar; Greene, James M.; Sontag, Eduardo D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.21.163931,562
170266,Computer vision application to determine crowdedness in public transport stations,2021,"The 2022 Winter Olympics bid success promoted the development of the ice and snow sports in China. The emergence of indoor skiing system drives the ski and snow sports into a highly developed period especially at the normal prevention and control stage of COVID-19. However, the conventional indoor skiing system is insufficient in sports experience and inability to track the skier trajectory and attitude for training. Fortunately, the Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) and Micro Inertial Navigation System (MINS) are widely used in indoor environments due to high-precision positioning and low-cost priorities. UWB presents high accuracy in positioning, while it is easily to be disturbed by the Non Line of Sight (NLOS) and multipath effects. Meanwhile, the MINS error would accumulate with time. Therefore, this paper proposed a MINS/UWB integration algorithm to implement the trajectory and attitude measurement of the skier with low-cost. Meanwhile, the MINS/UWB based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is designed with sequential algorithm for skiing. Finally, both the indoor positioning experiment and the intelligent skiing system verification experiment were carried out to verify the accuracy of MINS/UWB integration system. Experimental results show the MINS/UWB integration technology could locate effectively when the UWB signal is intermittently blocked. © 2021 IEEE.","Cong, X.; Guo, H.; Ruan, J.; Guan, L.; Gao, Y.","18th IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation, ICMA 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icma52036.2021.9512654,562

Here, we conducted genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of methamphetamine stimulant sensitivity. To facilitate gene identification, we employed a Reduced Complexity Cross between closely related C57BL/6 mouse substrains and examined maximum speed and distance traveled over 30 min following methamphetamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). For maximum methamphetamine-induced speed following the second and third administration, we identified a single genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 11 that peaked near the Cyfip2 locus [LOD = 3.5, 4.2; peak = 21 cM (36 Mb)]. For methamphetamine-induced distance traveled, we identified a single genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 5 that peaked near a functional intronic indel in Gabra2 that codes for the alpha-2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor [LOD = 5.2; peak = 35 cM (67 Mb)]. Striatal cis-expression QTL mapping corroborated Gabra2 as a functional candidate gene underlying methamphetamine-induced distance traveled. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of the mutant intronic deletion on the C57BL/6J background to the wild-type C57BL/6NJ allele was sufficient to reduce methamphetamine-induced locomotor activity toward the wild-type C57BL/6NJ-like level, thus validating the quantitative trait variant (QTV). These studies demonstrate the power and efficiency of Reduced Complexity Crosses in identifying causal genes and variants underlying complex traits. Functionally restoring Gabra2 expression decreased methamphetamine stimulant sensitivity and supports preclinical and human genetic studies implicating the GABA-A receptor in psychostimulant addiction-relevant traits.

This includes identifying the geographical areas or travel routes most likely to contribute to the spreading of an outbreak. These areas and routes can then be monitored as part of an early warning system, be part of intervention strategies, e.g. lockdowns, aiming to mitigate the spreading of the disease or be a focus of vaccination campaigns.In this paper we present our work in developing a network-based infection model between the municipalities of Sweden in order to identify the areas most likely to contribute to an epidemic. We first construct a human mobility model based on the well-known radiation model, then we employ a network-based compartmental model to simulate epidemic outbreaks with various parameters. Finally, we adopt the influence maximization problem known in network science to identify the municipalities having the largest impact on the spreading of infectious diseases.We only present the first part of our work in this paper. In the future, we plan to investigate the robustness of our model in identifying high-risk areas by simulating outbreaks with various parameters. We also plan to extend our work to selecting the most likely infection paths contributing to the spreading of infectious diseases. © 2021 IEEE.","Bridgwater, A.; Bota, A.","33rd Annual Workshop of the Swedish Artificial Intelligence Society, SAIS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/sais53221.2021.9483971,562
170617,Controlled testing and isolation for suppressing covid-19,2021,"To facilitate timely treatment and management of COVID-ap patients, efficient and quick identification of COVID-19 patients is of immense importance during the COVID-19 crisis. Technological developments in machine learning (ML) methods, edge computing, computer-aided medical diagnostic been utilized for COVID-19 Classification. This is mainly because of their ability to deal with Big data and their inherent robustness and ability to provide distinct output characteristics attributed to the underlying application. The contrary transcription-polymerase chain reaction is currently the clinical typical for COVID-19 diagnosis. Besides being expensive, it has low sensitivity and requires expert medical personnel. Compared with RT-PCR, chest X-rays are easily accessible with highly available annotated datasets and can be utilized as an ascendant alternative in COVID-19 diagnosis. Using X-rays, ML methods can be employed to identify COVID-19 patients by quantitively examining chest X-rays effectively. Therefore, we introduce an alternative, robust, and intelligent diagnostic tool for automatically detecting COVID-19 utilizing available resources from digital chest X-rays. Our technique is a hybrid framework that is based on the fusion of two techniques, Neutrosophic techniques (NTs) and ML. Classification features are extracted from X-ray images using morphological features (MFs) and principal component analysis (PCA). The ML networks were trained to classify the chest X-rays into two classes: positive (+ve) COVID-19 patients or normal subjects (or −ve). The experimental results are performed based on a sample from a collected comprehensive image dataset from several hospitals worldwide. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score for the proposed scheme was 98.46%, 98.19%, 98.18%, 98.67%, and 98.17%. The experimental results also documented the high accuracy of the proposed pipeline compared to other literature techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Yasser, I.; Abd El-Khalek, A.

We aimed to evaluate the experiences and working environment at an NCI-designated Cancer Center for current and future parents in the post-COVID era. We hypothesized there would be differences in the experiences of parents between men and women, and between trainees, faculty, and staff. Methods: A 61-question online survey for current and future parents was developed by the Women's Task Force of the Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Questions focused on perceived attitudes towards parents, the supportive nature of the working environment for parents, experiences with breastfeeding as a working parent, and childcare responsibilities preand post-COVID. The survey was sent to 562 scientific faculty, physicians, trainees, and research staff at HCC. Comparisons between groups of interest were performed using a chi-square test. Results:There were 214 respondents (38% response rate) with even representation: 38% were faculty, 27% were trainees, and 35% were research staff;59% were female. 6% of respondents reported being 'discouraged or excluded from participating in specific activities due to having or planning children', and 24% felt 'moderately supported' as a parent at work. Regarding breastfeeding, 58% reported that the decision to breastfeed was moderately impacted by returning to work, and of the women who were currently or recently breastfeeding, 42% reported that there were not enough lactation rooms in their building. Other questions in the survey aimed to evaluate what further support would be helpful for parents. 40% reported that on-site childcare would help better support them as a parent, especially because 47% documented that finding childcare was difficult and 53% documented that they looked at ≥4 daycares or nannies. Further, 49% reported that they did not know where to look for resources in finding childcare. Pre-COVID, 32% reported spending 2-3 hours a day on childcare and/or home responsibilities;post-COVID, 55% reported spending ≥4 hours a day. These effects were more pronounced in women compared to men (p &lt; 0.05). Pre-COVID, 40% reported that they were unable to participate in work events due to childcare responsibilities, which increased to 54% post-COVID, and was most pronounced in faculty and trainees compared to staff (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Our survey describes some of the universal challenges of working parents in Oncology, which have been exacerbated by COVID. The impact of COVID was more pronounced in women. Further studies are needed for systematic interventions or policies that improve support for working parents, including unified resources and working groups for current and expecting parents.","Im, A.

The detection of COVID-19 has become a crucial task in the medical sector because of the soaring cases and the paucity of pharmaceutical supplies for detection. Considering the urgency, an immediate auxiliary automatic detection system is required for early diagnosis of the disease and helps the affected patients to be under immediate care. In this work, we aimed to propose an automatic detection system based on lung X-ray images, as radiography modalities is a promising way of faster diagnosis. In this work, we built a machine learning model considering X-ray images taken from publicly available data sets of 2000 images. The relevant features from the images were taken for building the model, prior that proper segmentation was applied to the X-ray images. The X-ray images are prone to noise and spatial aliasing which leads the boundary to be indistinguishable, so proper image segmentation is required Comprehensive validation has been performed on different segmentation techniques, among those, Sobel demonstrated an accurate result, which is not only effective in detecting edges but also good in removing noises within the image. Further, the preprocessed image is fed to a support vector machine (SVM) model, which accomplished the maximum classification accuracy of 99.17%, also SVM achieved precision, recall, and F1 score of 99.24%, 98.13%, 98.68% respectively in predicting the COVID-19 versus other pulmonary diseases.

170785,Internet Based Remote Laboratory Architecture for 3-Phase Induction Motor Control System Experiment,2021,"In Drosophila, nutrient status is sensed by the fat body, a functional homolog of mammalian liver and white adipocytes. The fat body conveys nutrient information to insulin-producing cells (IPCs) through humoral factors which regulate Drosophila insulin-like peptide (DILP) levels and insulin signalling. Insulin signalling has pleiotropic functions, which include the management of growth and metabolic pathways. Here, we report that Edem1 (endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein 1), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein involved in protein quality control, acts in the fat body to regulate insulin signalling and thereby the metabolic status in Drosophila. Edem1 limits the fat body derived Drosophila TNFα Eiger activity on IPCs and maintains systemic insulin signalling in fed conditions. During food deprivation, edem1 gene expression levels drop, which aids in the reduction of systemic insulin signalling crucial for survival. Overall we demonstrate that Edem1 plays a vital role in helping the organism to endure a fluctuating nutrient environment by managing insulin signalling and metabolic homeostasis.","Pathak, Himani; Varghese, Jishy",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/671305,562

Since the introduction of corporate sustainability, it has been seen an extra cost for risk mitigation and making “compensating” positive impact. The world has reached a tipping point of volatility, mainly due to climate change but also due to the emergence of COVID-19, therefore the applicability of existing corporate structures is under question and this poses high risk to the existence of our planet. On the other hand, the technology cost for sustainable investment has reached parity in comparison with non-sustainable alternatives. Therefore, our proposed Organic Growth Theory introduces a step-by-step approach so that corporates can grow and be profitable without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. It is concluded that a new structure for corporates, called founcorps, would be required to direct corporates to evolve into being a responsible legal entity.","Karnama, Ahmad Vinuesa Ricardo",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12208523,562

At the same time, existing pro-vaccination public health communication strategies have proven ineffective. We present a novel approach to increase vaccination intentions, which appeals to individuals' other-regarding preferences. Specifically, we assess how vaccination intentions are influenced by the presence of people who cannot vaccinate, such as the immunosuppressed, newborns or pregnant women, using a game where there is a passive player whose welfare depends on the decisions of other, active players. Results from a survey experiment targeting parents and from a laboratory experiment provide support for a twofold positive effect of the presence of the passive player on vaccination intentions. These findings suggest messages that invoke altruistic, other-regarding preferences may be an effective approach to increasing vaccination intentions. Our findings could be extended to other campaigns where the population is invited to adopt behaviors that can help the most susceptible people, as is the case of the self-quarantine measures adopted during the outbreak of CoVID-19 at the beginning of 2020. If the attention of people is focused on the positive effect that they can have on those that cannot protect themselves, then the message may be more effective and people may be more responsive.","Cucciniello, M.; Pin, P.; Imre, B.; Porumbescu, G.; Melegaro, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.14.20100586v1?rss=1,562

In this research, we further developed AutoVEM into AutoVEM2. AutoVEM2 is composed of three modules, including call module, analysis module, and plot module, which can be used modularly or as a whole for any virus, as long as the corresponding reference genome is provided. Therefore, it’s much more flexible than AutoVEM. Here, we analyzed three existing viruses by AutoVEM2, including SARS-CoV-2, HBV and HPV-16, to show the functions, effectiveness and flexibility of AutoVEM2. We found that the N501Y locus was almost completely linked to the other 16 loci in SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the UK and Europe. Among the 17 loci, 5 loci were on the S protein and all of the five mutations cause amino acid changes, which may influence the epidemic traits of SARS-CoV-2. And some candidate key mutations of HBV and HPV-16, including T350G of HPV-16 and C659T of HBV, were detected. In brief, we developed a flexible automated tool to analyze candidate key mutations and epidemic trends for any virus, which would become a standard process for virus analysis based on genome sequences in the future. Highlights An automatic tool to quickly analyze candidate key mutations and epidemic trends for any virus was developed. Our integrated analysis method and tool could become a standard process for virus mutation and epidemic trend analysis based on genome sequences in the future.

Removal of particles and droplets via filtration from a volume can drastically reduce the exposure to viruses, but viruses may remain active on filtration surfaces as potential resuspension or fomite risks. Here, we report the development of macroscopic carbon nanotube air filters synthesized using ultra-thin carbon nanotube electrically conductive membranes, mechanically supported by a porous polyester backing. Filtration efficiencies were measured up to 99.999%, while ultra-thin materials with low areal density (0.1 g m─2) exhibited pressure drops comparable to commercial High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. These electrically conductive filters are actively self-sanitized by thermal flashes via resistive heating to temperatures above 80 °C within seconds or less. Such temperatures were proven to achieve full deactivation of a betacoronavirus and an adeno-associated virus retained on filter surfaces. A filtration unit prototype equipped with a CNT filter module (∼1.2 m2) was shown to achieve air purification of 99% of a room within 10 min at 26 air changes per hour.

The access of the latter to procurement procedures in the EU may hence be blocked, but this essentially is a prerogative of each national government and of each contracting authority. On the other hand, confronted with an assault by Chinese companies which have managed to capture a dangerously big share of the EU public procurement market, the Commission started an active campaign on several fronts. More recently, the Commission decided to make a substantial effort in convincing Member States to come forward with concrete measures by which to restrict in an effective manner the access of third-country and, in particular, Chinese, suppliers to the EU procurement market. In response, the Romanian Government adopted in April 2021 a new set of laws providing for the automatic exclusion from the award procedures of all suppliers residing in one of the countries listed therein.

171279,Job Satisfaction and Expectations of Pharmacy Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Application of DEMATEL Method,2021,"Common genetic variants modulate the cellular response to viruses and are implicated in a range of immune pathologies, including infectious and autoimmune diseases. The transcriptional antiviral response is known to vary between infected cells from a single individual, yet how genetic variants across individuals modulate the antiviral response (and its cell-to-cell variability) is not well understood. Here, we triggered the antiviral response in human fibroblasts from 68 healthy donors, and profiled tens of thousands of cells using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed GASPACHO (GAuSsian Processes for Association mapping leveraging Cell HeterOgeneity), the first statistical approach designed to identify dynamic eQTLs across a transcriptional trajectory of cell populations, without aggregating single-cell data into pseudo-bulk. This allows us to uncover the underlying architecture and variability of antiviral response across responding cells, and to identify more than two thousands eQTLs modulating the dynamic changes during this response. Many of these eQTLs colocalise with risk loci identified in GWAS of infectious and autoimmune diseases. As a case study, we focus on a COVID-19 susceptibility locus, colocalised with the antiviral OAS1 splicing QTL. We validated it in blood cells from a patient cohort and in the infected nasal cells of a patient with the risk allele, demonstrating the utility of GASPACHO to fine-map and functionally characterise a genetic locus. In summary, our novel analytical approach provides a new framework for delineation of the genetic variants that shape a wide spectrum of transcriptional responses at single-cell resolution.","Kumasaka, Natsuhiko; Rostom, Raghd; Huang, Ni; Polanski, Krzysztof; Meyer, Kerstin B.; Patel, Sharad; Boyd, Rachel; Gomez, Celine; Barnett, Sam N.; Panousis, Nikolaos I; Schwartzentruber, Jeremy; Ghoussaini, Maya; Lyons, Paul A.; Calero-Nieto, Fernando J.; Göttgens, Berthold; Barnes, Josephine L.; Worlock, Kaylee B.; Yoshida, Masahiro; Nikolic, Marko Z.; Stephenson, Emily; Reynolds, Gary; Haniffa, Muzlifah; Marioni, John; Stegle, Oliver; Hagai, Tzachi; Teichmann, Sarah A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.457774,562

Here, we describe an installation-free Graphical User Interface (GUI) running in the web browser, which is distinct from the simulation engine running anywhere, on the student’s laptop or on a supercomputer. This architecture provides robustness against technological changes in the software stack and simplifies deployment for self-education and for teachers. Our new open source tool, NEST Desktop, comprises graphical elements for creating and configuring network models, running simulations, and visualizing and analyzing the results. NEST Desktop allows students to explore important concepts in computational neuroscience without the need to learn a simulator control language before. Our experiences so far highlight that NEST Desktop helps advancing both quality and intensity of teaching in computational neuroscience in regular university courses. We view the availability of the tool on public resources like the European ICT infrastructure for neuroscience EBRAINS as a contribution to equal opportunities. Significance Statement The graphical user interface NEST Desktop makes neuronal network simulations accessible to non-programmers. It facilitates the interactive exploration of neuronal network models by integrating the whole workflow of wiring up the setup, simulating the neuronal dynamics, and analyzing the recorded activity data into a single tool. NEST Desktop effectively supports teaching the concepts and methods of computational neuroscience. Due to its installation-free web-based implementation, it is in particularly suitable for online courses.","Spreizer, Sebastian; Senk, Johanna; Rotter, Stefan; Diesmann, Markus; Weyers, Benjamin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.15.444791,562

This paper reviews the forced urgent transition to complete online learning in two different scenarios during the Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020. The two different scenarios are a Japanese university and a Chinese senior high school. Rather than simply listing actions of how online learning was conducted in these two schools, this research focuses on what role the cultural factors played in the transition. The authors primarily investigated the cultural differences in terms of institutional decision making, teachers’ online instructions, students’ online learning behaviors, and the involvement of students’ families between two schools in two different countries. Several interesting cultural differences reflected in the transition were found: as for decision and information delivery, email was the major communication tool in Japan, while social media group was most welcomed in China;as for online instructions, the Japanese university teachers were concessive, while the Chinese teachers were somewhat dominant;As for online learning recourses, Japanese students have less than their Chinese students;As for online learning behavior, Japanese students minded self-disclosure in virtual classes while Chinese students were open;As for family role, Chinese parents were much more heavily involved in their children’s online learning… As the transformation to technology-driven education is still continuing with and will continue after the Covid-19 Pandemic, the findings from this research will leave us in no doubt that educators who need to take part in online teaching in local, regional, national, and international contexts need to seriously consider impact of cultural factors. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Wang, S.; Chen, A.","14th International Conference on Blended Learning, ICBL 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80504-3_24,562

Moreover, the ageing of the global population and the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic are creating a rapid rise of demand for healthcare services. This includes those who are in need of remote monitoring for chronic conditions through rehabilitation exercises. Therefore, this paper presents a telehealth system using PoseNet for in-home rehabilitation, with built-in statistical computation for doctors to analyze the patient’s recovery status. This system enables patients to perform rehabilitation exercises at home using an ordinary webcam. The PoseNet skeleton-tracking method is applied to detect and track the patients’ angular movements for both elbows and knees. By using this system, the measurement of the elbow and knee joint angles can be calculated and recorded while patients are performing rehabilitation exercises in front of the laptop webcam. After the patients complete their rehabilitation exercises, the skeleton results of four body parts will be generated. Based on the same actions performed by patients on selected days, the doctors can examine and evaluate the deviation rate of patients’ angular movements between different days to determine the recovery rate.","Chua, Jiaming Meng-Chew Leow",Future Internet,https://doi.org/10.3390/fi13070173,562

Above and beyond the new prospects that this situation arises, also many problems were raised. For example, the special care education e.g., deaf or hard hearing students, face more difficulties than in ordinary situations. These students either read the lips or have to see their interlocutor’s whole body, in order to understand what he/she is saying but this nowadays is almost inevitable. In the unlikely scenario that their school is open, all classroom participants including teacher must wear a face mask, while in distance learning they can see only a small window of their teacher and most likely only his/her face.

However, daylighting design is challenging for high rise living since configuration of multiple apartments together often results in deep plans and wrongly oriented apartments with poor daylighting. Melbourne considered as the most liveable city in the world has witnessed a boom in high rise apartments in recent years, where bedrooms were designed without windows or with one small opening. Previous studies indicated that one out of two apartments in Melbourne’s central business district (CBD) failed to provide daylighting in the bedrooms. This has led to amendments in planning policy with the aim of providing access to daylight in all habitable rooms. This paper investigates the daylighting conditions in apartment buildings using field measurement and daylight simulations. Daylight levels in 12 apartment units in Melbourne CBD were measured. Additionally, daylight simulations were conducted to identify ways for optimizing light levels in standard layouts. The field measurements showed that daylighting levels were insufficient in one third the apartments due to the presence of deep floor plates and external obstructions. The results from the daylight simulations showed that window to floor area ratio (WFR) of approximately 30% is required for achieving acceptable daylighting levels in bedrooms that have south orientation.","Abidi, Sehar",Infrastructures,https://doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures5100081,562

These rules have caused many things such as limitation of social interaction and increased limit of public places, including campuses, schools, and other educational institution. This condition leads to the difficulties of educational activities since most classes are either canceled or moved to an online platform. Instead of classes, most of the workshops, conferences, and other activities which are important to students have been canceled or postponed. To alleviate the pandemic impact in education especially for college students this work proposed a system for conduction remote practicum safely and effectively to support the education and experience of these students.

The authors argue that highly improbable, but high-impact events require the upper echelons of management, traditionally the custodians of strategy formulation to offer a new kind of strategic leadership focused on new mindsets, organizational capabilities, more in tune with high uncertainty and unpredictability. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on strategic leadership, and complexity leadership theory, the authors review the literature and present a conceptual framework for exploring the nature of strategic leadership under uncertainty. The authors conceptualize organizations as complex adaptive systems and discuss the imperatives for developing new mental models for emergent leadership. Findings: Strategic leaders have a key role to play in preparing their organizations for episodic disruptions. These include developing their adaptive capabilities and building resilient organizations to ensure their organizations cannot only bounce back after a disruption but have the capacity for transformation to new fitness levels when necessary. Strategic leaders must engage with complexity leadership by seeing their organizations as complex adaptive systems, reconfigure their leadership approaches and organizations to build strategic adaptive capability. Research limitations/implications: This is a conceptual paper and the authors cannot make any claims of causality. Practical implications: Organizational leaders need to reconfigure their mental models and leadership approaches to reflect the new normal of uncertainty and unpredictability. Developing the strategic adaptive capability of organizations should prepare them for dealing with high impact events. To assure business continuity in the face of disruptions requires building flexible, adaptable business models.

Successful arboviruses often modify host immunity to accelerate pathogen transmission; however, few studies have explored the underlying mechanism. Here we report attracted herbivore infestation on the virus-infected plants promote transmission by the associated vector herbivore. This herbivore-induced defense suppression underpins a subversive mechanism used by Begomovirus, the largest genus of plant viruses, to compromise host defense for pathogen transmission. Begomovirus-infected plants accumulated βC1 proteins in the phloem where they were bound to host defense regulators, transcription factor WRKY20 and two mitogen-activated protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6. Once perceiving whitefly herbivory or endogenous secreted peptide PEP1, the plants started dephosphorylation on serine33 and stimulated βC1 protein as a phosphatase. βC1 dephosphorylated MPK3/6 and WRKY20, the latter negatively regulated salicylic acid signaling and vascular callose deposition. This viral hijacking of WRKY20 accumulated more vascular callose by which enforced whitefly prolonged salivation and phloem sap ingestion, therefore impelling more virus transmission among plants. We present a scenario in which viruses dynamically respond to the presence of their vectors, suppressing host immunity and promoting pathogen transmission only when needed.","Zhao, Pingzhi; Wang, Ning; Yao, Xiangmei; Zhu, Changxiang; Hogenhout, Saskia A.; Liu, Shu-sheng; Zhou, Xueping; Fang, Rongxiang; Ye, Jian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.158212,562

BACKGROUND: Immune mechanisms in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia are incompletely characterized. DESIGN/METHODS: A subsample of the prospective Northern Manhattan Study underwent detailed neuropsychological testing. Cognitive scores were converted into Z-scores and categorized into four domains (memory, language, processing speed, and executive function) based on factor analysis. Blood samples were analyzed using a 60-plex immunoassay. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) procedures to select markers and their interactions independently associated with cognitive scores. Linear regression models assessed cross-sectional associations of known correlates of cognition with cognitive scores, and assessed model fit before and after addition of LASSO-selected immune markers. RESULTS: Among 1179 participants (mean age 70+8.9 years, 60% women, 68% Hispanic), inclusion of LASSO-selected immune markers improved model fit above age, education, and other risk factors (p for likelihood ratio test<0.005 for all domains). C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 11 (CCL 11, eotaxin), C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 9 (CXCL9), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and serpin E1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) were associated with each of the domains and with overall cognitive function. Immune marker effects were comparable to conventional risk factors: for executive function, each standard deviation (SD) increase in CCL11 was associated with an effect equivalent to aging three years; for memory, HGF had twice the effect of aging. CONCLUSIONS: Immune markers associate with cognitive function in a multi-ethnic cohort. Further work is needed to validate these findings and determine optimal treatment targets.","Elkind, M.

Around 50% of the people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) may require insulin, which may be temporary (during acute illness) or permanent if glucose control is inadequate with other agents.4 Permanent insulin therapy is usually commenced when there is evidence of beta-cell functional decline, which may present with symptomatic hyperglycaemia (polyuria, polydipsia and unintentional weight loss). During the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing numbers of patients have been commenced on insulin in hospital due to acute hyperglycaemia commonly seen with the disease or due to therapy with steroids, exacerbating hyperglycaemia.6 In the circumstance of steroid exacerbated diabetes, morning doses of steroids lead to hyperglycaemia particularly later in the day around afternoon or evening. According to their characteristics, insulins are grouped into five main categories.4 * Short-acting insulin (human): examples include Actrapid and Humulin S.

Texas Oncology found that most ED visits occurred during regular business hours. Prolonged patient call back times were consistently rated poorly on satisfaction surveys and often led to ED visits for symptoms that could be managed in our offices. We partnered with Navigating Cancer (NC) to implement an electronic patient management technology solution. Methods: For each of our 200 locations, call volume was estimated based on clinic volume. We then reallocated or hired dedicated triage nurses and operators. Incoming calls were entered into the NC dashboard by operators as incidents which were routed based on symptom priority following system generated prompts. Incident volumes and resolution times were tracked. We instituted PDSA cycles at all locations with a goal of less than 90-minute resolution of symptom-related incidents Utilizing the electronic dashboard allowed us to continue this initiative during the COVID-19 public health emergency as our staff could work remotely. Nurses were able to document if a potential ED visit was avoided. These data points allowed our practice to establish comprehensive and strategic actions plans for quality improvement. Results: We finalized implementation of the system in February of 2020. Total incidents for 2020 were over 1 million, averaging over 5000 per location. Resolution time for all incidents started at 3.2 hours pre-implementation and improved to 2.2 hours in December of 2020. Resolution times for symptom-related incidents started at 2.3 hours pre-implementation and ended at 1.5 hours in December of 2020 with over 60% resolved under one hour. 8% of symptom-related incidents resulted in definite or probable ED avoidances by nursing assessment. Shortness of breath, vomiting, chills, and weakness were the top symptom types addressed for ED avoidances. Conclusions: An electronic patient management solution with PDSA cycles of quality improvement can markedly reduce call back times, especially for symptom related calls. We believe managing symptoms in a timely fashion will lower ED visits and hospitalizations as well as improve patient satisfaction. We will report on these outcomes once available.","Wilfong, L.

Due to national shutdowns, reduced transport logistics, and containment measures on the federal and provincial levels, the authorities could not meet the rising demand from the health care system on the PPE equipment. Fortunately, the PPE production capacities in China have regained (and expanded) their available capacities through which Austria now can get the demand of PPE to protect its citizens. ADAPT develops an adaptive and autonomous decision-making network to support the involved stakeholders along the PPE supply chain to save and protect human lives.

173625,A Study on User Experience of COVID-19 Emergency Communication Platform from Cross-cultural Perspective of View,2021,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the costliest disease affecting the cattle industry globally. Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of BRD is not yet fully understood. It is widely believed that viruses predispose cattle to bacterial infection by causing direct damage to the respiratory tract and interfering with the immune system, leading to bacterial pneumonia. BRD remains a major challenge despite extensive vaccination against all major viral pathogens associated with the disease. Orthomyxoviruses (Influenza C & D viruses), have recently been found to infect cattle throughout the United States and are implicated to play a role in BRD. Here, we use the largest cohort study to date to investigate the association of influenza viruses in cattle with BRD. Cattle (n=599) from 3 locations were individually observed and scored for respiratory symptoms using the McGuirk scoring system. Deep pharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs were collected from each animal and were tested quantitatively for bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, influenza C virus (ICV) and influenza D virus (IDV) by real-time PCR. Cattle that have higher viral loads of IDV and ICV also have greater numbers of co-infecting viruses than controls. More strikingly, in BRD-symptomatic cattle, the geometric mean of detectable IDV viral RNA was nearly 2 logs higher in co-infected animals (1.30×104) than those singly infected with IDV (2.19×102). This is strong evidence that viral coinfections can lead to higher replication of IDV. Our results strongly suggest that orthomyxoviruses may be significant contributors to BRD.","Nissly, Ruth H.; Zaman, Noriza; Ibrahim, Puteri Ainaa S.; McDaniel, Kaitlin; Lim, Levina; Kiser, Jennifer N.; Bird, Ian; Chothe, Shubhada K.; Bhushan, Gitanjali L.; Vandegrift, Kurt; Neibergs, Holly J.; Kuchipudi, Suresh V.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.118166,562

Although Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard for clinical diagnosis, it is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. At the same time, more and more people have doubted the sensitivity of RT-PCR. Therefore, Computed Tomography (CT) images are used as a substitute for RT-PCR. Powered by the research of the field of artificial intelligence, deep learning, which is a branch of machine learning, has made a great success on medical image segmentation. However, general full supervision methods require pixel-level point-by-point annotations, which is very costly. In this paper, we put forward an image segmentation method based on weakly supervised learning for CT images of COVID-19, which can effectively segment the lung infection area and doesn't require pixel-level labels. Our method is contrasted with another four weakly supervised learning methods in recent years, and the results have been significantly improved.","Chen, H. Y.; Wang, S.

Moreover, the spread of infodemics creates daunting challenges for peaceful livelihood and fighting the pandemic. In this article, we propose CovChain, a blockchain-based Internet of Things solution for identity preservation and anti-infodemics. Toward this, we propose storing patient information on a private blockchain and exploiting its immutability feature, which helps combat infodemics. We further propose encrypting the data using a distributed attribute-based encryption (d-ABE) scheme to facilitate restricted access to information based on the clearance level. We also propose reducing the load on the miners by using geographically-aware fog nodes. As data in a blockchain is immutable, we delete the blocks corresponding to recovering patients and store the information in a forked CovChain. The cardinality of the two chains helps in maintaining a global census by the cloud servers. Through system implementations, we present the feasibility of CovChain on resource-constrained devices within tolerable delays of 1 s, upload and download rates of 35 kb/s, and CPU (single-core) and memory utilization under 70 percent.","Deb, P.

173845,An Improved Data Driven Dynamic Sird Model for Predictive Monitoring of Covid-19,2021,"To determine the racial disparities in oncology visits of racial minorities before and after COVID-19. Data were obtained from the electronic health records, a multi-specialty healthcare system serving a racially/ethnically diverse patient population in northern California. The study cohort included patients who had at least one oncology visit from January 2019 to August 2020. We examined the trends in the volume of oncology office visits and adoption of video visits during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic period. Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression were performed to examine variability in use of video visits by specific patient characteristics (sex, age, race/ethnicity and language barrier). Of 63,903 cancer patients (median age: 66;68% female), Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians and others composed of 64.8%, 3.5%, 9.2%, 11.7% and 10.8% of our study cohort. Over the 20 month study period, the drop in in-person visits began in March and peaked in April 2020. Compared to the year 2019, the office visits decreased by -16.6%, -55.9%, and -50.9% in March, April, and May of 2020. Although there was a trend towards increased office visits in June (-21.9% compared to 2019), this again decreased to -35% in July 2020. The proportion of visits conducted by video began at 16.6% in the first week after California's shelter-in-place order in March, peaked at a high rate of 43.4% in April, and remained at a rate of 33.8% in August. We focused on variability by specific patient subgroups when telemedicine was offered and used prevalently during early pandemic in April. Based on age, the younger cohorts, 18-50 and 51-64 year olds, were more likely to utilize video visit at 50.6%, and 50.6% compared to only 38.0% and 36.7% of the older groups (65-75 and 76+ years old, p<0.001). In fact, the largest discrepancy, 21% difference between the younger vs older groups, was observed towards the end of April. With respect to race, Asians had the highest use of video visits (51.4%) compared to Hispanic (34.5%) and Black patients (40.3%) in April (p<0.001). Although the gap narrowed over the next 4 months with only a 4% difference by August, these cancelled visits were not recovered in the minority groups. Finally, 44.6% of those who did not require an interpreter utilized video visits as compared to only 19.8% who did require an interpreter (p<0.001). Age and race/ethnicity remain strong predictors of video visit use after adjusting the main and interaction effects of patient characteristics, with Asians 51-64 year old having the highest rate (58%) and Hispanics 76+ year old the lowest rate (30%). Overall office visits have decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older patients, Black patients, Hispanic patients, and patients who required interpreting services were less likely to be treated through video visits. Future studies are needed to better understand the barriers to telemedicine care.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of ED health care personnel in 20 geographically diverse university-affiliated EDs from May 13, to July 8, 2020, including case counts of prior laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnoses among all ED health care personnel, and then point-in -time serology (with confirmatory testing) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing in a sample of volunteers without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis. Health care staff were categorized as clinical (physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses) and nonclinical (clerks, social workers, and case managers). Previously undiagnosed infection was based on positive SARS-CoV-2 serology or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction result among health care personnel without prior diagnosis. Results: Diagnosed COVID-19 occurred in 2.8% of health care personnel (193/6,788), and the prevalence was similar for nonclinical and clinical staff (3.8% versus 2.7%;odds ratio 1.5;95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.2). Among 1,606 health care personnel without previously diagnosed COVID-19, 29 (1.8%) had evidence of current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most (62%;18/29) who were seropositive did not think they had been infected, 76% (19/25) recalled COVID-19-compatible symptoms, and 89% (17/19) continued to work while symptomatic. Accounting for both diagnosed and undiagnosed infections, 4.6% (95% confidence interval 2.8% to 7.5%) of ED health care personnel were estimated to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, with 38% of those infections undiagnosed. Conclusion: In late spring and early summer 2020, the estimated prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was 4.6%, and greater than one third of infections were undiagnosed. Undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection may pose substantial risk for transmission to other staff and patients.","Mohr, N. M.; Harland, K. K.; Krishnadasan, A.; Ten Eyck, P.; Mower, W.

It should be admitted that higher education worldwide is changing, and institutions face challenges when adapting to the new COVID-19 reality - blended digital teaching and learning. They are tackling several issues connected with the essence of virtual education, its technical aspect, and students' learning environment. During COVID-19 lockdown, teachers have to prepare and deliver their classes from home, simultaneously coping with numerous professional and technical challenges, often without any appropriate support. In addition to that, they were lack of technology literacy, professional knowledge, and experience needed for successful E-teaching. Besides, a new mode of blended digital teaching and learning also made them consider technical and administrative aspects of the current educational process, namely to use new educational platforms and tools, organize active workflows, and work out critical educational principles to design and facilitate practical online experiences. Along with the challenges that the teachers face in such conditions, they should be able to cope with the stress and psychological disorders of pupils and students. The article emphasizes the abnormal psychology of youngsters (pupils and students) as the result of stress and anxiety that appeared during Covid lockdown - the application of psychological science to understanding and treating mental disorders - and the use of video as a productive means of avoiding psychological disabilities. The research objective is to prove that video is an effective educational tool for avoiding psychological difficulties in blended digital learning during COVID-19 lockdown while teaching foreign languages, literature, and culture. Special attention is paid to psychological strategies of overcoming stress during COVID-19 lockdown, as well as to effective ways to students' adapt to a virtual learning environment, development and implementation of anti-stress methods, which heighten their motivation. The article also heads on and explores potential solutions to educational problems that one can encounter in the new educational process at the post-COVID-19 epidemic period, such as the quality of education offered, its cost and availability, internationalization, and employability.","Babelyuk, O.; Koliasa, O.; Lopushanskyy, V.; Smaglii, V.; Yukhymets, S.",Arab World English Journal,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.13,562

We compared the performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) model and convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The performance of the CNN model was 12.5% higher than that of the LSTM model. Moreover, population migration and internet search data can respectively improve the prediction performance of the model.

174504,Fuzzy Decision-Making Methods in Transport Engineering,2021,"We study the influence of spatial heterogeneity on the antiviral activity of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) infected with influenza A. MEF of type Ube1L−/− are composed of two distinct sub-populations, the strong type that sustains a strong viral infection and the weak type, sustaining a weak viral load. We present new data on the virus load infection of Ube1L−/−, which have been micro-printed in a checker board pattern of different sizes of the inner squares. Surprisingly, the total viral load at one day after inoculation significantly depends on the sizes of the inner squares. We explain this observation by using a reaction diffusion model and we show that mathematical homogenization can explain the observed inhomogeneities. If the individual patches are large, then the growth rate and the carrying capacity will be the arithmetic means of the patches. For finer and finer patches the average growth rate is still the arithmetic mean, however, the carrying capacity uses the harmonic mean. While fitting the PDE to the experimental data, we also predict that a discrepancy in virus load would be unobservable after only half a day. Furthermore, we predict the viral load in different inner squares that had not been measured in our experiment and the travelling distance the virions can reach after one day.","Baabdulla, Arwa Abdulla; Now, Hesung; Park, Ju An; Kim, Woo-Jong; Jung, Sungjune; Yoo, Joo-Yeon; Hillen, Thomas",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425332,562

Understanding the immune response and the molecular variability of Tp is needed for vaccine development. However, most clinical studies do not reach their target sample size. The aim of this study was to describe our experience recruiting early syphilis cases for translational studies in Cali, Colombia. Methods The monthly number of enrolled participants (MNEP) was obtained from medical records. Three distinct periods were identified. During period 1 (July-2003 to December-2018) the study personnel visited the staff of 87 health institutions and presented the eligibility criteria. During period 2 (May-2019 to March-2020), in addition to staff visits, the active surveillance (AS) of syphilis test results was conducted and an HIV outpatient clinic (HOC) was added to the network. During period 3 (March-2020 to January-2021) the COVID-19 pandemic reached Colombia. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the MNEP was calculated. The frequency and proportion of subjects from HIV and AS was calculated for periods 2 and 3. Finally, to assess the association between the proportion of months with 0, 1, 2, 3 or 6 participants and the period the Fisher's exact test was used. Results 159 months were included in the analysis. The median MNEP was 1 for the three periods, while the IQR was 0-1, 1-6 and 0-2 for periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

174629,Analysis of Epidemic Events Based on Event Evolutionary Graph,2022,"Background: Rheumatic patients' follow-up in terms of treatment adherence, disease control achieved with treat-to-target (T2T) and tight-control strategy have been deeply influenced by nationwide mitigation strategies such as quarantine, travel restrictions, and inadequate access to routine visits, laboratory and imaging investigations. These restrictions could be potentially detrimental for patients' care, but to what extent these measures affected the T2T and tight-control approach in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unknown. Objectives: This study investigated whether the adoption of telephone virtual care imposed by COVID-19 pandemic has been effective in maintaining remission in RA treated with targeted therapies and to identify factors associated with its maintenance. Methods: This observational retrospective real-life study was conducted from November 2019 through September 2020. Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of RA patients treated with targeted therapies was analysed retrospectively before, during and after the national lockdown (LD). During LD period, rheumatologists provided virtual care by telephone to assess the clinical status to guarantee the absence of current contraindications to therapy. Then, patients could choose whether to receive home drug delivery or to maintain their faceto-face consultations. Logistic mixed effects regression models were fitted, with CDAI remission as response variable. A multivariate analysis and a parsimonious model were finally obtained by stepwise selection procedure using AIC. Results: Data were extracted from a longitudinal observational registry, and at baseline, 502 RA patients were eligible for this study. 52 patients failed to complete their follow-up, 450 patients were included in the final analysis. During LD, 359 patients chose in-person visit, 91 patients home drug delivery and virtual visit. Our cohort did not show a statistically significant decrease in the number of patients fulfilling CDAI remission criteria all along the three periods. Among the 450 patients evaluated, the CDAI remission rate was 40.22% (N=181) and 43.78% (N=197) during pre-LD and post-LD, respectively. As for the 359 patients who choose in-person visits during LD, 43.18% (N=155) were in remission according to CDAI. The final model (step-wise selection) applied to the multivariate analysis of factors that potentially could interfere with disease control in patients with CDAI remission showed that the probability to maintain remission was associated with Caucasian ethnicity, male gender and absence of fibromyalgia (Table 1 below). Conclusion: Telephone-based tight control strategy ensured satisfactory management of RA treated with targeted therapies during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. All along the three periods, we observed that the probability to be in CDAI remission was significantly associated with Caucasian ethnicity, male gender, and absence of fibromyalgia. This temporary approach has been a feasible compensation for face-to-face visits, thus reassuring for future months before the end of pandemic.","Ingegnoli, F.; Cincinelli, G.; Luppino, A.

Non-human primates are a key pre-clinical animal model for human vaccine development, allowing both lymph node and circulating immune responses to be longitudinally sampled for correlates of vaccine efficacy. However, patterns of vaccine antigen drainage via the lymphatics after intramuscular immunisation can be stochastic, driving uneven deposition between lymphoid sites, and between individual lymph nodes within larger clusters. In order to improve the accurate isolation of antigen-exposed lymph nodes during biopsies and necropsies, we developed and validated a method for co-formulating candidate vaccines with tattoo ink, which allows for direct visual identification of vaccine-draining lymph nodes and evaluation of relevant antigen-specific B and T cell responses by flow cytometry. This approach improves the assessment of vaccine-induced immunity in highly relevant non-human primate models.","Barber-Axthelm, Isaac M; Kelly, Hannah G; Esterbauer, Robyn; Wragg, Kathleen; Gibbon, Anne; Lee, Wen Shi; Wheatley, Adam K; Kent, Stephen J; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.270975,562

Methods and Results: This is an observational study generated from the first 79 patients admitted to intensive care in Uppsala due to respiratory failure with SARS-CoV-2 infection, during the first wave in 2020, included in the PRONMED study. From this group 34 underwent echocardiographic examination of which 25 were included in the study, and compared to 44 non-echo patients. Demographic analysis compared standard parameters and previous morbidities between the echo and non-echo group. Standard echocardiographic parameters were analysed indicating a reduced left ventricular function as assessed by global longitudinal strain and very discrete increases in wall thickness in the group as a whole. A group comparison between the outcomes survival and death was carried out. Right sided dimensions and functional parameters did not indicate major strain. An increased maximum tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicating increased pulmonary arterial pressure was significantly associated with death, but failed to maintain significance when corrected for multiple comparison. Biochemical cardiac markers and D-dimer correlated to initiation of echocardiography and mortality. Tricuspid regurgitation maximum velocity was positively correlated with maximum troponin I. Conclusion: These results suggests that there is no clear negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are indications that pulmonary pressure elevation carries a negative predictive outcome suggesting pulmonary disease as the major driver of mortality. Cardiac biomarkers as well as D-dimer carry a predictive outcome value.","Isackson, H.; Larsson, A.; Lipcsey, M.; Frithiof, R.; Flachskampf, F.

Thus, the movement restrictions were put in place by most of the countries in the world including Asia and Australasia to manage the pandemic. This has disrupted the supply chains and mobility networks and the overall economic slowdown. Some of the impacts has seriously affected transport operator finances, including revenue and cash flow, moving many companies closer to bankruptcy. With road and transport sectors as the key driver of economic and social activities, the recovery from COVID-19 in countries all over the world is at risk. Thus, this paper presents the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on road and transport sectors in Asia and Australasia based on a quantitative method through an online questionnaire survey. One hundred and seventeen (117) participants from various countries and background have responded and gave their feedbacks on the impact factors. The findings shows that the top five (5) factors impacting the road and transport sectors are suspension of current activities and operations, followed by the reduction in company's revenue, profits, cashflow, turnover, interruption in construction planning and scheduling, transport disruptions to supply chains, mobility network and public transport usage and the transport travel pattern and ridership. This study is limited to number of survey samples as indicated in the paper. Only on the surface impact was measured in this study.

Given fast accumulation of sequenced viral genomes, a basic need in genome epidemiology is to identify which reference genomes are identical or closest to the ones in a sequenced sample. Then the associated metadata such as the geographical locations can be utilized to infer the transmission network. In this work, we deliver VirStrain, a fast and accurate tool for conducting strain-level analysis from short reads. By using a greedy covering algorithm, we are able to derive unique k-mer combinations for highly similar reference genomes. VirStrain is able to detect the most possible strain and also multiple strains that may simultaneously infect the same host. We tested VirStrain on three types of RNA viruses whose reference genomes have different similarity distri-butions. For each types of virus, we assessed VirStrain across multiple bench-mark datasets of different properties and complexity.

It sheds light on the “new normal” and its overarching implications for hotel operations from the user experience perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method strategy was adopted for data collection. Qualitative data was gathered from a video analysis of two webinars with high-profile panels of thought leaders about the challenges arising from the global health crisis and related post-pandemic recovery strategies. This data has been triangulated with desk research and data collected through an online survey which sought to map guest sentiments with respect to resuming the use of hospitality services and their attitude towards the proposed tech transformation initiatives in the Indian luxury hospitality industry. Findings: The research data indicates that despite their pandemic-related trepidations, people still have a strong urge to be social and to travel. Technology can play a pivotal role in creating safe spaces for social distancing, facilitating a contactless guest interface to alleviate guest concerns for safe hygiene and rebuilding customer confidence to address the trust deficit. Practical implications: Hospitality organisations must be discerning in the investments they make in new technology and contactless experiences because hasty investments in extensive automation may be perceived as gimmicky by guests. Intelligent and astute use of technology tools can minimise human error, optimise service efficiency and enhance guest experience through elevated levels of personalised hospitality in luxury hotels by judiciously marrying high touch with high tech. Originality/value: This study is the one of the first empirical explorations of the tech transformation strategies adopted by luxury hotels in the Indian context in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Utilizing the Chinese setting over the two-month period in 2020 from the beginning of the outbreak to the successful containment of the spread of virus, we show that while the pandemic has negatively impacted real estate firm returns, firms with broader geographic scope and more geographically diversified property allocations have managed to better endure the crisis. We further find that firms with higher leverage report lower returns during the pandemic irrespective of their geographic scope, but larger firms can lessen the adverse impact of the pandemic only if they have adopted a more diversified strategy. Overall, our study provides novel evidence on the benefit of diversification by demonstrating the importance of geographic scope and diversification at times of crises. Specifically, we show corporate diversification could be especially useful to mitigate the negative stock market reactions resulting from the pandemic. Moreover, diversification could even become essential for larger firms that are expected by the market to be more diversified.","Chu, Xiaoling Lu Chiuling Tsang Desmond",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14070309,562

VIP152 (formerly BAY 1251152), a potent and highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, has been evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced cancer. The maximum tolerated dose was 30 mg once weekly administered in consecutive 21-day cycles, based on neutropenia as the dose-limiting toxicity (JCO 2018;36:2507;NCT02635672). DHL is defined as dual rearrangement of the MYC gene and either the BCL2 or BCL6 genes;the resulting overexpression of MYC and BCL2/BCL6 make it particularly difficult to treat. Patients with DHL have a poor prognosis and no standard of care. Considering the impact of CDK9 inhibition on MYC, an exploratory cohort of patients with DHL was added to the study. Methods: Patients with refractory or relapsed DHL were eligible. VIP152 was administered once weekly as a 30-minute IV infusion on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 21-day cycle. Tumor response was assessed according to the revised Cheson criteria (2007). Results: To date a total of 7 patients have been enrolled and were evaluable at the time of data cutoff (24NOV2020). The patients were mostly men (6/7 pts, 86%) with a median (range) age of 70 (58-84) years. All patients received ≥2 prior therapies, including 2 patients with bone marrow transplant. Three of 7 patients (29%) had ≥3 prior therapies. The median time on treatment was 22 days (range 8-1361 days). The most common adverse events of any grade were: constipation, fatigue, nausea (each 3/7 pts, 43%) and abdominal pain, diarrhea, lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease, skin infection, tumor pain, and vomiting (each 2/7 pts, 29%). Most were Grade 1 and Grade 2. The Grade 3 adverse events were fatigue, lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count decrease (each 1/7 pts, 14%) and tumor pain (2/7 pts, 29%). One Grade 4 lymphocyte count decrease was reported. Two patients had a serious adverse event (Grade 3 syncope and Grade 3 tumor pain). Two patients had dosing held for an adverse event;however, no patient withdrew from treatment due to any adverse events. One death occurred due to disease progression. Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis showed significant reduction of MYC, PCNA, and MCL-1 mRNA in all patients across multiple timepoints. Antitumor activity consisted of 2 complete metabolic responses in 7 patients (29%) based on investigator-assessed FDG-PET scans. Due to the COVID pandemic, the patients withdrew consent after 3.7 and 2.3 years, respectively, of treatment. Both patients were in complete metabolic response. Conclusions: VIP152 had a manageable safety profile, on-target pharmacodynamic activity and signs of durable monotherapy antitumor activity in patients with DHL. These encouraging results warrant further evaluation of VIP152 in patients with MYCdriven lymphoma and solid tumors.","Moreno, V.; Cordoba, R.; Morillo, D.; Diamond, J. R.; Hamdy, A.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by reverse transcription - multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-mqPCR) after the precipitation of nucleic acids with PEG8000 and RNA isolation with TRIzol Reagent. The number of copies of the gene encoding SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N1) per liter of wastewater was compared with the number of officially registered COVID-19 cases in Prague. Although the data obtained by sampling wastewater from the major Prague sewers were more consistent than those obtained from the small sewers, the correlation between wastewater-based and clinical-testing data was also good for the residential areas with more than 1 000 registered inhabitants. It was shown that monitoring SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater sampled from small sewers could identify isolated occurrences of COVID-19-positive cases in local neighborhoods. This can be very valuable while tracking COVID-19 hotspots within large cities.","Zdenkova, K.; Bartackova, J.; Cermakova, E.; Demnerova, K.; Dostalkova, A.; Janda, V.; Novakova, Z.; Rumlova, M.; Rihova Ambrozova, J.; Skodakova, K.; Swierczkova, I.; Sykora, P.; Vejmelkova, D.; Wanner, J.; Bartacek, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.28.21261272v1?rss=1,562

Viruses are omnipresent predators for all organisms, but have no acknowledged active biocontrol. The viral biomass undoubtedly reintegrates the trophic cycles, however the mechanisms of this phase still remain unknown. Methods Here, we used stable isotope probing with 13C labelled T4 phages to monitor the increase of density of the bacterial DNA concomitant with the decrease of plaque forming units. We used 12C T4 phages as control. Results T4 phage disappearance in wastewater sludge was found to occur mainly through predation by Aeromonadacea. Phage consumption also favours significant in situ bacterial growth. Furthermore, an isolated strain of Aeromonas was observed to grow on T4 phages as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Conclusions bacterial species are capable of consuming bacteriophages in situ, which is likely a widespread and underestimated type of biocontrol.This assay is anticipated as a starting point for harnessing the bacterial potential in limiting the diffusion of harmful viruses within environments such as gut or water.","Godon, Jean-Jacques; Bize, Ariane; Ngo, Hoang; Cauquil, Laurent; Almeida, Mathieu; Petit, Marie Agnès; Zemb, Olivier",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.01.446436,562

Consequently, companies experience impact on their supply chains in terms of disruptions of material supply, deliveries, productivity and revenue. Thus, the importance of Supply Chain Visibility (SCV) in global and competitive markets with increasing sustainability demands has received widespread recognition. Yet, the literature provides limited understanding of requirements to consider when developing a SCV system. Addressing the gap, this study presents the findings from a case study during the first months of 2021 at a global manufacturing company developing a SCV system to improve their inbound flow. Using a system engineering perspective, this study presents requirements highlighted during early stage for a SCV system. The results indicate the importance of ensuring SCV system requirements to enable data collection, handling and usage for decision making leading to both supply chain sustainability and resilience.

It became urgent to respond to the pandemic, particularly in terms of teaching and learning. One of the first options taken by higher education institutions was to implement non-face-to-face teaching, also called remote emergency teaching. The objectives of this research are to identify students' perception of the frequency of use of digital tools and assess the level of satisfaction on the use of these tools. The study is essentially of quantitative nature. Data were collected through a questionnaire from a sample of 677 students from a Portuguese public higher education institution. From the results, it is highlighted that during the pandemic the use of the tools: Colibri/Zoom and Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) was very frequent. In a post-pandemic scenario, the tools that will have the most preference for use will be VLE and email. Regarding the satisfaction with the use of digital tools during the pandemic, the tools with the highest level of satisfaction by students were: VLE, Colibri/Zoom, email and Office 365. It was also found through the analysis of the correlation among the variable's frequency of use and satisfaction that the higher the frequency of use of digital tools is, the higher is the level of satisfaction. © 2021 AISTI.","Alves, P.; Morais, C.; Miranda, L.; Pereira, M.

We aimed to evaluate the performance of the Roche Elecsys™ chemiluminescent immunoassay (Rotkreuz, Switzerland), that detects antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen, at an academic laboratory in South Africa. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 312 donors with confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests, with approval from a large university’s human research ethics committee. Negative controls included samples stored prior to December 2019 and from patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR and were confirmed negative using multiple serology methods (n = 124). Samples were stored at –80 °C and analysed on a Roche cobas™ 602 autoanalyser. Results: Compared with RT-PCR, our evaluation revealed a specificity of 100% and overall sensitivity of 65.1%. The sensitivity in individuals > 14 days’ post-diagnosis was 72.6%, with the highest sensitivity 31–50 days’ post-diagnosis at 88.6%. Results were also compared with in-house serology tests that showed high agreement in majority of categories. Conclusions: The sensitivity at all-time points post-diagnosis was lower than reported in other studies, but sensitivity in appropriate cohorts approached 90% with a high specificity. The lower sensitivity at earlier time points or in individuals without symptomatology may indicate failure to produce antibodies, which was further supported by the comparison against in-house serology tests.","Grove, J.

176342,Experiments of Federated Learning for COVID-19 Chest X-ray Images,2021,"Background: Since the beginning of the pandemic, clinicians and researchers have been searching for alternative tests to improve screening and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, the gold standard for virus identification is the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Saliva samples, however, offer clear practical and logistical advantages but due to lack of collection, transport, and storage solutions, high-throughput saliva-based laboratory tests are difficult to scale up as a screening or diagnostic tool. With this study, we aimed to validate an intra-laboratory molecular detection method for SARS-CoV-2 on saliva samples collected in a new storage and inactivating solution, comparing the results to NP swabs to determine the difference in sensitivity between the two tests. Methods: In this study, 156 patients (cases) and 1005 asymptomatic subjects (controls) were enrolled and tested simultaneously for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome by RT-PCR on both NP swab and saliva samples. Saliva samples were collected in a preservative and inhibiting saline solution (Biofarma Srl). Internal method validation was performed to standardize the entire workflow for saliva samples. Results: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 conducted on saliva samples showed a clinical sensitivity of 95.1% and specificity of 97.8% compared to NP swabs. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 81% while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.5%. Test concordance was 97.6% (Cohen's Kappa=0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91). The LoD of the test was 5 viral copies for both samples. Conclusions: RT-PCR assays conducted on a stored saliva sample achieved similar performance to those on NP swabs and this may provide a very effective tool for population screening and diagnosis. Collection of saliva in a stabilizing solution makes the test more convenient and widely available; furthermore, the denaturation properties of the solution reduces the infective risks belonging to sample manipulation.","Bulfoni, M.; Sozio, E.; Marcon, B.; De Martino, M.; Cesselli, D.; De Carlo, C.; Martinella, R.; Migotti, A.; Vania, E.; Zanus-Fortes, A.; De Piero, J.; Nencioni, E.; Tascini, C.; Isola, M.; Curcio, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.10.21263072v1?rss=1,562
176360,COVID-19 Diagnosis from Chest X-ray Images Using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and InceptionV3,2021,"Refractory neonatal seizures do not respond to first-line anti-seizure medications (ASMs) like phenobarbital (PB), a positive allosteric modulator for GABAA receptors, the most widely used ASM to treat neonatal seizures. GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition is dependent upon neuronal chloride regulation. The electroneutral cation-chloride transporter KCC2 mediates neuronal chloride extrusion; an age-dependent increase of KCC2 expression enables the shift of GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. BDNF-TrkB activation following excitotoxic injury recruits downstream targets like PLCγ1, leading to KCC2 hypofunction. This study investigated the efficacy of partial and full TrkB agonists; LM22A-4 (LM), HIOC and Deoxygedunin (DG) respectively, on PB-refractory seizures, post-ischemic TrkB-pathway activation, and KCC2 membrane stability in a P7 CD-1 mouse model of refractory neonatal seizures. Anti-seizure efficacy was determined by quantifying seizure burdens with continuous video-EEG. LM rescued PB-refractory seizures in a sexually dimorphic manner. LM anti-seizure efficacy was associated with a significant reduction in the post-ischemic phosphorylation of TrkB at Y816, a site known to mediate post-ischemic KCC2 hypofunction via PLCγ1 activation. LM additionally rescued ischemia-induced pKCC2-S940 dephosphorylation preserving its membrane stability. HIOC and DG, two novel full TrkB agonists, also rescued PB-refractoriness and post-ischemic TrkB-PLCγ1 pathway activation. Additionally, chemogenetic inactivation of TrkB significantly reduced post-ischemic neonatal seizure burdens at P7. Developmental expression profiles of TrkB and KCC2 in naïve pups identified developmental differences that may underlie the sex-dependent variance in anti-seizure efficacy. These results support a novel role for the TrkB receptor in the emergence of age-dependent refractory neonatal seizures.","Kipnis, P.A.; Sullivan, B.J.; Carter, B.M.; Kadam, S.D.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.23.887190,562

This collaboration has focused on the New Uffizi Project and sought to evaluate the energy consumption of the HVAC systems of the Vasari Corridor by applying the typical tools and methods for the Building Energy Model (BEM) of existing buildings. In order to perform a dynamic simulation of the energy behavior and thermal comfort of the Corridor, the Building Energy Model was validated by comparing the hourly measured and simulated indoor temperature values and through the varying of natural ventilation and solar shading. Due to its building characteristics the control of the indoor thermo-hygrometric parameters is a critical issue. These aspects expose the Corridor to climatic variations which necessitate major energy consumption. In estimating energy consumption, three different scenarios of the use of the Corridor itself were referenced: one of which was its return to the original Medici use as a connection between Palazzo Pitti and Palazzo Vecchio through the Uffizi Galleries;the other two were the possible uses for temporary exhibitions of artwork which met the acceptable parameters of indoor air quality (thermal comfort and control of risk of SARS-CoV 2).","Schmidt, E.

The events of the past year, especially those related to the pandemic and the fallout of the presidential election, led to a resurgence of public interest in federalism and a focus on the importance of government decision-making of state and local governments. Events during the last year have not only reinforced partisan polarization but have also deepened the existing divide of Americans along partisan lines and perhaps in new ways.

Methods: Population-based cohort study using healthcare claims data from 23 million beneficiaries of a German health insurance provider. We included adult patients with incident hospital-treated sepsis identified by ICD-10 codes in 2013-2014. New medical, psychological and cognitive diagnoses associated with post-sepsis morbidity; mortality; dependency on nursing care; and total health care costs in survivors were assessed to 3 years after hospital discharge. Results: Among 116,507 sepsis patients who survived hospitalization for sepsis, 74.3% had a new medical, psychological or cognitive diagnosis in the first year after discharge. 20.6% and 3.8% had new diagnoses in two and three domains, respectively. 31.5% were newly dependent on nursing care, and 30.7% died within the first year. In the second and third year, 65.8% and 59.4% of survivors had new diagnoses, respectively. Healthcare costs totaled an average 36,585 Euro/patient in three years, including index hospitalization costs. Occurrence of new diagnoses in predefined subgroups was: 73.7% (survivors of non-severe sepsis), 75.6% (severe sepsis), 78.3% (ICU-treated sepsis), 72.8% (non-ICU treated sepsis) and 68.5% (survivors without prior diagnoses). Conclusions: New medical, psychological and cognitive diagnoses consistent with post-sepsis morbidity are common after sepsis, including among patients with less severe sepsis, no prior diagnoses, and younger age. This calls for more efforts to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, define optimal screening for common new diagnoses, and test interventions to prevent and treat post-sepsis morbidity.

Based on research regarding the role of peers, learning in groups, school belonging, and educational equity, we explored students' emotional and motivational processes in relation to different aspects of social support and the school environment. In the present study, 279 students from 20 classes of two secondary schools completed a questionnaire on their contextual situations in distance learning, the organization and amount of their learning, and the resulting emotions and motivations. Results show that students' perceived joy during the crisis was relatively low, while perceived anxiety was relatively high. Regression analyses showed relations of general enjoyment and joy of learning in the crisis to self-efficacy belief, which was in turn influenced by environmental predictors such as support from family and school as well as the student-teacher relationship. Thus, school authorities and teachers can effectively contribute to students' mastering of the crisis by establishing a transparent information policy, well-structured learning routines, and virtual lessons.","Tannert, S.; Groschner, A.",European Educational Research Journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/14749041211024784,562

Methods: The cumulative distribution function of the time for the total number of COVID-19 cases was used to construct a quantile function for classifying COVID-19 alert levels. The EWMA control chart control limits for monitoring a COVID-19 outbreak were formulated by applying the delta method and the sample mean and variance method. Samples were selected from countries and region including Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and Hong Kong to generate the total number of COVID-19 cases from February 15, 2020 to December 16, 2020, all of which followed symmetric patterns. A comparison of the two methods was made by applying them to a EWMA control chart based on the first hitting time for monitoring the COVID-19 outbreak in the sampled countries and region. Results: The optimal first hitting times for the EWMA control chart for monitoring COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and Hong Kong were approximately 280, 208, 286, and 298 days, respectively.

Many people experience anxiety due to lockdown, social isolation, unemployment, and a high probability of illness and death. Uncertainty in the future, anxiety during the period of uncertainty caused by the spread of the “new coronavirus”, are a trigger for emotional exhaustion, suppress the immune system, which negatively affects the human nervous system and provokes an exacerbation of chronic ailments. The psychological conse-quences of a person’s stay in quarantine are considered. In the structure of mental health disorders associated with the COVID-19 epidemic, there is a large range of adaptation disorders: fear, frustration, a sense of hopelessness, expectation of threat, loneliness, social isolation and alienation. In the situation of COVID-19, there is often a depletion of mental resources and maladaptation, a disorder of adaptive reactions. Anxiety disorders occur in the form of adaptation disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, somato-form disorders, including panic attacks. Timely diagnosis of these disorders is possible not only by the psychiatric service, but also with the involvement of internists who possess screening diagnostic tools with automated conclusions (scales, mobile applications to smartphones, etc.). A brief review of domestic and foreign studies on the assessment of methods for the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders is presented. Diagnostic methods and therapeutic tactics, the use of various traditional drugs in psychosomatic pathology are discussed.

The economic impacts were mostly negative but differentiated across economic sectors and livelihood strategies;some gained from the business opportunities arising from the pandemic. Wage loss for migrant workers was the most common negative impact but lasted less than 2 months. Overall, rural China has escaped the worst impacts of the pandemic found in other developing countries. We argue that the structure of inequalities in today's China, now primarily based on market differentiations, has become far more complex than the simplistic rural-urban dichotomy based on the household registration (hukou) status can possibly explain. Rather than exacerbating the hukou-based rural-urban inequality, the true impacts of the pandemic on rural China are more likely to result from the reforms of the agri-food system. The suspected link between the new pathogen and the food system has created a misinformed urgency for the government to accelerate the industrialization of the food system, which we think can backfire and increase the likelihood of the next outbreak.","Zhang, Q.

176860,US Pandemic Prediction Using Regression and Neural Network Models,2020,"Hybridization is an important evolutionary mechanism that can enable organisms to adapt to environmental challenges. It has previously been shown that the fungal allodiploid species Verticillium longisporum, causal agent of Verticillium stem striping in rape seed, has originated from at least three independent hybridization events between two haploid Verticillium species. To reveal the impact of genome duplication as a consequence of the hybridization, we studied the genome and transcriptome dynamics upon two independent V. longisporum hybridization events, represented by the hybrid lineages ""A1/D1"" and ""A1/D3"". We show that the V. longisporum genomes are characterized by extensive chromosomal rearrangements, including between parental chromosomal sets. V. longisporum hybrids display signs of evolutionary dynamics that are typically associated with the aftermath of allodiploidization, such as haploidization and a more relaxed gene evolution. Expression patterns of the two sub-genomes within the two hybrid lineages are more similar than those of the shared A1 parent between the two lineages, showing that expression patterns of the parental genomes homogenized within a lineage. However, as genes that display differential parental expression in planta do not typically display the same pattern in vitro, we conclude that sub-genome-specific responses occur in both lineages. Overall, our study uncovers the genomic and transcriptomic plasticity during evolution of the filamentous fungal hybrid V. longisporum and illustrate its adaptive potential. ImportanceVerticillium is a genus of plant-associated fungi that include a handful of plant pathogens that collectively affect a wide range of hosts. On several occasions, haploid Verticillium species hybridized into the stable allodiploid species Verticillium longisporum, which is, in contrast to haploid Verticillium species, a Brassicaceae specialist. Here, we studied the evolutionary genome and transcriptome dynamics of V. longisporum and the impact of the hybridization. V. longisporum genomes display a mosaic structure due do genomic rearrangements between the parental chromosome sets. Similar to other allopolyploid hybrids, V. longisporum displays an ongoing loss of heterozygosity and a more relaxed gene evolution. Also, differential parental gene expression is observed, with an enrichment for genes that encode secreted proteins. Intriguingly, the majority of these genes displays sub-genome-specific responses under differential growth conditions. In conclusion, hybridization has incited the genomic and transcriptomic plasticity that enables adaptation to environmental changes in a parental allele-specific fashion.","Rujas, Edurne; Kucharska, Iga; Tan, Yong Zi; Benlekbir, Samir; Cui, Hong; Zhao, Tiantian; Wasney, Gregory A; Budylowski, Patrick; Guvenc, Furkan; Newton, Jocelyn C; Sicard, Taylor; Semesi, Anthony; Muthuraman, Krithika; Nouanesengsy, Amy; Prieto, Katherine; Bueler, Stephanie A; Youssef, Sawsan; Liao-Chan, Sindy; Glanville, Jacob; Christie-Holmes, Natasha; Mubareka, Samira; Gray-Owen, Scott D; Rubinstein, John L; Treanor, Bebhinn; Julien, Jean-Philippe",,https://doi.org/10.1101/341636,562

It soon became clear that without proper planning, cancer outcomes would worsen. Cancer patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, morbidity, and mortality. Health sectors internationally reduced or paused non-urgent cancer care to protect cancer patients from COVID-19. However, disproportionate delays in screening, diagnosis, and treatment can unduly impact cancer outcomes, and backlogs can further burden a strained health system. Tailored approaches to cancer management are required which balance health resource availability along with the risks of exposure and benefits of treatment. Australia's relatively low COVID-19 case numbers afforded Cancer Australia an opportunity to proactively plan for optimal cancer management during this, and future, pandemics. Methods: Cancer Australia's Cancer care in the time of COVID-19: A conceptual framework for the management of cancer during a pandemic (the framework) maps evidence-based cancer care considerations in relation to a health system's capacity across acute and recovery pandemic phases, in relation to steps of the cancer care pathway. The framework promotes infection control and resource prioritisation in the context of innovative care models, triaging approaches and individualised treatment plans, underpinned by effective communication and shared decision-making. Results: The framework supports health system planning and risk-stratified approaches to guide decision-making and improve cancer outcomes. Many aspects of cancer care are recommended to continue (to varying degrees) in most pandemic phases, with modifications or pauses in some aspects of care as the pandemic curve approaches or exceeds health system capacity. Principles of the framework were employed during the second wave of COVID-19 in the Australian state of Victoria, with continuation of cancer screening programs, diagnostic investigations, and treatments wherever it was safe to do so. This resulted in reductions in cancer services and treatment being relatively smaller than in the first wave. Conclusions: Cancer management in a pandemic is not a one-size-fits-all. Countries and jurisdictions need to tailor cancer care according to the risk of the health system becoming overwhelmed. The framework guides optimal cancer care to improve outcomes for people with cancer, while minimising COVID-19 infection. As further evidence becomes available from this pandemic or in future pandemics, this framework can be refined to inform ongoing and future pandemic health system planning.","Milch, V.; Anderiesz, C.; Hector, D.; Turnbull, S.; Austen, M.; Wang, R.; Der Vartanian, C.; Keefe, D.

177150,COVID-19 Prediction using X-Ray Images,2021,"Recently, all public facilities in Jakarta have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic;offices and retailers are closing their stores since the beginning of the outbreak, but the other facilities such as airports, train stations, and hospitals are still open while following the new normal protocols. Additionally, to help flatten the curve of Covid-19, buildings are taking transmission caution towards their facilities and interior spaces during the pandemic. This study’s main objective is to provide a review of the concepts of adaption within a building to the occurring issue of Covid-19. An entrance is the first gate or door to welcome customers, but unfortunately, buildings’ entrance areas are undergoing several adjustments of space and functions. In this research, the design thinking method is combined with qualitative analysis using tools such as benefits maps to help build competitive advantage and communication strategy, what kind of activities that give height, low benefit and how easy or difficult it might be to implement the strategy. This study concludes objectives in delivering new normal protocols within the building facility with a recommendation for entrance areas to provide several tools. Fulfilling the customer’s expectation is one way to increase the trust and a feeling of safety in customers’ perceptions. Entrance space adaption will also give customers a positive perception of the buildings when they enter the facility. Additionally, it will also give a long-term solution for the new normal protocols taking place. Finally, the eight concept activities could be utilized as a guideline and strategy for facility and building maintenance proposals to add value to facilities’ long-term solution.","Ruki, U.

However, with the emerging unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have already changed the way we live, work, and travel, encouraging a change in commuter behavior has become even more important. This has necessitated that existing strategies be reconsidered in favor of adapting to a highly uncertain ?COVID-19 world.? Historically, there has been a dearth of literature relating to airport employees? ground access even though as a group employees represent an important segment of airport users with complex access requirements. This paper therefore focuses on airport employee related airport ground access strategies considering an emerging understanding of the future impacts of COVID-19 on global air travel. Pre-COVID strategies are investigated by conducting a documentary analysis of the most recent ground access strategies of 27 UK airports. The findings reveal that airport ground access strategies were mainly focused on setting targets and producing policy measures in favor of reducing car use and increasing the use of more sustainable transport modes including public transport, car sharing, and active travel (walking, cycling). However, measures encouraging public transport and car sharing will be more difficult to implement because of social distancing and fear of proximity to others. Instead, initiatives encouraging remote working, active travel, and improved staff awareness will be at the forefront of the future ground access strategy development.","Yilmaz, Oguzhan Frost Matthew Timmis Andrew Ison Stephen",Transportation Research Record,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981211033280,562
177216,Design of Web table system,2020,"Background: Population-based genomic screening has the predicted ability to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with medically actionable conditions. However, much research is needed to develop standards for genomic screening, and to understand the perspectives of people offered this new testing modality. This is particularly true for non-European ancestry populations who are vastly underrepresented in genomic medicine research. Therefore, we implemented a pilot genomic screening program in the BioMe Biobank in New York City, where the majority of participants are of non-European ancestry. Methods: We initiated genomic screening for well-established genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC), Lynch syndrome (LS), and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). We evaluated and included an additional gene (TTR) associated with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (hATTR), which has a common founder variant in African ancestry populations. We evaluated the characteristics of 74 participants who received results associated with these conditions. We also assessed the preferences of 7,461 newly enrolled BioMe participants to receive genomic results. Results: In the pilot genomic screening program, 74 consented participants received results related to HBOC (N=26), LS (N=6), FH (N=8), and hATTR (N=34). Thirty-three of 34 (97.1%) participants who received a result related to hATTR were self-reported African/African American (AA) or Hispanic/Latinx (HL), compared to 14 of 40 (35.0%) participants who received a result related to HBOC, LS, or FH. Among 7,461 participants enrolled after the BioMe protocol modification to allow the return of genomic results, 93.4% indicated that they would want to receive results. Younger participants, women, and HL participants were more likely to opt to receive results. Conclusions: The addition of TTR to a pilot genomic screening program meant that we returned results to a higher proportion of AA and HL participants, in comparison with genes traditionally included in genomic screening programs in the U.S. We found that the majority of participants in a multi-ethnic biobank are interested in receiving genomic results for medically actionable conditions. These findings increase knowledge about the perspectives of diverse research participants on receiving genomic results, and inform the broader implementation of genomic medicine in underrepresented patient populations.","Abul-Husn, N.

In answering this question, we utilize a framework for examining sustainability along the fashion-supply chain, highlighting the opportunities and challenges for a sustainable transition with respect to design, production, retail, consumption, and endof- life. At each step, we also consider socioeconomic dimensions with regard to social impacts, employment, and gender. In doing so, we argue that any meaningful shift toward sustainability and a just transition must recognize social and environmental challenges as interconnected, addressing structural inequalities.","Brydges, T.; Retamal, M.; Hanlon, M.","Sustainability: Science, Practice &amp; Policy",https://doi.org/10.1080/15487733.2020.1829848,562

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and occurrence of COVID-19 reinfection through a narrative review study. Methods: We searched the Medline (PubMed). Embase. Scopus. Web of Science. Cochrane library. Ovid, and CIXHAL databases. Inclusion criteria included all studies whose main purpose was to provide information about the occurrence or presence of reinfection in patients with COVID-19. An independent samples t test was used to compare the continuous outcomes between the 2 groups. Results: The mean duration of the first episode in the group with mild or moderate COVID-19 was 24.42±1.67 days, and it was 21.80±3.79 days in the group with severe COVID-19. The mean duration of the second episode (reinfection) in patients with mild or moderate form was 15.38 ± 5.57 days, and it was 19.20=2.98 days in patients with severe form. In both episodes, the duration of the disease did not significantly differ between the 2 groups (p=0.4S4 in the first episode;p=0.675 in the second episode), but the interval to the occurrence of reinfection in patients with the mild or moderate form was significantly longer than those with the severe form (p<0.001). In this instance, the time interval in patients with the mild or moderate form was 36.63±5.71 days while in those with the severe form of the disease it was 29.70=5.65 days. Besides, the genomes of the viruses isolated from the first and second episode were different. Conclusion: According to the results, all patients should be very careful about the severity of the second episode because of the more need for medical interventions for saving the patients. The interval between the first end and the second episode as well as the duration of each episode is highly important for better management of the disease. © Iran University of Medical Sciences","Eshrati, B.; Baradaran, H.

Online shopping presents a different environment, atmosphere, and experience. The possibility of ethical violations is higher during online than face-toface transactions. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the influence of perceived health risk and customer perception of online retail ethics on consumer online shopping behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving seven variables, namely perceived health risk, security, privacy, non-deception, reliability fulfillment, service recovery, and online shopping behavior. The data were collected through an online survey by employing the purposive sampling technique to a consumer who has shopped online during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. 315 valid responses were obtained and analyzed through quantitative method using SEM-Amos. The results showed that perceived health risk and four variables of online retail ethics including security, privacy, reliability fulfillment, and service recovery affected online shopping behavior. Meanwhile, non-deception was found to have an insignificant effect. The coefficient value proved perceived health risk to be more dominant in influencing online shopping behavior than the variables of online retail ethics. Thus, consumers pay more concern for their health during online shopping. However, positive consumer perceptions of the behavior of online retail websites in providing services also can encourage consumers to shop online during this pandemic. © Yuniarti Fihartini, Arief Helmi, Meydia Hassan, Yevis Marty Oesman, 2021.","Fihartini, Y.; Helmi, A.; Hassan, M.; Oesman, Y.

177396,Methods of identifying touched areas have been wiped properly,2021,"There has been a spate of interest in association networks in biological and medical research, for example, genetic interaction networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method, the extended joint hub graphical lasso (EDOHA), to estimate multiple related interaction networks for high dimensional omics data across multiple distinct classes. To be specific, we construct a convex penalized log likelihood optimization problem and solve it with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The proposed method can also be adapted to estimate interaction networks for high dimensional compositional data such as microbial interaction networks. The performance of the proposed method in the simulated studies shows that EDOHA has remarkable advantages in recognizing class-specific hubs than the existing comparable methods. We also present three applications of real datasets. Biological interpretations of our results confirm those of previous studies and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanism in disease. Author summary Reconstruction of multiple association networks from high dimensional omics data is an important topic, especially in biology. Previous studies focused on estimating different networks and detecting common hubs among all classes. Integration of information over different classes of data while allowing difference in the hub nodes is also biologically plausible. Therefore, we propose a method, EDOHA, to jointly construct multiple interaction networks with capacity in finding different hub networks for each class of data. Simulation studies show the better performance over conventional methods. The method has been demonstrated in three real world data.","Xu, Yang; Jiang, Hongmei; Jiang, Wenxin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.431400,562

177478,Video-Based Facial Recognition Develop for Accurately Identify People Wearing Surgical Masks,2021,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns have impacted MSM’s sexual activity and access to HIV/STI-related services. This study among MSM in the Netherlands assesses COVID-19-induced changes in numbers of sex partners, condomless anal intercourse (CAI), PrEP use, and HIV/STI testing.MethodsFrom July 20th to September 11th 2020, MSM were recruited via social media to complete an online survey. 2182 respondents (Mage=40 years) provided data on their sexual activity in 3 bimesters before the first lockdown (T1 Jan.–Feb.), during the lockdown (T2 mid-March-mid-May) and after the lockdown (T3 June–July). PrEP use and HIV/STI testing were reported per semester.ResultsThe mean number of sex partners decreased by 39% between T1 and T2 and remained 12% lower at T3 than at T1. The number of CAI partners decreased by 36% between T1 and T2, and at T3 was similar to T1. A majority (62%) of PrEP users stopped using PrEP at some point because of COVID-19, of which 73% subsequently resumed PrEP. A fifth (20%) of respondents postponed/missed appointments for STI testing and 16% postponed/missed appointments for HIV testing. Only 39% of these respondents caught up on missed testing. Self-sampling/testing accounted for 1% of HIV testing and 1.2% of STI testing in the last semester before COVID-19 (past 7–12 months), and 5.5% and 2.7% respectively in the first semester with COVID-19 (past 0–6 months).ConclusionSexual behaviours that put MSM at risk of STI or HIV acquisition were significantly reduced during the first lockdown. However, reengagement in sexual activity and CAI was rapid in the two months after the lockdown. Resumption of PrEP use after an interruption was more frequent than catching up on HIV/STI testing. Further promoting self-sampling/testing may contribute to mitigating the adverse impact of a succession of lockdowns and periods of easing of restrictions.","Adam, P.; Coul, E.

However, the effect of BCG vaccination on the conventional innate and adaptive immune cells subsets is not well characterized. Methods: We investigated the impact of BCG vaccination on the frequencies of T cell, B cell, monocyte and dendritic cell subsets as well as total antibody levels in a group of healthy elderly individuals (age 60-80 years) at one month post vaccination as part of our clinical study to examine the effect of BCG on COVID-19. Results: Our results demonstrate that BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central and effector memory CD4+ T cells and diminished frequencies of naive, transitional memory, stem cell memory CD4+ T cells and regulatory T cells. In addition, BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central, effector and terminal effector memory CD8+ T cells and diminished frequencies of naive, transitional memory and stem cell memory CD8+T cells. BCG vaccination also induced enhanced frequencies of immature, classical and activated memory B cells and plasma cells and diminished frequencies of naive and atypical memory B cells. While BCG vaccination did not induce significant alterations in monocytes subsets, it induced increased frequencies of myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs. Finally, BCG vaccination resulted in elevated levels of all antibody isotypes. Conclusions: BCG vaccination was associated with enhanced innate and adaptive memory cell subsets, as well as total antibody levels in elderly individuals, suggesting its potential utility in SARS-Cov2 infection by enhancing heterologous immunity.","Pavan Kumar, N.; Padmapriyadarsini, C.; Rajamanickam, A.; Bhavani, P.

177643,A Decentralised Authentication and Access Control Mechanism for Medical Wearable Sensors Data,2021,"Background: Non-invasive oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurement is a central vital sign that supports the management of COVID-19 patients. However, reports on SpO2 characteristics (patterns and dynamics) are scarce and none, to our knowledge, has analysed high resolution continuous SpO2 in COVID-19. Methods: SpO2 signal sampled at 1Hz and clinical data were collected from COVID-19 departments at the Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel) between May 1st, 2020 and February 1st, 2021. Data from a total of 367 COVID-19 patients, totalling 27K hours of continuous SpO2 recording, could be retrieved, including 205 non-critical and 162 critical cases. Desaturations based on different SpO2 threshold definitions and oximetry derived digital biomarkers (OBMs) were extracted and compared across severity and support levels. Findings: An absolute SpO2 threshold at 93% was the most efficient in discriminating between critical and non-critical patients without support or under oxygen support. Under no support, the non-critical group depicted a fold change (FC) of 1,8 times more frequent desaturations compared to the critical group. However, the hypoxic burden was 1,6 times more important in critical versus non-critical patients. Other OBMs depicted significant differences, notably the percentage of time below 93% SpO2 (CT93) was the most discriminating OBM. Mechanical ventilation depicted a strong effect on SpO2 by significantly reducing the frequency (1,85 FC) and depth (1,21 FC) of desaturations. OBMs related to periodicity and hypoxic burden were markedly affected up to several hours before the initiation of the mechanical ventilation. Interpretation: This is the first report investigating continuous SpO2 measurements in hospitalized patients affected with COVID-19. SpO2 characteristics differ between critical and non-critical patients and are impacted by the level of support. OBMs from high resolution SpO2 signal may enable to anticipate clinically relevant events, monitoring of treatment response and may be indicative of future deterioration.","Sobel, J.

177666,A Plug&Play flexible skin sensor for the wireless monitoring of pandemics,2021,"Background: Since the beginning of 2020, the medical staff caring for patients with rheumatic disorders has been exposed to considerable emotional and physical stress due to the COVID19 pandemic outbreak. Newly-designed circuits were imposed to better manage chronic patient admissions. Objectives: To assess the level of motivation in healthcare personnel caring for patients with rheumatic disorders and identify determinants that lead to dissatisfaction during the COVID19 spread. Methods: A 15-item questionnaire was distributed among medical and paramedical staff looking after chronic rheumatic patients. Motivation factors were included in questions having five preset answers, ranging from not al all, to a small extent, moderately, to a large extent and to a very large extent. The final item was an open-type question, favoring personal suggestions and potential changes in local management. Results: Out of a total of a 124 responders, 82 were doctors with various degrees in training (fellow trainees, specialists in Rheumatology, Head of Department), 37 medical assistants, 3 nurses, a physical therapist, one clinical psychologist. Mean age in the group was 38.3 years old with a strikingly female dominance (87.6%). Within the responders, the financial factor represented by monthly salary or bonuses had no or little impact on work motivation during the pandemic since more than 70% answered with not al all / to a small extent / moderately. Regarding motivation through working hours, 26.7% responded either not at all or to a small extent, 32.4% were moderately motivated while only 12.4% were more enthusiastic. More than half (53.4%) of the staff stated that motivation was not entirely affected by working conditions in the hospital. Answers were relatively equally divided referring to motivation by safety at their workplace (almost 20% for each statement), and 40.9% suffered some extent of demotivation due to risk of contamination while caring for COVID19 positive patients. 42% of the staff was only moderately motivated by hospital's measure to limit the spread of COVID throughout the personnel. Almost 75% of the healthcare workers were not motivated by news media. Around 54% said that personal motivation was not influenced by a larger work volume and 43% were very much motivated by work relationships with colleagues. 41% of the staff is only moderately satisfied with their work during the COVID outbreak while 18% are not at all satisfied. Finally, the last open-question confirmed that for some the pandemic period was a time to bring healthcare professionals together to a stronger bond. Other responders felt that chronic rheumatic patients were left aside, while caring mostly for COVID19 patients and only limited admissions for life-threatening conditions. Moreover, medical staff suggested that the lack of a more frequent testing throughout the personnel to avoid contamination was demotivating, while still living with families or relatives. Conclusion: Motivation of the personnel is a process with great economic and social impact. This study challenged the level of healthcare staff in difficult times caused by medical crisis. Results of the enquiry showed that financial benefits had no impact on motivation. Harsher working conditions or larger volume did not negatively impact motivation of staff, but the fear of contamination was considerable. Apparently the media influence was not a motivator for medical staff during the outbreak. Medical teams should find their stamina until the end of pandemia.","Cobilinschi, C.; Constantinescu, A.; Draniceanu, I.; Balanescu, A.; Bojinca, V.; Constantinescu, C.

Our identification scheme treats the enactment of China's Property Law in 2007 as a quasi-natural experiment and then conducts a difference-in-differences estimation. The results show that firms with less net fixed assets hire more workers, particularly for firms with tighter financial constraints, higher labor intensity and those located in cities with stricter law enforcement, greater fiscal pressure and lower bank density. Further analysis shows that liquid assets help firms obtain more debt, save less cash, decrease the cash flow sensitivity of cash and investment and invest more in fixed assets, consistent with the collateral channel. In addition, a significant convergence of labor productivity across firms illustrates that the Property Law also has a labor reallocation effect. Our findings shed light on the importance of expanding collateral menus in maintaining employment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Guanchun Liu Yuanyuan Ye Yongwei Zhang Chengsi",Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2021.07.003,562

The 2019 Coronavirus disease and FSBs apply as working examples elaborating the proposed Four-F action plan with several managerial implications for the internal and external stakeholders of FSBs. Design/methodology/approach: The method involves reviewing and coding 108 articles using the PRISMA approach, then applying findings to develop the Four-F action plan integrating multiple theoretical concepts (such as stakeholder, crisis management and dynamic capabilities). Findings: There are two key findings. First, though all four crisis phases should be considered by decision-makers as part of their contingency planning process, the pre and post-crisis stages need higher attention. Second, the Four-F action plan provides specific recommendations to FSBs stakeholders (consumers, suppliers and government) for each crisis phase (pre-crisis, crisis emergence, crisis occurrence and post-crisis).

Their activity quantified against model phospholipid membranes is fundamental to a detailed understanding of their structure-activity relationships. However, existing characterization assays lack the resolution necessary to achieve this insight. Leveraging a highly parallelized microfluidic platform for trapping and studying thousands of giant unilamellar vesicles, we conducted quantitative long-term microscopy studies to monitor the membrane-disruptive activity of archetypal antimicrobial peptides with a high spatiotemporal resolution. We described the modes of action of these peptides via measurements of the disruption of the vesicle population under the conditions of continuous peptide dosing using a range of concentrations, and related the observed modes with the molecular activity mechanisms of these peptides. The study offers an effective approach for characterizing membrane-targeting antimicrobial agents in a standardized manner, and for assigning specific modes of action to the corresponding antimicrobial mechanisms.","Nahas, Kareem Al; Fletcher, Marcus; Hammond, Katharine; Nehls, Christian; Cama, Jehangir; Ryadnov, Maxim G; Keyser, Ulrich F",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.455434,562

178175,S. Knobler A. Mahmoud,2005-03-31,"Infectious diseases (ID) represent a significant proportion of morbidity and mortality across the world. Host genetic variation is likely to contribute to ID risk and downstream clinical outcomes, but there is a need for a genetics-anchored framework to decipher molecular mechanisms of disease risk, infer causal effect on potential complications, and identify instruments for drug target discovery. Here we perform transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of 35 clinical ID traits in a cohort of 23,294 individuals, identifying 70 gene-level associations with 26 ID traits. Replication in two large-scale biobanks provides additional support for the identified associations. A phenome-scale scan of the 70 gene-level associations across hematologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurologic traits proposes a molecular basis for known complications of the ID traits. Using Mendelian Randomization, we then provide causal support for the effect of the ID traits on adverse outcomes. The rich resource of genetic information linked to serologic tests and pathogen cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, sinus/nasopharyngeal, tracheal, and blood samples (up to 7,699 positive pathogen cultures across 92 unique genera) that we leverage provides a platform to interrogate the genetic basis of compartment-specific infection and colonization. To accelerate insights into cellular mechanisms, we develop a TWAS repository of gene-level associations in a broad collection of human tissues with 79 pathogen-exposure induced cellular phenotypes as a discovery and replication platform. Cellular phenotypes of infection by 8 pathogens included pathogen invasion, intercellular spread, cytokine production, and pyroptosis. These rich datasets will facilitate mechanistic insights into the role of host genetic variation on ID risk and pathophysiology, with important implications for our molecular understanding of potentially severe phenotypic outcomes.","Hale, A.

Much of the direct or indirect impact is potentially in reductions in healthcare encounters for services such as preventive care. Here, we quantified changes in cancer screening rates to better understand the impact of the evolving COVID-19 implications and shifts in health-seeking behaviors. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of cancer screening rates during March-June 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and March-June 2020 (post-COVID-19 restrictions), using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database which includes Medicare and commercially insured members. Members meeting age and/or sex criteria as detailed in the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer screening represented the eligible membership for screening. Procedure and laboratory services were used to identify those who received cancer screening. Analyses were conducted cross-sectionally by cancer screening type. Results:Eligible cohorts were identified from insured members within March-June 2019 and 2020 (2019: 17,931,318;2020: 17,521,411). The percent of eligible members screened in March-June 2019 was 19.3%, 9.4%, 16.7%, 0.4%, and 7.8% for breast, cervical, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Changes in screening rates from 2019 to 2020 are summarized in Table, with the sharpest decline in April. The percent change from 2019 to 2020 during the combined March-June period for each cancer screening type was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: Routine cancer screening rates from March-June 2020 showed meaningful reductions when compared to the same period in 2019, with substantial declines during the initial peak of the pandemic in April. These declines may be impacted by variations in regional restrictions with tighter restrictions leading to larger screening declines and loosening restrictions reflecting catch-up screening. Efforts to promote cancer screening in a safe and timely manner are crucial given individual risk factors, to reduce later stage cancer diagnoses and improve clinical outcomes.","Kim, A.; Gitlin, M.; Fadli, E.; McGarvey, N.; Cong, Z.; Chung, K.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15-suppl.10550,562

178571,Research on Course Experience Optimization of Online Education Based on Service Encounter,2021,"Disease transmission and behavior change are both fundamentally social phenomena. Behavior change can have profound consequences for disease transmission, and epidemic conditions can favor the more rapid adoption of behavioral innovations. We analyze a simple model of coupled behavior-change and infection in a structured population characterized by homophily and outgroup aversion. Outgroup aversion slows the rate of adoption and can lead to lower rates of adoption in the later-adopting group or even behavioral divergence between groups when outgroup aversion exceeds positive ingroup influence. When disease dynamics are coupled to the behavior-adoption model, a wide variety of outcomes are possible. Homophily can either increase or decrease the final size of the epidemic depending on its relative strength in the two groups and on R0 for the infection. For example, if the first group is homophilous and the second is not, the second group will have a larger epidemic. Homophily and outgroup aversion can also produce dynamics suggestive of a “second wave” in the first group that follows the peak of the epidemic in the second group. Our simple model reveals dynamics that are suggestive of the processes currently observed under pandemic conditions in culturally and/or politically polarized populations such as the United States.","Smaldino, Paul E.; Jones, James Holland",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.157511,562
178711,Comparative Study of Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily through person-to-person contacts. Quantifying population contact rates is important for understanding the impact of physical distancing policies and for modeling COVID-19, but contact patterns have changed substantially over time due to shifting policies and behaviors. There are surprisingly few empirical estimates of age-structured contact rates in the United States both before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that capture these changes. Here, we use data from six waves of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey (BICS), which collected detailed contact data between March 22, 2020 and February 15, 2021 across six metropolitan designated market areas (DMA) in the United States. Contact rates were low across all six DMAs at the start of the pandemic. We find steady increases in the mean and median number of contacts across these localities over time, as well as a greater proportion of respondents reporting a high number of contacts. We also find that young adults between ages 18 and 34 reported more contacts on average compared to other age groups. The 65 and older age group consistently reported low levels of contact throughout the study period. To understand the impact of these changing contact patterns, we simulate COVID-19 dynamics in each DMA using an age-structured mechanistic model. We compare results from models that use BICS contact rate estimates versus commonly used alternative contact rate sources. We find that simulations parameterized with BICS estimates give insight into time-varying changes in relative incidence by age group that are not captured in the absence of these frequently updated estimates. We also find that simulation results based on BICS estimates closely match observed data on the age distribution of cases, and changes in these distributions over time. Together these findings highlight the role of different age groups in driving and sustaining SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the U.S. We also show the utility of repeated contact surveys in revealing heterogeneities in the epidemiology of COVID-19 across localities in the United States.","Chin, T.; Feehan, D.

Host defense against IA relies on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are prototypically anti-viral cells, participate in innate immune crosstalk underlying mucosal antifungal immunity. Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs and neutrophils recruited pDCs to the lung by releasing the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in a Dectin-1/Card9- and type I and III interferon-signaling dependent manner, respectively. During aspergillosis, circulating pDCs entered the lung in response to CXCR3-dependent signals. Via targeted pDC ablation, we found that pDCs were essential for host defense in the presence of normal neutrophil and Mo-DC numbers. Although interactions between pDC and fungal cells were not detected, pDCs regulated neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and conidial killing. Thus, pDCs act as positive feedback amplifiers of neutrophil effector activity against inhaled mold conidia.","Guo, Yahui; Kasahara, Shinji; Jhingran, Anupam; Tosini, Nicholas L.; Zhai, Bing; Aufiero, Mariano A.; Mills, Kathleen A.M.; Gjonbalaj, Mergim; Espinosa, Vanessa; Rivera, Amariliz; Luster, Andrew D.; Hohl, Tobias M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.05.079517,562

Objective: The objective of this preliminary study was to assess whether we could identify (1) users who have reported on Twitter that they received Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy or the periconception period, and (2) reports of their pregnancy outcomes. Methods: We searched for reports of Covid-19 vaccination in a large collection of tweets posted by users who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter. To help determine if users were vaccinated during pregnancy, we drew upon a natural language processing (NLP) tool that estimates the timeframe of the prenatal period. For users who posted tweets with a timestamp indicating they were vaccinated during pregnancy, we drew upon additional NLP tools to help identify tweets that report their pregnancy outcomes. Results: Upon manually verifying the content of tweets detected automatically, we identified 150 users who reported on Twitter that they received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy or the periconception period. Among the 60 completed pregnancies, we manually verified at least one reported outcome for 45 (75%) of them. Conclusions: Given the limited availability of data on Covid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy, Twitter can be a complementary resource for potentially increasing the acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination in pregnant populations.

So far, the design interventions created to contrast the pandemic have been largely focused on the design of products for personal use (i.e. PPE), which however will not be very effective in the long run. In post-pandemic scenarios, designers will be asked to create new enabling solutions to foster socially inclusive and sustainable 'new normalities'. These solutions will play a fundamental role in the transition toward future sustainable and inclusive living conditions.

Social innovation resonates with the challenges the pandemic presents. This paper aims to address the question of which form of social innovation will be most pivotal in the post-pandemic world.Design/methodology/approachThe paper has been developed by reviewing key literature on social innovation, with a specific focus on the most current contributions of Moulaert and MacCallum and Mulgan.FindingsSocial innovation is embedded in debates around social change but the “type” of social change that dominates the future of social innovation is connected to how social innovation interacts at different scales and with different actors engaged in shaping change in specific contexts. Building upon extant knowledge of social innovation we can hypothesise two paths of social innovation emerging/intensifying: one that seeks economic reform with an emphasis on meeting social needs in new ways and another that seeks complete systemic change.Originality/valueThis is a reflective piece that by reviewing current contributions to the social innovation literature questions the post-pandemic future of the field.","Montgomery, Thomas Mazzei Micaela",Social Enterprise Journal,https://doi.org/10.1108/sej-03-2021-0018,562

179326,Machine Learning Approach For Clustering Of Countries To Identify The Best Strategies To Combat Covid-19,2021,"Sensory neurons with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) represent a useful model to study axon regeneration. Whereas regeneration and functional recovery occurs after peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury or dorsal root injury is not followed by regenerative outcomes. Regeneration of sensory axons in peripheral nerves is not entirely cell autonomous. Whether the DRG microenvironment influences the different regenerative capacities after injury to peripheral or central axons remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we performed a single cell transcriptional profiling of mouse DRG in response to peripheral (sciatic nerve crush) and central axon injuries (dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury). Each cell type responded differently to the three types of injuries. All injuries increased the proportion of a cell type that shares features of both immune cells and glial cells. A distinct subset of satellite glial cells (SGC) appeared specifically in response to peripheral nerve injury. Activation of the PPARα signaling pathway in SGC, which promotes axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury, failed to occur after central axon injuries. Treatment with the FDA-approved PPARα agonist fenofibrate increased axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. This study provides a map of the distinct DRG microenvironment responses to peripheral and central injuries at the single cell level and highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries or disease.","Avraham, Oshri; Feng, Rui; Ewan, Eric E.; Rustenhoven, Justin; Zhao, Guoyan; Cavalli, Valeria",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.398537,562
179434,"Object detection, 3-D coordinate extraction and pose estimation for an autonomous medical robot",2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic authorities have been striving to obtain reliable predictions for the spreading dynamics of disease. We recently developed an in-homogeneous multi-""sub-populations"" (multi-compartments: susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic, infectious, recovered) model, that accounts for the spatial in-homogeneous spreading of the infection and shown, for a variety of examples, how the epidemic curves are highly sensitive to location of epicenters, non-uniform population density, and local restrictions. In the present work we tested our model against real-life data from South Carolina during the period May 22 to July 22 (2020), that was available in the form of infection heat-maps and conventional epidemic curves. During this period, minimal restrictions have been employed, which allowed us to assume that the local reproduction number is constant in time. We accounted for the non-uniform population density in South Carolina using data from NASA, and predicted the evolution of infection heat-maps during the studied period. Comparing the predicted heat-maps with those observed, we find high qualitative resemblance. Moreover, the Pearson's correlation coefficient is relatively high and does not get lower than 0.8, thus validating our model against real-world data. We conclude that our model accounts for the major effects controlling spatial in-homogeneous spreading of the disease. Inclusion of additional sub-populations (compartments), in the spirit of several recently developed models for COVID-19, can be easily performed within our mathematical framework.","Granek, R.; Tsori, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.15.21262074v1?rss=1,562
179500,Managing Congregations of People by Predicting Likelihood of a Person being Infected by a Contagious Disease like the COVID Virus,2020,"The real estate sector is receiving mix responses throughout the world, with some countries like USA receiving lesser and European and Asia Pacific markets receiving more transactions in recent years. Among the concerning factors, post-purchase regrets by the real estate owners or renters are on the rise, which have never been assessed to date through scholarly research. These regrets can further increase in the time of lockdowns and bans on inspections due to Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and social distancing rules enforced by various countries such as Australia. The current study aims at investigating the key post-purchase regret factors of real estate and property owners and renters over the last decade using published literature and online threads. Based on pertinent literature, 118 systematically identified and text-mined articles, and four online threads with 135 responses, the current study develops system dynamics models to assess and predict the increase in consumers’ regrets over the last decade. Further, a user-generated thread with 23 responses involving seven real estate managers and five agents with more than 20 years of experience, 10 buyers with at least three successful rentals or purchases, and a photographer with more than 10 years of experience, is initiated on five online discussion platforms whereby the respondents are involved in a detailed discussion to highlight the regret reasons specific to real estate purchases based on online information. General architecture for text mining (GATE) software has been utilised to mine the text from both types of threads: Published and user generated. Overall, the articles and threads published over the last decade are studied under two periods: P1 (2010–2014) and P2 (2015–2019) to highlight the post-purchase or rent-related regret reasons. The results show that regret levels of the real estate consumers based on published post-purchase data are at an alarmingly high level of 88%, which compared to 2015, has increased by 18%. Among the major cited reasons, complicated buy–sell process, lack or accuracy of information, housing costs, house size, mortgages, agents, inspections, and emotional decision making are key reasons of regret. Overall, a total of 10% and 8% increases have occurred in the regrets related to the buy–sell process and lack of inspections, respectively. On the other hand, regrets related to agents and housing costs have decreased drastically by 40% mainly due to the good return on investments in the growing markets. However, based on the current trend of over reliance on online information and more powers to the agents controlling online information coupled with lack of physical inspections, the situation can change anytime. Similarly, lack of information, housing size, and mortgage-related regrets have also decreased by 7%, 5%, and 2%, respectively, since 2019. The results are expected to encourage policy level changes for addressing the regrets and uplifting the real estate industry and moving towards a smart and sustainable real estate sector. These results and pertinent discussions may help the real estate decision makers to uplift the current state, move towards a smart real estate, and avoid futuristic regrets, especially in the COVID-hit environment where most of the industries are struggling to survive. Careful attention is required to the top regret factors identified in the study by the real estate managers, investors, and agents to pave the way for a more managed real estate and property sector whereby the consumers are more satisfied with the value they receive for their money. This win–win situation will enhance the property business and remove the stigmas of intentional and deliberate withholding of information by managers and agents from the property and real estate sectors that can help boost the business through more purchases and satisfaction of its customers.","Ullah, Fahim",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12114382,562

Methods Because UPMC is one of the largest health care systems in the US with multiple vendors' electronic health record (EHR) systems, we designed and implemented an RDW named Neptune to serve the specific needs of our CTSA. Neptune uses an atomic design where data is stored at a high level of granularity as represented in source systems. Neptune contains robust patient identity management tailored for research; integrates patient data from multiple sources, including EHRs, health plans, and research studies; and includes knowledge for mapping to standard terminologies. Neptune enables efficient provisioning of data to large analytics-oriented data models and to individual investigators. Results Neptune contains data for more than 5 million patients longitudinally organized as HIPAA Limited Data with dates and includes structured EHR data, clinical documents, health insurance claims, and research data. Neptune is used as a source for patient data for hundreds of IRB-approved research projects by local investigators and for national projects such as the Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network, the All of Us Research Program, and the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. Discussion The design of Neptune was heavily influenced by the large size of UPMC, the varied data sources, and the rich partnership between the University and the healthcare system. It features several desiderata of an RDW, including robust protected health information management, an extensible information storage model, and binding to standard terminologies at the time of data delivery. It also includes several unique aspects, including the physical warehouse straddling the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC networks and management under a HIPAA Business Associates Agreement.","Visweswaran, S.; McLay, B.; Capella, N.; Morris, M.; Milnes, J.

However, body temperature and fevers have been shown to vary over the course of a day and across individuals by age, sex and other characteristics. The objective of this paper is to describe the individual variation in diurnal temperature patterns during episodes of febrile activity using a database of millions of recorded temperatures across the United States. We then model the probability of recording a fever during a single reading at given time for individuals who are experiencing a febrile episode. We find a wide variation in body temperatures over the course of a day and across individual characteristics. Similarly, the likelihood of recording a fever may vary widely by the time of day when the reading is taken and by an individual's age or sex. These results suggest diurnal temperature variation and demographics should be considered when using body temperature to screen for disease, especially for diseases that are contagious.","Miller, A.; Koeneman, S.; Polgreen, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.04.20164095v1?rss=1,562

As restaurants develop comprehensive reopening plans, consumers may still have mixed feelings about simple things such as going out for a meal. This paper explores wellbeing perceptions of restaurant diners. Based on the analysis of semi-structured interviews, this paper reveals that wellbeing in hospitality is a collective concept comprised of multiple domains of a service system, including macro, meso, and micro levels. Furthermore, this paper provides strong support to show that wellbeing is not only sought collectively, but also is determined by consumers' wellbeing perceptions of both themselves and others around them, and thus contributes to the wellbeing literature in the hospitality domain. Finally, this paper identifies potential concerns regarding crowding and behaviors of other guests, which extends the hospitality literature on perceived territoriality.

Specifically, this work generates metrics of VMT per capita, daily change in VMT, and VMT immediate reaction rates for every county in the U.S.A. and develops regression models to determine how these factors influence VMT rates over time. Results show that state-mandated orders were deployed in a pattern relative to their expected economic impact. Model results showed infection rates may have had a greater influence on forcing state policy adoption, ensuring reduced VMT, rather than the number of cases directly influencing individual travel to a significant degree. Additionally, counties with higher populations or labeled as urban counties saw a greater reduction in VMT across all three models compared with lower population and rural counties.

Here, analyzing viral loads of over 11,000 infections during the current wave in Israel, we find that even though this wave is dominated by the Delta-variant, breakthrough infections in recently vaccinated patients, still within 2 months post their second vaccine inoculation, do have lower viral loads compared to unvaccinated patients, with the extent of viral load reduction similar to pre-Delta breakthrough observations. Yet, this infectiousness protection starts diminishing for patients two months post vaccination and ultimately vanishes for patients 6 months or longer post vaccination. Encouragingly, we find that this diminishing vaccine effectiveness on breakthrough infection viral loads is restored following the booster vaccine. These results suggest that the vaccine is initially effective in reducing infectiousness of breakthrough infections even with the Delta variant, and that while this protectiveness effect declines with time it can be restored, at least temporarily, with a booster vaccine.","Levine-Tiefenbrun, M.; Yelin, I.; Alapi, H.; Katz, R.; Herzel, E.; Kuint, J.; Chodick, G.; Gazit, S.; Patalon, T.; Kishony, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.29.21262798v1?rss=1,562
180226,Real-time education in emergency situation,2021,"Syftet med denna studie är att öka kunskapen om människors oro över coronapandemin i Sverige. Vi använder enkätdata (n=3 040) för att studera 1) hur utbredd oron är, 2) vad den mer konkret består i, 3) hur den varierar mellan olika demografiska och socioekonomiska grupper, 4) huruvida oron kan förklaras av faktorer som personlighet, livsåskådning, tillit och riskuppfattningar, samt 5) vilka konsekvenser oron får för människors sociala kontakter, livskvalitet, beteenden och åsikter om samhällets åtgärder för att minska smittspridningen. Resultaten visar att det finns en utbredd oro över coronapandemin i Sverige och att denna främst bottnar i en oro för den egna eller familjemedlemmars hälsa. Dessutom varierar oron mellan grupper: framför allt äldre personer men även kvinnor och låginkomsttagare uppvisar jämförelsevis en högre grad av oro. Det finns ett flertal faktorer som förklarar den upplevda oron, men särskilt riskuppfattningar förklarar en stor andel av variationen mellan individer samt skillnader mellan olika grupper. De som oroar sig mer uppger också att de i större utsträckning följer myndigheternas rekommendationer och har minskat sina sociala aktiviteter samt upplever en försämrad livskvalitet under coronapandemin.Alternate abstract:The purpose of this study is to provide insight into individuals' degree of worrying about the corona pandemic in Sweden. Using survey data (n=3,040), we study: 1) how widespread worrying about the corona pandemic is;2) what aspects of the pandemic people worry about;3) differences in the level of worrying among demographic and socio-economic groups;4) the extent to which worries are related to factors such as personality, religiosity, political orientation, trust, and risk perceptions;and 5) consequences of worrying for social contacts and quality of life, as well as for behaviours and opinions in relation to government recommendations. Results show that worrying about the coronavirus pandemic in Sweden is widespread and primarily about one's own or relatives' health. Moreover, we find evidence of group differences, where elderly, women, and those with lower incomes articulate higher levels of worry. Several explanatory factors are linked to worrying about the pandemic. In particular, risk perceptions explain a large share of variation between individuals and groups. While those who worry more report greater compliance with authorities' recommendations and reduced social activities, they also report a lower quality of life during the pandemic.","Kulin, Joakim Sevä Ingemar Johansson Hjerm Mikael Connolly Filip Fors",Sociologisk Forskning,https://doi.org/10.37062/sf.58.22104,562

Design: Mixed study comprising an online sampling-based survey, single-site observational clinical trial and development of a decision analytic model. Setting: A quaternary care, urban, academic, emergency department in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Participants: For the acceptability survey, we recruited N=1000 individuals living in the United States participating in an online sampling from the survey provider YouGov. In the ED study, we enrolled 40 individuals over 18 years old presenting to the ED for evaluation. Interventions: In the pilot ED study, consenting participants were exposed to a mobile robotic system facilitated triage interview controlled by an emergency medicine clinician. Afterwards, participants completed a survey to measure their satisfaction with the robotic system. Main outcome measures: Acceptability of mobile robot facilitated tasks in healthcare (national survey), satisfaction with interaction of a robotic system (ED study), number of potential SARS-CoV-2 infections avoided and cost savings (US dollars) per year per ED (decision analytic model). Results: In the national survey, participants rated the use of robotics for a variety of patient-facing healthcare functions useful or very useful. The perceived usefulness increased when asked to consider these functions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the ED, 40 patients completed study procedures; 92.5% (N=37) reported satisfaction with the robotic system. Most participants (82.5%, N=33) reported their experience being evaluated by a robotic system was as good as an in-person encounter. Our decision analytic model estimated that robotic evaluations could prevent 2.68 infections per ED yearly and save $1 million annually per ED by decreasing PPE and additional staffing in a triage space. Conclusions: Robotic systems were broadly acceptable across the US and their acceptance increased in the setting of COVID-19. Mobile robotic-enabled teleheath facilitated contactless evaluation of ED patients and was highly acceptable and equivalent to an in-person history. Robotic platforms may prevent healthcare-associated COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers and have a significant cost savings if widely implemented among healthcare systems.","Chai, P.

Our analysis reveals that human mobility increases significantly even before lockdown restrictions are eased, with the trend continuing in the post-lockdown period. We also observe that the day of week has a significant impact on mobility of individuals, with the overall mobility on Fridays increasing over time possibly due to people self-relaxing restrictions and engaging in social activities on Friday evenings. We also design an interactive tool that showcases mobility patterns in different granularities and can potentially help people and government officials understand the mobility of individuals and the number of COVID-19 cases in a particular neighborhood. © 2021 IFIP.","Ayan, N.; Damasceno, N.

180278,A UWB Radar-based Approach of Detecting Vital Signals,2021,"Global COVID-19 pandemic containment necessitates understanding the risk of hesitance or resistance to vaccine uptake in different populations. The Middle East and North Africa currently lack vital representative vaccine hesitancy data. We conducted the first representative national phone survey among the adult population of Qatar, between December 2020 and January 2021, to estimate the prevalence and identify potential determinants of vaccine willingness: acceptance (strongly agree), resistance (strongly disagree), and hesitance (somewhat agree, neutral, somewhat disagree). Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression models estimated associations between willingness groups and fifteen variables. In the total sample, 42.7% (95% CI: 39.5-46.1) were accepting, 45.2% (95% CI: 41.9-48.4) hesitant, and 12.1% (95% CI: 10.1-14.4) resistant. Vaccine resistant compared with hesistant and accepting groups reported no endorsement source will increase vaccine confidence (58.9% vs. 5.6% vs. 0.2%, respectively). Female gender, Arab ethnicity, migrant status/type, and vaccine side-effects concerns were associated with hesitancy and resistance. COVID-19 related bereavement, infection, and quarantine status were not significantly associated with any willingness group. Absence of or lack of concern about contracting the virus was solely associated with resistance. COVID-19 vaccine resistance, hesitance, and side-effects concerns are high in Qatar's population compared with those globally.

Methods: We performed an interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study using nationwide dispensing claims data (January 2017-November 2020). We focused on six subsidised medicines proposed for re-purposing: hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, colchicine, corticosteroids, and calcitriol (Vitamin D analogue). We quantified changes in monthly dispensing and initiation trends during COVID-19 (March-November 2020) using autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) and compared characteristics of initiators in 2020 and 2019. Results: In March 2020, we observed a 99% (95%CI 96%-103%) increase in hydroxychloroquine dispensing (of which approximately 30% attributable to new use), and a 251% increase (95%CI 232%-270%) in initiation, with a shift towards prescribing by general practitioners (42% in 2020 vs 25% in 2019) rather than specialists. These increases subsidised following regulatory restrictions on prescribing to relevant specialties. There was also a small but sustained increase in ivermectin dispensing over multiple months, with a 104% (95%Ci 63%-145%) increase in initiation in May 2020 following its first identification as potentially disease-modifying in April 2020. Other than increases in March related to stockpiling among existing users, we observed no increases in initiation of calcitriol or colchicine during COVID-19. Dispensing of corticosteroids and azithromycin remained low after March 2020. Conclusions: Most increases in dispensing observed early on during COVID-19 were temporary and appear to be related to stockpiling among existing users. However, we observed increases in initiation of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and a shift in prescribing patterns, indicating that a small proportion may be COVID-19 related. A quick response by regulators can help limit inappropriate repurposing to lessen the impact on medicine supply and patient harms.","Schaffer, A.

Tracing such impact during the pandemic has been challenging due to a lack of representative data. This paper addresses this gap in the present study. Design/methodology/approach: A survey has been conducted using a structured questionnaire containing various items that portray the impact on income, spending, saving, investment, borrowing, insurance and retirement. The sample consists of 699 respondents and purposive and snowball sampling has been used for data collection. The results are presented and analyzed using infographics and frequency distributions. This study conducts an analysis of variance and Chi-square tests for significance. Findings: This paper finds a fall in income and limited ability to cope with the current economic conditions. The survey highlights inadequate savings and insurance, weak retirement planning, outstanding loans and under-diversified investments inhibiting financial resilience even among the higher-income group. Particularly, lower-income strata, women and not much educated are most financially vulnerable. Further, no substantial financial benefits have been received from the government and people rely on their usual income sources. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that measures the pandemic’s impact on personal finances, especially in connection with a developing economy like India.

The pandemic outbreak has led to the most unprecedented and catastrophic loss of human life in the recent history. As of January 2021, there were more than 100 million cases of COVID-19 and more than two million deaths worldwide. Compared to the general population, patients with cancer are at a higher risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. In large cohort studies, mortality from COVID-19 in patients with cancer can be as high as 40%. In addition to clinical variables (older age, male sex, and co-morbidities) that are associated with mortality in general population, cancer patients are uniquely vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to immunosuppression from cancer and its therapy, and disruption of routine clinical care. Among patients with cancer, the lung cancer population is at a higher risk of poor outcomes and mortality from COVID-19 for several reasons. For instance, lung is the main target organ in COVID-19 that can lead to respiratory failure, patients with lung cancer have baseline poor lung function from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and smoking. In addition, some of the lung cancer treatment side-effects like pneumonitis, may obscure the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this article, we systematically review the most impactful cohort studies published to date in patients with cancer and COVID-19. We describe the rates of mortality in patients with cancer and COVID-19 with a special focus on the lung cancer population. We also summarize the factors associated with poor outcomes and mortality in patients with lung cancer and COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2021.","Kulkarni, A. A.; Wilson, G.; Fujioka, N.; Patel, M.

This interaction is similar to the mechanism in SARS-CoV, a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in 2003. Drugs and antibodies that inhibit the interaction between ACE2 and S proteins could be key therapeutic methods for preventing viral infection and replication in COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate the interaction between human ACE2 and a fragment of the S protein (S1 subunit) derived from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV using two-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), which can detect the interaction of fluorescently labeled proteins. The S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 interacted in solution with soluble ACE2, which lacks a transmembrane region, more strongly than that of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, one-to-one stoichiometry of the two proteins during the interaction was indicated. Thus, we propose that this FCCS-based interaction detection system can be used to analyze the interaction strengths of various mutants of the S1 subunit that have evolved during the worldwide pandemic, and also offers the opportunity to screen and evaluate the performance of drugs and antibodies that inhibit the interaction.","Fujimoto, Ai; Yidan, Lyu; Kinjo, Masataka; Kitamura, Akira",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.456769,562

Recent evidence proposed COVID-19 lockdowns may have contributed to changes in preterm birth. We aimed to determine the prevalence of preterm birth during the COVID-19 lockdown on the Sunshine Coast and in the state of Queensland, Australia. Methods Retrospective cohort analysis of all births in Queensland including the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, during two epochs, April 1-May 31, 2020 (lockdown) and June 1-July 31, 2020 (post-lockdown), compared to antecedent calendar-matched periods in 2018-2019. Prevalence of preterm birth, stillbirth, and late terminations were examined. Results There were 64,989 births in Queensland from April to July 2018-2020. At the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, there was a significantly higher chance of birth at term during both lockdown (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.17, 2.79; P=0.007) and post-lockdown (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.27, 3.18; P=0.003). At the same centre, prevalence of preterm birth was 5.5% (30/547) during lockdown, compared to 9.1% (100/1095) in previous years, a 40.0% relative reduction (P=0.016). At this centre during lockdown, emergency caesareans concurrently decreased (P=0.034) and vacuum-assisted births increased (P=0.036). In Queensland overall, there was a nonsignificant decrease in the prevalence of preterm birth during lockdown. Conclusions There is a link between lockdown and a reduction in the prevalence of preterm birth on the Sunshine Coast. The cause is speculative. Further research is needed to determine a causal link and assess if this can be translated into management which provides a sustained reduction in preterm birth and its associated morbidity and mortality.","Jasper, B.; Stillerova, T.; Anstey, C.; Weaver, E.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.06.21261711v1?rss=1,562

181235,Twitter Sentiment Analysis and Political Approval Ratings for Situational Awareness,2021,"Objectives: This paper examines differences in vaccination coverage and hesitancy for people in vaccine priority groups. Design, setting, participants: Using data from 2,400 Australians who participated in two waves of the Taking the Pulse of the Nation survey in April and May 2021, we describe vaccination coverage and hesitancy among vaccine priority groups including people with disability, people living with a severe mental health condition, a severe long-term health condition, those requiring frequent assistance with everyday activities, and people who provide paid or unpaid care. Main outcome measures: The proportion of the sample who were vaccinated and who were vaccine hesitant, for the whole sample and for vaccine priority groups, disaggregated by age group and gender. Results: COVID-19 vaccine coverage was estimated to be 8.2% overall, higher for people with severe long term health conditions (13.4%) and lower for people with severe mental health conditions (4.3%). Vaccine hesitancy was high overall (35.6%) and was found to be lower for people with disability (30.3%), with severe long term health conditions (27.7%), with frequent need for assistance (24.2%) and carers (30.7%), but similar for those with severe mental health conditions (36.1%). Conclusions: Low vaccination coverage and high hesitancy for people in the priority groups leaves many people at significant risk of serious disease or death if infected with COVID-19. These findings demonstrate the urgent need for governments to enable easy access to vaccination for people in priority groups and to develop communication strategies to promote vaccination uptake, co-designed with the priority groups.","Aitken, Z.; Emerson, E.; Kavanagh, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261633v1?rss=1,562
181293,Redefining the Digital Paradigm for Virtual Museums: Towards Interactive and Engaging Experiences in the Post-pandemic Era,2021,"Ski touring on groomed slopes is a relatively new outdoor sport that has steadily been gaining interest. So far, little scientific attention has been given to this outdoor activity. Thus, few questions have been asked about the motivation for practising this sport, and even fewer about whether the current COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the frequency of and motivation for ski touring. For this reason, we conducted a large-scale study (n = 6802) in the Austrian Alps. Results revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has not changed the motive structure for ski touring;however, the findings showed that many people have even started to practice this sport. This research note contributes to the existing knowledge by (a) documenting ski tourers’ motives using a large sample, (b) giving insights into the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this specific outdoor sport, and (c) showing COVID-19-related impacts on practicing ski touring. Management implications •No changes in motivational reasons for ski touring due to COVID-19 pandemic.•Trend towards outdoor sports, especially ski tours on groomed slopes in the alpine region of central Europe. Amplification of the trend due to the pandemic and the associated restrictions.•As an outdoor sport, ski touring on groomed slopes offers versatile added value for ski tourers, but also huge potential for ropeway operators.•This soft slope tourism can also show alternatives to temporary ropeway closures in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and could also promote tourism (especially day tourism) in small circles at the regional level.•The increase in beginners naturally raises the question of whether this group needs special offers or how to deal with beginners on the slopes. On the other hand, this also raises the question of how to deal with the increase in ski slope users in general.","Schlemmer, Philipp Schnitzer Martin",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2021.100413,562
181320,Remote Sensing Image Classification for Spatial Information Extraction of Panax notoginseng Fields,2021,"Northeast Brazil has the world's highest rate of Zika-related microcephaly. Yet, in this hard-hit region, traditional case counts of Zika cannot accurately describe Zika risk. Reporting of Zika cases only became mandatory after its association with microcephaly in neonates, when the Zika epidemic was already declining in the region. To advance the study of the Brazilian Zika epidemic and its impacts, we identified hotspots of Zika in Pernambuco state, Northeast Brazil, using Aedes-borne diseases (dengue, chikungunya and Zika) and microcephaly data. We used the Kulldorff's Poisson purely spatial scan statistic to detect low- and high-risk clusters and combined the results to identify the municipalities most affected by the Zika epidemic. Municipalities were classified as hotspots if they were part of any high-risk cluster, and classified according to a gradient of Zika burden during the epidemic, considering the strength of the evidence. In Pernambuco, officials confirmed 123,934 dengue cases, 167 Zika cases, and 32,983 chikungunya cases between 2014-2017, and 800 microcephaly cases between 2015-2017. We identified 26 Aedes-borne diseases clusters (11 high-risk), and 5 microcephaly cases clusters (3 high-risk). Combining the results, sixty-three out of 184 municipalities were identified as hotspots for Zika. The northeast of Pernambuco and the Sertao region were hit hardest by the Zika epidemic. The first is the most populous area, while the second has one of the highest rates of social and economic inequality in Brazil. The identification of Sertao as a Zika hotspot was only possible because the clusters results were combined. The under-reporting of acute infectious diseases is expected to be higher in poor areas. Therefore, using only Aedes-borne data does not correctly identify the high-risk areas. We successfully identified hidden Zika hotspots using a simple methodology combining Aedes-borne diseases and microcephaly information.","Freitas, L. P.; Lowe, R.; Koepp, A. E.; Valongueiro, S.

Due to the involvement of ACE-2 in blood pressure regulation, there have appeared reports of possible negative effects of taking some cardiological drugs during coronavirus pandemic. Some hypotheses suggest an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more severe clinical course of COVID-19 in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. In the face of contradictory information regarding this question, several societies of cardiology and hypertension have issued clinical recommendations for patients treated with the above-mentioned drugs. These recommendations conclude that there are no unambiguous data that would support the hypothesis about the negative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Therefore, it is highly recommended not to discontinue treatment in patients in whom these drugs lead to improvement in their clinical condition.","Plech, T.",Polish Journal of Public Health,https://doi.org/10.2478/pjph-2019-0034,562

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be observed as early as 14 days post- infection, but little is known about the stability of antibody levels over time. Here we evaluate the long-term stability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies following infection in 402 adult donors. Methods. We performed a multi-centre study carried out at Plasma Donor Centres in the city of Heidelberg (Plasmazentrum Heidelberg, Germany) and Munich (Plasmazentrum M&uumlnchen, Germany). We present anti-S/N and anti-N IgG antibody levels in prospective serum samples collected up to 403 days post recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Results: The cohort includes 402 adult donors (185 female, 217 male; 17 - 68 years of age) where anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were measured in plasma samples collected between 18- and 403-days post SARS-CoV-2 infection. A linear mixed effects model demonstrated IgG decay rates that decrease over time ({chi}2=176.8, p<0.00001) and an interaction of time*age ({chi}2=10.0, p<0.005)), with those over 60+ years showing the highest baseline IgG levels and the fastest rate of IgG decay. Baseline viral neutralization assays demonstrated that serum IgG levels correlated with in vitro neutralization capacity in 91% of our cohort. Conclusion. Long-term antibody levels and age-specific antibody decay rates suggest the potential need for age-specific vaccine booster guidelines to ensure long term vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sjaarda, C.

Deploying an ecological framework, we situate students' experiences within their families, communities, and educational institutions. We draw on qualitative and quantitative survey responses from 1,067 undocumented students attending California 4-year universities. Qualitative findings show that immigration status exacerbated the negative economic effects of the pandemic, leading to severe financial strains that had cascading negative effects on undocumented students' academics and health. Regression analyses confirm the strong association between students' preexisting economic insecurity and negative effects of the pandemic. Legal vulnerability and family strains moderated this relationship, but campus environment had little effect.","Enriquez, L. E.; Rosales, W. E.; Chavarria, K.; Hernandez, M.

Such platforms bear the potential to resolve even extremely complex regions, such as multigenic families and repetitive stretches of DNA. Deep sequencing coverage, however, is required to overcome low nucleotide accuracy, especially in regions with high homopolymer density, copy number variation, and sequence similarity, such as the MHC and KIR gene clusters of the immune system. Therefore, we have adapted a targeted enrichment protocol in combination with long-read sequencing to efficiently annotate complex genomic regions. Using Cas9 endonuclease activity, segments of the complex KIR gene cluster were enriched and sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. This provided sufficient coverage to accurately resolve and phase highly complex KIR haplotypes. Our strategy facilitates rapid characterization of large and complex multigenic regions, including its epigenetic footprint, in multiple species, even in the absence of a reference genome.","Bruijnesteijn, Jesse; van der Wiel, Marit; de Groot, Natasja G.; Bontrop, Ronald E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.11.434935,562

To identify the new emergent variants, the surveillance of the variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI) is ongoing. This study aimed to determine how the transition of viral lineage occurred by stationary genome analysis in Yamanashi, Japan. Methods We performed the whole genome sequencing using SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (n=325) collected from February 2020 to the end of June 2021. The number of analyzed samples accounted for 15.4% of the total 2,109 samples identified in our community. Viral lineage was defined by the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (PANGO) lineages. Results We identified 13 types of viral lineages including R.1, P.1, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) These virus lineages had distinct periods of expansion and decline. After the emerging of the R.1 lineage harboring E484K variant (designated VOI in Japan), the prevalent B.1.1.214 lineage were no longer identified. The R.1 lineages were temporarily prevalent afterwards, but the influx of B.1.1.7 lineage (designated VOC) led to a decline in R.1. Currently, B.1.1.7 has become dominant after mid-April, 2021. Conclusion We clearly elucidated the transition and replacement of viral lineage by the community-based analysis. The virus completely replaced by more infectious lineages, therefore, it will be necessary to continue to monitor the VOC and VOI.","Hirotsu, Y.; Omata, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.21259820v1?rss=1,562

The questionnaire used contains 23 items and was structured based on four distinctive factors, namely attractiveness, accessibility, motivation and efficiency;it was applied after the winter session of the academic year 2020–2021. The values of the internal consistency coefficient Cronbach’s alpha indicate for the four mentioned factors a high fidelity for the measurements of the investigated features. The results of the 147 completed questionnaires allowed the definition of the independent variables sex (boys and girls) and environment of origin (rural and urban) the identification of their influence on the scores of each item (dependent variables) by using the statistical technique MANOVA (multivariate and univariate analysis), besides the values of F and the corresponding significance thresholds;the magnitude of the effect, expressed by partial eta squared (Ƞ2p), was also calculated. Even if the averages of item scores differ between sexes and backgrounds, the differences noted are in few cases significant: attractiveness and socialization for those in urban areas;participation in activities and effective involvement for girls;technical deficiencies, platform logging and weak computer skills for those in rural areas;and an increase in free time for girls and students in urban areas. The study undertaken allows the identification of the favorable aspects and the shortcomings of online teaching activities, these being the premises for optimizing the teaching process in the following stages.","Mocanu, George Danut Murariu Gabriel Georgescu Lucian Sandu Ion",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11146328,562

182286,Indicators on the Feasibility of Curfew on Pandemics Outbreaks in Metropolitan/Micropolitan Cities,2021,"Background: There has been a well-documented link showing that pre-existing diabetes worsens outcomes in Covid-19 infection in adults. However, researchers have postulated that this relationship is reciprocal, where infection with Covid-19 may trigger new onset diabetes. Data on pediatric new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Covid-19 remains scarce. Furthermore, the results are conflicting;some studies showed increased rate of new onset T1DM in children with Covid-19 and the others did not find any difference in 2020 compared to previous years. The aim of this study is to elucidate the relationship between pediatric new onset T1DM and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with Covid-19 infection in a single center. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 50 pediatric diabetes cases admitted to the Bronson Children's Hospital between March 2020 and December 2020. Results: From the total of 50 patients, 42 had new onset T1DM. Of these 42, 33 (78.6%) presented with DKA, and 17 (40.5%) met hospital criteria for Covid-19 testing, with 16 of those producing a negative result. There was only 1 (5.9% of tested, 2.4% of T1DM cases) patient with new onset T1DM associated with a positive Covid-19 test. Conclusion: The low number of positive cases identified in this study suggests that there may be no link between Covid-19 viral illness and new onset T1DM in the pediatric population. Major limitations include the single center localization of the study and inability to test all cases for Covid-19 at this facility. Due to the scarcity of test kits and lab personnel especially early during the pandemic, only patients that met symptomatic criteria were tested. It is possible and likely that some of the patients were infected with Covid-19 but remained asymptomatic.","Rowland, Dustin Lee Nicole Do Ergun-Longmire Berrin",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-1122-p,562

182304,The History of Agent-Based Modeling in the Social Sciences,2021,"During an epidemic, infectious individuals might not be detectable until some time after becoming infected. The studies show that carriers with mild or no symptoms are the main contributors to the transmission of a virus within the population. The average time it takes to develop the symptoms causes a delay in the spread dynamics of the disease. When considering the influence of delay on the disease propagation in epidemic networks, depending on the value of the time-delay and the network topology, the peak of epidemic could be considerably different in time, duration, and intensity. Motivated by the recent worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the topological extent in which this virus has spread over the course of a few months, this study aims to highlight the effect of time-delay in the progress of such infectious diseases in the meta-population networks rather than individuals or a single population. In this regard, the notions of epidemic network centrality in terms of the underlying interaction graph of the network, structure of the uncertainties, and symptom development duration are investigated to establish a centrality-based analysis of the disease evolution. A traffic volume convex optimization method is then developed to control the outbreak by identifying the sub-populations with the highest centrality and then isolating them while maintaining the same overall traffic volume (motivated by economic considerations) in the meta-population level. The numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations, highlight the impact of time-delay as well as the importance of considering the worst-case scenarios in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment. © 2021 American Automatic Control Council.","Darabi, A.; Siami, M.","2021 American Control Conference, ACC 2021",https://doi.org/10.23919/acc50511.2021.9483082,562

Despite this, the large majority of research into blended learning has studied university student populations. Thus, this paper seeks to research differences in usage between and in primary and secondary schools. Data were collected from a prototype learning portal, resulting in a dataset of 803 students from 12 schools with 45 teachers. Teachers and students could perform diverse actions on the platform, coded as 19 student features and 6 teacher features. These features were used to perform cluster analysis with k-means clustering on the entire dataset, split between teachers and students. Differences in primary and secondary schools were also analyzed. Clustering on the entire student dataset resulted in two clusters that differed on amounts of learning activities and learning tracks. Primary and secondary school students differed on the amount of learning activities, amount of learning tracks, and ratings of fun. Clustering on teachers resulted in two clusters differing in exploration and personalization. These results might be due to differences implementations of blended learning, where young students begin with simple rotation and complexity in implementation increases with age. These results might also be due to differences in teacher competencies. These results belie the importance of research into blended learning in pre-university education, filling a gap in literature and providing guidelines for coaching and use of multiple learning applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bhatt, S.

In this study, we examine the validation and utilization of these criteria. METHODS: Two cohorts of 316 consecutive patients were recruited, including 242 patients previously diagnosed to have NAFLD and 74 patients with concomitant NAFLD and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) The validity of the proposed criteria for MAFLD, namely presence of hepatic steatosis with one of three criteria, overweight/obesity, diabetes or evidence of metabolic dysregulation was assessed. Fibrosis was assessed using, fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). The impact of MAFLD on the clinical outcomes in CHC patients was also investigated. Results: The clinical criteria captured 240 patients (99.2%). 215 (88.8%) met either overweight or diabetes and 25 (10.3%) met the presence of 2 criteria of metabolic dysfunction. In patients, with dual etiologies, in the multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, BMI, ALT, AST and diabetes, the presence of MAFLD were significantly associated with increase high FIB-4 score of fibrosis (Odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.77 [1.49-9.48], P < 0.005) when compared to those with MAFLD only. CONCLUSION: The proposed criteria for diagnosis of MAFLD is well validated and easily applicable to the entire spectrum of disease including non-obese subjects. Patients with lean MAFLD have favorable metabolic and fibrosis characteristics compared to their obese counterpart, while patients with concomitant MAFLD and CHC had severe metabolic and fibrosis characteristics compared to patients with MAFLD alone.","Fouad, Y.; Saad, Z.; Abdel Raheem, E.; Abel gany, Y.; Moness, H.; Osman, N.; Abdelhameed, W.; Mostafa, A.; attia, d.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.20.20176214v1?rss=1,562

The paper addresses four examples of gratitude work: Politburo Standing Committee member Wang Yang's short-lived critique of gratitude in the name of a different conception of popular sovereignty;the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Sichuan earthquake as a day of gratitude;the detention of Uyghurs in Xinjiang who are taught to be grateful to the Communist Party in a campaign of religious de-radicalization;and the refusal of gratitude in quarantined Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic.

188905,Remote Rehabilitation: A Field-Based Feasibility Study of an mHealth Resistance Exercise Band.,2020-12-01,"Arteriviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses with an efficiently organized, polycistronic genome. A short region between the replicase gene and open reading frame (ORF) 2 of the equine arteritis virus (EAV) genome was previously assumed to be untranslated. However, here we report that this segment of the EAV genome contains the 5' part of a novel gene (ORF 2a) which is conserved in all arteriviruses. The 3' part of EAV ORF 2a overlaps with the 5' part of the former ORF 2 (now renamed ORF 2b), which encodes the GS glycoprotein. Both ORF 2a and ORF 2b appear to be expressed from mRNA 2, which thereby constitutes the first proven example of a bicistronic mRNA in arteriviruses. The 67-amino-acid protein encoded by EAV ORF 2a, which we have provisionally named the envelope (E) protein, is very hydrophobic and has a basic C terminus. An E protein-specific antiserum was raised and used to demonstrate the expression of the novel gene in EAV-infected cells. The EAV E protein proved to be very stable, did not form disulfide-linked oligomers, and was not N-glycosylated. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy studies showed that the E protein associates with intracellular membranes both in EAV-infected cells and upon independent expression. An analysis of purified EAV particles revealed that the E protein is a structural protein. By using reverse genetics, we demonstrated that both the EAV E and GS proteins are essential for the production of infectious progeny virus.","Snijder, E J; van Tol, H; Pedersen, K W; Raamsman, M J; de Vries, A A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10400725/,562

This is due to the uncertainty if the populations are detached from or in synch with information on COVID-19. The findings reported here suggest that rural Africa is burdened with misinformation and infodemic regarding COVID-19 due to widespread misconceptions and anecdotal reports. It is, therefore, necessary to engage with community leaders to provide awareness campaigns in rural communities to ensure access to reliable information issued by local and international health authorities. It is pertinent to set up avenues that improve health literacy in communities in rural Africa as it is a major determinant of information assimilation","Okereke, M.; Ngaruiya, L.

206999,Tax Planning for Small and Micro Enterprises under the Influence of the 2019-nCoV,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to rapid acceleration in the deployment of new digital technologies to improve both accessibility to and quality of care, and to protect staff. Mixed-reality (MR) technology is the latest iteration of telemedicine innovation; it is a logical next step in the move toward the provision of digitally supported clinical care and medical education. This technology has the potential to revolutionize care both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This pilot project sought to deploy the HoloLens2 MR device to support the delivery of remote care in COVID-19 hospital environments. METHODS: A prospective, observational, nested cohort evaluation of the HoloLens2 was undertaken across three distinct clinical clusters in a teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Data pertaining to staff exposure to high-risk COVID-19 environments and personal protective equipment (PPE) use by clinical staff (N=28) were collected, and assessments of acceptability and feasibility were conducted. RESULTS: The deployment of the HoloLens2 led to a 51.5% reduction in time exposed to harm for staff looking after COVID-19 patients (3.32 vs 1.63 hours/day/staff member; P=.002), and an 83.1% reduction in the amount of PPE used (178 vs 30 items/round/day; P=.02). This represents 222.98 hours of reduced staff exposure to COVID-19, and 3100 fewer PPE items used each week across the three clusters evaluated. The majority of staff using the device agreed it was easy to set up and comfortable to wear, improved the quality of care and decision making, and led to better teamwork and communication. In total, 89.3% (25/28) of users felt that their clinical team was safer when using the HoloLens2. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies have a role in minimizing exposure to nosocomial infection, optimizing the use of PPE, and enhancing aspects of care. Deploying such technologies at pace requires context-specific information security, infection control, user experience, and workflow integration to be addressed at the outset and led by clinical end-users. The deployment of new telemedicine technology must be supported with objective evidence for its safety and effectiveness to ensure maximum impact.","Martin, Guy; Koizia, Louis; Kooner, Angad; Cafferkey, John; Ross, Clare; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Sivananthan, Arun; Tanna, Anisha; Pratt, Philip; Kinross, James",J Med Internet Res,,562
207043,Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning,2021,"As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, awareness of uncommon presentations of the disease increases. Such is the case with pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Recent evidence suggested that these can occur in the context of COVID-19 pneumonia, even in the absence of mechanical ventilation-related barotrauma. We present two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by pneumomediastinum. The first patient was a 55-year-old woman who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Her clinical course was complicated by pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, and, unfortunately, she died 2 days following the admission. The second patient was a 31-year-old man who developed a small pneumomediastinum and was managed conservatively. He had a spontaneous resolution of the pneumomediastinum and was discharged 19 days later. None of our patients required invasive or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. We performed a literature review of COVID-19 pneumonia cases that developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or both. The analysis showed that the latter had high mortality (60%). Thus, it is necessary to pay attention to these complications as early identification and management can reduce the associated morbidity and mortality.","Quincho-Lopez, Alvaro; Quincho-Lopez, Dania L; Hurtado-Medina, Fernando D",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,562

213523,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the Pleural Swab of a COVID-19 Patient with a Pneumothorax,2021,"Oncological care was largely derailed due to the reprioritisation of health care services to handle the initial surge of COVID-19 patients adequately. Cancer screening programmes were no exception in this reprioritisation. They were temporarily halted in the Netherlands (1) to alleviate the pressure on health care services overwhelmed by the upsurge of COVID-19 patients, (2) to reallocate staff and personal protective equipment to support critical COVID-19 care, and (3) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Utilising data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry on provisional cancer diagnoses between 6 January 2020 and 4 October 2020, we assessed the impact of the temporary halt of national population screening programmes on the diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancer in the Netherlands. A dynamic harmonic regression model with ARIMA error components was applied to assess the observed versus expected number of cancer diagnoses per calendar week. Fewer diagnoses of breast and colorectal cancer were objectified amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. This effect was most pronounced among the age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes, especially in breast cancer (age group 50-74 years). Encouragingly enough, the observed number of diagnoses ultimately reached and virtually remained at the level of the expected values. This finding, which emerged earlier in age groups not invited for cancer screening programmes, comes on account of the decreased demand for critical COVID-19 care since early April 2020, which, in turn, paved the way forward to resume screening programmes and a broad range of non-critical health care services, albeit with limited operating and workforce capacity. Collectively, transient changes in health-seeking behaviour, referral practices, and cancer screening programmes amid the early stages of the initial COVID-19 epidemic in the Netherlands conjointly acted as an accelerant for fewer breast and colorectal cancer diagnoses in age groups eligible for cancer screening programmes. Forthcoming research is warranted to assess whether the decreased diagnostic scrutiny of cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in stage migration and altered clinical management, as well as poorer outcomes.","Dinmohamed, Avinash G; Cellamare, Matteo; Visser, Otto; de Munck, Linda; Elferink, Marloes A G; Westenend, Pieter J; Wesseling, Jelle; Broeders, Mireille J M; Kuipers, Ernst J; Merkx, Matthias A W; Nagtegaal, Iris D; Siesling, Sabine",J Hematol Oncol,,562

We aimed at evaluating the impact of COVID-19 emergency on the management of people with epilepsy (PWE) living in the rural communities of the Gran Chaco area of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected a sample of PWE living in the rural communities of the Bolivian Chaco. A standardized questionnaire was developed, consisting of six questions addressing drug availability, drug discontinuation, personnel responsible for drug retrieval during the lockdown, and the presence of seizures in the two months preceding the interview. Questionnaires were administered by community health workers of the rural health centers in September 2020. RESULTS: Seventy PWE (38 men, 54.3%; mean age 26.9â¯±â¯16.7) were interviewed. During the lockdown the large majority of them (nâ¯=â¯51, 73.9%) reported an irregular medication intake mainly due to the lack of antiseizure medications in the local health posts, leading to an increase in seizure frequency. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has unmasked the frailty of the Bolivian health system, especially for the management of chronic diseases such as epilepsy in the rural communities.","Nicoletti, Alessandra; Todaro, Valeria; Cicero, Calogero Edoardo; Giuliano, Loretta; Zappia, Mario; Cosmi, Francesco; Vilte, Estela; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Crespo Gómez, Elizabeth Blanca",Epilepsy Behav,,562

Plans and policies for responding to public health emergencies are generally framed at higher levels of governance, but developing, improving and sustaining the capacities necessary for implementing these policies is a direct function of local-level authorities. Evaluating local-level public health capacities is an important process for identifying strengths and weaknesses that can impact the preparedness for, detection of and response to health security threats. However, while various evaluations and assessments exist for evaluating capacities at other levels, currently, there are no readily available health security assessments for the local-level. In this paper, we describe a tool-the Rapid Urban Health Security Assessment (RUHSA) Tool-that is based on a variety of other relevant assessments and guidance documents. Assessing capacities allow for local-level authorities to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their local health security systems, create multiyear action plans and prioritise opportunities for improving capacities, effectively engage with development partners to target resources effectively and develop compelling narratives and a legacy of leadership. While the RUHSA Tool was not designed to be used in the midst of a public health emergency, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it may also be adapted to inform a checklist for prioritising what capacities and activities a city needs to rapidly develop or to help focus requests for assistance.","Boyce, Matthew R; Katz, Rebecca",,,562

220544,Content Based COVID-19 Chest X-Ray and CT Images Retrieval framework using Stacked Auto-Encoders,2021,"Clinicians have widely recognized that indirect calorimetry (IC) is the ""gold standard"" for measuring energy expenditure (EE) and thus would intuitively anticipate that its use would be needed to provide optimal nutrition support in critical illness. Recent studies in the literature as well as dramatic changes in clinical practice over the past decade, though, would suggest that such a precise measure by IC to set energy goals is not required to maximize clinical benefit from early feeding in the intensive care unit (ICU). Results from randomized controlled trials evaluating permissive underfeeding, use of supplemental parenteral nutrition to achieve tight calorie control, and caloric density of formulas to increase energy delivery have provided an important perspective on 3 pertinent issues. First, a simple weight-based predictive equation (25 kcal/kg/day) provides a clinically useful approximation of EE. Second, a precise measure of EE by IC does not appear to improve outcomes compared with use of this less accurate estimation of energy requirements. And third, providing some percentage of requirements (50%-80%), achieves similar clinical benefit to full feeding (100%) in the early phases of critical illness. The value from IC use lies in the determination of caloric requirements in conditions for which weight-based equations are rendered inaccurate (anasarca, amputation, severe obesity) or the clinical state is markedly altered (such as the prolonged hyperinflammatory state of coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). In most other circumstances, routine use of IC would not be expected to change clinical outcomes from early nutrition therapy in the ICU.","McClave, Stephen A; Omer, Endashaw",Nutr Clin Pract,,562

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the emergency department of three different hospitals (two coronavirus disease-19 hubs). Demographics and data on acute pyelonephritis, acute kidney injury, urinoma, hematuria, inpatient admission/discharge home, and type of treatment were gathered and compared with the same periods in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 516 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 62.4% were male. Their mean age was 58.86 ± 16.24 years. The number of admissions decreased significantly, by 51.25% (P = 0.003), during lockdown compared to 2019 (78 vs 160 admissions). The number of admissions in the reopening phase (May-June 2020) was in line with that in 2019 (n = 138). The number of hospitalizations (P = 0.005), acute obstructive pyelonephritis (P = 0.019), and complications (P = 0.02) was statistically significantly higher during lockdown compared to 2019. The increase in the rate of surgical procedures nearly reached significance (P = 0.059). The odds of having complications and being hospitalized were almost fivefold (odds ratio 4.68, 95% confidence interval 1.98-11.07) and twofold greater (odds ratio 2.39, 95% confidence interval 1.29-4.43) compared to the same period in 2019. No difference was noted between May-June 2020 and 2019. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease-19 lockdown period provoked a meaningful reduction in symptomatic ureteral lithiasis admission. Most patients presented with complicated disease, which required an increased rate of interventional procedures compared to the equivalent period in 2019. Admissions reverted to normal levels during the reopening phase.","Castellani, Daniele; Ragonese, Mauro; Di Rosa, Mirko; Marzio, Vittorio; Di Gianfrancesco, Luca; Bassi, Pierfrancesco; De Dominicis, Mauro; Dellabella, Marco; Antonucci, Michele",Int. j. urol,,562

Infection with either virus may lead to aberrant host responses, such as excessive immune cell recruitment and activation, dysregulated inflammation, and coagulopathy. These may contribute to the development of lung edema and respiratory failure. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that lung endothelial cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both viruses. In this review, we discuss how infection with influenza or SARS-CoV-2 may induce endothelial dysfunction. We compare the effects of infection of these two viruses, how they may contribute to pathogenesis, and discuss the implications for potential treatment. Understanding the differences between the effects of these two viruses on lung endothelial cells will provide important insight to guide the development of therapeutics.","Latreille, Elyse; Lee, Warren L",Viruses,,562

The hypothesis is that people's nutritional and oxidative scavenging capacity may provide fundamental data to predict severe and acute pulmonary distress following SARS-Cov2 infection. Consequently, the scientific community has addressed the role of balanced diets, nutritional supplements, and micronutrients, including folk herbal formulations, in reducing hospitalization and the severity of pulmonary impact in COVID-19 by preventing the most serious forms of the infection. This led to an animated debate on the potential effectiveness of some vitamins, micronutrients, and traditional Chinese medicine in preventing COVID-19, with some authors convinced that plant extracts could act oppositely, exacerbating the effect of the infection. While current research is still far to assess the suggestions and issues raised in this short communication, it is undoubtedly true that determining an individual's current metabolic status, including macro- and micronutrients, is an essential factor in defining any individuals' deficiencies, which will need to be addressed urgently through a proper diet, specific personalized nutritional supplementation, and lifestyle changes.","Gasmi, Amin; Chirumbolo, Salvatore; Peana, Massimiliano; Noor, Sadaf; Menzel, Alain; Dadar, Maryam; Bjørklund, Geir",Biol. trace elem. res,,562

Thus, individuals who naturally contracted SARS-CoV-2 are expected to develop a more rapid and sustained response to COVID-19 vaccines than naïve individuals. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in six healthcare workers who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, in comparison to nine control subjects without a previous infection. The vaccine was well tolerated by both groups, with no significant difference in the frequency of vaccine-associated side effects, with the exception of local pain, which was more common in previously infected subjects. Overall, the titers of neutralizing antibodies were markedly higher in response to the vaccine than after natural infection. In all subjects with pre-existing immunity, a rapid increase in anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers was observed one week after the first dose, which seemed to act as a booster. Notably, in previously infected individuals, neutralizing antibody titers 7 days after the first vaccine dose were not significantly different from those observed in naïve subjects 7 days after the second vaccine dose. These results suggest that, in previously infected people, a single dose of the vaccine might be sufficient to induce an effective response.","Gobbi, Federico; Buonfrate, Dora; Moro, Lucia; Rodari, Paola; Piubelli, Chiara; Caldrer, Sara; Riccetti, Silvia; Sinigaglia, Alessandro; Barzon, Luisa",Viruses,,562

239354,Four-Year Study on the Bio-Agronomic Response of Biotypes of Capparis spinosa L. on the Island of Linosa (Italy),2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 coinfection with other viral and bacterial pathogens and their interactions are increasingly recognized in the literature as potential determinants of COVID-19 phenotypes. The aim of this study was to determine infection induced, host transcriptomic overlap between SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 infection induced gene expression data were used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) via the Enrichr platform. GSEA compared the extracted signature to VirusMINT, Virus and Microbe perturbations from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) in order to detect overlap with other pathogen induced host gene signatures. For all analyses, a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: GSEA via Enrichr revealed several significantly enriched sub-signatures associated with HSV1, EBV, HIV1, IAV, RSV, P.Aeruginosa, Staph. Aureus and Strep. Pneumoniae infections, among other pathogens (FDR < 0.05). These signatures were detected in at least 6 infection-induced transcriptomic studies from GEO and involved both bronchial epithelial and peripheral blood immune cells. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may function synergistically with other viral and bacterial pathogens at the transcriptomic level. Notably, several meta-analyses of COVID-19 cohorts have furthermore corroborated viral and bacterial pathogens reported herein as coinfections with SARS-CoV-2. The identification of common, perturbed gene networks outlines a common host targetome for these pathogens, and furthermore provides candidates for biomarker discovery and drug design.","Vavougios, George D",Infect Genet Evol,,562
248842,The role of social media in public crisis governance,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of oxygen metabolism markers as predictors of mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was undertaken to compare the medical records of patients with severe COVID-19 (53 deceased patients and 50 survivors). The survivors were selected from 222 records using a random number generator. In addition, 28 individuals who considered themselves to be healthy and who had no history of serious illness were included in the study for comparison. Oxygen saturation in arterial blood, oxygen saturation in central venous blood (ScvO2), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), respiratory index (PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen), oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption (VO2) and oxygen extraction (O2ER) were compared in all participants. The optimal cut-off point for each oxygen metabolism marker in the prediction of mortality was determined based on the maximum value of the Youden Index in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences in all studied oxygen metabolism markers were found between survivors compared with deceased patients (p < 0.001). ScvO2, VO2 and O2ER [area under curve (AUC) 1.0] were the strongest predictors of mortality, and PaO2 was the weakest predictor of mortality (AUC 0.81). ScvO2 <29%, VO2 >124.6 ml/min and O2ER >30.2% were identified as predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: ScvO2, VO2 and O2ER are good predictors of mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Oliynyk, Oleksandr V; Rorat, Marta; Barg, Wojciech",Int J Infect Dis,,562
248843,The role of social media in public crisis governance,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged the need for computer-aided diagnosis with automatic, accurate, and fast algorithms. Recent studies have applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray (CXR) images. However, the data scarcity in these studies prevents a reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting and limits the performance of deep networks. Moreover, these networks can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia usually from healthy subjects only or occasionally, from limited pneumonia types. Thus, there is a need for a robust and accurate COVID-19 detector evaluated over a large CXR dataset. To address this need, in this study, we propose a reliable COVID-19 detection network: ReCovNet, which can discriminate COVID-19 pneumonia from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616 images including 4603 COVID-19 samples. The proposed ReCovNet achieved a detection performance with 98.57% sensitivity and 99.77% specificity.","Degerli, Aysen; Ahishali, Mete; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

249949,Spatial joint upsampling based crowd counting,2020,"Background: As COVID-19 surged in people experiencing homelessness, leaders at Boston Medical Center (BMC), New England's largest safety-net hospital, developed a program to care for them. Aim: Provide an opportunity for COVID-infected people experiencing homelessness to isolate and receive care until no longer contagious Setting: A decommissioned hospital building. Participants: COVID-infected people experiencing homelessness Program Description: Care was provided by physician volunteers and furloughed staff. Care focused on allowing isolation, managing COVID-19 symptoms, harm-reduction interventions, and addressing problems related to substance use and mental illness. Program evaluation: Among 226 patients who received care, 65% were referred from BMC. Five percent were transferred to the hospital for a complication that appeared COVID-related. There were no deaths, but 7 patients had non-fatal overdoses. Seventy-nine % had at least one diagnosis of mental illness, and 42% reported actively using at least one substance at the time of admission. Thirty % had at least one mental health diagnosis plus active substance use. Discussion: This hospital-based COVID Recuperation Unit was rapidly deployed, provided safe isolation for 226 patients over 8 weeks, treated frequent SUD and mental illness, and helped prevent the hospital's acute-care bed capacity from being overwhelmed during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Komaromy, M.; Harris, M.; Koenig, R.

263587,Cloud Security Issues and Log-based Proactive Strategy,2021,"Patients and physicians worldwide are facing tremendous health care hazards that are caused by the ongoing severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is the first approved treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a novel nucleoside analog with a broad antiviral activity spectrum among RNA viruses, including ebolavirus (EBOV) and the respiratory pathogens Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. First described in 2016, the drug was derived from an antiviral library of small molecules intended to target emerging pathogenic RNA viruses. In vivo, remdesivir showed therapeutic and prophylactic effects in animal models of EBOV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the substance failed in a clinical trial on ebolavirus disease (EVD), where it was inferior to investigational monoclonal antibodies in an interim analysis. As there was no placebo control in this study, no conclusions on its efficacy in EVD can be made. In contrast, data from a placebo-controlled trial show beneficial effects for patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir reduces the time to recovery of hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen and may have a positive impact on mortality outcomes while having a favorable safety profile. Although this is an important milestone in the fight against COVID-19, approval of this drug will not be sufficient to solve the public health issues caused by the ongoing pandemic. Further scientific efforts are needed to evaluate the full potential of nucleoside analogs as treatment or prophylaxis of viral respiratory infections and to develop effective antivirals that are orally bioavailable.","Malin, Jakob J; Suárez, Isabelle; Priesner, Vanessa; Fätkenheuer, Gerd; Rybniker, Jan",Clin. microbiol. rev,,562

The generation interval and latent period, though both are of importance in understanding the features of COVID-19 transmission, are difficult to observe, and thus they can rarely be learnt from surveillance data empirically. In this study, we develop a likelihood framework to estimate the generation interval and incubation period simultaneously by using the contact tracing data of COVID-19 cases, and infer the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion and latent period thereafter. We estimate the mean of incubation period at 6.8 days (95 %CI: 6.2, 7.5) and SD at 4.1 days (95 %CI: 3.7, 4.8), and the mean of generation interval at 6.7 days (95 %CI: 5.4, 7.6) and SD at 1.8 days (95 %CI: 0.3, 3.8). The basic reproduction number is estimated ranging from 1.9 to 3.6, and there are 49.8 % (95 %CI: 33.3, 71.5) of the secondary COVID-19 infections likely due to pre-symptomatic transmission. Using the best estimates of model parameters, we further infer the mean latent period at 3.3 days (95 %CI: 0.2, 7.9).

METHODS: A prospective cohort study of 100 SCA patients; 50 with COVID-19 (COVID group) and 50 without (non-COVID group). All patients signed written informed consent. RESULTS: The COVID group had a significantly higher VOC episode median per year; 3 (IQR,1-6) vs 2 (IQR,2-12) (P < 0.05). The need for hospitalisation was similar in both groups. The non-COVID group had more history of culture-proven infection (P = 0.05). The COVID-group had more osteonecrosis (P < 0.05), splenic sequestration, splenomegaly and hepatic crisis (P = 0.05, 0.006, 0.02; respectively) and significantly higher (P < 0.05) symptoms of fever, cough, fatigue, abdominal pain and anosmia. Mean haemoglobin, lymphocyte subset, platelets, and reticulocytes were reduced in both groups, while lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels were significantly elevated. In the COVID group, the rise in white blood cell count, reticulocyte percentage, platelets and ferritin was subdued (P < 0.05).

METHODS: We tested 594 nasopharyngeal swab samples from individuals with COVID-19 (RT-PCR cycle threshold [Ct] values &#8804; 40) or non-COVID-19 (Ct values >40) diagnoses. RT-PCR positive samples were assigned to diagnostic, screening, or monitoring groups of testing. RESULTS: With a limit of detection of 1.2 × 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/mL, Lumipulse showed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 79.9% (155/194) and negative percent agreement of 99.3% (397/400), whereas PPAs were 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25 and 92.5% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30. By three groups, Lumipulse showed PPA of 87.0% (60/69), 81.1% (43/53), or 72.2% (52/72), respectively, whereas PPA was 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25, and was 94.4, 80.0, or 100% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively. Additional testing of RT-PCR positive samples for SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA showed that, by three groups, PPA was 63.8% (44/69), 62.3% (33/53), or 33.3% (24/72), respectively.

281609,Research on Learning Design Mode and Practice in the Context of Large-scale Online Teaching,2021,"Pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 is frequently associated with alterations in oxygenation. The arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is the most clinically used variable to assess such oxygenation, since it decisively influences the oxygen transported by hemoglobin (expressed by its percentage of saturation, SaO2). However, two recent studies conducted respectively in silico and using omic techniques in red blood cells of COVID-19 patients have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could decrease the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin (which would imply that PaO2 would overestimate SaO2), and also reduce the amount of this carrier molecule. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate this hypothesis in blood samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood gases of all COVID-19 patients performed in our laboratory in two months were included, as well as those from two control groups: synchronous patients with negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (SCG) and a historical group (HCG). Both SaO2 and venous saturations (SvO2) measured by cooximetry (COX) were compared separately with those calculated using the Kelman (K), Severinghaus (SV) and Siggaard-Andersen (SA) equations in each group. RESULTS: Measured and calculated SaO2 and SvO2 were practically equivalent in all groups. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for SaO2 in COVID-19 were 0.993 for COX-K and 0.992 for both COX-SV and COX-SA; being 0.995 for SvO2 for either COX-K, COX-SV or COX-SA. Hemoglobin and ferritin were slightly higher in COVID-19 compared to SCG and HCG (hemoglobin, p < 0.001 for both; ferritin, p < 0.05 for SCG and p < 0.001 for HCG). CONCLUSION: Under clinical conditions SARS-CoV-2 does not have an appreciable influence on the affinity of oxygen for the hemoglobin, nor on the levels of this carrier molecule. Therefore, PaO2 is a good marker of blood oxygenation also in COVID-19.","Pascual-Guàrdia, Sergi; Ferrer, Antoni; Díaz, Óscar; Caguana, Antonio O; Tejedor, Elvira; Bellido-Calduch, Salomé; Rodríguez-Chiaradia, Diego A; Gea, Joaquim",,,562

In this study, the performance of a rapid serological test in a clinical setting was evaluated. Samples from 819 consecutive patients (with or without respiratory symptoms) admitted to a large Emergency Department were tested between 23 March and 21 April 2020. Patient samples were tested in a real-time PCR assay and a serological assay. In total, 148/819 patients (18.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. The serological test revealed that 70/819 patients (8.5%) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly higher in patients with respiratory symptoms lasting for >7 days than in those with respiratory symptoms lasting for 0-7 days (p < 0.001). The serological assay had an overall sensitivity of 35.1% and an overall specificity of 97.3%. A high negative predictive value (96.7%) was reported for patients without respiratory symptoms. The results confirm that rapid serological assays alone are not sufficient for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection but can be incorporated into large-scale screening programs during periods in which the virus circulation is low.","Loconsole, Daniela; Centrone, Francesca; Morcavallo, Caterina; Campanella, Silvia; Sallustio, Anna; Quarto, Michele; Procacci, Vito; Chironna, Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,562

285055,Application and Algorithm: Maximal Motif Discovery for Biological Data in a Sliding Window,2020,"During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, guidelines have been issued by international, national and local authorities to address management and the need for preparedness. Children with COVID-19 differ from adults in that they are less often and less severely affected. Additional precautions required in the management of children address their increased radiosensitivity, need for accompanying carers, and methods for dealing with children in a mixed adult-paediatric institution. In this guidance document, our aim is to define a pragmatic strategy for imaging children with an emphasis on proven or suspected COVID-19 cases. Children suspected of COVID-19 should not be imaged routinely. Imaging should be performed only when expected to alter patient management, depending on symptoms, preexisting conditions and clinical evolution. In order to prevent disease transmission, it is important to manage the inpatient caseload effectively by triaging children and carers outside the hospital, re-scheduling nonurgent elective procedures and managing symptomatic children and carers as COVID-19 positive until proven otherwise. Within the imaging department one should consider conducting portable examinations with COVID-19 machines or arranging dedicated COVID-19 paediatric imaging sessions and performing routine nasopharyngeal swab testing before imaging under general anaesthesia. Finally, regular personal hygiene, appropriate usage of personal protective equipment, awareness of which procedures are considered aerosol generating and information on how to best disinfect imaging machinery after examinations should be highlighted to all staff members.","Raissaki, Maria; Shelmerdine, Susan C; Damasio, Maria Beatrice; Toso, Seema; Kvist, Ola; Lovrenski, Jovan; Hirsch, Franz Wolfgang; Görkem, Süreyya Burcu; Paterson, Anne; Arthurs, Owen J; Rossi, Andrea; van Schuppen, Joost; Petit, Philippe; Argyropoulou, Maria I; Offiah, Amaka C; Rosendahl, Karen; Caro-Domínguez, Pablo",Pediatr Radiol,,562

293802,Discovery of Travelling Companions from Trajectories with Different Sampling Rates,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) antibody therapies, including COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), monoclonal antibodies, and hyperimmune globulin, are among the leading treatments for individuals with early COVID-19 infection. The functionality of convalescent plasma varies greatly, but the association of antibody epitope specificities with plasma functionality remains uncharacterized. We assessed antibody functionality and reactivities to peptides across the CoV2 and the 4 endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) genomes in 126 CCP donations. We found strong correlation between plasma functionality and polyclonal antibody targeting of CoV2 spike protein peptides. Antibody reactivity to many HCoV spike peptides also displayed strong correlation with plasma functionality, including pan-coronavirus cross-reactive epitopes located in a conserved region of the fusion peptide. After accounting for antibody cross-reactivity, we identified an association between greater alphacoronavirus NL63 antibody responses and development of highly neutralizing antibodies against CoV2. We also found that plasma preferentially reactive to the CoV2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD), versus the betacoronavirus HKU1 RBD, had higher neutralizing titer. Finally, we developed a 2-peptide serosignature that identifies plasma donations with high anti-spike titer, but that suffer from low neutralizing activity. These results suggest that analysis of coronavirus antibody fine specificities may be useful for selecting desired therapeutics and understanding the complex immune responses elicited by CoV2 infection.","Morgenlander, William R; Henson, Stephanie N; Monaco, Daniel R; Chen, Athena; Littlefield, Kirsten; Bloch, Evan M; Fujimura, Eric; Ruczinski, Ingo; Crowley, Andrew R; Natarajan, Harini; Butler, Savannah E; Weiner, Joshua A; Li, Mamie Z; Bonny, Tania S; Benner, Sarah E; Balagopal, Ashwin; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C; Eshleman, Susan H; Casadevall, Arturo; Redd, Andrew D; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Ackerman, Margaret E; Pekosz, Andrew; Elledge, Stephen J; Robinson, Matthew; Tobian, Aaron Ar; Larman, H Benjamin",J. clin. invest,,562

The quality assessment of studies and findings was performed by an adaptation of the STROBE statement and CERQual approach. Excluding duplicates, a total of 1598 articles were screened, of which 20 studies were included in the final analysis, pertaining to 4965 older COVID-19 patients (&#8805;60 years old). Variety in symptoms was observed, with fever, cough, dyspnea, fatigue, or sputum production being the most common. Prominent changes in laboratory findings consistently indicated lymphopenia and inflammation and in some cases organ damage. Radiological examination reveals ground glass opacities with occasional consolidations, bilaterally, with a possible peripheral tendency.

305359,New type of corona virus induced acute otitis media in adult,2020,"BACKGROUND: Multiple industries and organisations are afflicted by and respond to institutional crises daily. As surgeons, we respond to crisis frequently and individually such as with critically unwell patients or in mass casualty scenarios; but rarely, do we encounter institutional or multi-institutional crisis with multiple actors as we have seen with the COVID-19 pan-demic. Businesses, private industry and the financial sector have been in a more precar-ious position regarding crisis and consequently have developed rapid response strate-gies employing foresight to reduce risk to assets and financial liquidity. Moreover, large nationalised governmental organisations such as the military have strategies in place ow-ing to a rapidly evolving geopolitical climate with the expectation of immediate new chal-lenges either in the negotiating room or indeed the field of conflict. Despite both nation-alised and privatised healthcare systems existing, both appeared ill-prepared for the COVID-19 global crisis. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature was undertaken exploring the approach to crisis man-agement and models used in organisations exposed to institutional crises outside the field of medicine. RESULTS: There are many parallels between the organisational management of private business institutions, large military organisations and surgical organisational management in healthcare. Models from management consultancies and the armed forces were ex-plored discussed and adapted for the surgical leader providing a framework through which the surgical leader can bring about an successful response to an institutional crisis and ensure future resilience. CONCLUSION: We believe that healthcare, and surgeons (as leaders) in particular, can learn from these other organisations and industries to engage appropriate generic operational plans and contingencies in preparation for whatever further crises may arise in the future, both near and distant. As such, following a review of the literature, we have explored a number of models we believe are adaptable for the surgical community to ensure we remain a dy-namically responsive and ever prepared profession.","Pring, Edward T; Malietzis, George; Kendall, Simon W H; Jenkins, John T; Athanasiou, Thanos",Int J Surg,,562
307580,Business Aspects of the Neutral Host Model: The Immersive Video Services Case,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Emergency Department (ED) attendances with chest pain reduced during the COVID-19 lockdown. We performed a service evaluation project in NHS Lothian to explore how and why the COVID-19 pandemic and public health advice had affected chest pain presentations and help-seeking behaviour at an individual patient level using a qualitative interview approach. METHODS: We carried out 28 semi-structured telephone interviews with a convenience sample of patients who presented with chest pain during lockdown and in patients with known coronary heart disease under the outpatient care of a cardiologist in April and May 2020. Interviews were audio recorded and voice files listened to while making detailed notes. Salient themes and issues were documented as verbatim extracts. Interviews were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Patient interviews revealed three main themes. 1) pandemic help-seeking behaviour; describing how participants made the decision to seek professional healthcare assessment. 2) COVID-19 exposure concerns; describing how the subthemes of perceived vulnerability, wishing to protect others and adding pressure to the health service shaped their decision making for an episode of acute chest pain. 3) hospital experience; describing the difference between the imagined and actual experience in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative interviews revealed how the pandemic shaped help-seeking practices, how patients interpreted their personal vulnerability to the virus, and described patient experience of attending hospital for assessment during this time. As patient numbers presenting to hospital appeared to mirror public health messaging, dynamic monitoring of this messaging should evaluate public response to healthcare campaigns to ensure the net impact on health, pandemic and non-pandemic related, is optimised.","Ferry, Amy V; Keanie, Collette; Denvir, Martin A; Mills, Nicholas L; Strachan, Fiona E",PLoS One,,562

Clinical validation for diagnostic accuracy and consistency, as well as patient acceptability, is crucial to evaluate the swab's performance. Objective: To determine the accuracy and acceptability of the 3DP swab for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Design, Setting, and Participants: A diagnostic study was conducted from May to July 2020 at 2 tertiary care centers in Singapore with different reference swabs (FLOQSwab [COPAN Diagnostics] or Dacron swab [Deltalab]) and swab processing techniques (wet or dry) to evaluate the performance of the 3DP swab compared with traditional, standard-of-care nasopharyngeal swabs used in health care institutions. The participants were patients with COVID-19 in the first 2 weeks of illness and controls with acute respiratory illness with negative test results for SARS-CoV-2. Paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from the same nostril and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The sequence of swabs was randomized based on odd and even participant numbers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measures were overall agreement (OA), positive percentage agreement (PPA), and negative percentage agreement of the 3DP swab compared with reference swabs. Secondary outcome measures were the correlation of cycle threshold (Ct) values of both swabs. Results: The mean (SD) age of participants was 45.4 (13.1) years, and most participants were men (87 of 89 [97.8%]), in keeping with the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. A total of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls were recruited. Among the patients with COVID-19, the overall agreement and PPA of the 3DP swab was 91.1% and 93.5%, respectively, compared with reference swabs. The PPA was 100% for patients with COVID-19 who were tested within the first week of illness. All controls tested negative. The reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction Ct values for the ORF1ab and E-gene targets showed a strong correlation (intraclass correlations coefficient, 0.869-0.920) between the 3DP and reference swab on independent testing at each institution despite differences in sample processing. Discordant results for both gene targets were observed only at high Ct values. Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic study of 79 patients with COVID-19 and 10 controls, the 3DP swab performed accurately and consistently across health care institutions and could help mitigate strained resources in the escalating COVID-19 pandemic.","Tay, Joshua K; Cross, Gail B; Toh, Song Tar; Lee, Chun Kiat; Loh, Jerold; Lim, Zhen Yu; Ngiam, Nicholas; Chee, Jeremy; Gan, Soo Wah; Saraf, Anmol; Chow, Wai Tung Eason; Goh, Han Lee; Siow, Chor Hiang; Lian, Derrick W Q; Loh, Woei Shyang; Loh, Kwok Seng; Lim, Chwee Ming; Chua, Ying Ying; Tan, Thuan Tong; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Yan, Benedict; Ko, Karrie; Chan, Kian Sing; Oon, Lynette; Chow, Vincent T K; Wang, De Yun; Fuh, Jerry Y H; Yen, Ching-Chiuan; Wong, John E L; Allen, David M",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

316661,Anticipating trajectories of exponential growth,2021,"BACKGROUND: The magnitude and time course of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States depends on early interventions to reduce the basic reproductive number to below 1. It is imperative, then, to develop methods to actively assess where quarantine measures such as social distancing may be deficient and suppress those potential resurgence nodes as early as possible. OBJECTIVE: We ask if social media is an early indicator of public social distancing measures in the United States by investigating its correlation with the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) as compared to social mobility estimates reported from Google and Apple Maps. METHODS: In this observational study, the estimated Rt was obtained for the period between March 5 and April 5, 2020, using the EpiEstim package. Social media activity was assessed using queries of ""social distancing"" or ""#socialdistancing"" on Google Trends, Instagram, and Twitter, with social mobility assessed using Apple and Google Maps data. Cross-correlations were performed between Rt and social media activity or mobility for the United States. We used Pearson correlations and the coefficient of determination (&#961;) with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Negative correlations were found between Google search interest for ""social distancing"" and Rt in the United States (P<.001), and between search interest and state-specific Rt for 9 states with the highest COVID-19 cases (P<.001); most states experienced a delay varying between 3-8 days before reaching significance. A negative correlation was seen at a 4-day delay from the start of the Instagram hashtag ""#socialdistancing"" and at 6 days for Twitter (P<.001). Significant correlations between Rt and social media manifest earlier in time compared to social mobility measures from Google and Apple Maps, with peaks at -6 and -4 days. Meanwhile, changes in social mobility correlated best with Rt at -2 days and +1 day for workplace and grocery/pharmacy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the potential use of Google Trends, Instagram, and Twitter as epidemiological tools in the assessment of social distancing measures in the United States during the early course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their correlation and earlier rise and peak in correlative strength with Rt when compared to social mobility may provide proactive insight into whether social distancing efforts are sufficiently enacted. Whether this proves valuable in the creation of more accurate assessments of the early epidemic course is uncertain due to limitations. These limitations include the use of a biased sample that is internet literate with internet access, which may covary with socioeconomic status, education, geography, and age, and the use of subtotal social media mentions of social distancing. Future studies should focus on investigating how social media reactions change during the course of the epidemic, as well as the conversion of social media behavior to actual physical behavior.","Younis, Joseph; Freitag, Harvy; Ruthberg, Jeremy S; Romanes, Jonathan P; Nielsen, Craig; Mehta, Neil",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,562

PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from the 140 000 eligible participants of Lifelines and the Lifelines NEXT birth cohort, who are all residents of the three northern provinces of the Netherlands. Participants filled out detailed questionnaires about their physical and mental health and experiences on a weekly basis starting in late March 2020, and the cohort consists of everyone who filled in at least one questionnaire in the first 8 weeks of the project. FINDINGS TO DATE: >71 000 unique participants responded to the questionnaires at least once during the first 8 weeks, with >22 000 participants responding to seven questionnaires. Compiled questionnaire results are continuously updated and shared with the public through the Corona Barometer website. Early results included a clear signal that younger people living alone were experiencing greater levels of loneliness due to lockdown, and subsequent results showed the easing of anxiety as lockdown was eased in June 2020. FUTURE PLANS: Questionnaires were sent on a (bi)weekly basis starting in March 2020 and on a monthly basis starting July 2020, with plans for new questionnaire rounds to continue through 2020 and early 2021. Questionnaire frequency can be increased again for subsequent waves of infections. Cohort data will be used to address how the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the northern provinces of the Netherlands, which environmental and genetic risk factors predict disease susceptibility and severity and the psychological and societal impacts of the crisis. Cohort data are linked to the extensive health, lifestyle and sociodemographic data held for these participants by Lifelines, a 30-year project that started in 2006, and to data about participants held in national databases.","Mc Intyre, Katherine; Lanting, Pauline; Deelen, Patrick; Wiersma, Henry H; Vonk, Judith M; Ori, Anil P S; Jankipersadsing, Soesma A; Warmerdam, Robert; van Blokland, Irene; Boulogne, Floranne; Dijkema, Marjolein X L; Herkert, Johanna C; Claringbould, Annique; Bakker, Olivier; Lopera Maya, Esteban A; Bültmann, Ute; Zhernakova, Alexandra; Reijneveld, Sijmen A; Zijlstra, Elianne; Swertz, Morris A; Brouwer, Sandra; van Ooijen, Raun; Angelini, Viola; Dekker, Louise H; Sijtsma, Anna; Scherjon, Sicco A; Wijmenga, Cisca; Dekens, Jackie A M; Mierau, Jochen; Boezen, H Marike; Franke, Lude",BMJ Open,,562

321877,COVID-19 Detection and Prediction Using Chest X-Ray Images,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has is a global health challenge. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Recent studies have suggested that patients with hypertension and diabetes treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers have a higher risk of COVID-19 infection as these drugs could upregulate ACE2, motivating the study of ACE2 modulation by drugs in current clinical use. Here, we mined published datasets to determine the effects of hundreds of clinically approved drugs on ACE2 expression. We find that ACEIs are enriched for ACE2-upregulating drugs, while antineoplastic agents are enriched for ACE2-downregulating drugs. Vorinostat and isotretinoin are the top ACE2 up/downregulators, respectively, in cell lines. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used in treating severe acute respiratory syndrome and COVID-19, significantly upregulates ACE2 both in vitro and in vivo. Further top ACE2 regulators in vivo or in primary cells include erlotinib and bleomycin in the lung and vancomycin, cisplatin, and probenecid in the kidney. Our study provides leads for future work studying ACE2 expression modulators.","Sinha, Sanju; Cheng, Kuoyuan; Schäffer, Alejandro A; Aldape, Kenneth; Schiff, Eyal; Ruppin, Eytan",Mol Syst Biol,,562

This study aimed to examine the relationships between burnout, resilience, and self-care among marriage and family counsellors in Malaysia. A total of 96 marriage and family counsellors in Malaysia were selected by using simple random sampling technique to participate in the present study. Data were collected by using three self-report instruments to measure the burnout, resilience and self-care. The findings demonstrated significant relationships between the constructs in which burnout and resilience as well as burnout and self-care were negatively correlated. Self-care and resilience were positively correlated. Multiple regression analysis revealed that burnout could not be significantly predicted by self-care and resilience. Findings of the study implied that emphasis must be given to burnout, resilience, and self-care and among marriage and family counsellors to enhance their personal and professional development.","Jie, L.

323568,Diagnose a Disease: A Fog Assisted Disease Diagnosis Framework with Bidirectional LSTM,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus discovered in December 2019 and is currently the cause of the global COVID-19 pandemic. A critical aspect of fighting this pandemic is to obtain accurate and timely test results so that patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 can be identified and isolated to reduce the spread of the virus. Research has shown that saliva is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics because its collection is minimally invasive and can be reliably self-administered. However, little research has been conducted on saliva testing and SARS-CoV-2 self-sampling (SARS-CoV-2SS) in Sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to comparatively evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of nasal and oral samples self-collected by individuals for SARS-CoV-2 testing against a reference method involving sample collection and testing by a health care professional. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the usability of nasal self-sampling and saliva self-sampling as a sample collection method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by using failure mode and error assessment. METHODS: Participants will be recruited from the general population by using various methods, Participants will be screened progressively as they present at the clinical trial sites as well as in primary health care catchment areas in the inner city of Johannesburg, South Africa. In the event that recruitment numbers are low, we will use a mobile van to recruit participants from outlying areas of Johannesburg. We aim to enroll 250 participants into this study in approximately 6 weeks. Two sample types-a self-administered nasal swab and a self-administered saliva sample-will be collected from each participant, and a health care professional will collect a third sample by using a nasopharyngeal swab (ie, the standard reference method). RESULTS: This protocol has been approved by the University of the Witwatersrand Human Research Ethics Committee on July 31, 2020 (Protocol number EzCov003). As of May 13, 2021, 120 participants have been enrolled into the study. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2SS may offer many benefits to individuals, by allowing for initial self-identification of symptoms and collection of samples without involving third parties and potential risk of infection provided the sample can be safely processed via a collection system. The results of this study will provide preliminary data on the acceptability, feasibility, and usability of SARS-CoV-2SS among the general population for its future implementation.

However, vaccine is also expected to be a limited resource. An optimal allocation strategy, especially in countries with access inequities and a temporal separation of hot-spots might be an effective way of halting the disease spread. We approach this problem by proposing a novel pipeline VacSIM that dovetails Actor-Critic using Kronecker-Factored Trust Region (ACKTR) model into a Contextual Bandits approach for optimizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Whereas the ACKTR model suggests better actions and rewards, Contextual Bandits allow online modifications that may need to be implemented on a day-to-day basis in the real world scenario. We evaluate this framework against a naive allocation approach of distributing vaccine proportional to the incidence of COVID-19 cases in five different States across India and demonstrate up to 100,000 additional lives potentially saved and a five-fold increase in the efficacy of limiting the spread over a period of 30 days through the VacSIM approach. We also propose novel evaluation strategies including a standard compartmental model based projections and a causality preserving evaluation of our model. Finally, we contribute a new Open-AI environment meant for the vaccine distribution scenario, and open-source VacSIM for wide testing and applications across the globe.","Awasthi, Raghav; Guliani, Keerat Kaur; Bhatt, Arshita; Gill, Mehrab Singh; Nagori, Aditya; Kumaraguru, Ponnurangam; Sethi, Tavpritesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06602v1.pdf,562

Trust is often a function of constant behavior. From an AI model perspective it means given the same input the user would expect the same output, especially for correct outputs, or in other words consistently correct outputs. This paper studies a model behavior in the context of periodic retraining of deployed models where the outputs from successive generations of the models might not agree on the correct labels assigned to the same input. We formally define consistency and correct-consistency of a learning model. We prove that consistency and correct-consistency of an ensemble learner is not less than the average consistency and correct-consistency of individual learners and correct-consistency can be improved with a probability by combining learners with accuracy not less than the average accuracy of ensemble component learners. To validate the theory using three datasets and two state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers we also propose an efficient dynamic snapshot ensemble method and demonstrate its value.","Wang, Lijing; Ghosh, Dipanjan; Diaz, Maria Teresa Gonzalez; Farahat, Ahmed; Alam, Mahbubul; Gupta, Chetan; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Marathe, Madhav",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06796v1.pdf,562
329272,Trajectory planning of a 6R manipulator around obstacles by using SRRT Algorithm,2021,"Base flipping is a key biophysical event involved in recognition of various ligands by ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules. However, the mechanism of base flipping in RNA remains poorly understood, in part due to the lack of atomistic details on complex rearrangements in neighboring bases. In this work, we applied transition path sampling (TPS) methods to study base flipping in a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule that is known to interact with RNA-editing enzymes through this mechanism. We obtained an ensemble of 1000 transition trajectories to describe the base-flipping process. We used the likelihood maximization method to determine the refined reaction coordinate (RC) consisting of two collective variables (CVs), a distance and a dihedral angle between nucleotides that form stacking interactions with the flipping base. The free energy profile projected along the refined RC revealed three minima, two corresponding to the initial and final states and one for a metastable state. We suggest that the metastable state likely represents a wobbled conformation of nucleobases observed in NMR studies that is often characterized as the flipped state. The analyses of reactive trajectories further revealed that the base flipping is coupled to a global conformational change in a stem-loop of dsRNA.","Levintov, Lev; Paul, Sanjib; Vashisth, Harish",J. chem. theory comput.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate that when appropriate strategies are adopted autopsy is a safe procedure with a minimal infection risk for all subjects involved (pathologists, technical personnel, and others) when proper strategies are adopted. We performed 16 autopsies on cadavers of persons who had died with confirmed COVID-19 with different post-mortem intervals (PMI). To confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, for each autopsy, 2 swabs were sampled from lungs, while to evaluate environmental contamination, 11 swabs were taken at three different times: T0 (before autopsy), T1 (at the end of the autopsy, without removing the corpse), and T2 (after cleaning and disinfecting the autopsy room). Specifically, 2 swabs were sampled on face shields used by each pathologist, and 4 swabs were collected on the autopsy table; 4 swabs were also collected from walls and 1 from floor. Lung swabs confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all cases. Environmental swabs, collected at T0 and T2 were all negative, while swabs sampled at T1 were shown to be positive. Interestingly, no association was shown between PMI length and environmental contamination. Infection control strategies for safe management of clinical forensic autopsies of bodies with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are also described.","Pomara, Cristoforo; Salerno, Monica; Sessa, Francesco; Esposito, Massimiliano; Barchitta, Martina; Ledda, Caterina; Grassi, Patrizia; Liberto, Aldo; Mattaliano, Anna Rita; Rapisarda, Venerando; Ferrante, Margherita; Agodi, Antonella",Diagnostics (Basel),,562

However, data regarding natriuretic peptides are scarce. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reflects haemodynamic stress and has proven useful for risk stratification in heart failure (HF) and other conditions such as pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. We aimed to adequately characterize NT-proBNP concentrations using a large cohort of patients with COVID-19, and to investigate its association with prognosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and available NT-proBNP determinations, from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied. Of 3080 screened patients, a total of 396 (mean age 71.8 ± 14.6 years, 61.1% male) fulfilled all the selection criteria and were finally included, with a median follow-up of 53 (18-62) days. Of those, 192 (48.5%) presented NT-proBNP levels above the recommended cut-off for the identification of HF. However, only 47 fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HF. Patients with higher NT-proBNP during admission experienced more frequent bleeding, arrhythmias and HF decompensations. NT-proBNP was associated with mortality both in the whole study population and after excluding patients with HF. A multivariable Cox model confirmed that NT-proBNP was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for all relevant confounders (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.44, per logarithmic unit). CONCLUSION: NT-proBNP is frequently elevated in COVID-19. It is strongly and independently associated with mortality after adjusting for relevant confounders, including chronic HF and acute HF. Therefore, its use may improve early prognostic stratification in this condition.","Caro-Codón, Juan; Rey, Juan R; Buño, Antonio; Iniesta, Angel M; Rosillo, Sandra O; Castrejon-Castrejon, Sergio; Rodriguez-Sotelo, Laura; Martinez, Luis A; Marco, Irene; Merino, Carlos; Martin-Polo, Lorena; Garcia-Veas, Jose M; Martinez-Cossiani, Marcel; Gonzalez-Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; López-de-Sa, Esteban; Merino, Jose L",Eur. j. heart fail,,562

340145,Real-time prediction of online shoppers’ purchasing intention using random forest,2020,"The WHO declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic in early 2020. As the pandemic has continued to evolve over a period of several months, many cases of unusual presentations are now emerging, which pose a greater challenge for physicians in terms of quickly identifying COVID-19 patients based on initial signs and symptoms. In this report, we present one such unusual presentation in a patient with sudden intraperitoneal hemorrhage and spontaneous splenic rupture with COVID-19 as the likely etiology and contributing factor. The patient was a 75-year-old Caucasian woman who presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of severe left-sided abdominal pain for several days without any preceding trauma. A CT of the abdomen/pelvis revealed a large amount of fluid in the abdomen, which raised suspicion of bleeding. An exploratory laparotomy revealed splenic rupture with hemoperitoneum, and the patient subsequently underwent an emergent splenectomy. The patient's COVID-19 antigen test returned positive during the surgery and was subsequently confirmed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. COVID-19 has been found to result primarily in respiratory symptoms through its ability to invade endothelial cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 affinity. It is speculated that this mechanism may cause a predisposition to micro-thromboses, which can eventually lead to manifestations such as large lymphoid organ thrombosis. Based on this case presentation and the evolving literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spontaneous splenic rupture is an emergent differential diagnosis that should be considered in COVID-19 patients presenting with gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain and nausea.","Knefati, M.; Ganim, I.; Schmidt, J.; Makkar, A.; Igtiben, S.; Landa, E.; Tarawneh, A.; Hicks, C.; Zimmerman, S.; Sukpraprut-Braaten, S.",Cureus,,562

We aimed to determine whether CP is associated with better clinical outcome among these patients. (2) Methods: A retrospective single-center study including adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The primary outcome was time to clinical improvement, within 28 days, defined as patient discharged alive or reduction of 2 points on a 6-point disease severity scale. (3) Results: Overall, 110 COVID-19 patients were admitted. Thirty-two patients (29%) received CP;among them, 62.5% received at least one CP with high neutralizing antibody titers (≥1:160). Clinical improvement occurred within 28 days in 14 patients (43.7%) of the CP group vs. 48 patients (61.5%) in the non-CP group (hazard ratio (HR): 0.75 (95% CI: 0.41–1.37), p = 0.35). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, CP was not independently associated with time to clinical improvement (HR: 0.53 (95% CI: 0.23–1.22), p = 0.14). Additionally, the average treatment effects of CP, calculated using the inverse probability weights (IPW), was not associated with the primary outcome (−0.14 days (95% CI: −3.19–2.91 days), p = 0.93). Hospital mortality did not differ between CP and non-CP groups (31.2% vs. 19.2%, p = 0.17, respectively). Comparing CP with high neutralizing antibody titers to the other group yielded the same findings.

(Themed issue on drinking water oxidation and disinfection processes.),2020,"With the increase in the number of users on social networks, sentiment analysis has been gaining attention. Sentiment analysis establishes the aggregation of these opinions to inform researchers about attitudes towards products or topics. Social network data commonly contain authors’ opinions about specific subjects, such as people’s opinions towards steps taken to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Usually, people use dialectal language in their posts on social networks. Dialectal language has obstacles that make opinion analysis a challenging process compared to working with standard language. For the Arabic language, Modern Standard Arabic tools (MSA) cannot be employed with social network data that contain dialectal language. Another challenge of the dialectal Arabic language is the polarity of opinionated words affected by inverters, such as negation, that tend to change the word’s polarity from positive to negative and vice versa. This work analyzes the effect of inverters on sentiment analysis of social network dialectal Arabic posts. It discusses the different reasons that hinder the trivial resolution of inverters. An experiment is conducted on a corpus of data collected from Facebook. However, the same work can be applied to other social network posts. The results show the impact that resolution of negation may have on the classification accuracy. The results show that the F1 score increases by 20% if negation is treated in the text. © 2021 by the authors.

Even though the SE is considered a disruptive phenomenon, especially in the accommodation and transport sectors, the Covid-19 has raised concerns about its survivability. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, the value of SE firms has dropped, and many service providers have no other option but to stop working. Understanding the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the SE sector is therefore essential. The objective of this study is therefore to examine the effect of the Covid-19 on sharing economy activities. We have used various publications-such as news articles, TV news items, YouTube videos, and blog posts-as data sources for this study purpose. Through content analysis, the study shows how the SE phenomenon is coping with the changing environment caused by the Covid-19. We analyzed the SE sector mainly from the perspective of four stakeholders: SE firms, service providers, service receivers (customers), and regulatory bodies.

347423,Research on the method of improving community governance capability based on block-chain technology,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to describe the distribution of excess mortality (EM) during the first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Stockholm Region, Sweden, according to age, sex and sociodemographic context. METHODS: Weekly all-cause mortality data were obtained from Statistics Sweden for the period 1 January 2015 to 17 May 2020. EM during the first 20 weeks of 2020 was estimated by comparing observed mortality rates with expected mortality rates during the five previous years (N=2 379 792). EM variation by socioeconomic status (tertiles of income, education, Swedish-born, gainful employment) and age distribution (share of 70+-year-old persons) was explored based on Demographic Statistics Area (DeSO) data. RESULTS: EM was first detected during the week of 23-29 March 2020. During the peak week of the epidemic (6-12 April 2020), an EM of 150% was observed (152% in 80+-year-old women; 183% in 80+-year-old men). During the same week, the highest EM was observed for DeSOs with lowest income (171%), lowest education (162%), lowest share of Swedish-born (178%) and lowest share of gainfully employed residents (174%). EM was further increased in areas with higher versus lower proportion of younger people (magnitude of increase: 1.2-1.7 times depending on socioeconomic measure). CONCLUSION: Living in areas characterised by lower socioeconomic status and younger populations was linked to excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Stockholm Region. These conditions might have facilitated viral spread. Our findings highlight the well-documented vulnerability linked to increasing age and sociodemographic context for COVID-19-related death.","Calderón-Larrañaga, Amaia; Vetrano, Davide L; Rizzuto, Debora; Bellander, Tom; Fratiglioni, Laura; Dekhtyar, Serhiy",,,562

349542,"Using FLOSS for Storing, Processing and Linking Corpus Data",2020,"Most of the ongoing projects aimed at the development of specific therapies and vaccines against COVID-19 use the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as the main target [1-3]. The binding of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2) of the host cell constitutes the first and key step for virus entry. During this process, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein plays an essential role, since it contains the receptor binding motif (RBM), responsible for the docking to the receptor. So far, mostly biochemical methods are being tested in order to prevent binding of the virus to ACE2 [4]. Here we show, with the help of atomistic simulations, that external electric fields of easily achievable and moderate strengths can dramatically destabilise the S protein, inducing long-lasting structural damage. One striking field-induced conformational change occurs at the level of the recognition loop L3 of the RBD where two parallel beta sheets, believed to be responsible for a high affinity to ACE2 [5], undergo a change into an unstructured coil, which exhibits almost no binding possibilities to the ACE2 receptor (Figure 1a). Remarkably, while the structural flexibility of S allows the virus to improve its probability of entering the cell, it is also the origin of the surprising vulnerability of S upon application of electric fields of strengths at least two orders of magnitude smaller than those required for damaging most proteins. Our findings suggest the existence of a clean physical method to weaken the SARS-CoV-2 virus without further biochemical processing. Moreover, the effect could be used for infection prevention purposes and also to develop technologies for in-vitro structural manipulation of S. Since the method is largely unspecific, it can be suitable for application to mutations in S, to other proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and in general to membrane proteins of other virus types.","Arbeitman, Claudia R.; Rojas, Pablo; Ojeda-May, Pedro; Garcia, Martin E.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12733v1.pdf,562

350625,Medical Telerobotic: IRAPs SHaRE-aGIVeR,2021,"BACKGROUND: Quantitative evaluation of renal cortical echogenicity (RCE) has been tried and developed in human and veterinary medicine. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to propose a method for evaluating RCE quantitatively and intuitively, and to determine associations between ultrasonographic renal structural distinction and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in canine chronic kidney disease (CKD). METHODS: Data were collected on 63 dogs, including 27 with normal kidney function and 36 CKD patients. Symmetric dimethylarginine and creatinine concentrations were measured for calculating eGFR. RCE was evaluated as 3 grades on ultrasonography images according to the distinction between the renal cortex and outer medulla. The RCE grade of each kidney was measured. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in eGFR between the group normal and CKD (p < 0.001). As mean of RCE grades (the mean values of each right and left kidney's RCE grade) increases, the proportion of group CKD among the patients in each grade increases (p < 0.001). Also, severity of RCE (classified as ""high"" if any right or left kidney evaluated as RCE grade 3, ""low"" otherwise) and eGFR is good indicator for predicting group CKD (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The degree of distinction between the renal cortex and the outer medulla is closely related to renal function including eGFR and the RCE grade defined in this study can be used as a method of objectively evaluating RCE.","Lee, Siheon; Hong, Sungkyun; Kim, Seungji; Oh, Dayoung; Choen, Sangkyung; Choi, Mincheol; Yoon, Junghee",J Vet Sci,,562
351351,Covid Economic Policy and Media Response: An Analysis of Culture and Media Content,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication and host immune response determine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but studies evaluating viral evasion of immune response are lacking. Here, we use unbiased screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type I interferon (IFN-I) response. We found three proteins that antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) binds TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) to suppress interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation, nsp13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation, and open reading frame 6 (ORF6) binds importin Karyopherin &#945; 2 (KPNA2) to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. We identify two sets of viral proteins that antagonize IFN-I signaling through blocking signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)/STAT2 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and nsp6 suppress IFN-I signaling more efficiently than SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Thus, when treated with IFN-I, a SARS-CoV-2 replicon replicates to a higher level than chimeric replicons containing nsp1 or nsp6 from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Altogether, the study provides insights on SARS-CoV-2 evasion of IFN-I response and its potential impact on viral transmission and pathogenesis.","Xia, Hongjie; Cao, Zengguo; Xie, Xuping; Zhang, Xianwen; Chen, John Yun-Chung; Wang, Hualei; Menachery, Vineet D; Rajsbaum, Ricardo; Shi, Pei-Yong",Cell Rep,,562
359562,Intelligent Mask Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques,2021,"Irish Travellers and Roma are two ethnic minorities experiencing high levels of health inequities. These communities are at greater risk of developing COVID-19 and of suffering more severe symptoms due to poor living environments and higher rates of comorbidities. This study explores the strategies adopted by community-health partnerships and NGOs to minimise the potential widening of Travellers' and Roma's health inequities during the initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. A descriptive qualitative approach was employed to provide a detailed account of three different community and partnership-led responses. Data were gathered from multiple sources and through first-hand participation in the COVID-19 responses. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. This study found that the main pandemic mitigation interventions implemented were public health measures, culturally sensitive communications, lobbying for policy change and economic and social support. These interventions, supported by the health promotion strategies of partnership, advocacy and empowerment, have proven to be extremely important to reduce potential inequities in exposure to the virus and in access to healthcare. The findings suggest that community-health partnerships between minority groups' organizations and healthcare professionals represent a viable approach to mitigate the disproportionate effects of a pandemic on Travellers and Roma.","Villani, Jacopo; Daly, Petra; Fay, Ronnie; Kavanagh, Lynsey; McDonagh, Sandra; Amin, Nurul",Glob Health Promot,,562

362539,AI-enabled Microscopic Blood Analysis for Microfluidic COVID-19 Hematology,2020,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread globally since being identified as a public health emergency of major international concern and has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In December 2019, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, known as COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. The newly identified zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Many cancer patients frequently visit the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance. They may be immunocompromised due to the underlying malignancy or anticancer therapy and are at higher risk of developing infections. Several factors increase the risk of infection, and cancer patients commonly have multiple risk factors. Cancer patients appear to have an estimated twofold increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 than the general population. With the WHO declaring the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, there is an urgent need to address the impact of such a pandemic on cancer patients. This include changes to resource allocation, clinical care, and the consent process during a pandemic. Currently and due to limited data, there are no international guidelines to address the management of cancer patients in any infectious pandemic. In this review, the potential challenges associated with managing cancer patients during the COVID-19 infection pandemic will be addressed, with suggestions of some practical approaches. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The main management strategies for treating cancer patients during the COVID-19 epidemic include clear communication and education about hand hygiene, infection control measures, high-risk exposure, and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Consideration of risk and benefit for active intervention in the cancer population must be individualized. Postponing elective surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy for cancer patients with low risk of progression should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Minimizing outpatient visits can help to mitigate exposure and possible further transmission. Telemedicine may be used to support patients to minimize number of visits and risk of exposure. More research is needed to better understand SARS-CoV-2 virology and epidemiology.","Al-Shamsi, Humaid O; Alhazzani, Waleed; Alhuraiji, Ahmad; Coomes, Eric A; Chemaly, Roy F; Almuhanna, Meshari; Wolff, Robert A; Ibrahim, Nuhad K; Chua, Melvin L K; Hotte, Sebastien J; Meyers, Brandon M; Elfiki, Tarek; Curigliano, Giuseppe; Eng, Cathy; Grothey, Axel; Xie, Conghua",Oncologist,,562

However, clinical features, outcomes, and predictors of mortality in SOT recipients are not well-described. METHODS: We performed a multi-center cohort study of SOT recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected using standardized intake and 28-day follow-up electronic case report forms. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for the primary endpoint, 28-day mortality, among hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-two SOT recipients from >50 transplant centers were included: 318 (66%) kidney or kidney/pancreas, 73 (15.1%) liver, 57 (11.8%) heart, and 30 (6.2%) lung. Median age was 58 (IQR 46-57), median time post-transplant was 5 years (IQR 2-10), 61% were male, and 92% had &#8805;1 underlying comorbidity.

371735,A comparative study of online teaching modes in Higher Vocational Colleges based on network questionnaire survey and SPSS analysis,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic placed an unprecedented demand on health systems to rapidly shift ambulatory in-person care to virtual care. Geriatric patients face more challenges with video visit access compared to younger patients due to discomfort with technology and less access to devices and internet. Medical students at the University of Michigan created an initiative to improve access to and comfort with video visits for geriatric patients. The program's goals were to (a) explore options for the delivery of personalized training to older adults, (b) create materials for volunteers to successfully navigate conversations with patients and caregivers, (c) provide patients one-to-one remote guidance while identifying and overcoming barriers-with practice sessions to increase comfort, (d) share with the larger health system, and (e) ensure program sustainability. Over a 10-week evaluation period, providers whose patients worked with our geriatric education on telehealth access volunteers had a video visit rate of 43% compared to 19.2% prior to participation in the program (adjusted odds ratio = 3.38, 95% confidence interval = 2.49, 4.59), ultimately providing a platform for geriatric patients to foster stronger connections with their providers, while increasing Michigan Medicine's overall proportion of video telehealth visits.","Pichan, Cayla M; Anderson, Clare E; Min, Lillian C; Blazek, Mary C",J Telemed Telecare,,562

METHODS: The training cohort included consecutive COVID-19 patients at the First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District in Wuhan, China, from 7 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. We selected baseline data through the stepwise Akaike information criterion and ensemble XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) model to build mortality-prediction models. We then validated these models by randomly collected COVID-19 patients in Union Hospital, Wuhan, from 1 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. RESULTS: A total of 296 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in the training cohort; 19 died during hospitalization and 277 discharged from the hospital. The clinical model developed using age, history of hypertension, and coronary heart disease showed area under the curve (AUC), 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], .80-.95); threshold, -2.6551; sensitivity, 92.31%; specificity, 77.44%; and negative predictive value (NPV), 99.34%. The laboratory model developed using age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, neutrophil and lymphocyte count, d-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase, and glomerular filtration rate had a significantly stronger discriminatory power than the clinical model (P = .0157), with AUC, 0.98 (95% CI, .92-.99); threshold, -2.998; sensitivity, 100.00%; specificity, 92.82%; and NPV, 100.00%. In the subsequent validation cohort (N = 44), the AUC (95% CI) was 0.83 (.68-.93) and 0.88 (.75-.96) for the clinical model and laboratory model, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We developed 2 predictive models for the in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan that were validated in patients from another center.","Wang, Kun; Zuo, Peiyuan; Liu, Yuwei; Zhang, Meng; Zhao, Xiaofang; Xie, Songpu; Zhang, Hao; Chen, Xinglin; Liu, Chengyun",Clin Infect Dis,,562

Primary care's response to the novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is arguably the most impactful natural experiment in our lifetime. EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF COVID-19: We briefly describe the OCHIN PBRN of community health centers (CHCs), its partnership with implementation scientists, and how we are leveraging this infrastructure and expertise to create a rapid research response evaluating how CHCs across the country responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 RESEARCH ROADMAP: Our research agenda focuses on asking: How has care delivery in CHCs changed due to COVID-19? What impact has COVID-19 had on the delivery of preventive services in CHCs? Which PBRN services (e.g., data surveillance, training, evidence synthesis) are most impactful to real-world practices? What decision-making strategies were used in the PBRN and its practices to make real-time changes in response to the pandemic? What critical factors in successfully and sustainably transforming primary care are illuminated by pandemic-driven changes? DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: PBRNs enable real-world evaluation of practice change and natural experiments, and thus are ideal laboratories for implementation science research. We present a real-time example of how a PBRN Implementation Laboratory activated a response to study a historic natural experiment, to help other PBRNs charting a course through this pandemic.","DeVoe, Jennifer E; Likumahuwa-Ackman, Sonja M; Angier, Heather E; Huguet, Nathalie; Cohen, Deborah J; Flocke, Susan A; Marino, Miguel; Gold, Rachel",J Am Board Fam Med,,562

393306,A Social Distance Monitoring System to ensure Social Distancing in Public Areas,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an inactivated and aluminium hydroxide adsorbed SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Sinovac, China) in voluntary participants after 14 days of the second dose against RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases. The secondary objectives include evaluating the efficacy after at least one dose of the vaccine against RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 cases; the efficacy of two doses of the vaccine on the rates of hospitalization and death; the safety of the vaccine including adverse reactions up to one year after the 2nd dose of vaccination; and the immunogenicity of the vaccine and its duration up to 120 days. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled case driven clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. The study is planned to be carried out within two separate cohorts in voluntary participants aged between 18-59 years old. The first cohort includes healthcare professionals actively working in healthcare units, who are assumed to have higher risk of acquiring COVID-19, and the second cohort includes other immunocompetent subjects in the same age group, who are at a regular risk for COVID-19 disease. In Cohort 1, healthcare professionals will be randomized to receive two intramuscular doses of investigational product or the placebo in a 1:1 ratio and they will be monitored for 12 months by active surveillance of COVID-19. In Cohort 2, immunocompetent subjects will be randomized to receive vaccine or the placebo in a 2:1 ratio. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals of both genders, including medical doctors, nurses, cleaners, hospital technicians, and administrative personnel who work in any department of a healthcare unit and immunocompetent individuals of both genders are included. Pregnant (confirmed by positive beta-hCG test) and breastfeeding women as well as those intending to become pregnant within three months after vaccination are excluded. Other exclusion criteria include history of COVID-19 test positivity (PCR or immunoglobulin test results), any form of immunosuppressive therapy including corticosteroids within 6 months, history of bleeding disorders, asplenia, and administration of any form of immunoglobulins or blood products within 3 months. Exclusion criteria for the second dose include any serious adverse events related with the vaccine, anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity after vaccination, or any confirmed or suspected autoimmune or immunosuppressive disease (including HIV infection). Participants are only included after signing the voluntary informed consent form, ensuring cooperation in visits, undergoing screening for evaluation, and conforming to all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All clinical sites are located in Turkey. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The vaccine was manufactured by Sinovac Research & Development Co., Ltd. It is a preparation made from a novel coronavirus (strain CZ02) grown in the kidney cell cultures (Vero Cell) of the African green monkey and contains inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride. A dose of 0.5 mL contains 600 SU of SARS-CoV-2 virus antigen. The placebo contains aluminium hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium chloride (0.5mL/dose). Scheduled visits and additional unscheduled weekly visits will be performed for the first 13 weeks and neutralizing antibody test, IgG test, T-Cell activation test, pregnancy test, and RT-PCR tests along with total antibody test will be performed. Adverse events and serious adverse events during the follow-up will be recorded on diary cards. Diary cards will collect information on the timing and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and solicited adverse events recorded by the subjects during one-year follow-up period. All serious adverse events will be managed and necessary treatment will be ensured according to the local regulations. All serious adverse events following vaccination will be reported to the ethics committee, the Ministry of Health, and the study sponsor within 24 hours of detection. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary efficacy endpoint is the incidence of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 disease confirmed by RT-PCR two weeks after the second dose of vaccination. Secondary efficacy endpoints are the incidence of hospitalization/mortality rates among one or two dose regimens, duration of immunogenicity rates up to 120 days, the seroconversion rate, the seropositivity rate, neutralizing antibody titer, and IgG levels 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary safety endpoint is the severity and frequency of local and systemic adverse reactions during the period of one week after vaccination. The study would be terminated if more than 15% of the subjects have grade &#8805;3 adverse events related to vaccination including local reactions. RANDOMISATION: Eligible subjects will be randomized at their Study Day 0 to two study groups using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS; developed by Omega CRO, Ankara, Turkey) in both risk groups. The IWRS system customizes the randomization algorithm. After enrolment in the study, each participant will be randomly assigned to either of the two treatment arms at a ratio of 1:1 in the high-risk group and at a ratio of 2:1 in the normal risk group. Each enrolled participant will be assigned to a code and will receive the treatment labelled with the code. BLINDING (MASKING): The trial is a double-blind study to avoid introducing bias. The blinding may be broken by the investigator in the event of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of the study vaccine is critical for management of the subject's immediate treatment. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board is to be contacted in case of breaking the blinding for a study object. The blood samples will be taken from both placebo and vaccinated groups, in order not to break the blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The study is planned to be carried out with two separate cohorts. The Cohort 1 includes healthcare professionals working in healthcare units and the Cohort 2 consists of immunocompetent subjects having normal risk for COVID-19 disease. The Cohort 2 will be initiated after the evaluation of the interim safety report of the Cohort 1 by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Both cohorts will be followed-up via RT-PCR to confirm symptomatic COVID-19 cases. If the clinical efficacy of the vaccine is shown in the Cohort 1 or 2, the subjects randomized into the placebo arm will also be vaccinated. In the Cohort 1, 588 subjects should be included in both arms with the assumption that the risk of infection with COVID-19 will be 5% for the placebo arm and 2% for the vaccine arm in the high-risk group. Considering 10% of drop-out rate and 5% of seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline, 680 subjects should be screened at both arms of the Cohort 1. Group sample sizes of 7545 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and 3773 placebo suits at a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in population proportions with a width equal to 1.0%, when the estimated incidence rate for vaccinated group is 1.0% and the estimated incidence rate for placebo group is 2.0%. Drop-out rate is assumed to be 10% and seropositivity or PCR positivity at baseline is assumed to be 5%; accordingly, 13000 participants are needed to be enrolled totally in both cohorts. The remaining 11640 subjects will be screened in the Cohort 2 and eligible subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 6.0 - 15 October 2020. Recruitment started on 15.09.2020 and is expected to end on February 2022. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04582344 .

METHODS: A total of 100 and 105 serum separately from non-infected populations and COVID-19 patients were detected with SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG kits. The characteristics including precision, functional sensitivity, linearity, and accuracy were evaluated for Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi CLIA kits. RESULTS: Maglumi and iFlash had the best analytical sensitivity for IgM and IgG, respectively. Axceed kits had a linearity response in the detected concentration. The clinical sensitivity of Axceed, iFlash, and Maglumi was 68.0%, 64.9%, and 63.9% with a specificity of 99.0%, 96.0%, and 100% for IgM, 85.6%, 97.9%, and 94.8% with a specificity of 97.0% for IgG. ROC analysis indicated all kits had a diagnostic power greater than 0.9. Notably, either IgM or IgG kits obtained a poor agreement (Kappa value from 0.397 to 0.713) with others. Among 38 recovered patients, 94.7% had an effective immune response, and both seropositive IgM and IgG accounted for the biggest proportion (medium, 42 days onset), then followed by the single seropositive IgG (medium, 50 days onset) in Ab profile. CONCLUSION: The performance of CLIA kits satisfied the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both positive of IgG and IgM contributes to improve the specificity, and a positive one will enhance the sensitivity.","Dou, Xiaowen; Wang, Enyun; Hu, Jiwen; Zong, Zengyan; Jiang, Ruiwei; Wang, Mengmeng; Kan, Lijuan; Zhang, Xiuming",J Clin Lab Anal,,562

394710,Sustainability of Teredo navalis L and Environmental Management Strategies in the Pandemic Era COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Venezuela and Colombia both adopted measures of containment early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Venezuela's ongoing humanitarian crisis has decimated its health care system, and forced millions of Venezuelans to flee through its porous border with Colombia. The extensive shared border, and illegal cross-border transit through improvised trails between the two countries are major challenges for public health authorities. We report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela, and present a snapshot of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic landscape in the Colombian-Venezuelan border region. METHODS: We sequenced and assembled viral genomes from total RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal (NP) clinical specimens using a custom reference-based analysis pipeline. Three assemblies obtained were subjected to typing using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages 'Pangolin' tool. A total of 376 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South America were obtained from the GISAID database to perform comparative genomic analyses. Additionally, the Wuhan-1 strain was used as reference. RESULTS: We found that two of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Venezuela belonged to the B1 lineage, and the third to the B.1.13 lineage. We observed a point mutation in the Spike protein gene (D614G substitution), previously reported to be associated with increased infectivity, in all three Venezuelan genomes. Additionally, three mutations (R203K/G204R substitution) were present in the nucleocapsid (N) gene of one Venezuelan genome. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic sequencing demonstrates similarity between SARS-CoV-2 lineages from Venezuela and viruses collected from patients in bordering areas in Colombia and from Brazil, consistent with cross-border transit despite administrative measures including lockdowns. The presence of mutations associated with increased infectivity in the 3 Venezuelan genomes we report and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes from neighboring borders areas may pose additional challenges for control of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the complex epidemiological landscape in Latin American countries. Public health authorities should carefully follow the progress of the pandemic and its impact on displaced populations within the region.","Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Muñoz, Marina; Florez, Carolina; Gomez, Sergio; Rico, Angelica; Pardo, Lisseth; Barros, Esther C; Hernández, Carolina; Delgado, Lourdes; Jaimes, Jesús E; Pérez, Luis; Teherán, Aníbal A; Alshammary, Hala Alejel; Obla, Ajay; Khan, Zenab; Dutta, Jayeeta; van de Guchte, Adriana; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S; Hernandez, Matthew M; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Simon, Viviana; van Bakel, Harm; Llewellyn, Martin S; Ramírez, Juan David",Infect Genet Evol,,562
395111,Augmented reality-based student’s worksheets on algebra word problems,2021,"BACKGROUND: As the world continues to advance technologically, social media (SM) is becoming an essential part of billions of people's lives worldwide and is affecting almost every industry imaginable. As the world is becoming more digitally oriented, the health care industry is increasingly visualizing SM as an important channel for health care promotion, employment, recruiting new patients, marketing for health care providers (HCPs), building a better brand name, etc. HCPs are bound to ethical principles toward their colleagues, patients, and the public in the digital world as much as in the real world. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to shed light on SM use worldwide and to discuss how it has been used as an essential tool in the health care industry from the perspective of HCPs. METHODS: A literature review was conducted between March and April 2020 using MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science for all English-language medical studies that were published since 2007 and discussed SM use in any form for health care. Studies that were not in English, whose full text was not accessible, or that investigated patients' perspectives were excluded from this part, as were reviews pertaining to ethical and legal considerations in SM use. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 83 studies. More studies were included from article references, and a total of 158 studies were reviewed. SM uses were best categorized as health promotion, career development or practice promotion, recruitment, professional networking or destressing, medical education, telemedicine, scientific research, influencing health behavior, and public health care issues. CONCLUSIONS: Multidimensional health care, including the pairing of health care with SM and other forms of communication, has been shown to be very successful. Striking the right balance between digital and traditional health care is important.","Farsi, Deema",J Med Internet Res,,562

For many of them, postponing or replacing their surgical treatments is not recommended. During this pandemic, surgeons must discuss the risks and benefits of treatment, and patients should sign a specific comprehensive Informed consent (IC). OBJECTIVES: To report an IC and an algorithm developed for oncologic surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We developed an IC and a process flowchart containing a preoperative symptoms questionnaire and a PCR SARS-CoV-2 test and described all perioperative steps of this program. RESULTS: Patients with negative questionnaires and tests go to surgery, those with positive ones must wait 21 days and undergo a second test before surgery is scheduled. The IC focused both on risks and benefits inherent each surgery and on the risks of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infections or related complications. Also, the IC discusses the possibility of sudden replacement of medical staff member(s) due to the pandemic; the possibility of unexpected complications demanding emergency procedures that cannot be specifically discussed in advance is addressed. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic, specific tools must be developed to ensure safe experiences for surgical patients and prevent them from having misunderstandings concerning their care.","de Cássio Zequi, Stênio; Franca Silva, Ivan Leonardo Avelino; Duprat, João Pedreira; Coimbra, Felipe José Fernandez; Gross, Jefferson L; Vartanian, Jose Guilherme; Makdissi, Fabiana Baroni Alves; Leite, Fernanda Perez M; Costa, Walter Henriques da; Yazbek, Guilherme; Joaquim, Eduardo Henrique Giroud; Bussolotti, Raquel Marcondes; Caruso, Pedro; de Ávila Lima, Marcon Censoni; Nakagawa, Suely Akiko; Aguiar, Samuel; Baiocchi, Glauco; Lopes, Ademar; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo",J Surg Oncol,,562

The aim of this study was to assess eating habits and lifestyle behaviors among residents of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region during the lockdown. A cross-sectional study among adult residents of the MENA region was conducted using an online questionnaire designed on Google Forms during April 2020. A total of 2970 participants from 18 countries participated in the current study. During the pandemic, over 30% reported weight gain, 6.2% consumed five or more meals per day compared to 2.2% before the pandemic (p<0.001), and 48.8% did not consume fruits on daily basis. Moreover, 39.1% did not engage in physical activity, over 35% spent more than five hours per day on screens. A significant association between the frequency of training during the pandemic and the reported change in weight was found (p < 0.001). A significantly higher percentage of participants reported physical and emotional exhaustion, irritability, and tension either all the time or a large part of the time during the pandemic (p < 0.001). Although a high percentage of participants reported sleeping more hours per night during the pandemic, 63% had sleep disturbances. The study highlights that the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused a variety of lifestyle changes, physical inactivity, and psychological problems among adults in the MENA region.","Cheikh Ismail, Leila; Osaili, Tareq M; Mohamad, Maysm N; Al Marzouqi, Amina; Jarrar, Amjad H; Zampelas, Antonis; Habib-Mourad, Carla; Abu Jamous, Dima Omar; Ali, Habiba I; Al Sabbah, Haleama; Hasan, Hayder; AlMarzooqi, Latifa Mohammed Rashid; Stojanovska, Lily; Hashim, Mona; Obaid, Reyad R Shaker; Elfeky, Samar; Saleh, Sheima T; Shawar, Zahieh A M; Al Dhaheri, Ayesha S",Br J Nutr,,562
410115,A Physiotheraphy Coaching System based on Kinect Sensor,2020,"Transitioning the care of a patient from a hospital to a skilled nursing facility (SNF) is critical and often risky. Poor care transitions can result in delays, medication mistakes, incomplete follow-up care, and adverse health outcomes. Ensuring a smooth and effective care transition is the goal for providers at both the hospital and SNF. At its foundation, successful care transitions rely on teamwork, relationship building, and communication among diverse groups of providers. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) developed the ECHO-CT (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes-Care Transitions) program to improve transitions of care through structured, bi-directional communication between hospital-based and SNF-based providers. This paper describes key strategies for success in this model including: facilitating teamwork, eliminating hierarchy, and encouraging a bi-directional learning environment. We propose these as strategies that could be implemented in other organizations seeking to improve value during transitions of care.","Junge-Maughan, Lauren; Moore, Amber; Lipsitz, Lewis",J Interprof Care,,562

The present work investigated understory bird communities of three of its remnants using ten mist nets installed at eight different points of the forest understory of each area. We captured 333 birds of 44 species and 19 families. Bird richness and abundance did not differ between the three remnants (KW = 6.08; p = 0.04 and KW = 10.54; p = 0.004). The composition was little similar among them, and each area presented high species diversity and evenness. The most captured species were Arremon taciturnus (n = 40), Chiroxiphia pareola (n = 32) and Conopophaga melanops (n = 28). C. melanops has a local threat status of vulnerable and is considered endemic. Endangered and endemic species each represented 15.91% of the captures. Both Reserva Biológica Guaribas areas had the highest number of threatened species, while Reserva Particular do Patrimônio Natural Engenho Gargaú showed the highest number of endemic and understory insectivorous species, which indicates a better quality status in comparison to the other two.

By adopting a descriptive approach, the paper introduces the case of coronavirus outbreak in China and how the public health administration coped with it. The 3H framework has been applied to analyse China’s strategy, and the framework’s assumptions are initially tested.Design/methodology/approachThe pandemic case is created based on credible reports, press releases from different respected sources, World Health Organization (WHO) statistics, interview transcripts and broadcasting stations’ video clippings. Interpretive analysis with pragmatism approach has been conducted in analysing the data and information collected. Triangulation, wherever possible, has been done to validate the data and information.FindingsAs an exploratory study, its findings show that 3H framework distinguishes the effectiveness of a country’s strategy and practice for combating the pandemic. Countries, which failed to observe the assumed principles of 3H domains tend to have much more infected cases and deaths.Originality/valueThe 3H framework conceptualised a holistic management approach and its assumptions have been initially tested with this pandemic case. The framework shows its predictability value for a country’s pandemic management effectiveness.","Yu, Eddie",Public Administration and Policy,,562
414003,A two-levels data anonymization approach,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide efforts to understand the biological traits of the newly identified HCoV-19 virus. In this mass spectrometry (MS)-based study, we reveal that out of 21 possible glycosites in the HCoV-19 S protein, 20 are completely occupied by N-glycans, predominantly of the oligomannose type. All seven glycosylation sites in human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) were found to be completely occupied, mainly by complex N-glycans. However, glycosylation did not directly contribute to the binding affinity between HCoV-19 S and hACE2. Additional post-translational modification (PTM) was identified, including multiple methylated sites in both proteins and multiple sites with hydroxylproline in hACE2. Refined structural models of HCoV-19 S and hACE2 were built by adding N-glycan and PTMs to recently published cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures. The PTM and glycan maps of HCoV-19 S and hACE2 provide additional structural details for studying the mechanisms underlying host attachment and the immune response of HCoV-19, as well as knowledge for developing desperately needed remedies and vaccines.","Sun, Zeyu; Ren, Keyi; Zhang, Xing; Chen, Jinghua; Jiang, Zhengyi; Jiang, Jing; Ji, Feiyang; Ouyang, Xiaoxi; Li, Lanjuan",,,562

We identified 19 published articles on PubMed of peer-reviewed randomized clinical trials of mental health apps focused on stress, anxiety, and depression Despite some evidence for the effectiveness of mental health apps, it remains unclear how effective these apps are compared with standard of care Populations studied so far also lack diversity, making it difficult to generalize any benefits to racial minorities and low-income individuals-the very people who have been most negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and traditionally have higher barriers to mental health services Whereas apps are not a substitute for face-to-face therapy, further evidence is warranted, given their potential for delivering scalable, low-cost care to patients We call for regulatory oversight as a means to ensure mental health apps demonstrate safety and effectiveness prior to marketing (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Clinical Impact Statement -Mental health apps are increasingly available to consumers/patients for depression, stress, and anxiety Early evidence suggests that those apps studied have a positive impact on these conditions, but further research and regulatory oversight is needed before apps should be recommended to patients (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Longyear, Robert L.; Kushlev, Kostadin",Practice Innovations,,562

429534,Learning to Recognize Masked Faces by Data Synthesis,2021,"As a response to the global COVID-19 surge in 2020, many countries have implemented lockdown or stay-at-home policies. If, however, the contact persons of every infected patient could be identified, the number of virus transmissions could be reduced, while the more incisive measures could be softened. For this purpose, contact tracing using smartphones is being considered as a promising technique. Here, smartphones emit and scan for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals for detecting devices in range. When a device is detected, its distance is estimated by evaluating its received signal strength. The main insight that is exploited for distance estimation is that the attenuation of a signal increases with the distance along which it has traveled. However, besides distance, there are multiple additional factors that impact the attenuation and hence disturb distance estimation. Among them, frequency selective hardware and signal propagation belong to the most significant ones. For example, a BLE device transmits beacons on three different frequencies (channels), while the transmit power and the receiver sensitivity depend on the frequency. As a result, the received signal strength varies for each channel, even when the distance remains constant. However, the information on which wireless channel a beacon has been received is not made available to a smartphone. Hence, this error cannot be compensated, e.g., by calibration. In this paper, we for the first time provide a solution to detect the wireless channel on which a packet has been received on a smartphone. We experimentally evaluate our proposed technique on multiple different smartphone models. Our results help to make contact tracing more robust by improving the accuracy of distance estimation.","Gentner, Christian; Gunther, Daniel; Kindt, Philipp H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09099v2.pdf,562

433710,A Study on the Perceived Marketability of ShoeVid-19 as an Effective Disinfecting Shoe Rack,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in Wuhan, China, it has been extensively studied by many scientists. Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is shown by people of all ages, especially those with different comorbidities. Our goal was to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, course, and outcome of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing neurological disorders. METHOD: We retrospectively studied 70 patients with COVID-19 and previous neurological diseases who were treated in the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration from 16 March to 15 June 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, image data, laboratory results, treatment methods and results, clinical signs and symptoms of patients hospitalised due to CNS diseases with COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS: The average age of hospitalised patients was 72, and the majority (63%) were women (44/70). The most common neurological disease was dementia, which was present in almost a third of patients (30.76%), followed by ischaemic stroke (24.61%). Chest imaging showed the presence of interstitial changes in 47% (33) of patients. Laboratory tests revealed increased total blood cells, increased levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimers, liver indicator markers and IL-6 in the most severely affected patients. The treatment of patients was focused on monitoring their clinical condition, and supporting respiratory inefficiency with passive oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. According to the guidelines of the Hospital Therapeutic Committee, pharmacological treatment (Arechin R, Kaletra R) was introduced in cases without contraindications. In patients with moderate COVID-19, antimalarial or antiviral agents were applied (78%). 30% of our observed patients died during the hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: We studied a select group of patients (elderly, with comorbidities, and moderate or severe COVID-19 course). Pre-existing neurological disorders were additionally associated with a poorer prognosis and a high fatality rate (30%). Dementia and CNS vascular disorder were the most frequent pre-existing neurological conditions. The neurological symptoms of COVID-19 were various. We observed impaired consciousness, dizziness, headache, nausea, myalgia, psychomotor agitation and slowness, delirium, and psychoses. Further analysis is needed to elucidate the incidence of COVID-19 neurological complications.","Zielinska-Turek, J.; Jasinska, A.; Kolakowska, J.; Szadurska, J.; Kosior, D.

The mobility of students within the framework of the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA) is also strongly affected by the unexpected interruption of this program and the deprivation of thousands of students worldwide of this fine opportunity for training, exchange and sharing. The International Federation of Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA) was founded in 1951 and currently maintains 135 National Member Organizations (NMOs) from 125 countries, representing a network of 1.3 million medical students around the globe. Moroccan students, members of IFMSA like students from other countries, are also concerned. Clinical and research exchanges, carried out under the auspices of the IFMSA, allow all the students to discover the health care and medical education systems of another country in a different sociocultural environment. To maintain student motivation and deal with the repercussions of cancelled exchanges, IFMSA could propose online training programs, adapted to student needs during this period of confinement and deconfinement from June to September 2020.","Bentata, Yassamine",Med Educ Online,,562

447088,Robust Real Time Mask Detection Using Deep Learning in an Complex Background,2021,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a coagulopathy favouring thrombosis over bleeding that imparts a poor prognosis. Clot in transit (CIT) is considered a rare entity and the most severe form of venous thromboembolism (VTE), carrying a higher mortality than isolated pulmonary embolism (PE). The incidence of this phenomenon in patients with COVID-19 infection is unknown and likely under-recognized. Case summary During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, a 70-year-old Hispanic female presented with syncope due to a saddle PE further complicated by a highly mobile CIT. Polymerase chain reaction was positive for COVID-19 infection, however, there was no evidence of lung parenchymal involvement or hyper-inflammation. Based on consensus from a multidisciplinary team, aspiration thrombectomy was attempted to treat this extreme case of VTE, however, the patient died during the procedure. Discussion This case raises awareness to the most catastrophic form of VTE, presenting in an early phase of COVID-19 infection without the typical hyper-inflammation and severe lung injury associated with development of COVID-related coagulopathy. It also serves to inform on the critical role echocardiography has in the comprehensive evaluation and re-evaluation of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the importance of a multidisciplinary organized approach in clinical decision-making for this complex and poorly understood disease and its sequelae.","Aoi, S.; Kakkar, A.

Not only people lost their lives to it, but also numerous industries and governments as a whole succumbed to its impacts. To prevent the spread of the disease, many countries have resorted to observing country-wide lockdowns, damaging the normalcy of their economy. The world economy has seen new lows by trillions of dollars during this period, giving rise to times of constant anxiety about the future. The renewable energy sector, which has always been one of the leading areas to promote sustainability in terms of the environment, too is not spared from being affected by the pandemic. An amalgamation of the effects of the pandemic on the global economy and fluctuating oil prices resulting from country-wide lockdowns across the world further triggered its impact on the renewable energy industry. This work highlights the extensive impacts of COVID-19 on the renewable energy sector of India, a country that has proved itself to be proactive and progressive when it comes to solutions toward sustainable development. It showcases the present impacts of the pandemic on the sector and highlights future projections of the way it may continue to affect this sector as the world continues to struggle with the pandemic. The authors have brought up a set of their opined regulations that the administration and policymakers of the renewable energy sector of India can adopt to avert or reduce the extensivity of the impact of COVID-19 on their sector.","Pradhan, Sudeep; Ghose, Dipanjan; Shabbiruddin,",Energy Sources Recovery Util.

Here we revisit T-B cooperation as a prerequisite for effective and durable neutralizing antibody responses centered on a mutationally constrained RBM B cell epitope. T-B cooperation requires co-processing of B and T cell epitopes by the same B cell and is subject to MHC-II restriction. We evaluated MHC-II constraints relevant to the neutralizing antibody response to a mutationally-constrained B cell epitope in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein. Examining common MHC-II alleles, we found that peptides surrounding this key B cell epitope are predicted to bind poorly, suggesting a lack MHC-II support in T-B cooperation, impacting generation of high-potency neutralizing antibodies in the general population. Additionally, we found that multiple microbial peptides had potential for RBM cross-reactivity, supporting previous exposures as a possible source of T cell memory.","Castro, Andrea; Ozturk, Kivilcim; Zanetti, Maurizio; Carter, Hannah",PLoS One,,562

DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective, observational study. SETTING: Ten tertiary referral university and community hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with confirmed severe COVID-19-related ARDS. INTERVENTIONS: Venovenous or venoarterial ECMO. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients (mean age 51.1 ± 9.7 years, female 17.4%) were treated with ECMO for confirmed severe COVID-19-related ARDS. Before ECMO, the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 10.1 ± 4.4, mean pH was 7.23 ± 0.09, and mean PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio was 77 ± 50 mmHg. Venovenous ECMO was adopted in 122 patients (92.4%) and venoarterial ECMO in ten patients (7.6%) (mean duration, 14.6 ± 11.0 days). Sixty-three (47.7%) patients died on ECMO and 70 (53.0%) during the index hospitalization. Six-month all-cause mortality was 53.0%. Advanced age (per year, hazard ratio [HR] 1.026, 95% CI 1.000-1-052) and low arterial pH (per unit, HR 0.006, 95% CI 0.000-0.083) before ECMO were the only baseline variables associated with increased risk of six-month mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggested that about half of adult patients with severe COVID-19-related ARDS can be managed successfully with ECMO with sustained results at six months. Decreased arterial pH before ECMO was associated significantly with early mortality. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that initiation of ECMO therapy before severe metabolic derangements subset may improve survival rates significantly in these patients. These results should be viewed in the light of a strict patient selection policy and may not be replicated in patients with advanced age or multiple comorbidities.

We aimed to analyse if laboratory exams, risk assessment scores, comorbidity scores were useful in predicting the VTE in SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted in internal medicine (IM). We evaluated 49 older adults with suspected VTE analysing history and blood chemistry, besides we calculated the Padua Prediction Score, the modified early warning scoring (MEWS) and the modified Elixhauser index (mEI). All patients underwent venous color-doppler ultrasounds of the lower limbs. Out of the 49 patients enrolled (mean age 79.3±14 years), 10 (20.4%) had deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and they were more frequently female (80% vs 20%, p = 0.04). We could not find any association with the Padua Prediction Score, the MEWS, and the mEI. D-dimer plasma levels were also not associated with DVT. In elderly people hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized in IM, our data, although limited by the sample size, suggest that prediction and diagnosis of VTE is difficult, due to lack of precise biomarkers and scores.","De Giorgi, Alfredo; Contini, Carlo; Greco, Salvatore; Fabbian, Fabio; Gasbarro, Vincenzo; Zuliani, Giovanni; Passaro, Angelina; Zenunaj, Gladiol; Manfredini, Roberto",J Infect Dev Ctries,,562

The potential Si/T ordering in different structures is discussed. Additionally, the influences from intrinsic and extrinsic properties (e.g. elemental size and electronics as well as lattice parameters and structure type) are investigated on each other using correlation plots. Thermal treatment is identified as an important factor for the ordering of Si/T atoms.","Nentwich, M; Zschornak, M; Sonntag, M; Gumeniuk, R; Gemming, S; Leisegang, T; Meyer, D C",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,562
452574,Network aggregation to enhance results derived from multiple analytics,2020,"The tumultuous inception of an epidemic is usually accompanied by difficulty in determining how to respond best. In developing nations, this can be compounded by logistical challenges, such as vaccine shortages and poor road infrastructure. To provide guidance towards improved epidemic response, various resource allocation models, in conjunction with a network-based SEIRVD epidemic model, are proposed in this article. Further, the feasibility of using drones for vaccine delivery is evaluated, and assorted relevant parameters are discussed. For the sake of generality, these results are presented for multiple network structures, representing interconnected populations-upon which repeated epidemic simulations are performed. The resource allocation models formulated maximise expected prevented exposures on each day of a simulated epidemic, by allocating response teams and vaccine deliveries according to the solutions of two respective integer programming problems-thereby influencing the simulated epidemic through the SEIRVD model. These models, when compared with a range of alternative resource allocation strategies, were found to reduce both the number of cases per epidemic, and the number of vaccines required. Consequently, the recommendation is made that such models be used as decision support tools in epidemic response. In the absence thereof, prioritizing locations for vaccinations according to susceptible population, rather than total population or number of infections, is most effective for the majority of network types. In other results, fixed-wing drones are demonstrated to be a viable delivery method for vaccines in the context of an epidemic, if sufficient drones can be promptly procured; the detrimental effect of intervention delay was discovered to be significant. In addition, the importance of well-documented routine vaccination activities is highlighted, due to the benefits of increased pre-epidemic immunity rates, and targeted vaccination.","Matter, Dean; Potgieter, Linke",PLoS One,,562

We assessed self-reported public perceptions related to COVID-19 including, beliefs (e.g., severity, concerns, health), knowledge (e.g., transmission, information sources), and behaviors (e.g., physical distancing) to understand perspectives in Canada and to inform future public health initiatives. METHODS: We administered a national online survey aiming to obtain responses from 2000 adults in Canada. Respondent sampling was stratified by age, sex, and region. We used descriptive statistics to summarize responses and tested for regional differences using chi-squared tests, followed by weighted logistic regression. RESULTS: We collected 1,996 eligible questionnaires between April 26th and May 1st, 2020. One-fifth (20%) of respondents knew someone diagnosed with COVID-19, but few had tested positive themselves (0.6%). Negative impacts of pandemic conditions were evidenced in several areas, including concerns about healthcare (e.g. sufficient equipment, 52%), pandemic stress (45%), and worsening social (49%) and mental/emotional (39%) health. Most respondents (88%) felt they had good to excellent knowledge of virus transmission, and predominantly accessed (74%) and trusted (60%) Canadian news television, newspapers/magazines, or non-government news websites for COVID-19 information. We found high compliance with distancing measures (80% reported self-isolating or always physical distancing). We identified associations between region and self-reported beliefs, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: We found that information about COVID-19 is largely acquired through domestic news sources, which may explain high self-reported compliance with prevention measures. The results highlight the broader impact of a pandemic on the general public's overall health and wellbeing, outside of personal infection. The study findings should be used to inform public health communications during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Parsons Leigh, Jeanna; Fiest, Kirsten; Brundin-Mather, Rebecca; Plotnikoff, Kara; Soo, Andrea; Sypes, Emma E; Whalen-Browne, Liam; Ahmed, Sofia B; Burns, Karen E A; Fox-Robichaud, Alison; Kupsch, Shelly; Longmore, Shelly; Murthy, Srinivas; Niven, Daniel J; Rochwerg, Bram; Stelfox, Henry T",PLoS One,,562

The newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 outbreak, which is a real threat to human health and life. The world has been struggling with this epidemic for about a year, yet there are still no targeted drugs and effective treatments are very limited. Due to the long process of developing new drugs, reposition of existing ones is one of the best ways to deal with an epidemic of emergency infectious diseases. Among the existing drugs there are candidates which are potentially able to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus infection with the virus. Some therapeutics target several proteins, and many diseases share molecular paths. In such cases, the use of existing pharmaceuticals for more than one purposes can reduce the time needed to design new drugs. The aim of this review was to analyse the key targets of viral infection and potential drugs acting on them, as well as to discuss various strategies and therapeutic approaches, including the possible use of natural products. We highlight the approach based on increasing the involvement of human deaminases, particularly APOBEC deaminases in editing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This can reduce the cytosine content in the viral genome leading to the loss of its integrity. We also indicate the nucleic acid technologies as potential approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Among numerous promising natural products, we point out curcumin and cannabidiol as good candidates for being anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.","Pluskota-Karwatka, Donata; Hoffmann, Marcin; Barciszewski, Jan",,,562

The objective of this paper is to evaluate at the ecological level if a large area (Red Zone) of the Veneto Region, where residents were exposed for decades to drinking water contaminated by PFAS, showed higher mortality for COVID-19 than the rest of the region. METHODS: We fitted a Bayesian ecological regression model with spatially and not spatially structured random components on COVID-19 mortality at the municipality level (period between 21 February and 15 April 2020). The model included education score, background all-cause mortality (for the years 2015-2019), and an indicator for the Red Zone. The two random components are intended to adjust for potential hidden confounders. RESULTS: The COVID-19 crude mortality rate ratio for the Red Zone was 1.55 (90% Confidence Interval 1.25; 1.92). From the Bayesian ecological regression model adjusted for education level and baseline all-cause mortality, the rate ratio for the Red Zone was 1.60 (90% Credibility Interval 0.94; 2.51). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we observed a higher mortality risk for COVID-19 in a population heavily exposed to PFAS, which was possibly explained by PFAS immunosuppression, bioaccumulation in lung tissue, or pre-existing disease being related to PFAS.","Catelan, Dolores; Biggeri, Annibale; Russo, Francesca; Gregori, Dario; Pitter, Gisella; Da Re, Filippo; Fletcher, Tony; Canova, Cristina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,562

The results show that the social representation is organized around five potentially central descriptive, anxiety-provoking and globally negative elements. But death and contagion are the only stable and structuring elements. The other elements vary according to the reason attributed to the object of fear. Depending on how individuals attribute the origin of the virus, social representations of it vary not only in terms of their content but also in terms of their structure. These results indicate how important it is to consider the perceptions that individuals share about the human (vs non-human) and intentional (vs unintentional) origin of an object of fear in the analysis of their representation of that object.","Rateau, Patrick; Tavani, Jean Louis; Delouvée, Sylvain",Health (London),,562

485336,Transfer Learning for Detection of COVID-19 Infection using Chest X-Ray Images,2021,"BACKGROUND: Limited evidence is available on the health effects of particulate matter (PM including PM2.5 with an aerodynamic diameter &#8804; 2.5 µm; PM10, &#8804; 10 µm; PM2.5-10, 2.5-10 µm) during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Italy. The aims of the study were to examine the associations between all-cause mortality and PM in the pandemic period and compare them to the normal periods (2015-2019). METHODS: We collected daily data regarding all-cause mortality (stratified by age and gender), and PM concentrations for 107 Italian provinces from 1 January 2015 to 31 May 2020. A time-stratified case-cross design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between PM and all-cause mortality. We also compared the counts and fractions of death attributable to PM in two periods. RESULTS: Italy saw an increase in daily death counts while slight decreases in PM concentrations in pandemic period. Each 10 µg/m3 increase in PM was associated with much higher increase in daily all-cause mortality during the pandemic period compared to the same months during 2015-2019 (increased mortality rate: 7.24% (95%CI: 4.84%, 9.70%) versus 1.69% (95%CI: 1.12%, 2.25%) for PM2.5; 3.45% (95%CI: 2.58%, 4.34%) versus 1.11% (95%CI: 0.79%, 1.42%) for PM10; 4.25% (95%CI: 2.99%, 5.52%) versus 1.76% (95%CI: 1.14%, 2.38%) for PM2.5-10). The counts and fractions of deaths attributable to PM were higher in 2020 for PM2.5 (attributable death counts: 20,062 versus 3927 per year in 2015-2019; attributable fractions: 10.2% versus 2.4%), PM10 (15,112 versus 3999; 7.7% versus 2.5%), and PM2.5-10 (7193 versus 2303; 3.7% versus 1.4%). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic increased the vulnerability and excess cases of all-cause mortality associated with short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM2.5-10, and PM10 in Italy, despite a decline in air pollution level.","Ye, Tingting; Xu, Rongbin; Yu, Wenhua; Chen, Zhaoyue; Guo, Yuming; Li, Shanshan",,,562

In particular, it has raised challenges in the context of competing care priorities between COVID-19 and cancer treatment. Residents on the front line face difficulties related to increasing care needs and urgent reorganization of health care systems while managing psychological stress and uncertainty. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncology residents. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a national survey (39 questions) in France among oncology and radiation therapy residents to determine the psychological impact and professional difficulties (eg, reassignment, training/research time, supervision, teleworking, management of patients) associated with the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 222 residents (medical oncologists, 61%; radiation therapists, 39%) participated in our survey, representing approximately one third of all residents and fellows in France. One third of respondents had been reassigned to a COVID-19 ward. Training and research activity decreased for 89% and 41% of respondents, respectively. Two thirds (70%) of respondents declared that they had faced ethical issues, 35% felt worried about their own health, and 23% experienced psychological distress. According to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 32% were anxious and 17% depressed. Consumption of tobacco, psychostimulants, and alcohol increased in 31%, 24%, and 29% of respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: French oncology residents were highly affected by the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of professional activity and psychological impact. This national survey can be used as a basis for improved management, medical reorganization, and training of residents during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Hilmi, Marc; Boilève, Alice; Ducousso, Anabelle; Michalet, Morgan; Turpin, Anthony; Neuzillet, Cindy; Naoun, Natacha",JCO Glob Oncol,,562
488544,The Economic Cross of the Digital Post-coronavirus Economy (on the Example of Rare Earth Metals Industry),2021,"The most severe presentation of COVID-19 is characterized by a hyperinflammatory state attributed to the massive pro-inflammatory cytokine release, called ""cytokine storm"". Several specific anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents are being evaluated by ongoing clinical trials; however, there is currently insufficient evidence for their efficacy and safety in COVID-19 treatment. Given the role of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE) 4 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the inflammatory response, we hypothesize that selective PDE4 inhibition may attenuate the cytokine storm in COVID-19, through the upstream inhibition of pro-inflammatory molecules, particularly TNF-&#945;, and the regulation of the pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. Conversely, other anti-cytokine agents lead to the downstream inhibition of specific targets, such as IL-1, IL-6 or TNF-&#945;, and may not be efficient in blocking the cytokine storm, once it has been triggered. Due to their mechanism of action targeting an early stage of the inflammatory response and ameliorating lung inflammation, we believe that selective PDE4 inhibitors may represent a promising treatment option for the early phase of COVID-19 pneumonia before the cytokine storm and severe multiorgan dysfunction take place. Furthermore, PDE4 inhibitors present several advantages including an excellent safety profile; the oral route of administration; the convenient dosing; and beneficial metabolic properties. Interestingly, obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2 have been reported to be risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. Therefore, randomized clinical trials of PDE4 inhibitors are necessary to explore their potential therapeutic effect as an adjunct to supportive measures and other therapeutic regiments.","Dalamaga, Maria; Karampela, Irene; Mantzoros, Christos S",Metabolism,,562

To investigate whether the imposition of fines can mitigate the spread of COVID-19.Methods. We used quasi-experimental difference-in-difference models. On March 20, 2020, Bavaria introduced fines as high as 25 000 (US $28 186) against citizens in violation of the Bundesland's (federal state's) lockdown policy. Its neighboring Bundesländer (federal states), on the other hand, were slow to impose such clear restrictions. By comparing 38 Landkreise (counties) alongside Bavaria's border from March 15 to May 11 using data from the Robert Koch Institute, we produced for each Landkreis its (1) time-dependent reproduction numbers (Rt) and (2) growth rates in confirmed cases.Results. The demographics of the Landkreise were similar enough to allow for difference-in-difference analyses. Landkreise that introduced fines on March 20 reduced the Rt by a further 0.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.46, -0.18; P < .001) and decreased the growth rate in confirmed cases by an additional 6 percentage points (95% CI = -0.11, -0.02; P = .005) compared with the control group.Conclusions. Imposing fines may slow down the spread of COVID-19.Public Health Implications.

Since then, the situation rapidly evolved from a cluster of patients with pneumonia, to a regional epidemic and now to a pandemic called COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This evolution is related to the peculiar modes of transmission of the disease and to the globalization and lifestyle of the 21st century that created the perfect scenario for virus spread. Even though research has not evidenced particular susceptibility of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments were considered potential risk factors. In this context, initiating treatments with these agents should be cautiously weighted and regular ongoing treatments shall be continued, while the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced whenever possible. Due to the increased risk of contamination, elective endoscopic procedures and surgeries should be postponed and IBD online appointments shall be considered. IBD patients shall also follow the recommendations provided to the general population, such as minimization of contact with infected or suspected patients and to wash hands frequently. In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, this pandemic can only be controlled through prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with the main objectives of providing patients the best healthcare possible and reduce mortality.","Magro, Fernando; Abreu, Candida; Rahier, Jean-François",United European Gastroenterol J,,562

The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.","Shayak, B; Sharma, Mohit M; Gaur, Manas; Mishra, An Kumar",Int. j. infect. dis,,562

Distal to the first jejunal loop, the jejunum appeared necrotic and then resected with bowel exteriorization (terminal jejunostomy and ileostomy). The postoperative course was complicated by worsening of respiratory distress, acute tubular necrosis and renal failure unresponsive to medical therapy and fatal outcome.

Drawing on an original set of interviews with China experts from each country, and an array of primary and secondary sources, I show that shifting framings of China's rise reflect the dynamics of the US, Australian and UK national security fields. The article highlights three features specifically: first, the US field features a belief that China's rise can be arrested or prevented, absent in Australia and the UK. I root this dynamic in the system of professional appointments and the intense US 'marketplace of ideas', which gives rise to intense framing contestation and occasional sharp frame change. I then identify the key positions produced by each field, from which key actors have shaped the differing interpretations of China and its meaning. The election of Donald Trump, a strong China-critic, to the US presidency empowered key individuals across government who shifted the predominant framing of China from potential challenger to current threat. The smaller and more centralized fields in Australia and Britain feature fewer and less intense China-sceptical voices;responses have thereby remained largely pragmatic, despite worsening diplomatic relations in each case.","McCourt, D.

In this review, we aim to decipher the various lines of evidence supporting the bidirectional association between psoriasis and obesity highlighting their pathophysiologic connections as well as we attempt to strategize a therapeutic holistic approach for obese psoriatic patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent meta-analyses have shown that (1) genetically higher BMI increased the odds of psoriasis occurrence; (2) obesity is associated with higher incidence and prevalence of psoriasis as well as psoriasis severity; (3) obesity is associated with lower efficacy to anti-TNF agents and may predict biologic treatment discontinuation; and (4) weight loss through diet and physical exercise may improve pre-existing psoriasis and prevent from de novo psoriasis. Methotrexate, acitretin, and cyclosporine could worsen hypertension, liver steatosis, and dyslipidemia. Since infliximab and ustekinumab are weight adjusted, they may be ideal drugs to treat obese psoriatic patients. IL-17 inhibitors are very effective independently from body weight; however, they tend to present better clearance rates in normal weight patients. There is a paucity on weight data regarding the efficacious IL-23 inhibitors. Apremilast may induce weight loss as an adverse effect presenting also some beneficial metabolic actions. Finally, simvastatin and some antidiabetic drugs could decrease psoriasis severity. More mechanistic, observational studies and well-conducted RCTs are necessary to decipher the enigmatic link between psoriasis and obesity, and to provide evidence-based specific guidelines for the screening and management of obese psoriatic patients.","Paroutoglou, Kyriaki; Papadavid, Evangelia; Christodoulatos, Gerasimos Socrates; Dalamaga, Maria",Curr. obes. rep,,562

Globally, in 2019, 9.96 million people fell ill with TB, including 1.19 million children aged 0-14 years. Children from family contacts have the highest risk of TB. Testing for TB and COVID-19 for individual indications in children can be done simultaneously. This will provide significant benefits for the detection of two infectious diseases. The study of TB with pulmonary symptoms and TB without symptoms (asymptomatic) will be essential for rational screening. Objective: The study of 333 cases of symptomatic and asymptomatic pulmonary TB in children from family contacts of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases. METHODS The focus group included 74 children with symptomatic pulmonary TB and 259 children with asymptomatic pulmonary TB from family contacts. Analysis of history of disease, comorbidity, clinical, bacteriological, X-ray methods and statistical analysis (Student's t-test, χ2-test) have been applied.RESULTSBoth groups did not differ by quantity of boys and girls. The group of children with symptomatic TB included 29 boys (39,2%) and 45 girls (60,8%). The group of children with asymptomatic TB included 128 boys (49,4%) and 131 girls (50,6%). Differences between groups is not valid (χ2=2,418;p=0,120). The average age of the children with symptomatic TB was 14,5 ± 3,8 years, in children with asymptomatic TB - 13,8 ± 4,7 years. Differences between groups is not valid ( p&gt;0,05).The frequency of excretion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the groups differed. The excretion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was determined in 36 children (48,6%) with symptomatic TB and 57 children (22,0%) with asymptomatic TB (χ2 = 20,295;p&lt;0,001).The frequency of lung cavities in the groups differed. Cavities were recorded in 24 children (32,4%) with symptomatic TB and 39 children (15,1%) with asymptomatic TB (χ2 = 11,327;p&lt;0,001). Drug resistance was observed in 7 children (9,5%) with symptomatic TB and 14 children (5,4%) with asymptomatic TB (χ2 = 1,601;p = 0,206). The difference is not significant. Comorbid diseases have been reported in 53 children (71,6%) with symptomatic TB and 188 children (72,6%) with asymptomatic TB (χ2 = 0,027;p = 0,870). The difference is not significant.CONCLUSIONSChildren with symptomatic TB from family contacts often had a more severe form of TB. They more often the excretion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and lung cavities compared to children with asymptomatic TB. The absence of pulmonary symptoms in children from family contacts does not exclude the presence of TB.","Gorbach, L.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,562

511989,"Proceedings of the 2020 International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence in Medical Sciences, ISAIMS 2020",2020,"Artificial intelligence, which has been actively applied in a broad range of industries in recent years, is an active area of interest for many researchers. Dentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial intelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology have mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image classification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and refinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed for the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, and image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve good results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making accurate and consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to widely use artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, there are lots of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of fine-labeled open data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial intelligence, and DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If solutions to these problems are presented with the development of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is expected to play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis systems, the establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment tools. OMF radiologists, as professionals who thoroughly understand the characteristics of radiographic images, will play a very important role in the development of artificial intelligence applications in this field.","Heo, Min-Suk; Kim, Jo-Eun; Hwang, Jae-Joon; Han, Sang-Sun; Kim, Jin-Soo; Yi, Won-Jin; Park, In-Woo",Dentomaxillofac Radiol,,562

517059,Pushing LIMITS: Envisioning beyond the artifact,2020,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses (RVs) are among the most common pathogens for both upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs). However, the viral epidemiology of RV-associated RTIs in adults has long been under-recognized. Through a sensitive molecular assay, it would be possible to have a better understanding of the epidemiology of RV-associated RTIs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Respiratory tract (RT) specimens from adults hospitalized due to RTIs were tested for RVs, using the multiplex PCR-based Luminex xTAG® Respiratory Viral Panel assay. A total of nineteen RVs, including influenza viruses and non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRVs) were detected. Positive rates were compared using a chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 2292 samples from adult patients hospitalized with RTIs were screened for RVs. The overall positive rate was 22%, with 17.8% samples positive for at least one NIRV. NIRVs had a higher positive rate in non-winter seasons. As many as 12.7% (46/363) of the samples collected through broncho-alveolar lavage and 20.5% (176/859) of the samples collected in ICUs were positive for RVs. Distribution of corona virus (CoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) demonstrated seasonal variation. Also, temperature was associated with the positive rates of specific viruses, including CoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hMPV and PIV. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses, notably NIRVs, were frequently detected in adults hospitalized with RTIs. Several RVs were detected with distinctive seasonal variations. A substantial number of RVs were identified in lower RT specimens or from patients admitted to ICU, highlighting their important role in causing severe respiratory infection.","Tai, Cheng-Chun; Tsai, Cheng-Hsien; Huang, Yu-Han; Lee, Chia-Lin; Chen, Hsin-Pai; Chan, Yu-Jiun",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,,562

518980,Application of Convolution BLS in AI Face-Changing Problem,2021,"Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a member of the JAK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, together with JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3. JAKs are important signaling mediators of many proinflammatory cytokines and represent compelling pharmacological targets for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pan-acting small-molecule JAK inhibitors were approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. However, their limited selectivity among JAK members have led to undesirable side effects, driving a search toward specific JAK inhibitors. Recently, TYK2 has emerged as a target of choice for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19 with an optimum balance between efficacy and safety, based on observations from human genetics studies and clinical outcomes of several agents targeting cytokine pathways for which TYK2 plays an essential role. In this article, we address selective targeting of TYK2 from the genetic sequence space through development of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against TYK2 mRNA. Potent ASO candidates were identified from the screening of over 200 ASOs using locked nucleic acid gapmer design. The lead ASOs exhibited potent and selective knockdown of TYK2 mRNA and protein across a panel of model human cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, showing no reduction in the mRNA and protein expression levels of other JAK paralogs. In agreement with the depletion of TYK2 proteins, several TYK2-mediated cytokine signaling pathways, including IFN-&#945; and IL-12, were inhibited upon ASO treatment. Our results established the TYK2 ASOs as investigational tool compound and potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19.","Tran, Nhan Van; Nguyen, Le Tuan Anh; Lim, Kah Wai; Phan, Anh Tuân",Immunohorizons,,562

522138,Dynamic Network Slicing: Challenges and Opportunities,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed society and introduced many new factors to consider in adolescent suicide risk assessment and prevention. One complexity that warrants consideration is the male-specific impacts of the pandemic within adolescence. METHODS: A review of the relevant literature. RESULTS: Matters of social distancing, virtual education, and substance use may impact adolescent men in fashions that raise their suicide risk more significantly relative to adolescent women. Social distancing may impact adolescents' friendships and generate a regression back to the nuclear family; qualities of male adolescents' friendships and of masculinity suggest that these impacts may be more severe in adolescent men and may directly raise suicide risk. Virtual schooling yields educational and social setbacks; losses of team sports, male mentors, and the implications of diminished educational advancement may more adversely affect adolescent men and raise risk. Substance use has increased in the pandemic, particularly amongst adolescent men. There are direct associations with suicide risk as well as indirectly through increased parental conflict and punishment. CONCLUSION: As adolescent men die by suicide at significantly elevated rates relative to adolescent women, a male-specific consideration of these impacts is indicated to address adolescent suicide in our current era. Recommendations are made for integrating these considerations into updated adolescent suicide risk assessment and prevention efforts.","Rice, Timothy; Sher, Leo",Acta Neuropsychiatr,,562

However, there is a need to better understand the overall impact of these interventions in improving cancer care and to identify best practices to support intervention adoption. Overall, this review intended to systematically catalogue the recent body of cancer-based mHealth and eHealth education and training interventions and assess the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing health care professionals’ knowledge, confidence, and behaviors related to the delivery of care along the cancer continuum. Our initial search yielded 135 articles, and our full review included 23 articles. We abstracted descriptive data for each of the 23 studies, including an overview of interventions (i.e., intended intervention recipients, location of delivery, topic of focus), study methods (i.e., design, sampling approach, sample size), and outcome measures. Almost all the studies reported knowledge gain as an outcome of the education interventions, whereas only half assessed provider confidence or behavior change. We conclude that there is some evidence that mHealth and eHealth interventions lead to improvements in cancer care delivery, but this is not a consistent finding across the studies reviewed. Our findings also identify gaps that should be addressed in future research, offer guidance on the utility of mHealth and eHealth interventions, and provide a roadmap for addressing these gaps.

This longitudinal cohort study including 1972 healthcare workers, of which 386 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in the vast majority of participants, 98%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. These antibody levels did not differ from those found in 59 convalescent COVID-19 patients (p=0.7). Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 93% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 68% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers, and these four-month follow-up levels were substantially lower in healthcare workers than in convalescent COVID-19 patients (p=2*10-5). Our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.","Havervall, S.; Jernbom Falk, A.; Klingstrom, J.; Ng, H.; Greilert Norin, N.; Gabrielsson, L.; Salomonsson, A.-C.; Isaksson, E.; Rudberg, A.-S.; Hellstrom, C.; Andersson, E.; Olofsson, J.; Skoglund, L.; Yousef, J.; Pin, E.; Christ, W.; Olausson, M.; Hedhammar, M.; Tegel, H.; Mangsbo, S.; Phillipson, M.; Manberg, A.; Hober, S.; Nilsson, P.; Thalin, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.21249162v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.03.21249162,562

Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis and modeling. We used the daily reports of definitive COVID-19 patients (sampling of severe cases and hospitalization) released by Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. Epidemic projection models of Gompertz, Von Bertalanffy and least squared error (LSE) were used to predict the number of cases at April 3, 2020 until May 13, 2020. Results: R0 in Iran was estimated to be 4.7 that has now fallen to below 2. Given the three different scenarios, the prediction of the patients on April 3, 2020 by Von Bertalanffy, Gompertz and LSE were estimated at 48200, 52500 and 58000, respectively. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 3600 individuals using the Von growth model, 4200 ones by Gompertz's model and 4850 ones according to the LSE method. To predict and estimate the number of patients and deaths in the end of epidemic based on Von and Gompertz models, we will have 87000 cases, 4900 and 11000 deaths until 13 May and 1 June, respectively. Conclusion: The process of controlling the epidemic is tangible. If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be flat from April 28, until July, 2020 and new cases are expected to decline from the following Iranian new year.","Ahmadi, Ali; Fadaei, Yasin; Shirani, Majid; Rahmani, Fereydoon",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037671,562
666350,"SARS-CoV-2: Vaccine Hesitancy among Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Groups with HIV in Miami, Florida",2021-03-26,"Disease epidemic outbreaks on human metapopulation networks are often driven by a small number of superspreader nodes, which are primarily responsible for spreading the disease throughout the network. Superspreader nodes typically are characterized either by their locations within the network, by their degree of connectivity and centrality, or by their habitat suitability for the disease, described by their reproduction number (R). Here we introduce a model that considers simultaneously the effects of network properties and R on superspreaders, as opposed to previous research which considered each factor separately. This type of model is applicable to diseases for which habitat suitability varies by climate or land cover, and for direct transmitted diseases for which population density and mitigation practices influences R. We present analytical models that quantify the superspreader capacity of a population node by two measures: probability-dependent superspreader capacity, the expected number of neighboring nodes to which the node in consideration will randomly spread the disease per epidemic generation, and time-dependent superspreader capacity, the rate at which the node spreads the disease to each of its neighbors. We validate our analytical models with a Monte Carlo analysis of repeated stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulations on randomly generated human population networks, and we use a random forest statistical model to relate superspreader risk to connectivity, R, centrality, clustering, and diffusion. We demonstrate that either degree of connectivity or R above a certain threshold are sufficient conditions for a node to have a moderate superspreader risk factor, but both are necessary for a node to have a high-risk factor. The statistical model presented in this article can be used to predict the location of superspreader events in future epidemics, and to predict the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that seek to reduce the value of R, alter host movements, or both.","Lieberthal, Brandon; Gardner, Allison M.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735223/,562
