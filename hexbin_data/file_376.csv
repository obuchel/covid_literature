2820,2820,2820,A Novel Strategy for Bitter Taste Masking of Gankeshuangqing Dispersible Tablets Based on Particle Coating Technology,13.134816,2.6099446,2017-07-19,"BACKGROUND: Currently, acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTIs) are increasingly becoming a significant health burden. Gankeshuangqing dispersible tablets (GKSQDT) which have a good effect on treating AURTIs. GKSQDT is composed of baicalin and andrographolide. However, its severe bitterness limits application of patients. Due to the addition of plentiful accessories, common masking methods are unsuitable for GKSQDT. It is thus necessary to develop a new masking method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Previous study showed that baicalin was less bitter than andrographolide. Thus, particle coating technology was adapted to prepare composite particles that baicalin coated on the surface of andrographolide to decrease bitterness. Initially, particle size of baicalin and coating time of composite was investigated to prepare composite. Then, scanning electron microscopy, wettability, and infrared (IR) spectrogram were used to characterize the microstructure of composite. Furthermore, electronic tongue test, animal preference experiment, and human sensory test were applied to evaluate the masking effect. RESULTS: To produce composite, baicalin should be ground in vibromill for 6 min. Then, andrographolide fine powder was added to grind together for 6 min. Contact angle of composite was smaller than mixture, and more similar to baicalin. Other physical characterization including microstructure, wettability, and IR also suggested that andrographolide was successfully coated by baicalin superfine. Furthermore, taste-masking test indicated taste-masked tablets was less bitter than original tablets. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that particle coating technology can be used for taste masking of GKSQDT without adding other substance. Moreover, it provides a new strategy of taste masking for national medicine. SUMMARY: A new strategy to mask bitterness without adding any other substance based on coating technology was provided. The masking effect was confirmed by electronic tongue test, animal preference experiment and human sensory test.

4219,4219,4219,Targeting the IL-22/IL-22BP axis enhances tight junctions and reduces inflammation during influenza infection,12.786773,7.955989,2019-10-09,"The seasonal burden of influenza coupled with the pandemic outbreaks of more pathogenic strains underscore a critical need to understand the pathophysiology of influenza injury in the lung. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is a promising cytokine that is critical in protecting the lung during infection. This cytokine is strongly regulated by the soluble receptor IL-22-binding protein (IL-22BP), which is constitutively expressed in the lungs where it inhibits IL-22 activity. The IL-22/IL-22BP axis is thought to prevent chronic exposure of epithelial cells to IL-22. However, the importance of this axis is not understood during an infection such as influenza. Here we demonstrate through the use of IL-22BP-knockout mice (il-22ra2(−/−)) that a pro-IL-22 environment reduces pulmonary inflammation during H1N1 (PR8/34 H1N1) infection and protects the lung by promoting tight junction formation. We confirmed these results in normal human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro demonstrating improved membrane resistance and induction of the tight junction proteins Cldn4, Tjp1, and Tjp2. Importantly, we show that administering recombinant IL-22 in vivo reduces inflammation and fluid leak into the lung. Taken together, our results demonstrate the IL-22/IL-22BP axis is a potential targetable pathway for reducing influenza-induced pneumonia.","Hebert, K.

DESIGN: A cost–utility analysis from a societal and healthcare perspective alongside a double-blinded, parallel group, placebo, multicentre trial. SETTING: Hospital outpatient clinics at six hospitals in Norway. The main results from the AIM study showed a small effect in back-related disability in favour of the antibiotics group, and slightly larger in those with type I Modic changes, but this effect was below the pre-defined threshold for clinically relevant effect. PARTICIPANTS: 180 patients with chronic LBP, previous disc herniation and Modic changes type I (n=118) or type II (n=62) were randomised to antibiotic treatment (n=89) or placebo-control (n=91). INTERVENTIONS: Oral treatment with either 750 mg amoxicillin or placebo three times daily for 100 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by EuroQoL-5D over 12 months and costs for healthcare and productivity loss measured in Euro (€1=NOK 10), in the intention-to-treat population. Cost–utility was expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Mean (SD) total cost was €21 046 (20 105) in the amoxicillin group and €19 076 (19 356) in the placebo group, mean difference €1970 (95% CI; −3835 to 7774). Cost per QALY gained was €24 625. In those with type I Modic changes, the amoxicillin group had higher healthcare consumption than the placebo group, resulting in €39 425 per QALY gained. Given these ICERs and a willingness-to-pay threshold of €27 500 (NOK 275 000), the probability of amoxicillin being cost-effective was 51%. Even when the willingness-to-pay threshold increased to €55 000, the probability of amoxicillin being cost-effective was never higher than 53%. CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin treatment showed no evidence of being cost-effective for people with chronic LBP and Modic changes during 1-year follow-up.

The strategy is assessed in terms of the value of the reproductive ratio R(0). We consider a general framework and analyse six different specific cases. The same antiviral strategy is simulated in all models, but they slightly differ in the compartmental structure. These differences correspond to different underlying assumptions concerning the timing of the intervention and the selection of individuals who receive treatment. It is shown that these details can have a strong influence on the predicted effectiveness of the strategy: for instance, with R(0) = 1.8 in absence of treatment, different models predict that with treatment R(0) can become as low as 0.4 or as high as 1.3; still, in all models 70% of infected individuals are treated and the infectiousness of treated individuals is reduced by 80%. A particular assumption that can be included when modelling influenza is time-varying infectivity. We consider a specific model to verify if the predicted effectiveness of antiviral treatment is influenced by the inclusion of this assumption. We compare the results obtained with constant and variable infectivity, in relation also to the time of intervention. It is likely that existing differences in the predictions of the effect of control measures depend on such modelling details. This finding stresses the need for carefully defining the structure of models in order to obtain results useful for policymakers in pandemic planning.","Lunelli, Antonella; Pugliese, Andrea",Math Med Biol,376,5

Because that process is frequently fraught with unspoken elements of ambivalence, disappointment, frustration, and failure, we find in Shelley's speculative fiction less a cautionary tale of overreach than a dynamic parable of the role that the unspoken, the invisible, and the unknown might play in contemporary physician/patient relationships. Playing with that parable, we consider its relevance to four often unacknowledged dynamics that shape physician/patient interaction: commitment to a false binary of life and death; the tyranny of normative aesthetics; shared negative affect; and the ethics of care and care-denial. To ""speak with Frankenstein"" is, we show, to make space for the otherwise unspeakable. The result is a more complete model of narrative medicine that accommodates to its ideal of open communication and full attention the persistence of what cannot be said, seen, or known--only imagined and approximated.","Lewis, Jayne; Shapiro, Johanna",J Med Humanit,376,17

A unique attribute of HA is its water-retaining properties, so HA has a major role in the regulation of fluid balance in the lung interstitium. Hyaluronic acid has been widely used in the treatment of eyes, ears, joints and skin disorders, but in the last years, it has been also proposed in the treatment of certain lung diseases, including airway diseases, due to its anti-inflammatory and water-binding capacities. Hyaluronic acid aerosol decreases the severity of elastase-induced emphysema in murine models, prevents bronchoconstriction in asthmatics and improves some functional parameters in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Due to the protection of HA against bronchoconstriction and its hydration properties, inhaled HA would increase the volume of airway surface liquid, resulting in mucus hydration, increased mucous transport and less mucous plugging of the airways. In addition, it has been seen in human studies that the treatment with nebulised HA improves the tolerability of nebulised hypertonic saline (even at 6% or 7% of concentration), which has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment in bronchial secretion management in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Our objective is to review the role of HA treatment in the management of chronic airway diseases.","Máiz Carro, Luis; Martínez-García, Miguel A.",Cells,376,1

ABSTRACT: Keeping exotic pets has become a popular habit in the UK in recent decades. Yet, information on the current scale of the trade and the diversity of animals involved is lacking. Here, we review the licensed sale of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals as exotic pets in the UK, identifying current geographical hotspots of trader activity, data gaps, and compliance issues related to this trade. In terms of trade volume, records showed large numbers of individual wild animals, across a wide range of species groups, are being legally sold in the UK. Maximum numbers of exotic pets permitted for sale included 54,634 amphibians, 64,810 reptiles, 23,507 birds, and 6479 mammals. Moreover, nearly 2000 pet traders located in 283 different local authority areas had permission to sell exotic pets. The scope and scale of the trade draws additional attention to the substantial animal welfare challenges associated with it, and our review serves to highlight several shortcomings associated with the licensed exotic pet trade in the UK. Pet shop licences often lacked detailed information about the specific type and number of animals permitted for sale, which raises compliance concerns and hinders efforts to carry out adequate inspection and monitoring. Ninety-five pet traders in England had been given a one star rating, indicating ‘minor failings’ in animal welfare, and some local authorities in England were still operating under the old Pet Animals Act (1951). We recommend that resources should be prioritised and focused towards local authorities in England that are not operating under the new Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations (2018), and that local authorities should improve data reporting on all licenses issued to aid inspection and monitoring.","Elwin, Angie; Green, Jennah; D’Cruze, Neil",Animals (Basel),376,13

This paper takes the emergency care system in Taiwan as the research context, where first-aid hospitals are ranked to three levels, advanced, intermediate, and general, and, currently, emphasizes on a general emergency responsibility hospital. Having limited capacity and capability, a general emergency responsibility hospital treats minor and moderate injuries, from which the majority of earthquake-induced casualties suffer. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of this group of earthquake-induced non-urgent patients on the performance of a hospital. A patient flow model was built to represent patients’ paths throughout emergency care. Based on the model, discrete event simulation was applied to simulate patients’ trajectories and states of a hospital under four seismic scenarios, where patient visits are 1.4, 1.6, 1.9, and 2.3 times the normal number. A healthcare performance index, Crowdedness Index (CI), is proposed to measure crowdedness on a daily basis, which is defined as the ratio of the average waiting time for treatment to the recommended maximal waiting time. Results of simulations rendered the establishment of empirical equations, describing the relation between the maximum CIs and the patient growth ratios. In the most severe case in this study, the maximum CI exceeds 92 and it takes 10 days to recover from the quality drop. This highlights the problem a general emergency responsibility hospital may encounter if no emergency response measure is implemented. Findings are provided pertaining to the predication of a recovery curve and the alarming level of patient increase, which are supportive information for preparedness planning as well as response measure formulation to improve resilience.","Lin, You-Xuan; Lin, Chi-Hao; Lin, Chih-Hao",PLoS One,376,1

Furthermore, those with higher cross-cultural adjustment competency and stress coping are more likely to have positive mental health, which also had an influence on lowering their turnover intention. Occupational competency had no significant association with mental health; however, it directly affects turnover intention.

This study aimed to show the incidence of delirium in patients after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy and factors affecting the occurrence of delirium in this group of patients. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Method: The study involved a group of patients from an intensive cardiac care unit who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy. The study lasted for more than two years, in the period from 2018 until 2020. The Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC) and the Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOSS) were applied. Additionally, the patients were examined using Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), and a thirst intensity scale; ultimately, relationships between these factors and delirium were examined. Results: In patients who underwent ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy, delirium was confirmed by the NuDESC in 68.75% of patients in the evening hours, while it was measured by the DOSS scale in 84.38% of patients in the morning. The study found that ECMO delirium was not associated with hyperactivity, sleep disturbance, sedation, pain, or thirst. Conclusion: Delirium in patients undergoing ECMO therapy was confirmed by both the NuDESC and DOSS. Factors such as thirst and sleep disturbance after ECMO therapy were shown to influence the occurrence of delirium. The diagnosis of delirium using standardized scales is possible provided that more tests are carried out.

This paper presents a research method based on virtual reality technology 3D-CTA in intracranial aneurysm surgery, including the application overview of 3D-CTA in intracranial aneurysm surgery and the virtual reality algorithm based on 3D-CTA for intracranial arteries. In addition, there is also the application of virtual reality CTA technology in the design of the intracranial aneurysm application system. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of 3D-CTA diagnosis based on virtual reality is 90.81%, and it can be put into use in the next step.","Li, Zhilei; Huo, Guojin; Feng, Yi; Ma, Zhulin",J Healthc Eng,376,1

Our group previously demonstrated that the immunostimulatory effects of CMP-001 are dependent on an anti-Qβ antibody response which results in opsonization of CMP-001 and uptake by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that then produce interferon (IFN)-α. IFN-α then leads to an antitumor T-cell response that is responsible for the in vivo efficacy of CMP-001. Here, we explore mechanisms by which the initial effects of CMP-001 on pDCs activate other cells that can contribute to development of an antitumor T-cell response. METHODS: Uptake of CMP-001 by various peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations and response to anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 were evaluated by flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. Purified monocytes were treated with anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 or recombinant IFN-α to evaluate direct and secondary effects of anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 on monocytes. RESULTS: Monocytes had the highest per cell uptake of anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 with lower levels of uptake by pDCs and other cell types. Treatment of PBMCs with anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 induced upregulation of IFN-responsive genes including CXCL10, PDL1, and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression by monocytes. Most of the impact of anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 on monocytes was indirect and mediated by IFN-α, but uptake of anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 altered the monocytic response to IFN-α and resulted in enhanced expression of PDL1, IDO, and CD80 and suppressed expression of CXCL10. These changes included an enhanced ability to induce autologous CD4 T-cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 induces IFN-α production by pDCs which has secondary effects on a variety of cells including monocytes. Uptake of anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 by monocytes alters their response to IFN-α, resulting in enhanced expression of PDL1, IDO and CD80 and suppressed expression of CXCL10. Despite aspects of an immunosuppressive phenotype, these monocytes demonstrated increased ability to augment autologous CD4 T-cell proliferation. These findings shed light on the complexity of the mechanism of action of anti-Qβ-coated CMP-001 and provide insight into pathways that may be targeted to further enhance the efficacy of this novel approach to immunotherapy.","Sabree, Shakoora A; Voigt, Andrew P; Blackwell, Sue E; Vishwakarma, Ajaykumar; Chimenti, Michael S; Salem, Aliasger K; Weiner, George J",J Immunother Cancer,376,31

However, certain conditions can predispose the organism to the overgrowth of specific pathogens that further lead to opportunistic infections. One of the most common such imbalances in the normal oral flora is the excessive growth of Candida spp., which produces oral candidiasis. In immunocompromised individuals, this fungal infection can reach the systemic level and become life-threatening. Hence, prompt and efficient treatment must be administered. Traditional antifungal agents, such as polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins, may often result in severe adverse effects, regardless of the administration form. Therefore, novel treatments have to be developed and implemented in clinical practice. In this regard, the present paper focuses on the newest therapeutic options against oral Candida infections, reviewing compounds and biomaterials with inherent antifungal properties, improved materials for dental prostheses and denture adhesives, drug delivery systems, and combined approaches towards developing the optimum treatment.","Gheorghe, Dan Cristian; Niculescu, Adelina-Gabriela; Bîrcă, Alexandra Cătălina; Grumezescu, Alexandru Mihai",Pharmaceutics,376,1

In this regard, insights into the immunomodulatory properties of antiangiogenic agents may help designing multidrug schedules based on specific immune synergisms. METHODS: We used orthogonal transcriptomic and phenotyping platforms combined with functional analytic pipelines to elucidate the immunomodulatory effect of the antiangiogenic agent pazopanib in mRCC patients. Nine patients were studied longitudinally over a period of 6 months. We also analyzed transcriptional data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RCC cohort (N = 571) to assess the prognostic implications of our findings. The effect of pazopanib was assessed in vitro on NK cells and T cells. Additionally, myeloid‐derived suppressor (MDSC)‐like cells were generated from CD14(+) monocytes transfected with mimics of miRNAs associated with MDSC function in the presence or absence of pazopanib. RESULTS: Pazopanib administration caused a rapid and dramatic reshaping in terms of frequency and transcriptional activity of multiple blood immune cell subsets, with a downsizing of MDSC and regulatory T cells in favor of a strong enhancement in PD‐1 expressing cytotoxic T and Natural Killer effectors. These changes were paired with an increase of the expression of transcripts reflecting activation of immune‐effector functions. This immunomodulation was marked but transient, peaking at the third month of treatment. Moreover, the intratumoral expression level of a MDSC signature (MDSC INT) was strongly associated with poor prognosis in RCC patients. In vitro experiments indicate that the observed immunomodulation might be due to an inhibitory effect on MDSC‐mediated suppression, rather than a direct effect on NK and T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The marked but transient nature of this immunomodulation, peaking at the third month of treatment, provides the rationale for the use of antiangiogenics as a preconditioning strategy to improve the efficacy of ICB.","Rinchai, Darawan; Verzoni, Elena; Huber, Veronica; Cova, Agata; Squarcina, Paola; De Cecco, Loris; de Braud, Filippo; Ratta, Raffaele; Dugo, Matteo; Lalli, Luca; Vallacchi, Viviana; Rodolfo, Monica; Roelands, Jessica; Castelli, Chiara; Chaussabel, Damien; Procopio, Giuseppe; Bedognetti, Davide; Rivoltini, Licia",Clin Transl Med,376,13

Lung-protective ventilation (LPV) has been proven to improve perioperative oxygenation and lung compliance in some critical patients. This study aimed to investigate whether intraoperative LPV could improve respiratory function and prevent postoperative complications in emergency TBI patients. METHODS: Ninety TBI patients were randomly allocated to three groups (1:1:1): Group A, conventional mechanical ventilation [tidal volume (VT) 10 mL/kg only]; Group B, small VT (8 mL/kg) + positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (5 cmH(2)O); and Group C, small VT (8 mL/kg) + PEEP (5 cmH(2)O) + recruitment maneuvers (RMs). The primary outcome was the incidence of total postoperative pulmonary complications; Secondary outcomes were intraoperative respiratory mechanics parameters and serum levels of brain injury markers, and the incidence of each postoperative pulmonary and neurological complication. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients completed the final analysis. The intraoperative PaO(2) and dynamic pulmonary compliance of Groups B and C were higher than those of Group A (P = 0.028; P = 0.005), while their airway peak pressure and plateau pressure were lower than those of group A (P = 0.004; P = 0.005). Compared to Group A, Groups B and C had decreased 30-day postoperative incidences of total pulmonary complications, hypoxemia, pulmonary infection, and atelectasis (84.0 % vs. 57.1 % vs. 53.8 %, P = 0.047; 52.0 % vs. 14.3 % vs. 19.2 %, P = 0.005; 84.0 % vs. 50.0 % vs. 42.3 %, P = 0.006; 24.0 % vs. 3.6 % vs. 0.0 %, P = 0.004). Moreover, intraoperative hypotension was more frequent in Group C than in Groups A and B (P = 0.007). At the end of surgery, the serum levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1 in Group B were lower than those in Groups A and C (P = 0.002; P < 0.001). The postoperative incidences of neurological complications among the three groups were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous intraoperative administration of small VT + PEEP is beneficial to TBI patients. Additional RMs can be performed with caution to prevent disturbances in the stability of cerebral hemodynamics.

The most severe outcome for migrant workers is death by suicide—a major cause of premature death among migrant workers. Nevertheless, in the literature, key factors associated with suicide among Nepalese migrant workers are not specifically identified. Thus, we aimed to delineate the main suicide risk factors for this group of migrants. (2) Methods: We used qualitative research methodology (sample = 20; male =17, female = 3) and employed nominal group techniques to identify the perceived primary risk factors for suicide. (3) Results: Study participants identified and ranked eight sources of distress and perceived risks for suicide, both from home and in the host country. Perceived risks for suicide include a complex set of socio-cultural, behavioral, occupational, physical, and mental health issues as well as communication barriers. (4) Conclusions: The findings suggest the need to design tailored mental health promotion programs for migrant workers before departure from Nepal as well as after arrival as migrant workers in South Korea.","Atteraya, Madhu Sudhan; Ebrahim, Nasser B.; Gnawali, Shreejana",Int J Environ Res Public Health,376,1

Despite extensive research into MECP2 function, no treatments for RTT are currently available. Here, we used an evolutionary genomics approach to construct an unbiased MECP2 gene network, using 1028 eukaryotic genomes to prioritize proteins with strong co-evolutionary signatures with MECP2. Focusing on proteins targeted by FDA-approved drugs led to three promising targets, two of which were previously linked to MECP2 function (IRAK, KEAP1) and one that was not (EPOR). The drugs targeting these three proteins (Pacritinib, DMF, and EPO) were able to rescue different phenotypes of MECP2 inactivation in cultured human neural cell types, and appeared to converge on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in inflammation. This study highlights the potential of comparative genomics to accelerate drug discovery, and yields potential new avenues for the treatment of RTT.","Unterman, Irene; Bloch, Idit; Cazacu, Simona; Kazimirsky, Gila; Ben-Zeev, Bruria; Berman, Benjamin P; Brodie, Chaya; Tabach, Yuval",,376,1

We developed a new electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based multiplexed assay and compared its performance to two commercial Bordetella pertussis ELISA kits and to historical in-house ELISAs. METHODS: The ECL assay quantifies serum concentrations of antibodies against four B. pertussis antigens: pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (PRN), and fimbrial agglutinogen (FIM). The assay was validated for precision, accuracy, dilutability, lower limit of quantification, and specificity. Sera from a clinical trial (CTRI/2016/11/007434) were used to compare the ECL assay to two commercial ELISA kits available from GenWay BioTech and Demeditec Diagnostics for accuracy, linearity, specificity, and concordance to both internal (WWO-2-043) and international (NIBSC 06/140) references. Sera from four clinical trials (NCT02587520, NCT00255047, NCT00347958, NCT01346293) were used to compare the concordance to clinical ELISAs. Informed consent was ensured prior to using any sera. RESULTS: Precision, accuracy, dilutability, lower limit of quantification, and specificity were demonstrated for the ECL assay. Concordance between the ECL assay and established clinical ELISAs was met for antibody responses to PT, FIM, and PRN, but not for FHA. The ECL assay demonstrated higher accuracy and linearity than the ELISA kits. While concordance between the ECL and commercial kits was low, the ECL assay better distinguished between pre- and post-vaccination clinical samples. CONCLUSION: The new ECL assay was validated for the quantitative evaluation of anti-PT, anti-FHA, anti-FIM, and anti-PRN IgG antibodies in samples from clinical trials, and demonstrated equivalent or better performance than two commercially available ELISA kits.","Varghese, Kucku; Bartlett, William; Zheng, Lingyi; Bookhout, Shawn; Vincent, Deanne; Huleatt, James; Brown, Monique; Mangarule, Somnath; Noriega, Fernando; Hodge, Shekema",Infect Dis Ther,376,1

An electronic search was conducted on three platforms (i.e., OVID®, Web of Science®, SciELO) as well as on the proceedings of the International Colloquium on Paratuberculosis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined a priori and conserved through the systematic process and only articles published in peer-reviewed journals were considered. A total of 26 articles met the definitive inclusion criteria. All were published in English, in 15 different journals, and between 1989 and 2020. The relevant articles reported the use of six different genotyping techniques (i.e., polymerase chain reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism, type-specific-PCR, mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units-variable number of tandem repeats, multi-locus short sequence repeat, single nucleotide polymorphism) in isolates from seven countries. Genotypes found so far in the region using typing techniques were mainly C type. MIRU-VNTR mostly reported INMV 1, INMV 2, and INMV 11 subtypes, among others. MLSSR reported genotypes from four different countries, reporting nine different subtypes of which 7g–10g–4ggt was the most common for loci 1, 2, and 8, respectively.

We investigated the effect of two exercise modes on CPR effectiveness and physiological outputs. After 4 min baseline conditions, 30 lifeguards randomly performed a 100 m run and a combined water rescue before 4 min CPR (using an adult manikin and a 30:2 compression–ventilation ratio). Physiological variables were continuously measured during baseline and CPR using a portable gas analyzer (K4b(2), Cosmed, Rome, Italy) and CPR effectiveness was analyzed using two HD video cameras. Higher oxygen uptake (23.0 ± 9.9 and 20.6 ± 9.1 vs. 13.5 ± 6.2 mL·kg·min(−1)) and heart rate (137 ± 19 and 133 ± 15 vs. 114 ± 15 bpm), and lower compression efficacy (63.3 ± 29.5 and 62.2 ± 28.3 vs. 69.2 ± 28.0%), were found for CPRrun and CPRswim compared to CPRbase. In addition, ventilation efficacy was higher in the rescues preceded by intense exercise than in CPRbase (49.5 ± 42.3 and 51.9 ± 41.0 vs. 33.5 ± 38.3%), but no differences were detected between CPRrun and CPRswim. In conclusion, CPRrun and CPRswim protocols induced a relevant physiological stress over each min and in the overall CPR compared with CPRbase. The CPRun protocol reduces the compression rate but has a higher effectiveness percentage than the CPRswim protocol, in which there is a considerably higher compression rate but with less efficacy.","Abraldes, J.

Recent genome-wide studies have mapped thousands of origins in animal and plant cells, but without yielding a distinct and universal consensus sequence. However, origin-associated regions with particular base composition features have been identified, such as the G-rich OGRE motif, predicted to form G-quadruplexes. Epigenetic marks such as histone modifications that promote open chromatin also favor origin formation. Before DNA replication can initiate at origins, they need to be “licensed” by the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) and other proteins to form pre-replication and pre-initiation complexes. Origin-associated proteins are themselves subject to multilayered regulation, notably by posttranslational modification and proteasomal degradation. Origins are organized into replicons and replicon clusters, whose firing occurs at discrete subnuclear bodies known as replication foci. A still poorly characterized nuclear matrix structure might be involved in the attachment of replication units and the formation of replication foci. Preferential genomic sequences responsible for these attachments have been reported, as well as factors playing roles in their regulation. There appears to be great flexibility in the choice of origins used in each S-phase, being affected by factors including cell identity and replication stresses. Origin selection also changes dramatically during embryogenesis in concert with developmental signaling pathways. Dysregulation of origin positioning and recognition are implicated in human disease, as mutations in origin-binding proteins have been found in developmental disorders, and expansions in repeat-containing genomic regions promote genome instability. This chapter summarizes current understanding about replication origins, the most recent discoveries, and outlines key unanswered questions in this exciting field.","Hutchins, James R.

One of the main techniques is overlapping genes. We model this process by the shortest common superstring problem, that is, we look for the shortest genome which still contains all genes. We give an algorithm for computing optimal solutions which is slow in the number of strings but fast (linear) in their total length. This algorithm is used for a number of viruses with relatively few genes.

The immunocompromised state of many cancer patients constitutes the basis for the frequent failure of the host to promote a normal and rapid recovery from an acute respiratory viral infection and results in a more severe and prolonged infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in these patients. Those respiratory viruses that are most prevalent and most prone to produce lower respiratory illnesses and pneumonia in healthy hosts, RSV, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses, are those most likely to cause severe illness and pneumonia leading to hospitalization in immunocompromised persons. However, viruses less prone to produce a lower respiratory illness but that are highly prevalent, such as rhinoviruses, may frequently be associated with severe illness. The limited availability of antivirals and vaccines for the acute respiratory viruses means that these infections will continue to be important for many years and dictate a need for utilizing infection control procedures as much as possible, particularly in hospitals and institutions, so as to minimize spread. Efforts to develop specific vaccines are important as their use could prevent as well as reduce exposure of cancer patients to these viruses. Development of specific antivirals is important for use in immunocompromised patients as normal recovery mechanisms may be seriously impaired.","Chemaly, Roy F.; Rathod, Dhanesh B.; Couch, Robert",Principles and Practice of Cancer Infectious Diseases,376,1

One health is thus at the intersection of human, animal, and environment health, and in the one health paradigm, these three different domains merge into one superposed and universal goal. The number of outbreaks around the world is increasing, in terms of total number and diversity of outbreaks and the richness of pathological agents. Identifying the origin of these outbreaks is important to ensure appropriate capacity to respond to potentially pandemic threats. Many (re-)emerging pathogens come from animals, and there is a compelling need to understand the epidemiology of these diseases, including the role of animals as disease reservoirs. In parallel, the progressive phasing out of antibiotics in animal foods around the world has been achieved through active collaboration of physicians and veterinarians, and it is to be hoped that this continued interaction will help align human and veterinary medicine with the objectives of the one health paradigm.

It is typically characterized by four main (cardinal) symptoms: spiking fever ≥39 °C, arthralgia or arthritis, skin rash, and hyperleukocytosis (≥10,000 cells/mm(3)). However, many other clinical features are possible, and it can appear in all age groups with potentially severe inflammatory onset accompanied by a broad spectrum of disease manifestation and complications. Hence, it remains a diagnostic challenge, and the clinician should first rule out infectious, tumoral, or inflammatory differential diagnoses. Determination of the total and glycosylated ferritin levels, although not pathognomonic, can help in diagnosis. New biomarkers have recently been described, but they need to be validated. The disease evolution of AoSD can be monocyclic, polycyclic, or chronic. In chronic disease, a joint involvement is often predominant, and erosions are noted in one-third of patients. Many progresses have been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis over the last decades. This chapter provides a comprehensive insight into the complex and heterogeneous nature of AoSD describing the identified cytokine signaling pathways and biomarkers. It also discusses the current evidence for the usage of biologics in AoSD to provide guidance for treatment decisions, taking into account both the efficacy and the safety of the different therapeutic options.","Mitrovic, Stéphane; Feist, Eugen; Fautrel, Bruno",Periodic and Non-Periodic Fevers,376,1

Zachman proposed the Zachman Framework for Enterprise Architecture (ZFEA), a descriptive, holistic representation of an enterprise for the purposes of providing insights and understanding. Some scholars claim that EA is an imperative to ensure successful business structures or business-IT alignment, or more recently with Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM), to manage required organizational transformation. However, EA initiatives within companies are often costly and the expected return on investment is not realized. In fact, Gartner recently indicated in their 2018 Enterprise Architecture Hype Cycle that EA is slowly emerging from the trough of disillusionment after nearly a decade. In this paper we argue that the role and value of EA is often misunderstood, and that EA, specifically the ZFEA for the purpose of this paper, could be considered as a theory given the view of theory within Information Systems (IS). The purpose of IS theories is to analyse, predict, explain and/or prescribe and it could be argued that EA often conform to these purposes. Using the taxonomy of theories as well as the structural components of theory within IS as proposed by Gregor, we motivate that the ZFEA could be regarded as an explanatory theory. Positioning ZFEA as IS explanatory theory provides insight into the role and purpose of the ZFEA (and by extension EA), and could assist researchers and practitioners with mediating the challenges experienced when instituting EA and EAM initiatives within organizations.","Gerber, Aurona; le Roux, Pierre; Kearney, Carike; van der Merwe, Alta","Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",376,1

The virus has a centrally situated nucleic acid, which is encased within a capsid consisting of a protein core. Viruses are obligatory intracellular microorganisms that live inside cells, using components of the nucleic acid and protein generating system of the host to replicate and trigger cell destruction leading to diseases. Alternatively, the host’s defense mechanisms lead to cell destruction in an attempt to clear cells infected by the viruses. The nucleic acid is RNA or DNA, which may be single-stranded or double-stranded [1]. The pathophysiology of viral infections may be attributed to the degeneration and cellular necrosis of the infected cells, leading to local and systemic inflammatory responses. The body’s defense mechanisms include phagocytosis, humoral and cell-mediated responses and the production of interferons [2]. Interferons prevent the local spread of viruses, whereas antibodies prevent viremia, ensure long-term immunity and sensitize infected cells to be destroyed by T-cells and macrophages [3, 4]. Cell-mediated immunity leads to an increase in cytotoxic cells that then release lymphokines, including interferon.","Amin, P.; Amin, V.",Annual Update in Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine 2015,376,1

The pooled small-RNA samples of each group were sequenced on Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) sequencer and the data were analyzed for differential expression. RESULTS: Here we identified 274 known miRNAs with bovine homologs and 36 novel mature-star miRNAs from the sequnces of small RNA libraries. Overall 195 miRNAs were common to all the three groups. Certain miRNAs such as bta-miR-21-5p, −26a, −29a/b, −30d − 103, − 140, − 150, − 191, − 374, − 1434-5p,-1260b, − 2484 and let-7 members were abundantly expressed in diseased groups. Bta-miR-1434-5p, − 188, −200c were up-regulated (> 1.5 folds) while bta-miR-27a-5p, −34b and -2285x were down-regulated (> 100 folds) in Brucellosis group. In Johne’s Disease group, only 3 miRNAs (bta-miR-1434-5p, − 2340 and − 2484) were up-regulated (> 1.5 folds). The functional classification of miRNA target genes into gene ontology (GO) terms indicated their involvement in innate immunity and cellular process of disease pathogenesis. Expression profile of four differentially expressed miRNAs (bta-miR-9-5p, − 677, − 331-3p and − 2440) and eight predicted target-genes were validated through reverse transcriptase qPCR.

The model is a collection of functional fuzzy rules with affine consequents capable to express the nonlinear relationships encountered in interval-valued data. An application concerning one-step-ahead forecast of interval-valued EUR/USD exchange rate using actual data is also addressed. The forecast performance of the fuzzy rule-based model is compared to that of traditional econometric time series methods and alternative interval models employing statistical criteria for both, low and high exchange rate prices.

However, evidence demonstrates major inaccuracies in the use of the term “sepsis” in clinical practice, coding, and research. Current and previous definitions of sepsis have been developed using expert consensus but the specific criteria used to identify children with sepsis have not been rigorously evaluated. Therefore, as part of the Society of Critical Care Medicine’s Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce, we will conduct a systematic review to synthesize evidence on individual factors, clinical criteria, or illness severity scores that may be used to identify children with infection who have or are at high risk of developing sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and separately those factors, criteria, and scores that may be used to identify children with sepsis who are at high risk of progressing to multiple organ dysfunction or death. DATA SOURCES: We will identify eligible studies by searching the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION: We will include all randomized trials and cohort studies published between January 1, 2004, and March 16, 2020. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extraction will include information related to study characteristics, population characteristics, clinical criteria, and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: We will calculate sensitivity and specificity of each criterion for predicting sepsis and conduct a meta-analysis if the data allow. We will also provide pooled estimates of overall hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors, clinical criteria, and illness severity scores from this review which identify patients with infection who are at high risk of developing sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and/or progressing to multiple organ dysfunction or death will be used to inform the next steps of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.","Menon, Kusum; Schlapbach, Luregn J.; Akech, Samuel; Argent, Andrew; Chiotos, Kathleen; Chisti, Mohammod Jobayer; Hamid, Jemila; Ishimine, Paul; Kissoon, Niranjan; Lodha, Rakesh; Oliveira, Cláudio Flauzino; Peters, Mark; Tissieres, Pierre; Watson, R.

Our approach does not require committing to a single inflexible compilation strategy and instead makes it straightforward to create domain-specific code translators. In addition to a small set of core definitions, our framework is a large, user-extensible collection of compilation rules each phrased to handle specific language constructs, code patterns, or data manipulations. By mixing and matching these pieces of logic, users can easily tailor extraction to their own domains and programs, getting maximum performance and ensuring correctness of the resulting assembly code. Using this approach, we complete the first proof-generating pipeline that goes automatically from high-level specifications to assembly code. In our main case study, the original specifications are phrased to resemble SQL-style queries, while the final assembly code does manual memory management, calls out to foreign data structures and functions, and is suitable to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. The pipeline runs entirely within the Coq proof assistant, leading to final, linked assembly code with overall full-functional-correctness proofs in separation logic.","Pit-Claudel, Clément; Wang, Peng; Delaware, Benjamin; Gross, Jason; Chlipala, Adam",Automated Reasoning,376,1

However, the lack of interpretability of these models has painfully impeded their practical applications, as their outputs and working mechanisms suffer from the intransparent decision process and complex inner structures. We thus propose to adopt the post-hoc method to tackle the interpretability issue for deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models. Specifically, we focus on applying the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method to interpret RNN-based DLKT model by backpropagating the relevance from the model’s output layer to its input layer. The experiment results show the feasibility using the LRP method for interpreting the DLKT model’s predictions, and partially validate the computed relevance scores. We believe it can be a solid step towards fully interpreting the DLKT models and promote their practical applications.","Lu, Yu; Wang, Deliang; Meng, Qinggang; Chen, Penghe",Artificial Intelligence in Education,376,1

To address these issues, we develop a task-oriented dialogue system to help teachers and parents identify students’ need deficiency through multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, relevant factors of need deficiency are summarized based on psychology theories, which provides a theoretical foundation for the newly proposed system. In addition, reinforcement learning methodology is adopted to learn dialogue policy to serve the designed dialogue system.

The leakage model is commonly generated with traces from an “open device”, assuming that a model which works for one device should work for another copy as well. In practice, applying a leakage model to a different copy of the same device (commonly called portability) is a hard problem to deal with, as intrinsic differences in the devices or the experimental setups used to obtain the traces cause behavioural variations which lead to an unsuccessful attack. In this paper we propose a novel similarity assessment technique that allows evaluators to quantify the differences among various copies of the same device. Moreover, we support this technique with actual experiments to show that this metric is directly related to the portability issue. Finally, we derive a method that improves the performance of template attacks.","Rioja, Unai; Batina, Lejla; Armendariz, Igor",Progress in Cryptology - AFRICACRYPT 2020,376,1

Tracing and obtaining the resultant paths is the main problem in path coverage testing. Evolutionary techniques are adopted in many software product evaluation methods such as generating and selection of input test data. The priority of the feasible paths is also to be determined. In this paper, we proposes an optimization algorithm for identifying the effective test data execution paths in control flow graph for the program module under test and finding the most efficient test paths using modified smell detection agent based optimization algorithm. New innovations are being conducted for bio-motivated algorithmic techniques from the characteristics of animal behavior. Smell detection agent based algorithm helps to identify most feasible paths and it uses sequential search to obtain all paths in a graph. The tester achieves the paths to be tested through a number of smell spot values from the source node to the target node. We will use control flow graph to produce perfect test paths and cyclomatic complexity number for obtaining the number of feasible test paths. The best feasible paths are prioritized using smell detection agent algorithm such that all the paths are thoroughly tested which ensures structural testing. This algorithm generates paths equal to the cyclomatic complexity. It can be illustrated that the proposed approach guarantees full path coverage.","S, Saju Sankar; S S, Vinod Chandra",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,376,1

Generalized seizures are the most common type in the patients. Opportunistic infections are a stereotypical predisposing factor for seizures in HIV patients, but a variety of pathogenic factors can also be found in these patients, such as metabolic perturbation and drug-drug interactions. The diagnostic criteria for seizures in these patients are the same as those in the general population. As HIV patients with seizures need to take both antivirals and antiepileptic drugs, the risk of drug-drug interactions is greatly increased, and the side effects of drugs may also become more prominent. At present, most experience in antiepileptic drug usage has come from the general population, and there is still a lack of guidance of antiepileptic drug use in special groups such as the HIV-infected people. Unlike the old-generation drugs that involve metabolisms through CYP450, the first-line antiepileptic drugs usually bypass CYP450, thus having less drug-drug interactions.

In some cases, families request continued organ support after NDD. Conflicts can escalate to formal legal challenges, causing emotional, financial, and moral distress for all involved. We describe prevalence, characteristics, and common experiences with requests for continued organ support following NDD in Canada. METHODS: Mixed-methods design combining anonymous online survey with semi-structured interviews of Canadian critical care physicians (448 practitioners, adult and pediatric). RESULTS: One hundred and six physicians responded to the survey and 12 participated in an interview. Fifty-two percent (55/106) of respondents had encountered a request for continued organ support after NDD within two years, 47% (26/55) of which involved threat of legal action. Requests for continued support following NDD ranged from appeals for time for family to gather before ventilator removal to disagreement with the concept of NDD. Common responses to requests included: consultation with an additional physician (54%), consultation with spiritual services (41%), and delay of one to three days for NDD acceptance (49%). Respondents with prior experience were less likely to recommend ancillary tests (P = 0.004) or consultation with bioethics services (P = 0.004). Qualitative analysis revealed perceptions that requests for continued organ support were driven by mistrust, tensions surrounding decision-making, and cultural differences rather than a lack of specific information about NDD. CONCLUSIONS: Family requests for continued somatic support following NDD were encountered by half our sample of Canadian critical care physicians.

Subject to the new coronavirus pandemic, nationalists have adopted extreme national security policies, namely, “the nation’s interests prevails;” globalists have adopted moderate policies by complying with the faith of society in the recommendations of the scientific community. The disparate contrasts in values and actions between the two groups are extensively manifested in domestic disease control, attitude toward the World Health Organization, identification of the disease’s source, vaccine research, international cooperation, and social reaction. This research indicates that nationalists largely consist of conservative country leaders, “social elites,” populists, and individuals in the middle-lower class, many of whom uphold racism and extreme nationalism, and that globalists largely consist of international organizations and regional leaders, medical practitioners, intellectuals and philanthropic entrepreneurs, the middle-upper class population. This social group distinction is clarified in accordance with converse ethical value perspectives, ideologies, social group-economic interests, and even national competition positions. Regarding cultural and institutional basics, nationalists uphold neoliberalism, social Darwinism, the law of jungle, and individualism, whereas globalists advocate for social democracy and collectivistic ethnic codes.

Furthermore, Taurisolo® was able to induce autophagic process via increasing the expression of LC3II, a protein marker involved in formation of autophagosome and ex novo synthesis of sphingomyelin, ceramides, and their metabolites both in HG- and THG-H9c2 cells. Finally, Taurisolo® reduced hypertrophy and induced differentiation of HG-H9C2 cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells. These data suggest that Taurisolo® counteracts the toxicity induced by TMAO and HG concentrations increasing autophagic process and activating de novo sphingolipid synthesis, resulting in a morphological cell remodeling. In conclusion, our results allow speculating that Taurisolo®, combined with energy restriction, may represent a useful nutraceutical approach for prevention of cardiomyopathy in obese subjects.","Lama, Stefania; Monda, Vincenzo; Rizzo, Maria Rosaria; Dacrema, Marco; Maisto, Maria; Annunziata, Giuseppe; Tenore, Gian Carlo; Novellino, Ettore; Stiuso, Paola",Oxid Med Cell Longev,376,1

However, in terms of overall percentages, the releases have been less significant. In India, prisons are overcrowded with nearly 70% under trials. With very poor sanitation and healthcare facilities, there are numerous deaths in custody due to various illnesses, including heart, lung, liver and kidney-related ailments as well as HIV, tuberculosis and cancer. It is in this context that the need to take urgent steps to contain the spread of the contagion inside prisons became apparent to the prison authorities around the time the national lockdown was announced by the Government of India. Some of the measures taken by prison departments include creation of temporary prisons to admit new prisoners and keep them in quarantine for 14 days before transferring them to the regular prisons, transfer of prisoners from congested prisons to less crowded prisons, making prisoners aware of the virus, setting up Corona care centres inside or outside prisons, etc. While prison authorities claim that they were taking necessary preventive steps within existing limitations, there has been some criticism of the inadequacy of these measures and the conditions inside prisons. The Supreme Court of India took suo moto cognizance of the issue and asked state governments to constitute a High Powered Committees to identify categories of prisoners who could be released. The article highlights that the criteria for release was based on the purported seriousness of the offence rather than vulnerability to getting infected. Also, the absence of gender disaggregated data on release of prisoners indicates the lack of importance given to the needs of women prisoners. It can be said that the policies and measures taken towards preventing the spread of COVID 19 pandemic in prisons has reinforced existing biases against prisoners. The major concern of the prison and judicial authorities was to somehow manage the situation without disturbing the ‘dangerousness’ and risk to ‘law and order’ narrative about prisoners. The article concludes by drawing attention to the fact that the Foucauldian principles of segregation, segmentation and surveillance were maintained in the decision making processes relating to treatment of prisoners during the pandemic.","Raghavan, Vijay",J,376,17

Exercise is a crucial component of maintaining good health in older individuals. The COVID-19 stay-at-home orders forced Veterans actively engaged in facility-based exercise to stop attending in-person group exercise programs like Gerofit. Objective. To compare the characteristics of Veterans who enrolled (E) or declined enrollment (DE) in the transition from a facility-based exercise program, Gerofit, to a virtual Gerofit-to-Home (GTH) program. Methods. Gerofit is a supervised exercise “VA Best Practice” program for older Veterans implemented at 17 VA medical centers around the country. At the time of COVID-19 mandated closures, 1149 Veterans were actively engaged in facility-based programs and invited to attend GTH classes. Comparisons between those enrolling and those declining enrollment were performed by t-tests. Results. Three hundred and eight of 1149 (27%) Veterans made the transition to telehealth delivered classes, with several sites having enrolled participants aged in their mid-nineties. Age was not associated with GTH adoption rates (74.0 vs. 74.7, p=not significant for E vs. NE). Body mass index (31.3 vs. 30.5 kg/m2, p<0.05), gait speed (1.19 vs. 1.12 m/s, p<0.001), arm curls (20.8 vs. 19.5, p<0.001), and chair stands (14.7 vs. 13.2, p<0.05) were higher in individuals actively participating in GTH compared to those that never enrolled. Conclusions. Some older adults can adopt a virtual approach to group-based exercise, demonstrating its feasibility. Further research is needed to improve GTH implementation for lower functioning individuals. Virtual group-based exercise could reduce negative health effects associated with isolation due to lack of in-person exercise.","Mateas, Catalin; Bettger, Janet; Jennings, Stephen; Manning, Kenneth; Hall, Katherine; Pearson, Megan; Morey, Miriam",Innov Aging,376,1

The economic slowdown and loss of employment have resulted in widespread food insecurity. There are also concerns that this might have long-lasting effects on the nutrition status of the population. In this context, government support through schemes such as the PDS plays an important role. While there have been some interventions through these schemes towards providing food and cash support to people, there are many gaps. The availability of high food stocks can be used as an opportunity to provide a universal PDS which is the need of the hour. Other issues such as expanding the PDS to include pulses and oils, decentralised procurement, universal food support through school meals and ICDS, and enhanced cash transfers through social security schemes also need to be ensured.","Sinha, Dipa",J,376,1

In our previous study, two homologous σ(54) factors, RpoN1 and RpoN2, were identified in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causative agent of bacterial leaf blight in rice. However, their functional roles, i.e., whether they exert combined or independent effects, remain unknown. In the current study, rpoN1 or rpoN2 deletion in Xoo significantly disrupted bacterial swimming motility, flagellar assembly, and virulence. Transcriptome analysis led to the identification of 127 overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) regulated by both RpoN1 and RpoN2. Furthermore, GO and KEGG classification demonstrated that these DEGs were highly enriched in flagellar assembly, chemotaxis, and c-di-GMP pathways. Interestingly, ropN1 deletion decreased ropN2 transcription, while rpoN2 deletion did not affect ropN1 transcription. No interaction between the rpoN2 promoter and RpoN1 was detected, suggesting that RpoN1 indirectly regulates rpoN2 transcription. In addition, RpoN1-regulated DEGs were specially enriched in ribosome, carbon, and nitrogen metabolism pathways. Besides, bacterial growth was remarkably repressed in ΔrpoN1 but not in ΔrpoN2. Taken together, this study demonstrates the overlapping and unique regulatory roles of RpoN1 and RpoN2 in motility, virulence, growth and provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of σ(54) factors in Xoo.","Yu, Chao; Nguyen, Doan-Phuong; Yang, Fenghuan; Shi, Jia; Wei, Yiming; Tian, Fang; Zhao, Xiuxiang; Chen, Huamin",Front Microbiol,376,7

Evidence suggests that estrogen-signaling pathways are closely linked to cancer development and progression. The novel G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER or GPR30) has been shown to influence cancer predisposition and progression, although results of related studies remain equivocal. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to estimate the relationship between GPER gene polymorphisms and GPER expression levels, with cancer predisposition and progression. The pooled results showed that two GPER polymorphisms, rs3808350 and rs3808351, were significantly associated with cancer predisposition, especially in the Asian population, but no significant association was detected for rs11544331. In parallel, we also found that cancer aggressiveness and progression correlated with rs3808351 and GPER expression in cancerous tissues. Altogether, our findings suggest that GPER plays a pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis and progression. We suggest that rs3808350 and rs3808351 may be used as a prospective biomarker for cancer screening; while rs3808351 and GPER expression can be used to examine the prognosis of patients with cancer.

While efforts are on for containment of these diseases, many new viral diseases, especially those of zoonotic origin, were discovered in humans, often in newer geographical areas where diseases were not reported previously. It is now an established fact that with changes in society, demography, climatic patterns, global economy and trade, viral zoonoses have made a comeback. Many factors are responsible for the emergence of viral pathogens worldwide. These factors, known as ‘drivers’, are numerous and are complexly interlinked. Major drivers of the emergence include ecological perturbations caused by changes in agricultural practices, livestock husbandry, and developmental activities; global warming and changes in climatic patterns, various forces of globalization such as international travel, trade and commerce; human demographic changes augmented by rising population and urbanization, population mobility; human behavioural changes; microbial adaptation and evolution; changing technology and industrial practices; and deficiencies in public health infrastructure.

The latter, the typology of societies, is based on daily life satisfaction surveyed by the AsiaBarometer quality of life research carried out in 29 Asian societies with face-to-face interviewing and with the sample size of 800 to 2,000 in each of 29 Asian societies (Inoguchi and Fujii 2013; see also Appendix E). The typology of societies is based on factor analyzing people’s daily life satisfaction with 16 life items (domains, aspects and styles). It is a profile of societies from the bottom up rather than top down. Since both the typology of global quasi-legislative behavior has proved to be reasonably strongly related to the internal preferences of each society obtained by the World Value Survey through the world data used in Welzel 2013 and statistically examined positively in Inoguchi and Le, 2019, another data set of domestic daily life satisfaction collected in Sinic East societies in 2019 has been examined and proved to be reasonably related each other. One strong finding here is that those domestic preferences gauged on the experts’ assessment of regimes’ nature like democratic vs. authoritarian does not seem to work well in comparison to the daily life satisfaction in 16 items of domains, aspects and styles and the values and norms in concrete life situations.","Inoguchi, Takashi; Le, Lien Thi Quynh",Digitized Statecraft in Multilateral Treaty Participation,376,1

We also find that, during the Italian lockdown, provinces with high protest votes virtually disregarded all social distancing orders. On the contrary, in provinces with higher political support for the current political legislation, we found a higher degree of social distancing compliance. These results are robust to controlling for other factors, including time, geography, local COVID-19 cases and deaths, healthcare hospital beds, and other sociodemographic and economic characteristics.

We have accumulated enough evidence to demonstrate that job burnout has become a major problem within the field of healthcare. It is a response to prolonged exposure to occupational stressors, and it has serious consequences for healthcare professionals (HPs) and the organizations in which they work. Burnout is associated with sleep deprivation (Vela-Bueno et al., 2008), medical errors (Fahrenkopf et al., 2008; Prins et al., 2009; Shanafelt et al., 2010), poor quality of care (Linzer, 2018; Shirom, Nirel, & Vinokur, 2006), and low ratings of patient satisfaction (Vahey et al., 2004). Indeed, for US surgeons, burnout and depression were among the strongest factors related to reporting a recent major medical error (Shanafelt et al., 2011). Contrary to research findings and theory developments, there is growing acceptance among managers and the general public for viewing burnout as an individual failing while de-emphasizing the extent to which the syndrome reflects organizational and healthcare system shortcomings. The most recent meta-analysis in the field of burnout point to the fact there is a need for organisational solutions that address the factors that drive and maintain burnout (Panagioti et al., 2017). Unfortunately, the most common responses have put the responsibility on healthcare professionals to take better care of themselves, become more resilient, and cope with stressors on their own (Montgomery, Panagopoulou, Esmail, Richards, & Maslach, 2019).","Montgomery, Anthony J.; Van der Doef, Margot; Panagopoulou, Efharis; Leiter, Michael P.","Connecting Healthcare Worker Well-Being, Patient Safety and Organisational Change",376,1

Refinement for such abstractions is crucial as it allows improvements of a given component without compromising its compatibility with the rest of the system. In the context of session types, the most general notion of refinement is the asynchronous session subtyping, which allows to anticipate message emissions but only under certain conditions. In particular, asynchronous session subtyping rules out candidates subtypes that occur naturally in communication protocols where, e.g., two parties simultaneously send each other a finite but unspecified amount of messages before removing them from their respective buffers. To address this shortcoming, we study fair compliance over asynchronous session types and fair refinement as the relation that preserves it. This allows us to propose a novel variant of session subtyping that leverages the notion of controllability from service contract theory and that is a sound characterisation of fair refinement. In addition, we show that both fair refinement and our novel subtyping are undecidable. We also present a sound algorithm, and its implementation, which deals with examples that feature potentially unbounded buffering.","Bravetti, Mario; Lange, Julien; Zavattaro, Gianluigi",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,376,1

The issues investigated in this work include the amount (percentage) of errors from which a substantial adverse effect on the performance of the AI-systems can be observed, and how unreliable labeling can be done in the training stage. The goals of this work are to raise ethical concerns regarding the various types of errors that can possibly find their way into AI-systems, to demonstrate the effect of training errors, and to encourage development of techniques that can cope with the problem of errors, especially for AI-systems that perform sensitive medical-related tasks.","Kaplan, Shimon; Handelman, Doron; Handelman, Amir",AI Ethics,376,1

The literature is thus far divided regarding the effects of corruption: One hypothesis argues that corruption greases the wheels of government and is therefore beneficial while the other hypothesis argues that it sands the wheels of government leading to suboptimal results in an economy. For the empirical analysis, a dataset consisting of bilateral FDI data from the OECD and the control of corruption measure from the World Governance Indicators of the World Bank is compiled. To further analyze the effects of corruption the Panama Papers revelation is used as a corruption increasing event and the implementation into law of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention is used as a corruption decreasing event. Finally, the difference between corruption levels in the target and the origin country, will be examined. Then, a gravity model with dyadic and time-fixed effects is employed to analyze the data. Findings are ambiguous in that corruption is positively correlated with FDI inflows in the target country and negatively correlated with FDI inflows in the origin country. The Panama Papers variable shows strong evidence, that the release of the Panama Papers resulted in a drop in FDI flows. Therefore, it seems that corruption has complex country specific effects and that target and source countries have to adopt varying policies with regards to corruption. The general effect of corruption harms FDI flows, as shown by the Panama Papers revelation.","Zander, Tobias",Int Econ Econ Policy,376,16

Such traces can reveal how emotional interpretations of the environment in which national states operate shape and frame certain policy and strategic choices. Drawing on the concept of the “institutionalisation of empathy and fear” developed by Crawford (Int Theory 6(3):535–557, 2014), I first operationalise and then apply this concept to the Australian foreign policy. This framework is applied to the analysis of the foreign policy documents and strategies published by the Australian government in the last decade. In particular, I focus on Australia’s foreign policy articulation and interpretation of the internet and digital technologies. New, pressing problems are emerging in the digital environment due to a range of cybersecurity threats, including an increase in the frequency of automated accounts and the dissemination of fake news and digital propaganda. From perceiving the internet as a communication platform that allows for listening to and dialogue with foreign publics, Australian foreign policy is increasingly framing the internet as strategic infrastructure that requires defending and guarding. The attention is, thus, moving towards short-term ‘defensive’ goals—as a result of a higher perceived fear of the latest evolution in the geopolitical context. The shift in Australian foreign policy indicates a form of institutionalisation of fear in response to the challenges emerging from the digital environment. I conclude by arguing that a more belligerent international environment highlights the tension between national interest—which evolves and changes due to political shifts and contextual elements—and the understanding of public diplomacy engagement as mutual understanding and mutual influence.","Di Martino, Luigi",Place Brand Public Dipl,376,1

Simple and rapid risk stratification methods are mandatory to recognize severe patients. This study aims to highlight the simple available laboratory biomarkers of good predictive value for COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-one COVID-19 positive patients admitted to two University Hospitals between the 1st of June and the 31st of July 2020 were retrospectively collected and classified to severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients according to need for ICU admission. All basic laboratory biomarkers at time of admission were recorded. Of included patients, 145 (41.3%) needed ICU admission. Anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, NLR, and PLR together with liver enzymes, INR, ferritin, CRP, and D-dimer were significantly higher in patients needed ICU admission (p < 0.001). However, by applying multivariate logistic regression, only anemia, high NLR, high PLR, and high D-dimer levels showed significant risk for ICU admission with OR equal 3.6 (95% CI 1.8–7.0), 9.0 (95% CI 3.6–22.6), 3.0 (95% CI 1.3–7.1), and 2.5 (95% CI 1.3–4.7), respectively. CONCLUSION: Anemia, increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (> 8), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (> 192), and D-dimer level (> 0.9 mg\L) at time of admission could be simple available predictors for severe COVID-19 infection requiring ICU admission.","Hashem, Maiada K.; Khedr, Eman M.; Daef, Enas; Mohamed-Hussein, Aliae; Mostafa, Ehab F.; Hassany, Sahar M.; Galal, Hanan; Hassan, Shimaa Abbas; Galal, Islam; Amin, Mariam Taher; Hassan, Hebatallah M.",Egypt J Bronchol,376,1

However, they lead to the release of hydrogen sulfide. This in turn leads to the iron sulfide scale formation (pyrite). ATP sulfurylase is an enzyme present in SRB, which catalyzes the formation of adenylyl sulfate (APS) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPi) from ATP and sulfate. This reaction is the first among many in hydrogen sulfide production by D. postgatei. Consensus scoring using molecular docking and machine learning was used to identify three potential inhibitors of ATP sulfurylase from a database of about 40 million compounds. These selected hits ((S,E)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(9-((m-tolylimino)methyl)-9,10-dihydroanthracen-9-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione; methyl 2-[[(1S)-5-cyano-2-imino-1-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)-3-azaspiro[5.5]undec-4-en-4-yl]sulfanyl]acetate; and (4S)-4-(3-chloro-4-hydroxy-phenyl)-1-(6-hydroxypyridazin-3-yl)-3-methyl-4,5-dihydropyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-6-ol), known as A, B, and C, respectively) all had good binding affinities with ATP sulfurylase and were further analyzed for their toxicological properties. Compound A had the highest docking score. However, based on the physicochemical and toxicological properties, only compound C was predicted to be both safe and effective as a potential inhibitor of ATP sulfurylase, hence the preferred choice. The molecular interactions of compound C revealed favorable interactions with the following residues: LEU213, ASP308, ARG307, TRP347, LEU224, GLN212, MET211, and HIS309.","Onawole, Abdulmujeeb T.; Hussein, Ibnelwaleed A.; Saad, Mohammed A.; Ahmed, Musa E.M.; Nimir, Hassan",ACS Omega,376,1

The etiological agent of COVID‐19 is the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). SARS‐CoV‐2 infects the respiratory system's epithelial cells via the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, causing from non or mild symptoms to severe viral pneumonia, and in some cases, death. Based on evolving clinical evidence, it is now unfitting to label SARS‐CoV‐2 as just a respiratory virus, as lately, various reports substantiate its pathogenicity in other organs of the body, including the central nervous system (CNS). Despite conflicting results regarding ACE2 expression in brain tissue, the latest data show that ACE2 is robustly expressed by CNS cells, suggesting that CNS is a potential target for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type within the CNS and play a role in axon guidance and synaptic support, control the blood‐brain barrier flow, and regulate neuroinflammation. To test if SARS‐CoV‐2 can enter into the CNS via astrocytes and then elicit adverse neurological effects, we have initiated studies to test if astrocytes express ACE2 and whether SARS‐CoV‐2 can infect human astrocytes via this receptor. We have found that astrocytes robustly express ACE2 at the mRNA and protein levels. We are currently testing if astrocytes are susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which could subsequently lead to neuronal damage and possibly account for some of the neurological symptoms observed in COVID‐19 patients. We hope to contribute to gain insights into the mechanisms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in the CNS and its potential physiological effects with this work.","Costa, Ricardo; Burgos‐Ramos, Emma; Gomez Torres, Oscar; Cruz‐Topete, Diana",FASEB J,376,1

The academic discussion on defining resilience is thriving to create interdisciplinary understandings and meanings. Simultaneously, resilience has firmly entered into planning practice to address vulnerabilities and cities' exposure facing to present and future hazards particularly related to climate change effects. In the last twenty years, a growing number of cities are adopting local climate actions, and urban resilience is also gradually a crucial part of international and national policies worldwide. Despite the increasing attention to urban resilience, its implementation at the local scale and the required increasing ambition are still lagging, also due to a lack of dialogue among researchers (the scientific level), policy-makers (the normative level) and practitioners (the operational level). Following the 2018 CitiesIPCC Research and Action Agenda recommendations, this paper contributes to improving understanding barriers, opportunities, and needs for science-policy-practice dialogue for urban climate resilience. The paper analyses the urban climate resilient strategiesstrategies of the Italian metropolitan cities, concluding that a science-policy-practice dialogue is lacking in implementing evidence-based climate change resilience policies and actions actions at the local scale. Starting from the Italian case study, the paper suggests an iterative process to unlock the science-policy-practice dialogue for contributing to operationalise urban climate resilience fostering thanks to a multiscalar governance approach.","Caldarice, Ombretta; Tollin, Nicola; Pizzorni, Maria",City Territ Archit,376,1

Hardware developments have introduced directional leads to stimulate specific brain targets and sensing electrodes to determine optimal settings via feedback from local field potentials. In addition, variable-frequency stimulation and asynchronous high-frequency pulse trains have introduced new programming paradigms to efficiently desynchronize pathological neural circuitry and regulate dysfunctional brain networks not responsive to conventional settings. Overall, these innovations have provided clinicians with more anatomically accurate programming and closed-looped feedback to identify optimal strategies for neuromodulation. Simultaneously, software developments have simplified programming algorithms, introduced platforms for DBS remote management via telemedicine, and tools for estimating the volume of tissue activated within and outside the DBS targets. Finally, the surgical accuracy has improved thanks to intraoperative magnetic resonance or computerized tomography guidance, network-based imaging for DBS planning and targeting, and robotic-assisted surgery for ultra-accurate, millimetric lead placement. These technological and imaging advances have collectively optimized DBS outcomes and allowed “asleep” DBS procedures. Still, the short- and long-term outcomes of different implantable devices, surgical techniques, and asleep vs. awake procedures remain to be clarified.

Foundations that are set up in perpetuity are often deemed slow and dilatory when it comes to taking decisions. Covid-19, however, demands fast, not to say unbureaucratic action. This is often contrary to the character of foundations and the way in which many of them pursue their programmatic goals. Foundations, therefore, risk falling short of their social mission and even missing the opportunity to offer society pioneering solutions. Yet, the current crisis has also underlined the importance of strategic partnerships between foundations and other players and of involving local people in bringing about social change.

Yet, today, physical inactivity is an unsolved, major public health problem. However, globally, tens of millions of people annually undertake ancient, significant and enduring traditions of physiologically and psychologically arduous walks (pilgrimages) of days-to-weeks extent. Pilgrim walking is a significant human activity requiring weighty commitments of time, action and belief, as well as community support. Paradoxically, human walking is most studied on treadmills, not ‘in the wild’, while mechanistically vital, treadmill studies of walking cannot, in principle, address why humans walk extraordinary distances together to demonstrate their adherence to a behaviourally demanding belief system. Pilgrim walkers provide a rich ‘living laboratory’ bridging humanistic inquiries, to progressive theoretical and empirical investigations of human walking arising from a behaviourally demanding belief system. Pilgrims vary demographically and undertake arduous journeys on precisely mapped routes of tracked, titrated doses and durations on terrain of varying difficulty, allowing investigations from molecular to cultural levels of analysis. Using the reciprocal perspectives of ‘inside→out’ (where processes within brain and body initiate, support and entrain movement) and ‘outside→in’ (where processes in the world beyond brain and body drive activity within brain and body), we examine how pilgrim walking might shape personal, social and transcendental processes, revealing potential mechanisms supporting the body and brain in motion, to how pilgrim walking might offer policy solutions for physical inactivity.","O’Mara, Shane",Front Psychol,376,1

SUMMARY ANSWER: The women were more emotionally affected due to the COVID–19 pandemic than men, especially increasing anxiety and fear of not achieving pregnancy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: COVID–19 pandemic required changes in behavior and plans of most people worldwide, including patients undergoing assisted reproductive treatment (ART). The reproductive societies recommended immediate cessation of all new fertility treatment cycles, arousing different opinions from patients and providers, concerned that a delay of months may affect clinical outcomes. The fear, social distancing and financial insecurity are enough reasons for worry and anguish, and the uncertainty of resuming plans of parenthood make the scenery even more challenging. Therefore, the psychosocial aspects’ evaluation of these patients during the pandemic is fundamental for better comprehension, management, and reception in this especially challenging moment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Cross-sectional study using data from a centre of reproductive medicine between June and August 2020. The sample was composed of 120 patients (54 men and 66 women), 14.16% undergoing frozen embryo transfer (FET), 77.5% in vitro fertilization (FIV), 1.6% semen freezing collection and 6.6% oocyte freezing. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The data were extracted from an electronic questionnaire elaborated by the clinical team, which included questions about the patients’ psychological aspects, applied one day before ART. The answers were compared between men and women,and between the types of ART used by each patient. The statistical analysis was made using the program SPSS for Windows. The Chi-Square test was used to compare the study groups, considering p < 0.05 statistically significant. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: It was observed that 23/54 (42%) of men and 42/66 (63%) of women were at least partially emotionally affected by the pandemic (p = 0.027). Comparing feelings between groups (men and women, respectively) the following results were observed: optimistic (42,1% vs 57,9% p = 0.664), hopeful (32,3% vs 67,7%, p = 0.098), anxious (22,6% vs 77,4%, p = 0.004), calm (60,7% vs 39,3%, p < 0.001). Also, 27% of men and 39.3% of women felt more anguished than normal, which was mostly expressed through anxiety (36.7% vs 63.3%, p = 0.113), followed by irritability (54.5% vs 45.5%, p = 0.421), eating habit change (42.5% vs 56.5, p = 0.962) and sleep disorders (28.6% vs 56.5%, p = 0.215). Most patients (96.6%) reported having somebody to share their feelings and didn’t want to be contacted by the clinic’s psychologist (92.5%); 26.3% of couples had their relationship positively affected. Comparing feelings between patients undergoing FET vs FIV, respectively, were found: optimistic (47.0% vs 29.0%, p = 0.142) and anxious (23,5% vs 27.9%, p = 0.70). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The data was collected at one point, in the worst moment of the pandemic in Brazil, which may have influenced some of the answers. The small sample size is due to the lower number of procedures in this period. Wider implications of the findings: The feelings were similar between groups. However, women seemed to be more fearful of not being able to realize the parenthood dream. Anxiety was the main symptom in both groups, being more prevalent in women. This study reinforces the importance of having mental health professionals in assisted reproductive clinic. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable","Hentschke, M; Dornelles, V Campo; Telöken, I.

The weak interactions between supramolecular monomers allow for adaptivity and responsiveness of supramolecular or self-assembling systems to external stimuli. In many cases, these characteristics improve the performance of recognition units, reporters, or signal transducers of biosensors. The facile methods for preparing supramolecular materials also allow for straightforward ways to combine them with other functional materials and create multicomponent sensors. To date, biosensors with supramolecular components are capable of not only detecting target analytes based on known ligand affinity or specific host-guest interactions, but can also be used for more complex structural detection such as chiral sensing. In this Review, we discuss the advancements in the area of biosensors, with a particular highlight on the designs of supramolecular materials employed in analytical applications over the years. We will first describe how different types of supramolecular components are currently used as recognition or reporter units for biosensors. The working mechanisms of detection and signal transduction by supramolecular systems will be presented, as well as the important hierarchical characteristics from the monomers to assemblies that contribute to selectivity and sensitivity. We will then examine how supramolecular materials are currently integrated in different types of biosensing platforms. Emerging trends and perspectives will be outlined, specifically for exploring new design and platforms that may bring supramolecular sensors a step closer towards practical use for multiplexed or differential sensing, higher throughput operations, real-time monitoring, reporting of biological function, as well as for environmental studies.","Lim, Sujeung; Kuang, Yuyao; Ardoña, Herdeline Ann M.",Front Chem,376,1

The global urgent demand for an effective preventive intervention has become more pressing as ETEC strains have become increasingly multiple antibiotic resistant. However, the vaccine development pipeline has been slow to address this urgent need. To date, vaccine development has focused mainly on canonical antigens such as colonization factors and expressed toxins but due to genomic plasticity of this enteric pathogen, it has proven difficult to develop effective vaccines. In this study, we investigated the highly conserved non-canonical vaccine candidate YghJ/SsLE. Using the mass spectrometry-based method BEMAP, we demonstrate that YghJ is hyperglycosylated in ETEC and identify 54 O-linked Set/Thr residues within the 1519 amino acid primary sequence. The glycosylation sites are evenly distributed throughout the sequence and do not appear to affect the folding of the overall protein structure. Although the glycosylation sites only constitute a minor subpopulation of the available epitopes, we observed a notable difference in the immunogenicity of the glycosylated YghJ and the non-glycosylated protein variant. We can demonstrate by ELISA that serum from patients enrolled in an ETEC H10407 controlled infection study are significantly more reactive with glycosylated YghJ compared to the non-glycosylated variant. This study provides an important link between O-linked glycosylation and the relative immunogenicity of bacterial proteins and further highlights the importance of this observation in considering ETEC proteins for inclusion in future broad coverage subunit vaccine candidates.","Thorsing, Mette; Krogh, Thøger Jensen; Vitved, Lars; Nawrocki, Arkadiusz; Jakobsen, Rikke; Larsen, Martin R.; Chakraborty, Subhra; Bourgeois, A.

The proposed technique is named as WEClustering. The proposed technique deals with the problem of high dimensionality in an effective manner, hence, more accurate clusters are formed. The technique is validated on several datasets of varying sizes and its performance is compared with other widely used and state of the art clustering techniques.

The outcomes of this work have implications for extending the model to materials design and for applications involving different types of loading in real-world application (e.g., erosion and fatigue).","Sayahlatifi, Saman; Shao, Chenwei; McDonald, André; Hogan, James",J Therm Spray Tech,376,1

This fast-paced development in AI and sensing technologies have stirred an evolution in the realm of robotics. Concurrently, augmented reality (AR) applications are providing solutions to a myriad of robotics applications, such as demystifying robot motion intent and supporting intuitive control and feedback. In this paper, research papers combining the potentials of AI and AR in robotics over the last decade are presented and systematically reviewed. Four sources for data collection were utilized: Google Scholar, Scopus database, the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2020 proceedings, and the references and citations of all identified papers. A total of 29 papers were analyzed from two perspectives: a theme-based perspective showcasing the relation between AR and AI, and an application-based analysis highlighting how the robotics application was affected. These two sections are further categorized based on the type of robotics platform and the type of robotics application, respectively. We analyze the work done and highlight some of the prevailing limitations hindering the field. Results also explain how AR and AI can be combined to solve the model-mismatch paradigm by creating a closed feedback loop between the user and the robot. This forms a solid base for increasing the efficiency of the robotic application and enhancing the user’s situational awareness, safety, and acceptance of AI robots. Our findings affirm the promising future for robust integration of AR and AI in numerous robotic applications.","Bassyouni, Zahraa; Elhajj, Imad H.",Front Robot AI,376,1

Despite the growth in the number of established palliative care programs over the past decade, little is known about the current operational features of PPC programs across the country. METHODS The National Palliative Care Registry collects annualized data on palliative care programs' structures, processes, and staffing. Using data from the 2018 registry survey, we report on the operational features of inpatient PPC programs across the United States. RESULTS Fifty-four inpatient PPC programs submitted data about their operations. Programs reported a median of 3.8 full-time equivalent staff per 10 000 hospital admissions (range 0.7-12.1) across the core interdisciplinary team, yet few (37%) met the minimum standards of practice for staffing. Programs provided more annual consults if they were longer-standing, had more interdisciplinary full-time equivalent staff, offered 24/7 availability for patients and families, or were at larger hospitals. The majority of programs reported concern for burnout (63%) and an inability to meet clinical demand with available staffing (60%). CONCLUSIONS There is considerable variability in PPC program operations and structure in hospitals. This study affirms the need for updated program standards and guidelines, as well as research that describes how different care delivery models impact outcomes for patients, families, staff, and health care systems. Future studies that further define the clinical demand, workload, and sustainability challenges of PPC programs are necessary to foster the provision of high-quality PPC and maintain a vital clinical workforce.","Rogers, Maggie M; Friebert, Sarah; Williams, Conrad S P; Humphrey, Lisa; Thienprayoon, Rachel; Klick, Jeffrey C",Pediatrics,376,17

Here, we investigated how LGP2 regulates the RIG-I- and MDA5-dependent induction of type I interferon (IFN) signaling and showed that LGP2 interacted with different components of the RNA-silencing machinery. We identified a direct protein-protein interaction between LGP2 and the IFN-inducible, double-stranded RNA binding protein PACT. The LGP2-PACT interaction was mediated by the regulatory C-terminal domain of LGP2 and was necessary for inhibiting RIG-I-dependent responses and for amplifying MDA5-dependent responses. We described a point mutation within LGP2 that disrupted the LGP2-PACT interaction and led to the loss of LGP2-mediated regulation of RIG-I and MDA5 signaling. These results suggest a model in which the LGP2-PACT interaction regulates the inflammatory responses mediated by RIG-I and MDA5 and enables the cellular RNA-silencing machinery to coordinate with the innate immune response.","Sanchez David, Raul Y; Combredet, Chantal; Najburg, Valérie; Millot, Gael A; Beauclair, Guillaume; Schwikowski, Benno; Léger, Thibaut; Camadro, Jean-Michel; Jacob, Yves; Bellalou, Jacques; Jouvenet, Nolwenn; Tangy, Frédéric; Komarova, Anastassia V",Science signaling,376,27

Most Bartonella spp. have adapted to a specific host, generally a domestic or wild mammal. Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) have become a focus of growing public-health interest because they have been identified as a reservoir host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Nevertheless, data on camel zoonoses are limited. We aimed to study the occurrence of Bartonella bacteremia among dromedaries in Israel. Nine of 51 (17.6%) camels were found to be bacteremic with Bartonella spp.; bacteremia levels ranged from five to >1000 colony-forming units/mL. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the concatenated sequences of gltA and rpoB genes demonstrated that the dromedary Bartonella isolates are closely related to other ruminant-derived Bartonella spp., with B. bovis being the nearest relative. Using electron microscopy, the novel isolates were shown to be flagellated, whereas B. bovis is nonflagellated. Sequence comparisons analysis of the housekeeping genes ftsZ, ribC, and groEL showed the highest homology to B. chomelii, B. capreoli, and B. birtlesii, respectively. Sequence analysis of the gltA and rpoB revealed ∼96% identity to B. bovis, a previously suggested cutoff value for sequence-based differentiation of Bartonella spp., suggesting that this approach does not have sufficient discriminatory power for differentiating ruminant-related Bartonella spp. A comprehensive multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis based on nine genetic loci (gltA, rpoB, ftsZ, internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 16S rRNA, ribC, groEL, nuoG, and SsrA) identified seven sequence types of the new dromedary isolates. This is the first description of a Bartonella sp. from camelids. On the basis of a distinct reservoir and ecological niche, sequence analyses, and expression of flagella, we designate these isolates as a novel Bartonella sp. named Bartonella dromedarii sp. nov.

METHODS 71 children with ADHD and 30 controls were included. 35 had ADHD with predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I) and 36 with predominantly hyperactive/impulsive or combined presentation (ADHD-C). We used the pediatric sleep questionnaire (PSQ) and a nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) to assess the sleep problems in children with ADHD before and 6 months after being treated with methylphenidate (0.3-0.7 mg/kg/dose). RESULTS PSG showed significantly higher apnea-hypopnea index and hypopnea counts, and lower slow-wave sleep percentage in children with ADHD. The results of PSQ reported by parents showed significantly higher rates of delay initiation of sleep, sleep onset latency, sleep fragment, daytime sleepiness, enuresis, bruxism, nightmares, periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and snoring in children with ADHD compared to normal controls. Comparisons of ADHD presentations revealed no significant difference between ADHD-I and ADHD-C by either PSG or PSQ measurements. After 6-month MPH treatment, the PSG showed significantly increased total sleep time and reduced periodic limb movement index (PLMI). The PSQ indicated significant reduction in bruxism and snoring in ADHD-I, as well as nightmares in ADHD-C, and both subgroups showed significant reduction in PLMD. CONCLUSION subjective and objective approaches produced inconsistent findings regarding the sleep problems in children with ADHD.

We sought to compare the outcomes of patients who underwent elective open, laparoscopic, and robotic total abdominal colectomy. METHODS The NIS database was used to examine the clinical data of patients who underwent an elective total colectomy procedure during 2009-2012. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare the three surgical approaches. RESULTS We sampled a total of 26,721 patients who underwent elective total colectomy. Of these, 16,780 (62.8 %) had an open operation, while 9934 (37.2 %) had a minimally invasive approach (9614 laparoscopic surgery, and 326 robotic surgery). The most common indication for an operation was ulcerative colitis (31 %). Patients who underwent open surgery had significantly higher mortality and morbidity compared to laparoscopic (AOR 2.48, 1.30, P < 0.01) and robotic approaches (AOR 1.04, 1.30, P < 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively). There was no significant difference in mortality and morbidity between the laparoscopic and robotic approaches (AOR 0.96, 1.03, P = 0.10, P = 0.78). However, conversion rate of laparoscopic surgery to open was significantly higher than that of robotic approach (13.3 vs. 1.5 %, P < 0.01). Patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery had significantly lower total hospital charges compared to patients who underwent open surgery (mean difference = $21,489, P < 0.01). Also, total hospital charges for a robotic approach were significantly higher than for a laparoscopic approach (mean difference = $15,595, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Minimally invasive approaches to total colectomy are safe, with the advantage of lower mortality and morbidity compared to an open approach. Although there was no significant difference in the morbidity between minimally invasive approaches, robotic surgery had a significantly lower conversion rate compared to laparoscopic approach. Total hospital charges are significantly higher in robotic surgery compared to laparoscopic approach.","Moghadamyeghaneh, Zhobin; Hanna, Mark H; Carmichael, Joseph C; Pigazzi, Alessio; Stamos, Michael J; Mills, Steven",Surgical endoscopy,376,19

RESEARCH AIM To compare maternal milk production, breastfeeding self-efficacy, the extent to which infants received mother's milk, and rate of direct breastfeeding in a single-family room to an open bay neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS A longitudinal, prospective observational study comparing 77 infants born at 28- 32° weeks gestational age and their 66 mothers (n = 35 infants of n = 30 mothers in single family room and n = 42 infants of n = 36 mothers in open bay). Comparisons were made on milk volume produced, the extent to which infants were fed mother's milk, and rate of direct breastfeeding from birth to 4 months' corrected infant age. Breastfeeding self-efficacy was compared across mothers who directly breastfed at discharge (n = 45). RESULTS First expression (6 hr vs. 30 hr, p < .001) and first attempt at breastfeeding (48 hr vs. 109 hr, p < .001) occurred significantly earlier, infants were fed a greater amount of mother's milk (p < .04), and significantly more infants having single-family room care were exclusively directly breastfed from discharge until 4 months' corrected age; OR 6.8 (95% CI [2.4, 19.1]). Volumes of milk produced and breastfeeding self-efficacy did not differ significantly between participants in either units.

It is unclear if and how pre-stress neurocognitive factors moderate risk for anxiety during high stress situations. Enhanced error monitoring and a cognitive control strategy of more instantaneous (reactive) control have both been independently related to anxiety. We examine if a specific neurocognitive profile characterized by heightened error monitoring and a more reactive cognitive control strategy in adolescence predicts young adults' anxiety trajectories across three early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS As part of a longitudinal study (N=291), data were acquired in adolescence (13 years) on error monitoring (n=124) and cognitive control strategy (n=119). In young adulthood (18 years), anxiety was assessed three times during the COVID-19 pandemic (n=162). RESULTS On average, participants experienced greater anxiety in the first COVID-19 assessment, then anxiety decreased in the following months. Error monitoring and cognitive control strategy interacted to predict anxiety trajectories, such that among adolescents with an increased reliance on reactive control, error monitoring predicted greater anxiety in the first assessment, but greater decreases the following months as stay-at-home orders were lifted and families adapted to the restrictions. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that neurocognitive profiles in adolescence predict young adults' anxiety responses during a highly stressful period such as the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare, side by side, the cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) and processed electroencephalogram (EEG) response bilaterally to carotid artery clamping and shunting in patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia. With institutional approval and written informed consent, patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia and routine carotid artery shunting were recorded bilaterally, simultaneously and continuously with an rSO2 and processed EEG monitor. The response of the monitors during carotid artery clamping and shunting were assessed and compared between monitors and bilaterally within each monitor. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study. At clamping the surgical-side and contralateral-side rSO2 dropped significantly below the baseline incision value (-17.6 and -9.4% respectively). After shunting, the contralateral-side rSO2 returned to baseline while the surgical-side rSO2 remained significantly below baseline (-9.0%) until the shunt was removed following surgery. At clamping the surgical-side and contralateral-side processed EEG also dropped below baseline (-19.9 and -20.6% respectively). However, following shunt activation, the processed EEG returned bilaterally to baseline. During the course of this research, we found the rSO2 monitor to be clinically more robust (4.4% failure rate) than the processed EEG monitor (20.0% failure rate). There was no correlation between the rSO2 or processed EEG changes that occurred immediately after clamping and the degree of surgical side stenosis measured pre-operatively. Both rSO2 and processed EEG respond to clamping and shunting during CEA. Cerebral oximetry discriminates between the surgical and contralateral side during surgery. The rSO2 monitor is more reliable in the real-world clinical setting. Future studies should focus on developing algorithms based on these monitors that can predict clamping-induced cerebral ischemia during CEA in order to decide whether carotid artery shunting is worth the associated risks. From the practical point of view, the rSO2 monitor may be the better monitor for this purpose.","Perez, William; Dukatz, Christopher; El-Dalati, Sami; Duncan, James; Abdel-Rasoul, Mahmoud; Springer, Andrew; Go, Michael R; Dzwonczyk, Roger",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,376,1

Methods Motor evoked potentials were recorded from resting vastus medialis, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medial and lateral hamstring, and medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles on the right leg of 16 young healthy adults using bipolar surface electrodes. TMS was delivered through a 110-mm double-cone coil at 63 sites over the left hemisphere. Location and size of cortical representation and number of discrete peaks were quantified. Results Within the quadriceps group there was a main effect of muscle on anterior-posterior centre of gravity (p = 0.010), but the magnitude of the difference was small. There was also a main effect of muscle on medial-lateral hotspot (p = 0.027) and map volume (p = 0.047), but no post-hoc tests were significant.

We evaluated predictors of functional dependence despite successful revascularization among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy. METHODS We analyzed the pooled data from the Multi Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia (MERCI), Thrombectomy Revascularization of Large Vessel Occlusions in Acute Ischemic Stroke (TREVO), and TREVO 2 trials. Successful revascularization was defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score 2b or 3. Functional dependence was defined as a score of 3 to 6 on the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. We assessed relationship of demographic, clinical, angiographic characteristics, and hemorrhage with functional dependence despite successful revascularization. RESULTS Two hundred and twenty-eight patients with successful revascularization had clinical outcome follow-up. The rates of functional dependence with endovascular success were 48.6% for Trevo thrombectomy and 58.0% for Merci thrombectomy. Age (odds ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.06 per 1-year increase), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.15 per 1-point increase), and symptom onset to endovascular treatment time (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.22 per 30-minute delay) were predictors of functional dependence despite successful revascularization. Symptom onset to reperfusion time beyond 5 hours was associated with functional dependence. All subjects with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage had functional dependence. CONCLUSIONS One half of patients with successful mechanical thrombectomy do not have good outcomes. Age, severe neurological deficits, and delayed endovascular treatment were associated with functional dependence despite successful revascularization.

Despite the ability of certain antibiotics to control initial infection, relapse occurs in treated patients. The inability of antibiotics to clear this bacterial infection is in part due to persistence, an evasion mechanism against antibiotics and host defenses effects. Evaluation of antibiotic efficacy against B. pseudomallei revealed that up to 48% of in vitro grown populations can survive in a persister state. Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems have been previously implicated in modulating bacterial persistence. We generated 3 isogenic TA mutants and found that loss of each toxin gene did not alter antibiotic persistence or macrophage survival. In response to macrophage-induced persistence, all three toxin mutants demonstrated increased intracellular susceptibility to levofloxacin which in part was due to the inability of the mutants to induce persistence after nitric oxide or nutrient starvation.

The comparisons revealed that elite accessions were more productive in terms of grain yield and TKW, whereas obsolete accessions showed high GPC and end-use quality-traits. The generated dendrogram based on SSR markers, agronomic, seed quality-traits clearly differentiate the genotypes in two main groups obsolete and elite accessions. Analysis of correlation revealed a significant association between the traits TKW, Y, b*, a*, GPC, GC, SDS and H. High genetic diversity found between elite and obsolete cultivars for parameters such as yield, end-use quality and their correlation with SSR markers could help breeders for an eventual breeding program on durum-wheat.","Jlassi, Ines; Bnejdi, Fethi; Saadoun, Mourad; Hajji, Abdelhamid; Mansouri, Dhouha; Ben-Attia, Mossadok; El-Gazzah, Mohamed; El-Bok, Safia",Molecular biology reports,376,1

During the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was unclear how ED volume would be impacted in paediatric hospitals. The objective of this study was to examine differences in the international experience of paediatric ED utilisation and disposition at five different children's hospitals. METHODS We obtained data on ED volume, acuity level and disposition (hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission) for the time period 1 December1-10 August for the years 2017-2020 from hospitals in five cities (Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Singapore; Melbourne, Australia; Seattle, Washington, USA; and Paris, France). Per cent change was analysed using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS Overall ED volume dramatically decreased in all five hospitals during the early months of COVID-19 compared with prior years. There was a more varied response of decreases in ED volume by acuity level, hospitalisation and ICU admission among the five hospitals. The one exception was a 2% increase in ICU admissions in Paris. As of August 2020, all hospitals have demonstrated increases in ED volume; however, they are still below baseline. CONCLUSION Paediatric EDs in these five cities demonstrated differential decreases of ED volume by acuity and disposition during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Lois; Mannix, Rebekah; Guedj, Romain; Chong, Shu-Ling; Sunwoo, Sidney; Woodward, Tony; Fleegler, Eric",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,376,1

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the levels of vitamin D and severity of COVID-19. METHODS A total of 204 patients with COVID-19 disease were enrolled in the study. All patients had viral pneumonia, which was confirmed with chest computer tomography. All cases were divided in two groups- mild (outpatients); and serious (inpatients)- according to their clinical and laboratory data. Serum vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescence method. RESULTS Vitamin D deficiency was found in 41.7 % (n = 85) of cases and insufficiency was found in 46.0 % (n = 94), while in 12.3 % (n = 25) of cases normal vitamin D levels were found. The odds of having a serious clinical outcome were increased for vitamin D insufficiency patients 5.604 times (%95 CI:0.633-49.584) and for vitamin D deficiency patients 38.095 times (%95 CI:2.965-489.50) for each standard deviation decrease in serum 25(OH)D. CONCLUSION Adequate levels of vitamin D could suppress inflammation and reduce the severity of COVID-19. Vitamin D supplementation may have an important role in decreasing the impact of the pandemic (Tab. 5, Fig. 2, Ref. 27).","Basaran, N; Adas, M; Gokden, Y; Turgut, N; Yildirmak, T; Guntas, G",Bratislavske lekarske listy,376,16

In viral infections, viruses exploit receptor-ligand interactions to latch onto cellular exterior prior to subsequent entry and invasion. In light of the selective binding affinity between viral pathogens and cells, nanoparticles cloaked in cellular membranes are herein employed for virus targeting. Using the influenza virus as a model, erythrocyte membrane cloaked nanoparticles are prepared and modified with magnetic functionalities (RBC-mNP) for virus targeting and isolation. To maximize targeting and isolation efficiency, density gradient centrifugation and nanoparticle tracking analysis were applied to minimize the presence of uncoated particles and membrane vesicles. The resulting nanoparticles possess a distinctive membrane corona, a sialylated surface, and form colloidally stable clusters with influenza viruses. Magnetic functionality is bestowed to the nanoparticles through encapsulation of superparamagnetic iron-oxide particles, which enable influenza virus enrichment via magnetic extraction. Viral samples enriched by the RBC-mNPs result in significantly enhanced virus detection by multiple virus quantification methods, including qRT-PCR, immunnochromatographic strip test, and cell-based titering assays. The demonstration of pathogen targeting and isolation by RBC-mNPs highlights a biologically inspired approach toward improved treatment and diagnosis against infectious disease threats.

NADPH and NADH are known to interact with HRP and generate significant quantities of superoxide anion, a radical that spontaneously dismutates to form H2O2 which interferes with the AR/HRP assay. Microsomal enzymes generate H2O2 as a consequence of electron transfer from NADPH to cytochrome P450 hemoproteins with subsequent oxygen activation. We found that superoxide anion formation via the interaction of NADPH with HRP was inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD) without affecting H2O2 generation by microsomal enzymes. Using SOD in enzyme assays, we consistently detected rates of H2O2 production using microgram quantities of microsomal proteins (2.62 ± 0.20 picomol/min/µg protein for liver microsomes from naïve female rats, 12.27 ± 1.29 for liver microsomes from dexamethasone induced male rats, and 2.17 ± 0.25 picomol/min/µg protein for human liver microsomes).

Although NGS-based metagenomic screening may be of interest in veterinary medicine, in particular for intensively farmed livestock species such as pigs, there is a lack of protocols tailored to veterinary requirements, likely because of the high diversity of species and samples. Therefore, we developed an NGS-based protocol for use in veterinary virology and present here different applications in porcine medicine. To develop the protocol, each step of sample preparation was optimized using porcine samples spiked with various RNA and DNA viruses. The resulting protocol was tested with clinical samples previously confirmed to be positive for specific viruses by a diagnostic laboratory. Additionally, we validated the protocol in an NGS viral metagenomics ring trial and tested the protocol on viral multiplex reference material (NIBSC, U.K.). We applied our ViroScreen protocol successfully for 1) virus identification, 2) virus characterization, and 3) herd screening.

The inhibition of the nociceptive impulse may decrease the occurrence of muscle spasm following mobilization postoperatively. This mechanism may contribute to a better functional recovery following upper limb surgery. This systematic review will investigate the impact of peripheral nerve block on functional recovery after an upper limb surgery. METHODS We will search studies comparing peripheral nerve block to general anesthesia for upper limb surgery in the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, EMBASE, and Scopus. In duplicate, independent reviewers will assess eligibility, evaluate risk of bias, and abstract data on type of peripheral nerve block and functional outcome. Where possible, we will pool results using a random effects model. For each outcome, we will assess the quality of evidence using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION We aim to summarize the available evidence comparing functional recovery with peripheral nerve block versus general anesthesia for upper limb surgery.

The relative contributions of the various IFN subtypes to innate immunity against virus infections remain elusive. IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and other type I IFN molecules signal through a common, universally expressed cell surface receptor, whereas type III IFN (IFN-lambda) uses a distinct cell-type-specific receptor complex for signaling. Using mice lacking functional receptors for type I IFN, type III IFN, or both, we found that IFN-lambda plays an important role in the defense against several human pathogens that infect the respiratory tract, such as influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. These viruses were more pathogenic and replicated to higher titers in the lungs of mice lacking both IFN receptors than in mice with single IFN receptor defects. In contrast, Lassa fever virus, which infects via the respiratory tract but primarily replicates in the liver, was not influenced by the IFN-lambda receptor defect. Careful analysis revealed that expression of functional IFN-lambda receptor complexes in the lung and intestinal tract is restricted to epithelial cells and a few other, undefined cell types. Interestingly, we found that SARS coronavirus was present in feces from infected mice lacking receptors for both type I and type III IFN but not in those from mice lacking single receptors, supporting the view that IFN-lambda contributes to the control of viral infections in epithelial cells of both respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.","Mordstein, Markus; Neugebauer, Eva; Ditt, Vanessa; Jessen, Birthe; Rieger, Toni; Falcone, Valeria; Sorgeloos, Frederic; Ehl, Stephan; Mayer, Daniel; Kochs, Georg; Schwemmle, Martin; Günther, Stephan; Drosten, Christian; Michiels, Thomas; Staeheli, Peter",Journal of virology,376,28

METHODS We described cystocisternostomy technique for arachnoid cysts through fenestration medial to the edge of tentorium through lateral pontomesencephalic membrane and illustrated it's outcomes. We performed endoscopic lateral pontomesencephalic membranotomy in nine children with zero angled rigid endoscope (STORZ). The age ranged from eight months up to nine years. The cysts were Galassi type III in eight cases (five of them giant hemispheric) and Galassi type II in one case. Clinical presentations were delay in milestones, seizures, loss of consciousness, unsteady gait, and persistent headache. RESULTS The cysts were decreased in size in five cases after three months and nearly disappeared after three and 15 months in two cases, and in 18 months in the other two. Preoperative symptoms improved in all cases. Insignificant subdural hygroma was found in five cases, one case developed hydrocephalus four months later treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt; contralateral massive subdural hematoma occurred in one case four months after surgery evacuated with two burr holes with good clinical outcome. There was neither CSF leakage, cranial nerve palsy nor mortality. CONCLUSION The fenestration through the lateral pontomesencephalic membrane created a shortcut of CSF flow to the basal cisterns especially cerebellopontine cistern and represents a reliable option with an acceptable success rate. It creates a good drainage to the large cysts.","El Refaee, Ehab; Elbaroody, Mohammad",World neurosurgery,376,1

Pinus krempfii, a flat-leaved pine endemic to the Central Highlands of Vietnam, provides a notable exception as it seems to compete successfully with shade-tolerant tropical species. Here, we test the hypothesis that successful conifer performance at the juvenile stage depends on physiological traits of shade tolerance by comparing the physiological characteristics of P. krempfii to coexisting species from two taxa: the genus Pinus, and a relatively abundant and shade tolerant conifer family found in pantropical forests, the Podocarpaceae. We examined leaf photosynthetic, respiratory and biochemical traits. Additionally, we compiled attainable maximum photosynthesis, maximum RuBP carboxylation (Vcmax) and maximum electron transport (Jmax) values for Pinus and Podocarpaceae species from the literature. In our literature compilation, P. krempfii was intermediate between Pinus and Podocarpaceae in its maximum photosynthesis and its Vcmax. Pinus exhibited a higher Vcmax than Podocarpaceae, resulting in a less steep slope in the linear relationship between Jmax and Vcmax. These results suggest that Pinus may be more shade intolerant than Podocarpaceae with P. krempfii falling between the two taxa. However, in contrast, Vietnamese conifers' leaf mass per areas and biochemical traits did not highlight the same intermediate nature of P. krempfii. Furthermore, regardless of leaf morphology or family assignation, all species demonstrated a common and extremely high carbon gain efficiency. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of shade tolerant photosynthetic traits for conifer survival in tropical forests. However, they also demonstrate a diversity of shade tolerance strategies, all of which lead to the persistence of Vietnamese juvenile conifers in low-light tropical understories.","Schmiege, Stephanie C; Buckley, Brendan M; Stevenson, Dennis; Cuong, Truong Quang; Nam, Le Canh; Griffin, Kevin L",Tree physiology,376,1

This study examined both D2B and clinical outcomes of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).Methods and Results:This was a retrospective study of 303 STEMI patients who presented directly or were transferred to a tertiary hospital in Singapore for PPCI from October 2019 to March 2020. We compared the clinical outcomes of patients admitted before (BOR) and during (DOR) the COVID-19 outbreak response. The study outcomes were in-hospital death, D2B, cardiogenic shock and 30-day readmission. For direct presentations, fewer patients in the DOR group achieved D2B time <90 min compared with the BOR group (71.4% vs. 80.9%, P=0.042). This was more apparent after exclusion of non-system delay cases (DOR 81.6% vs. BOR 95.9%, P=0.006). Prevalence of both out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (9.5% vs. 1.9%, P=0.003) and acute mitral regurgitation (31.6% vs. 17.5%, P=0.006) was higher in the DOR group. Mortality was similar between groups. Multivariable regression showed that longer D2B time was an independent predictor of death (odds ratio 1.005, 95% confidence interval 1.000-1.011, P=0.029). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak response have had an adverse effect on PPCI service efficiency.

Resveratrol and pterostilbene are plant stilbenoids associated with several health-promoting benefits. Resveratrol has been shown to inhibit the replication of several viruses, including herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, papillomaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and influenza virus. Alone, resveratrol does not inhibit HIV-1 infection of activated T cells, but it does synergize with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in these cells to inhibit reverse transcription. Here, we demonstrate that resveratrol and pterostilbene completely block HIV-1 infection at a low micromolar dose in resting CD4 T cells, primarily at the reverse transcription step. The anti-HIV effect was fully reversed by exogenous deoxynucleosides and Vpx, an HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus protein that increases deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) levels. These findings are consistent with the reported ability of resveratrol to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase and to lower dNTP levels in cells.

Error of active reproduction of joint position (EARJP) was assessed at the following reference positions: 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° for forward flexion and abduction and 15°, 30°, and 45° for internal and external rotation in rTSA, contralateral non-operated, and control shoulders. RESULTS Results of EPRJP for rTSA, contralateral, and control (respectively) are as follows:Forward flexion: 30° = (8.0 ± 5.7, 9.8 ± 6.1, and 4.9 ± 3.0), 60° = (5.0 ± 2.8, 5.9 ± 2.7, and 5.1 ± 3.2), 90° = (3.1 ± 1.6, 5.5 ± 2.6, and 3.2 ± 1.4), and 120° = (3.4 ± 2.1, 5.6 ± 4.0, and 3.5 ± 1.7)Abduction: 30° = (5.2 ± 2.5, 9.1 ± 6.1, and 4.6 ± 2.3), 60° = (5.2 ± 3.6, 6.6 ± 4.1, and 5.3 ± 3.1), 90° = (3.8 ± 2.0; 7.4 ± 5.5, and 4.1 ± 1.9), and 120° = (5.3 ± 2.9, 7.7 ± 5.3, and 4.2 ± 1.9)Internal rotation: 15° = (4.3 ± 3.1, 6.2 ± 4.4, and 2.8 ± 1.2), 30° = (3.2 ± 1.9, 4.5 ± 2.3, and 3.3 ± 1.4), and 45° = (3.5 ± 2.0, 4.1 ± 1.8, and 2.8 ± 1.0)External rotation: 15° = (3.0 ± 1.7, 4.2 ± 2.2, and 3.6 ± 1.4) and 30° = (3.1 ± 1.5, 3.8 ± 2.6, and 3.4 ± 1.6)The results showed significantly better JPS (lower EPRJP) in shoulders following rTSA and normal control shoulders comparing with the patient's contralateral shoulder. The explanation can be that rTSA improves joint kinematics and stability, which allows better muscular performance and proprioception feedback. CONCLUSION Shoulders following rTSA show JPS superior to non-operated contralateral shoulders and comparable with healthy population shoulders. It seems that rTSA restores shoulder proprioception.","Walecka, Joanna; Lubiatowski, Przemysław; Consigliere, Paolo; Atoun, Ehud; Levy, Ofer",International orthopaedics,376,1

Despite advances in the understanding of stroke pathophysiology, therapeutic options remain limited. In this study, we explored the interaction of Shrm4 and the metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABAB ) in ischemic stroke. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was induced by filament insertion in Shrm4+/+ and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, followed by reperfusion for up to 7 days. Baclofen was administered was used to activate GABAB in vivo during reperfusion. Neurological deficits, motor and memory functions, and infarct volume were determined in the various mouse groups. Furthermore, we also developed an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model in primary neurons to test Shrm4/GABAB interactions in vitro. Shrm4 was observed to decrease infarct volume and neuronal cell loss in penumbra, and rescue neurological deficits in MCAO mice. Notably, Shrm4 also increased pole climbing speed, reduced foot faults, and increased escape latency in the Morris water maze test, while reducing neuron autophagy through an interaction with GABAB receptors. GABAB activation using baclofen further reduced OGD-induced neuron damage in culture and stroke outcomes of MCAO, relative to Shrm4 alone. Taken together, Shrm4-mediated GABAB activation confers neuroprotection by reducing neuronal autophagy in acute ischemic stroke.","Yuan, Ya-Jing; Ye, Zhi; Yu, Hao; Chen, Yang; Wang, Yu-Wen; Zhao, Jun-Hua; Sun, Ji-Feng; Xu, Li-Ming",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,376,12

We aimed to compare the prognostic value of resting CSBF and CFR for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent vasodilator stress CMR. METHODS We studied 693 patients with known CAD and 519 patients with suspected CAD admitted to our hospital between 2009 and 2019. The CFR was calculated as the CSBF during adenosine triphosphate infusion divided by CSBF at rest. MACE was defined as composite of cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure hospitalization, and sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 4.6 years, 92 patients (8%) experienced MACE. The resting CSBF was significantly higher in patients with MACE than in patients without MACE (114.7 ± 44.9 mL/min vs. 84.7 ± 30.9 mL/min, p < 0.001 for known CAD; 122.2 ± 33.3 mL/min vs. 86.6 ± 36.7 mL/min, p < 0.001 for suspected CAD). The resting CSBF remained a significant predictor for MACE after adjusting clinical and CMR variables (hazard ratio [HR] of resting CSBF higher than the median: 3.18, p = 0.0083 for known CAD; HR: 23.3, p < 0.001 for suspected CAD). The area under the curve for predicting MACE was 0.73 for resting CSBF, 0.72 for CFR (p = 0.78) in patients with known CAD, and 0.82 for resting CSBF, 0.83 (p = 0.58) for CFR in patients with suspected CAD. CONCLUSIONS The resting CSBF may be a useful non-invasive method for the risk stratification of patients with known or suspected CAD without any radiation exposure, contrast media, or pharmacological vasodilator agents.","Kato, Shingo; Fukui, Kazuki; Kodama, Sho; Azuma, Mai; Nakayama, Naoki; Iwasawa, Tae; Kimura, Kazuo; Tamura, Kouichi; Utsunomiya, Daisuke",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,376,23

Objectives. To investigate the impact of lockdown measures on the number of patients who visited a tertiary urban trauma centre. Methods. The period of investigation was from 1 February to 30 June 2020 and was segmented into three intervals: pre-lockdown (February and March 2020), hard lockdown (April and May 2020) and immediately post lockdown (June 2020). The electronic HECTIS health record registry was interrogated for the total number of patients that were seen per month. These were further categorised according to mechanism of injury (stab, gunshot, blunt assault and road traffic injuries). Penetrating (stab and gunshot) and blunt assault victims were collectively grouped as violent trauma. Results. The mean total number of patients seen decreased by 53% during the hard lockdown period. There was a moderate reduction (15%) in patients with gunshot injuries seen during the hard lockdown phase, but there was an 80% increase in the post-lockdown period. The proportion of patients injured in road traffic collisions pre lockdown, hard lockdown and immediate post lockdown was 16.4%, 8.9% and 11.1%, respectively. Patients injured in road traffic collisions decreased by 74% during the hard lockdown period and maintained a reduction of 32% during the immediate post-lockdown period. The mean total number of patients who visited the trauma unit returned to pre-lockdown levels in June. Conclusions. There was an overall trend of reduced number of patients who visited the trauma unit during the hard lockdown period; however, these numbers returned to pre-lockdown levels during the immediate post-lockdown period. The number of road traffic injury admissions remained reduced during all three phases of lockdown, while the number of gunshot victims increased substantially during the post-lockdown period.","Navsaria, P H; Nicol, A J; Parry, C D H; Matzopoulos, R; Maqungo, S; Gaudin, R",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,376,16

The existence of age dependence would impact the development and operation of automated quantitative capnographic tools. Here, we quantitatively assess the relationship between normal capnogram shape and age. Capnograms were collected from healthy subjects, and physiologically-based features (exhalation duration, end-tidal CO2 and time spent at this value, normalized time spent at end-tidal CO2, end-exhalation slope, and instantaneous respiratory rate) were computationally extracted. The mean values of the individual features over 30 exhalations were linearly regressed against subject age, accounting for inter-feature correlation. After data collection, 154 of 178 subjects were eligible for analysis, with an age range of 3-78 years (mean age 39, std. dev. 20 years). The Bonferroni-corrected joint 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the regression line slopes contained the origin for five of six features (the remaining CI was only slightly offset from the origin). The associated individual r2 values for the regressions were all below 0.07. We conclude that age is not a significant explanatory factor in describing variations in the shape of the normal capnogram. This finding could be exploited in the design of automated methods for quantitative capnogram analysis across a range of ages.","Mieloszyk, Rebecca J; Krauss, Baruch S; Montagu, Diana; Andolfatto, Gary; Barbi, Egidio; Verghese, George C; Heldt, Thomas",Conference proceedings : ...

This paper considers research fatigue in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, to identify contributory factors and possible solutions for future post-disaster research. Methodology We draw on examples from the literature and our own observations from the recruitment and data collection phases of qualitative and quantitative studies, to provide an overview of possible research fatigue in the current COVID-19 pandemic, with implications for future post-disaster research. Findings People affected by disasters sometimes receive multiple requests for study participation by separate teams who may not necessarily be coordinating their work. Not keeping participants informed of the research process or outcomes can lead to disillusionment. Being overburdened with too many research requests and failing to see any subsequent changes following participation may cause individuals to experience research fatigue. Originality Guidelines for researchers wishing to reduce the occurrence of research fatigue include ensuring greater transparency within research; sharing of results; and using oversight or gatekeeper bodies to aid coordination. Failure to restrict the number of times that people are asked to participate in studies risks poor participation rates. This can subsequently affect the quality of information with which to inform policy-makers and protect the health of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health disasters/emergencies.","Patel, Sonny S; Webster, Rebecca K; Greenberg, Neil; Weston, Dale; Brooks, Samantha K",Disaster prevention and management,376,23

The diagnostic angiography demonstrated a right CCF. Accordingly transarterial embolization of the fistula was attempted 5 days later. The initial right internal carotid angiography showed an aneurysm on the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) which was not recognized in the diagnostic angiography. Spontaneous reduction of the shunt flow and long dissection of the ICA were also revealed. The aneurysm was successfully occluded with coils, and only minor shunt flow was shown on the final angiogram. EDS type IV was diagnosed with a skin biopsy for a collagen abnormality. After the operation, the stenosis of the right ICA gradually progressed, although there was no recurrence of the CCF.Interventional treatment for patients with EDS can cause devastating vascular complication. We should be aware of the possibility of EDS type IV when a spontaneous CCF shows unusual angiographical change because early diagnosis of EDS type IV is crucial for determination of the optimum treatment option.","Kojima, Atsuhiro; Saga, Isako; Tomio, Ryosuke; Kosho, Tomoki; Hatamochi, Atsushi","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",376,1

These disease-related biomarkers often exist at very low levels in biological fluids, necessitating ultrasensitive measurement methods. Single-molecule arrays (Simoa), a bead-based digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is the current state of the art for ultrasensitive protein detection and can detect sub-femtomolar protein concentrations, but its ability to achieve high-order multiplexing without cross-reactivity remains a challenge. Here, a sequential protein capture approach for multiplex Simoa assays is implemented to eliminate cross-reactivity between binding reagents by sequentially capturing each protein analyte and then incubating each capture bead with only its corresponding detection antibody. This strategy not only reduces cross-reactivity to background levels and significantly improves measurement accuracies, but also enables higher-order multiplexing. As a proof of concept, the sequential multiplex Simoa assay is used to measure five different cytokines in plasma samples from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The ultrasensitive sequential multiplex Simoa assays will enable the simultaneous measurements of multiple low-abundance analytes in a time- and cost-effective manner and will prove especially critical in many cases where sample volumes are limited.","Gilboa, Tal; Maley, Adam M; Ogata, Alana F; Wu, Connie; Walt, David R",Advanced healthcare materials,376,6

Although two SARS-related Rhinolophus sinicus bat CoVs (SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs) previously detected in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) in Yunnan, RsSHC014 and Rs3367, possessed 95% genome identities to human and civet SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 protein exhibited only 32.2 to 33% amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs. To elucidate the origin of SARS-CoV ORF8, we sampled 348 bats of various species in Yunnan, among which diverse alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, including potentially novel CoVs, were identified, with some showing potential interspecies transmission. The genomes of two betacoronaviruses, SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C, from greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), possessed 93% nucleotide identities to human/civet SARSr-CoV genomes. Although these two betacoronaviruses displayed lower similarities than SARSr-Rs-BatCoV RsSHC014 and Rs3367 in S protein to civet SARSr-CoVs, their ORF8 proteins demonstrated exceptionally high (80.4 to 81.3%) amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs, compared to SARSr-BatCoVs from other horseshoe bats (23.2 to 37.3%). Potential recombination events were identified around ORF8 between SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs and SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs, leading to the generation of civet SARSr-CoVs. The expression of ORF8 subgenomic mRNA suggested that the ORF8 protein may be functional in SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs. The high Ka/Ks ratio among human SARS-CoVs compared to that among SARSr-BatCoVs supported that ORF8 is under strong positive selection during animal-to-human transmission. Molecular clock analysis using ORF1ab showed that SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C diverged from civet/human SARSr-CoVs in approximately 1990. SARS-CoV ORF8 originated from SARSr-CoVs of greater horseshoe bats through recombination, which may be important for animal-to-human transmission. IMPORTANCE Although horseshoe bats are the primary reservoir of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), it is still unclear how these bat viruses have evolved to cross the species barrier to infect civets and humans. Most human SARS-CoV epidemic strains contain a signature 29-nucleotide deletion in ORF8, compared to civet SARSr-CoVs, suggesting that ORF8 may be important for interspecies transmission. However, the origin of SARS-CoV ORF8 remains obscure. In particular, SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs from Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) exhibited <40% amino acid identities to human/civet SARS-CoV in the ORF8 protein. We detected diverse alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses among various bat species in Yunnan, China, including two SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs from greater horseshoe bats that possessed ORF8 proteins with exceptionally high amino acid identities to that of human/civet SARSr-CoVs. We demonstrated recombination events around ORF8 between SARSr-Rf-BatCoVs and SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs, leading to the generation of civet SARSr-CoVs. Our findings offer insight into the evolutionary origin of SARS-CoV ORF8 protein, which was likely acquired from SARSr-CoVs of greater horseshoe bats through recombination.","Lau, Susanna K P; Feng, Yun; Chen, Honglin; Luk, Hayes K H; Yang, Wei-Hong; Li, Kenneth S M; Zhang, Yu-Zhen; Huang, Yi; Song, Zhi-Zhong; Chow, Wang-Ngai; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Ahmed, Syed Shakeel; Yeung, Hazel C; Lam, Carol S F; Cai, Jian-Piao; Wong, Samson S Y; Chan, Jasper F W; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Woo, Patrick C Y",Journal of virology,376,28

We sought to understand the effects of CDK4/6 inhibition (CDK4/6i) and radiation (RT) in multiple preclinical breast cancer models. METHODS Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were used to identify significantly altered pathways after CDK4/6i. Clonogenic assays were used to quantify the RT enhancement ratio (rER). DNA damage was quantified using γH2AX staining and the neutral comet assay. DNA repair was assessed using RAD51 foci formation and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) reporter assays. Orthotopic xenografts were used to assess the efficacy of combination therapy. RESULTS Palbociclib significantly radiosensitized multiple ER+ cell lines at low nanomolar, sub IC50 concentrations (rER: 1.21 - 1.52) and led to a decrease in the surviving fraction of cells at 2 Gy (p < 0.001). Similar results were observed in ribociclib- (rER: 1.08 - 1.68) and abemaciclib-treated (rER: 1.19 - 2.05) cells. Combination treatment decreased RAD51 foci formation (p < 0.001), leading to a suppression of HR activity, but did not affect NHEJ efficiency (p > 0.05). Immortalized breast epithelial cells and cells with acquired resistance to CDK4/6i did not demonstrate radiosensitization (rER: 0.94 - 1.11) or changes in RAD51 foci. In xenograft models, concurrent palbociclib and RT led to a significant decrease in tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS These studies provide preclinical rationale to test CDK4/6i + RT in women with locally-advanced ER+ breast cancer at high risk for locoregional recurrence.","Pesch, Andrea M; Hirsh, Nicole; Chandler, Benjamin C; Michmerhuizen, Anna R; Ritter, Cassandra L; Androsiglio, Marlie; Wilder-Romans, Kari; Liu, Meilan; Gersch, Christina; Larios, Jose M; Pierce, Lori J; Rae, James M; Speers, Corey",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,376,14

This ongoing randomized trial, with the final goal of a 10-year follow-up, compares the safety and efficacy of surgical clip occlusion and endovascular coil embolization in patients presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from a ruptured aneurysm. The 1- and 3-year results of this trial have been previously reported. METHODS In total, 500 patients with an SAH met the entry criteria and were enrolled in the study. Of these patients, 471 were randomly assigned to the treatments: 238 to surgical clipping and 233 to endovascular coiling. Six patients who died before treatment and 57 patients with nonaneurysmal SAHs were excluded, leaving a total of 408 patients who underwent clipping (209 assigned) or coiling (199 assigned). Whether to treat patients within the assigned group or to cross over patients to the other group was at the discretion of the treating physician; 38% (75/199) of the patients assigned to coiling were crossed over to clipping and 1.9% (4/209) assigned to clipping were crossed over to coiling. The outcome data were collected by a dedicated nurse practitioner. The primary outcome analysis was based on the assigned treatment group; poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score > 2 and was independently adjudicated. Six years after randomization, 336 (82%) of 408 patients who had been treated were available for examination. RESULTS On the basis of an mRS score of > 2, and similar to the results at the 3-year follow-up, no significant difference in outcomes (p = 0.24) was detected between the 2 treatment groups. Complete aneurysm obliteration at 6 years was achieved in 96% (111/116) of the clipping group and in 48% (23/48) of the coiling group (p < 0.0001). In the period between the 3- and 6-year follow-ups, 3 additional patients assigned to coiling and none assigned to clipping received retreatment, for overall retreatment rates of 4.6% (13/280) for clipping and 16.4% (21/128) for coiling (p < 0.0001). When aneurysm location was considered, the 6-year results continued to match the previously reported results, with no difference in outcome for anterior circulation aneurysms at most time points. Of the anterior circulation aneurysms assigned to coiling treatment, 42% (70/168) were crossed over to clipping treatment. The outcomes for posterior circulation aneurysms continued to favor coiling. The randomization process was unexpectedly skewed, with 18 of 21 treated aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) being assigned to clipping, but even when PICA aneurysms were removed from the analysis, outcomes for the posterior circulation aneurysms still favored coiling. CONCLUSIONS Although BRAT was statistically underpowered to detect small differences, these results suggest little difference in outcome between the 2 treatments for anterior circulation aneurysms. This was not the case for the posterior circulation aneurysms, where coil embolization appeared to provide a sustained advantage over clipping. Aneurysm obliteration rates in BRAT were significantly lower and retreatment rates significantly higher in the patients undergoing coiling than in those undergoing clipping. However, despite the fact that retreatment rates were higher after coiling, no recurrent hemorrhages were known to have occurred in patients undergoing coiling in BRAT who were followed up for 6 years. Sufficient questions remain about the relative benefits of the 2 treatment modalities to warrant further well-designed randomized trials.","Spetzler, Robert F; McDougall, Cameron G; Zabramski, Joseph M; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Hills, Nancy K; Russin, Jonathan J; Partovi, Shahram; Nakaji, Peter; Wallace, Robert C",Journal of neurosurgery,376,29

This disease has a high rate of transmission and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the survival of COVID-19 patients in Kurdistan province. METHODS In this retrospective study, the data including demographic features and the patient's clinical background in terms of co-morbidities such as diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease (CLD), coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic kidney disease (CKD) and weak immune system (WIS) were extracted from electronic medical records. We use Cox's regression proportional hazard (PH) to model. RESULTS In this study, out of 1831 patients, 1019 were males (55.7%) and 812 were females (44.3%) with an average age of 52.74 ± 22.16 years. For survival analysis, data from people infected with COVID-19 who died or were still being treated were used. According to Cox's regression analysis, age variables (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.03, CI: 1.02-1.04), patients with a history of diabetes (HR: 2.16, CI: 1.38-3.38), cancer (HR: 3.57, CI: 1.82-7.02), CLD (HR: 2.21, CI: 1.22-4) and CHD (HR: 2.20, CI: 1.57-3.09) were significant and affected the hazard of death in patients with COVID-19 and assuming that the other variables in the model are constant, the hazard of death increases by 3% by increasing one unit (year), and the hazard of death in COVID-19 patients with CHD, diabetes, cancer, CLD is 2.16, 3.57, 2.2 and 2.21, respectively. CONCLUSION According to findings, it is necessary to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with CLD, diabetes, cancer, CHD, and elder, as patients with these characteristics may face a greater risk of death. Therefore, we suggest that elders and people with those underlying illnesses need to be under active surveillance and screened frequently.","Zandkarimi, Eghbal; Moradi, Ghobad; Mohsenpour, Behzad",International journal of health policy and management,376,16

METHODS A model for OO using sliced bovine tibia and sliced muscle tissue was developed. A bone cavity filled with either a mixture of SPIO and agarose or pure agarose (control group) was established. EMA was performed using an experimental system, RFA and MWA using clinically approved systems, and the ablation protocols recommended by the vendor. For temperature measurements, fiberoptic temperature probes were inserted inside the cavity, on the outside of the periosteum, and at a 5 mm distance to the periosteum. RESULTS Maximum temperatures with or without SPIO in the nidus were as follows: EMA: 79.9 ± 2.5/22.3 ± 0.7 °C; RFA: 95.1 ± 1.8/98.6 ± 0.9 °C; MWA: 85.1 ± 10.8/83.4 ± 9.62 °C. In RFA with or without SPIO significantly higher temperatures were achieved in the nidus compared to all other groups (p < 0.05). In MWA significantly higher temperatures were observed in the 5 mm distance to the periosteum compared to EMA and RFA with or without SPIO (p < 0.05). In MWA temperature decrease between nidus and the 5 mm distance to the periosteum was significantly lower than in RFA with or without SPIO (p < 0.0001). In MWA without SPIO temperature decrease was significantly lower than in the EMA group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION In the experimental setting, ablation of OO is safe and effective using EMA. It is less invasive than RFA and MWA, and it theoretically allows repeated treatments without repeated punctures. In comparison, the highest temperatures in the nidus are reached using RFA.","Isfort, Peter; Witte, H; Slabu, I; Penzkofer, T; Baumann, M; Braunschweig, T; Kennes, L N; Kuhl, C K; Schmitz-Rode, T; Mahnken, A H; Bruners, P",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,376,1

To determine the impacts of adjuvant corticosteroid administrated to patients with non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD A retrospective cohort study based on propensity score analysis was designed to explore the effects of corticosteroid on several clinical outcomes. RESULTS 132 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and 35 pairs were generated according to propensity score matching. Compared to non-corticosteroid group, the CT score on day 7 was significantly higher in corticosteroid group (8.6 (IQR, 2.8-11.5) versus 12.0 (IQR, 5.0-19.3), P = 0.046). In corticosteroid group, more patients progressed to severe cases (11.4% versus 2.9%, P = 0.353), hospital stay (23.5 days (IQR, 19-29 d) versus 20.2 days (IQR, 14-25.3 d), P = 0.079) and duration of viral shedding (20.3 days (IQR, 15.2-24.8 d) versus 19.4 days (IQR, 11.5-28.3 d), P = 0.669) were prolonged, while fever time (9.5 days (IQR, 6.5-12.2 d) versus 10.2 days (IQR, 6.8-14 d), P = 0.28) was shortened, however all these data revealed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION Corticosteroid might have a negative effect on lung injury recovery in non-severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients, however the results of this study must be interpreted with caution because of confounding factors.","Yuan, Mingli; Xu, Xiaoxiao; Xia, Dongping; Tao, Zhaowu; Yin, Wen; Tan, Weijun; Hu, Yi; Song, Cheng",Shock,376,1

Therefore, we aimed to explore microcirculatory effects of combined spinal-general anaesthesia and laparoscopy, as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy over forearm and calf muscles utilising a 3-min ischemic challenge. Patients (n = 102) undergoing elective laparoscopic gynaecological surgery were randomised to receive general anaesthesia alone or in combination with high-dose or low-dose spinal analgesia (levobupivacaine 7.5 mg or 3.75 mg, respectively, plus sufentanil 2.5 μg). Primary outcomes were near-infrared spectroscopy derived parameters before general anaesthesia induction, 5 min after tracheal intubation, and 15 min after pneumoperitoneum commencement. General anaesthesia resulted in impaired post-ischaemic recovery rate in the forearm (p < 0.001, within all groups), which improved during laparoscopy. For the calf, before general anaesthesia induction, high and low dose spinal analgesia significantly slowed the post-ischaemic recovery compared to control (34 ± 16% min-1 and 36 ± 13% min-1 vs. 52 ± 27% min-1, respectively; p = 0.002 and p = 0.006). General anaesthesia abolished differences between the groups (24 ± 14% min-1 and 25 ± 12% min-1 vs. 27 ± 18% min-1), while during laparoscopy high-dose spinal analgesia further reduced the post-ischaemic recovery compared to low-dose spinal and control groups (p = 0.023 and p = 0.040, respectively). During gynaecological laparoscopy patients show impaired calf but maintain forearm microcirculatory function, regardless of the anaesthetic technique. Reduction in post-ischaemic recovery with high-dose spinal analgesia is explained by its sympatholytic effects: number of perfused capillaries is increased, leading to a haemodynamically more favourable state. Blood pressure is positively correlated with the post-ischaemic recovery rate in vascular beds not affected by spinal analgesia.","Zdravkovic, Marko; Podbregar, Matej; Kamenik, Mirt",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,376,20

It has already infected more than 54.5 million people worldwide, currently leading to more than 1.3 million deaths. Although it causes a mild flu-like disease in most patients, lethality may increase to more than 20% in elderly subjects, especially in those with comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes, or lung and cardiac disease, and the mechanisms are still elusive. Common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, headache, and diarrhea or constipation. Interestingly, respiratory viruses have also placed themselves as relevant agents for central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 has already been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Here, we discuss several clinical features related to CNS infection during COVID-19. Patients may progress from headaches and migraines to encephalitis, stroke, and seizures with leptomeningitis. However, the pathway used by the virus to reach the brain is still unknown. It may infect the olfactory bulb by retrograde neuronal transportation from olfactory epithelium, or it could be transported by the blood. Either way, neurological complications of COVID-19 add greatly to the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Neurological signs and symptoms must alert physicians not only to worst outcomes but also to future possible degenerative diseases.","Bandeira, Isabelle Pastor; Schlindwein, Marco Antônio Machado; Breis, Leticia Caroline; Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann; Gonçalves, Marcus Vinícius Magno",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,376,28

T he identification of patients at high risk for early recurrence, which are potential candidates to prompt anticoagulation, is crucial to justify the risk of bleeding associated with early anticoagulant treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate in patients with acute ischemic stroke and AF the association between findings at trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) and 90 days recurrence. In consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke and AF, TTE was performed within 7 days from hospital admission. Study outcomes were recurrent ischemic cerebrovascular events (stroke or TIA) and systemic embolism. 854 patients (mean age 76.3 ± 9.5 years) underwent a TTE evaluation; 63 patients (7.4%) had at least a study outcome event. Left atrial thrombosis was present in 11 patients (1.3%) among whom 1 had recurrent ischemic event. Left atrial enlargement was present in 548 patients (64.2%) among whom 51 (9.3%) had recurrent ischemic events. The recurrence rate in the 197 patients with severe left atrial enlargement was 11.7%. On multivariate analysis, the presence of atrial enlargement (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.06-4.29, p = 0.033) and CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR 1.22; 95% CI 1.04-1.45, p = 0.018, for each point increase) were correlated with ischemic recurrences. In patients with AF-associated acute stroke, left atrial enlargement is an independent marker of recurrent stroke and systemic embolism. The risk of recurrence is accounted for by severe atrial enlargement. TTE-detected left atrial thrombosis is relatively uncommon.","Paciaroni, Maurizio; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Falocci, Nicola; Caso, Valeria; Becattini, Cecilia; Marcheselli, Simona; Rueckert, Christina; Pezzini, Alessandro; Poli, Loris; Padovani, Alessandro; Csiba, Laszló; Szabó, Lilla; Sohn, Sung-Il; Tassinari, Tiziana; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Michel, Patrik; Cordier, Maria; Vanacker, Peter; Remillard, Suzette; Alberti, Andrea; Venti, Michele; Acciarresi, Monica; D'Amore, Cataldo; Mosconi, Maria Giulia; Scoditti, Umberto; Denti, Licia; Orlandi, Giovanni; Chiti, Alberto; Gialdini, Gino; Bovi, Paolo; Carletti, Monica; Rigatelli, Alberto; Putaala, Jukka; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Masotti, Luca; Lorenzini, Gianni; Tassi, Rossana; Guideri, Francesca; Martini, Giuseppe; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Vadikolias, Kostantinos; Liantinioti, Chrissoula; Corea, Francesco; Del Sette, Massimo; Ageno, Walter; De Lodovici, Maria Luisa; Bono, Giorgio; Baldi, Antonio; D'Anna, Sebastiano; Sacco, Simona; Carolei, Antonio; Tiseo, Cindy; Imberti, Davide; Zabzuni, Dorjan; Doronin, Boris; Volodina, Vera; Consoli, Domenico; Galati, Franco; Pieroni, Alessio; Toni, Danilo; Monaco, Serena; Baronello, Mario Maimone; Barlinn, Kristian; Pallesen, Lars-Peder; Kepplinger, Jessica; Bodechtel, Ulf; Gerber, Johannes; Deleu, Dirk; Melikyan, Gayane; Ibrahim, Faisal; Akhtar, Naveed; Lees, Kennedy R",Journal of neurology,376,1

DESIGN We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews and surveys. After applying an overarching organizational framework, we used an iterative, team-based process to develop relevant inductive codes. We then performed thematic analyses to identify and catalogue critical domains related to surgeons' education about opioid prescribing. SETTING Tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS Maximum variation purposive sampling was used to recruit general surgery residents and surgical faculty members. RESULTS We interviewed 21 attending surgeons and 20 surgical residents. Surgeons reported minimal formal training on pain management and prescribing opioids. A minority of individuals described receiving opioid training in the form of continuing medical education, intern boot camp sessions, and medical school classes. Participants compensated for the lack of formal training during residency by informally learning from senior residents, consulting pain specialists, and seeking external learning resources. Increased surgical experience was correlated with increased comfort with pain management. A majority of surgeons desired formal training. The most commonly requested educational resources were opioid prescribing guidelines for common operations and recommendations for treating chronic pain patients. Residents requested that training occur early in residency to maximize the benefits received. Based on these findings, we developed a conceptual framework to explain how surgeons learn to prescribe opioids and to highlight opportunities for improvement. CONCLUSIONS Although surgeons routinely prescribe opioids and desire education on opioids, a majority of them do not receive any training. Instituting formal educational programs is critical for improving opioid prescribing practices among surgeons.These programs should include standard prescribing guidelines and address management of acute postoperative pain in patients with chronic pain.","Ayakta, Nagehan; Sceats, Lindsay A; Merrell, Sylvia Bereknyei; Kin, Cindy",Journal of surgical education,376,1

Whether paramedics have a duty to treat under extreme conditions and what acceptable limitations may be placed on such a duty require urgent consideration. The purpose of this research is to encourage discussion within the paramedic profession and broader community on this important ethical and legal issue. METHODS The authors employed qualitative methods to gather paramedic and community member perspectives in Victoria, Australia. RESULTS These findings suggested that both paramedic and community member participants agree that acceptable limitations on paramedic duty to treat during disaster are required. These limitations should be based on consideration of the following factors: personal health circumstances (eg, pregnancy for female paramedics); pre-existing mental health conditions (eg, posttraumatic stress disorder/PTSD); competing personal obligations (eg, paramedics who are single parents); and unacceptable levels of personal risk (eg, risk of exposure and infection during a pandemic). CONCLUSION It is only with the engagement of a more broadly representative segment of the prehospital profession and greater Australian community that appropriate guidance on limiting standards of care under extreme conditions can be developed and integrated within prehospital care in Australia.

METHODS A retrospective chart review identified 248 patients who were treated for symptomatic peripheral artery disease with the Lutonix DCB between May 2013 and October 2014. Forty patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 208 patients (mean age 74.1±9.7 years; 138 men) with evaluable data for outcome analysis. The patient cohort suffered from either severe claudication (38.6%) or critical limb ischemia (CLI; 61.4%) in 220 limbs. Almost two-thirds (140, 63.6%) of the 220 target lesions were total occlusions, and 37 (17.8%) of all patients had occlusion of all 3 BTK vessels before intervention. RESULTS Over a median 9-month follow-up, target lesion revascularization occurred in 15.9% of patients with an average time to first reintervention of 8 months. In total, 39 amputations were performed in 31 limbs. However, 17 of these amputations were preplanned minor amputations below the ankle; only 9 (4.1%) major amputations occurred corresponding to 6.6% of the CLI cohort. Freedom from the composite of death or major amputation was estimated as 92% and 85% at 6 and 12 months, respectively, by Kaplan-Meier analysis. In the full cohort, improvement of at least 1 Rutherford category was seen in 130 (59.1%) limbs after 1 year or at the last follow-up, with 104 (80.0%) of those limbs showing an improvement of ≥2 categories. CONCLUSION From this single-center experience, the Lutonix DCB shows therapeutic promise in a disease state where new treatment options are needed.","Steiner, Sabine; Schmidt, Andrej; Bausback, Yvonne; Bräunlich, Sven; Ulrich, Matthias; Banning-Eichenseer, Ursula; Scheinert, Dierk",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,376,27

The Western Australian Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Study commenced in 2008 to evaluate a program providing TIV to children aged 6 to 59 months. METHODS An observational study enrolling children with influenza-like illness presenting to a tertiary pediatric hospital was conducted (2008-2012). Vaccination status was determined by parental questionnaire and confirmed via the national immunization register and/or vaccine providers. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction and culture were performed on nasopharyngeal samples. The test-negative design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) by using 2 control groups: all influenza test-negative subjects and other-virus-detected (OVD) subjects. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated from models with season, month of disease onset, age, gender, indigenous status, prematurity, and comorbidities as covariates. Subjects enrolled in 2009 were excluded from VE calculations. RESULTS Of 2001 children enrolled, influenza was identified in 389 (20.4%) children. Another respiratory virus was identified in 1134 (59.6%) children. Overall, 295 of 1903 (15.5%) children were fully vaccinated and 161 of 1903 (8.4%) children were partially vaccinated. Vaccine uptake was significantly lower in 2010-2012 after increased febrile adverse events observed in 2010. Using test-negative controls, VE was 64.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 33.7%-81.2%). No difference in VE was observed with OVD controls (65.8%; 95% CI: 32.1%-82.8%). The VE for children <2 years was 85.8% (95% CI: 37.9%-96.7%). CONCLUSIONS This study reveals the effectiveness of TIV in young children over 4 seasons by using test-negative and OVD controls. TIV was effective in children aged <2 years. Despite demonstrated vaccine effectiveness, uptake of TIV remains suboptimal.","Blyth, Christopher C; Jacoby, Peter; Effler, Paul V; Kelly, Heath; Smith, David W; Robins, Christine; Willis, Gabriela A; Levy, Avram; Keil, Anthony D; Richmond, Peter C",Pediatrics,376,1

These synthetic viral particles are safer surrogates of native viruses and acquire the tropism and host entry pathway characteristics governed by the heterologous envelope glycoprotein used. They have proven to be very useful tools used in research with many applications, such as enabling the study of entry pathways of enveloped viruses and to generate effective gene-delivery vectors. The basis for their generation lies in the capacity of some viruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), to incorporate envelope glycoproteins of other viruses into a pseudotyped virus particle. These can be engineered to contain reporter genes such as luciferase, enabling quantification of virus entry events upon pseudotyped particle infection with susceptible cells. Here, we detail a protocol enabling generation of MLV-based pseudotyped particles, using the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S) as an example of a heterologous envelope glycoprotein to be incorporated.

METHODS In total, 36 thrombectomy procedures were performed on a Mentice endovascular simulator by six radiologists not specialized in neurointerventions. Each radiologist was challenged with six different endovascular simulation scenarios under alternating conventional local support (specialist inside the room [LOS]) and RESS, which was performed using an advanced live streaming platform. RESULTS Both support modes led to a median of 2 attempts (interquartile range [IQR] 2.0-2.0 each) until successful recanalization.

The percentage of thrombi covered by the stent-retriever and average speed when retrieving the stent-retriever (3.7 mm/s, IQR 3.25-5.35 mm/s vs. 3.6 mm/sec, IQR 2.5-4.7) were similar in both groups. Fluoroscopy time did not differ (19.0 min, IQR 16.9-23.5 min vs. 19.9 min, IQR 15.9-23.5 min) with a trend towards increased median amounts of contrast medium used under RESS (62.9 ml vs. 43.1 ml; p = 0.055). CONCLUSION This study confirmed the feasibility of RESS for thrombectomy procedures in a simulated environment. This serves as basis for future studies planned to analyze the effectiveness of RESS in a real-world environment and to test if it improves the learning curve of interventionalists with limited thrombectomy experience in remote areas.","Bechstein, Matthias; Buhk, Jan-Hendrik; Frölich, Andreas Maximilian; Broocks, Gabriel; Hanning, Uta; Erler, Martin; Anđelković, Milan; Debeljak, Dragan; Fiehler, Jens; Goebell, Einar",Clinical neuroradiology,376,1

BACKGROUND The frequent occurrence of disasters has caused concern internationally. When disaster strikes, the demands on nursing staff are much higher than those on other healthcare professionals. There is little understanding of the concept of disaster among nurses in Hong Kong. DESIGN This was a descriptive study. A questionnaire was used to explore nurses' perception of disaster. METHOD The questionnaire was distributed to all registered nurses studying in a master's degree programme in a university in Hong Kong. FINDINGS Only 123 out of the 164 respondents (75%) gave a description of disaster in the open-ended question. Sixty-one per cent of them described unfortunate events with large numbers of victims as disasters. The 'Lan Kwai Fong tragedy--stampede caused by over-crowdedness' (90.9%) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak (89.6%) were commonly referred to as disasters in Hong Kong. Fires in tall buildings (61.6%), infectious disease outbreaks (61%) and stampedes caused by overcrowding (48.8%) were rated as the events most likely to happen in Hong Kong. CONCLUSION Understanding how nurses perceive disaster and the likelihood of disastrous events is the initial step for disaster planning and the development of a disaster nursing curriculum in Hong Kong. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE All nurses around the world should be equipped with knowledge and skills for disaster care. This study provides information and implications for related research and the development of a disaster nursing curriculum to meet the global demand for disaster preparedness.","Fung, W M Olivia; Lai, K Y Claudia; Loke, Alice Yuen",Journal of clinical nursing,376,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS The literature on PEEK in implant prosthodontics published through August 2018 was identified with an online search of MEDLINE (via PubMed), Science Direct, Embase (via Ovid), and Google Scholar databases. Qualitative and quantitative syntheses were carried out for original research studies. RESULTS The amount of published original research studies was found to be limited. PEEK was found to be applied as a material in the fabrication of implant-supported fixed dental prosthesis (IFDP) frameworks (43%), prosthetic implant abutments (35%), implant abutment screws (15%), and retention clips on implant bars (7%). Only 38% of the studies were clinical studies, while 15% were observational and 47% were in vitro. The studies identified did not permit the estimation of long-term survival nor success rates for any of the prosthetic components. The results only allowed a preliminary short-term assessment of PEEK IFDP frameworks, which presented satisfactory survival but alarming success rates over the first year of service. CONCLUSION In light of the paucity of evidence on the viability of PEEK as an implant-prosthodontic material, its use cannot yet be endorsed. Clinicians should heed the suggested protocols to improve mechanical performance and lower the incidence of prosthetic complications. Further high-quality research is needed for an enhanced understanding of the material's viability.","Paratelli, Andrea; Perrone, Giammarco; Ortega, Rocío; Gómez-Polo, Miguel",The International journal of prosthodontics,376,1

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of insurance type on the rate and type of initial concussion visits and the time from injury to the initial visit in youth. METHODS We extracted and analyzed initial concussion-related medical visits for youth ages 10 to 17 from electronic health records. Patients must have visited Nationwide Children's Hospital's (NCH) concussion clinic at least once between 7/1/2012 and 12/31/2017. We evaluated the trends and patterns of initial concussion visits across the study period using regression analyses. RESULTS Of 4955 unique concussion visits included, 60.1% were males, 80.5% were white, and 69.5% were paid by private insurance. Patients' average age was 13.9 years (SD = 3.7). The rate of the initial concussion visits per 10,000 NCH visits was consistently higher in privately insured than publicly insured youth throughout the study period (P < .0001). Privately insured youth had greater odds of initial concussion visits to sports medicine clinics (AOR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.20, 1.76) but lower odds of initial concussion visits to the ED/urgent care (AOR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.60, 0.90) than publicly insured youth. Days from injury to initial concussion visit significantly decreased among both insurance types throughout the study (P < .0001), with a greater decrease observed in publicly insured than privately insured youth (P = .011). CONCLUSIONS Results on the differences in the rate, type, and time of initial concussion-related visits may help inform more efficient care of concussion among youth with different types of insurance.","Radlicz, Chris; Jackson, Kenneth; Hautmann, Amanda; Shi, Junxin; Yang, Jingzhen",BMC public health,376,6

METHODS In this randomized, single-blind, prospective study, subjects between the ages 1 and 25 years with skin abscesses needing an I&D were enrolled consecutively and randomized to be packed or not packed following the procedure. Treatment failure was assessed at a 48-hour follow-up visit by a masked observer who rated the need for a major intervention (repeat I&D or re-exploration) or minor intervention (antibiotics initiated or changed, need for packing, or repeat visit). Pain scores were assessed using color analog scales before and after the procedure and repeated at the 48-hour follow-up visit. Healing and abscess recurrence were assessed via telephone interview at 1 week and 1 month. RESULTS Fifty-seven subjects were enrolled over a 15-month period. Overall failure rates were similar between the groups, with 19 (70%) of 27 subjects in the packed group needing an intervention by 48 hours compared with 13 (59%) of 22 subjects in the nonpacked group who needed an intervention (difference, 11%; 95% confidence interval, -15% to 36%). Major and minor intervention rates were also similar. Pain scores did not significantly differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS Wound packing does not appear to significantly impact the failure or recurrence rates after simple I&D. Larger studies are needed to better validate the equivalency of these 2 strategies.","Kessler, David O; Krantz, Amanda; Mojica, Michael",Pediatric emergency care,376,1

Due to a complex combination of physical, psychosocial and addiction problems at the end of life, they often have limited access to palliative care. Both the homeless and healthcare providers experience a lot of barriers. Therefore, providing palliative care that fits the needs and concerns of the homeless is a challenge to healthcare providers. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence about the concerns, palliative care needs and preferences of homeless people, as well as barriers and facilitators for delivering high quality palliative care. METHODS PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched up to 10 May 2016. Included were studies about homeless people with a short life expectancy, their palliative care needs and the palliative care provided, that were conducted in Western countries. Data were independently extracted by two researchers using a predefined extraction form. Quality was assessed using a Critical Appraisal instrument. The systematic literature review was based on the PRISMA statement. RESULTS Twenty-seven publications from 23 different studies met the inclusion criteria; 15 studies were qualitative and eight were quantitative. Concerns of the homeless often related to end-of-life care not being a priority, drug dependence hindering adequate care, limited insight into their condition and little support from family and relatives. Barriers and facilitators often concerned the attitude of healthcare professionals towards homeless people. A respectful approach and respect for dignity proved to be important in good quality palliative care. CONCLUSIONS A patient-centred, flexible and low-threshold approach embodying awareness of the concerns of homeless people is needed so that appropriate palliative care can be provided timely. Training, education and experience of professionals can help to accomplish this.","Klop, Hanna T; de Veer, Anke J E; van Dongen, Sophie I; Francke, Anneke L; Rietjens, Judith A C; Onwuteaka-Philipsen, Bregje D",BMC palliative care,376,7

STUDY DESIGN Prospective observational study. METHODS We constructed a transoral robotic surgery (TORS) simulator using porcine tongue in a modified airway mannequin. Twenty-nine surgeons performed transoral robotic posterior hemiglossectomy on the simulator. The 20 resident subjects completed six trials each, and the five fellows and four attending surgeons completed two trials each. In addition to instrument vibrations, surgical video was recorded for each trial and was blindly rated using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skill (GEARS), a validated instrument for assessing robotic surgical skill. RESULTS Attending surgeons were faster (P = .004) and demonstrated greater technical skill than fellows or residents (P < .001). Resident completion time generally decreased over the study, becoming significantly faster by the fifth trial (P = .02). A similar trend was seen in resident GEARS scores, which generally increased and were significantly improved by the fourth trial (P = .008). Instrument vibrations were not significantly different between subject groups. Finally, subjects highly rated the realism and training value of the TORS simulator (mean 4.4 and 4.7 out of 5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The reported findings support using the described simulator as a training tool for TORS. Residents significantly improved in speed and technical skill over the course of six trials but did not achieve the performance levels of attending surgeons. These results demonstrate that high-fidelity simulation is a valuable tool for training novice surgeons in transoral robotic surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE NA.

Here, we explored IgG autoantibodies reacting with a panel of cytoplasmic endosomal/lysosomal antigens and individual heat-shock proteins, all of which share links to autophagy. Sera from autoimmune patients and from MRL/lpr and NZB/W lupus-prone mice reacted with the C-terminal residues of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP)2A. No cross-reaction was observed with LAMP2B or LAMP2C variants, with dsDNA or mononucleosomes, or with heat-shock protein A8. Moreover, administering chromatography-purified LAMP2A autoantibodies to MRL/lpr mice accelerated mortality. Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed elevated cell-surface expression of LAMP2A on MRL/lpr B cells. These findings reveal the involvement of a new class of autoantibodies targeting the C-terminus of LAMP2A, a receptor for cytosolic proteins targeted for degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy. These autoantibodies could affect the autophagy process, which is abnormally upregulated in lupus.

AIMS The aims of the current study were to assess the prevalence of loneliness among young people at the time of COVID-19 and to identify whether selected variables related to the pandemic predicted the level of loneliness. METHOD A cross-sectional study using WhatsApp and Facebook social media platforms was conducted to survey 1,057 young people aged 15 to 24 years from six Middle Eastern countries. Participants completed survey items including demographic and COVID-19-related questions; the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS); the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS); and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. RESULTS The prevalence of experienced loneliness was 1 (0.1%), 625 (59.1%), 429 (40.6%), and 2 (0.2%), reflecting low, moderate, moderately high, and high experiences for loneliness, respectively. History of depression or anxiety, being dissatisfied with life, and having depression at the time of COVID-19 were significant predictors of loneliness among youth. The model was significant (F = 44.95, p < .05) and accounted for 29.8% of the variance in UCLA Loneliness Scale scores.

Currently, no consensus for the ideal AP regimen exists. Thus the present study aimed to gain a better understanding of real world practice AP patterns by surveying neurointerventional surgeons. METHODS Survey links were emailed to 296 neurointerventional surgeons practicing in the USA, asking 51 questions including demographics, stent specific use, AP pre and post-medication, types of APs, point of care (POC) assessment, complications, and outcomes. Data were collected and analyzed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). RESULTS 74 participants responded; 56.8% were from academic centers. Participants treated an average of 5.5 aneurysms per month. They placed an average of 1.6 intracranial stents and 1.4 cervical stents per month. Mean number of pipeline embolization devices (PEDs) placed per year was 15.2. Heterogeneity existed regarding AP regimens; the most frequent included acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 325 mg+Plavix 75 mg daily (for 7 days prior) and ASA 325 mg+Plavix 75 mg daily (for 5 days prior) for routine placement of intracranial and cervical stents, respectively. For emergency placement, ASA 325 mg+Plavix 600 mg (at time of surgery) was the most frequently used. 46.8% routinely used POC testing, most frequently VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, California, USA); the most common threshold determining a non-responder was <30% inhibition. 85.7% used POC for PED placement. Management changes based on POC testing were diverse. CONCLUSIONS The results highlight the heterogeneity of current practices regarding AP medication regimens during neurovascular stenting. Given its importance, evidence based protocols are imperative. Minimal literature exists focusing on neurovasculature, and therefore understanding current practice patterns represents a first step toward generating these protocols.","Faught, Ryan W F; Satti, Sudhakar R; Hurst, Robert W; Pukenas, Bryan A; Smith, Michelle Janine",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,376,1

The reverse holds true for A(H5N1) influenza; at a fatality rate that exceeds 60%, it is known to cause severe damage to the human respiratory system, but is not presently capable of efficient transmission from human to human. Apart from the clear differences between the two types of influenza, there are some significant similarities that warrant attention. In particular, the more severe and fatal 2009 A(H1N1) influenza cases have shown symptoms similar to those reported in cases of A(H5N1) influenza. Histopathological findings for these cases, to the extent available, also appear to have similarities for both diseases in terms of damage and severity. Here we review important recent publications in this area, and we discuss some of the key commonalities and contrasts between the two influenza A types in terms of their biology, origins, clinical features, pathology and pathogenesis, and receptors and transmissibility.","Korteweg, Christine; Gu, Jiang",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,376,4

While many patients are incidentally diagnosed during operation, in some cases it can present with severe gastrointestinal symptoms. In this case report, the patient presented with signs of toxic megacolon leading to rapid aggravation of inflammatory shock. PATIENT CONCERNS A 49-day old male infant presented with fever, poor feeding, and severe abdominal distension. DIAGNOSIS Abdominal ultrasonography was done. During the examination, a foley catheter was inserted through the anus to evaluate bowel patency and enable rectal decompression. The tip of the foley catheter was located in a separate narrower tubular lumen adjacent to the distended rectum. These findings suggested possibility of a tubular duplication cyst of the rectum as the culprit for the bowel obstruction. INTERVENTIONS The patient underwent emergency laparotomy. Findings showed multiple tubular intestinal duplications involving the ileum, appendix, cecum, descending colon, sigmoid colon and rectum. The true lumen of the rectosigmoid colon was completely collapsed while the adjacent tubular cyst remained severely distended and stool passage was not possible. Decompression of the sigmoid colon was done with loop colostomy with both the wall of the true bowel and enteric cyst forming the colostomy orifice. OUTCOMES After 40 days of postoperative care, the patient was discharged with no immediate complications. Four months after the initial operation, colostomy take-down and transanal rectal common wall division was done. No complications were observed. LESSONS To our knowledge, this is the first case to be reported where a rare presentation of intestinal duplication resulted in an acute presentation toxic megacolon. Such emergency cases can be effectively treated with emergency surgical bowel decompression and elective common wall division.","Jang, Eunju; Chung, Jae Hee",Medicine,376,26

Blood was collected from healthy males and nonpregnant females under fasting and nonfasting conditions with and without anticoagulants. Sphingolipids analyzed included sphingoid bases, sphingosine and dihydrosphingosine, their 1-phosphates (S1P and dhS1P), molecular species (C(n)-) of ceramide (Cer), sphingomyelin (SM), hexosylceramide (HexCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), and Cer 1-phosphate (Cer1P). SM, LacCer, HexCer, Cer, and Cer1P constituted 87.7, 5.8, 3.4, 2.8, and 0.15% of total sphingolipids, respectively. The abundant circulating SM was C(16)-SM (64.0 µM), and it increased with fasting (100 µM). The abundant LacCer was C(16)-LacCer (10.0 µM) and the abundant HexCer was C(24)-HexCer (2.5 µM). The abundant Cer, C(24)-Cer (4.0 µM), was not influenced by fasting; however, levels of C(16)-C(20) Cers were decreased in response to fasting. S1P levels were higher in serum than plasma (0.68 µM vs. 0.32 µM). We also determined levels of sphingoid bases and SM species in isolated lipoprotein classes. HDL(3) was the major carrier of S1P, dhS1P, and Sph, and LDL was the major carrier of Cer and dhSph. Per particle, VLDL contained the highest levels of SM, Cer, and S1P.

However, CFTR has been localized to vascular endothelium and smooth muscle, suggesting that CFTR dysfunction may directly impact cardiovascular function. As treatments for CF improve and life-expectancy increases, the risk of vascular disease may increase in prevalence related to primary and secondary CFTR dysfunction, chronic systemic inflammation, nutritional health and hyperglycemia in individuals with CF related diabetes.

First, the structural characteristics and photocatalytic activities of Fe(III)-(8-hydroxyquinoline-5-carboxylic acid)-TiO2 (Fe-HQC-TiO2) nanoparticle to degrade phenolic pollutants and reduce Cr(VI) simultaneously had been investigated. Compared with the single degradation, the efficiency of synergistic degradation/reduction had been improved and the degradation/reduction rate had been obviously accelerated. In particular, the cyclic stability of Fe-HQC-TiO2 photocatalyst decreased obviously when it was used to reduce Cr(VI) alone, but it could still keep above 90% after three cycles when it was used for reduction of Cr(VI) and degradation of phenol synergistically. Second, to Fe-HQS/TiO2 nanoparticle or Fe-HQS/TiO2 nanotube (HQS (8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonic acid)), the synergistic degradation/reduction (2,4-dichlorophenol/Cr(VI)) efficiencies were always greater than those of a single degradation/reduction and the time was greatly reduced. All the results indicated that there were interactions between Cr(VI) and phenol or 2,4-dichlorophenol in the photocatalytic process. The possible mechanism of synergistic accelerated degradation of phenolic compounds and reduction of Cr(VI) was proposed by analyzing and testing the surface characteristics of photocatalyst and the properties of photocatalytic system during the synergistic degradation/reduction.","Guo, Tongtong; Yang, Shuang; Chen, Yunning; Yang, Lu; Sun, Yingnan; Shang, Qingkun",Environmental science and pollution research international,376,16

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of negative RT-PCR results at first clinical presentation as well as negative serological results after a follow-up of at least 3 weeks. Methods Among all patients seen for suspected COVID-19 in Liechtenstein (n=1921), we included initially RT-PCR positive index patients (n=85) as well as initially RT-PCR negative (n=66) for follow-up with SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Antibodies were detected with seven different commercially available immunoassays. Frequencies of negative RT-PCR and serology results in individuals with COVID-19 were determined and compared to those observed in a validation cohort of Swiss patients (n=211). Results Among COVID-19 patients in Liechtenstein, false-negative RT-PCR at initial presentation was seen in 18% (12/66), whereas negative serology in COVID-19 patients was 4% (3/85). The validation cohort showed similar frequencies: 2/66 (3%) for negative serology, and 16/155 (10%) for false negative RT-PCR. COVID-19 patients with negative follow-up serology tended to have a longer disease duration (p=0.05) and more clinical symptoms than other patients with COVID-19 (p<0.05). The antibody titer from quantitative immunoassays was positively associated with the number of disease symptoms and disease duration (p<0.001). Conclusions RT-PCR at initial presentation in patients with suspected COVID-19 can miss infected patients. Antibody titers of SARS-CoV-2 assays are linked to the number of disease symptoms and the duration of disease. One in 25 patients with RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 does not develop antibodies detectable with frequently employed and commercially available immunoassays.","Baron, Rita Christiane; Risch, Lorenz; Weber, Myriam; Thiel, Sarah; Grossmann, Kirsten; Wohlwend, Nadia; Lung, Thomas; Hillmann, Dorothea; Ritzler, Michael; Bigler, Susanna; Egli, Konrad; Ferrara, Francesca; Bodmer, Thomas; Imperiali, Mauro; Heer, Sonja; Renz, Harald; Flatz, Lukas; Kohler, Philipp; Vernazza, Pietro; Kahlert, Christian R; Paprotny, Matthias; Risch, Martin",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,376,17

We surveyed ECT providers across Canada to understand how the first wave of the pandemic affected ECT delivery between mid-March 2020 and mid-May 2020. METHODS The survey was administered to ECT team members and decision makers at 107 Canadian health care centers with a focus on 5 domains: operations, decision-making, hospital resources, ECT procedure, and patient impact. Responses were obtained from 72 institutions, and collected answers were used to derive representative responses reflecting the situation at each ECT center. For specific domains, responses were split into 2 databases representing the perspective of psychiatrists (n = 67 centers) and anesthesiologists (n = 24 centers). RESULTS Provision of ECT decreased in 64% centers and was completely suspended in 27% of centers after the onset of the pandemic. Outpatient and maintenance ECT were more affected than inpatient and acute ECT. Programs reported a high level of collaboration between psychiatry and hospital leadership (59%) but a limited input from clinical ethicists (18%). Decisions were mostly made ad hoc leading to variability across institutions in adopted resource allocation, physical location of ECT delivery, and triaging frameworks. The majority of centers considered ECT to be aerosol-generating and incorporated changes to airway management. CONCLUSIONS Electroconvulsive therapy services in Canada were markedly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The variability in decision-making across centers warrants the development of a rational approach toward offering ECT in pandemic contexts.","Demchenko, Ilya; Blumberger, Daniel M; Flint, Alastair J; Anderson, Melanie; Daskalakis, Zafiris J; Foley, Karen; Karkouti, Keyvan; Kennedy, Sidney H; Ladha, Karim S; Robertson, Jamie; Vaisman, Alon; Koczerginski, David; Parikh, Sagar V; Bhat, Venkat",The journal of ECT,376,20

METHODS Colloidal gold immunochromatography assay was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody and its titer in 113 convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were followed up from February 19, 2020 to April 6, 2020. The basic characteristics and treatment factors of patients in the high titer group (antibody titer≥1꞉160, n=22) and the low titer group (antibody titer <1꞉160, n=91) were analyzed. The IgG antibody titer in the high titer group was continuously monitored and the trend of titer was analyzed. RESULTS The difference in the clinical type of COVID-19, onset time, first admission C-reactive protein, absolute value of lymphocyte, absolute value of CD19+CD3- lymphocytes, and the treatment of glucocorticoid were not statistically significant between the patients in the high titer group and the low titer group (all P>0.05). The male patients in the high titer group were more than those in the low titer group (P<0.05). The titer of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in the high titer group decreased to less than 1꞉160 28 d after discharge. CONCLUSIONS Male COVID-19 patients might be more likely to produce high titer SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies than female. The peak level of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in convalescent patients is maintained for a short period. Using plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients for treatment should be within 28 d after discharge.","Wu, Chenggao; Liu, Wei; Li, Guoliang; Zhang, Zhanglin; Xiao, Kun; LE, Aiping",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

To characterize the studies, metadata was extracted from Pubmed, Web of Science, Altmetrics Explorer, and Unpaywall. Results The authors analyzed 963 knowledge syntheses representing 3.1% of total articles published (n=30,597). On average, 45.9 knowledge syntheses were published annually (SD=35.85, Median=33), and there was an overall 2,620% increase in the number of knowledge syntheses published from 1999 to 2019. The journals each published, on average, a total of 68.8 knowledge syntheses (SD=67.2, Median=41) with Medical Education publishing the most (n=189; 19%). Twenty-one knowledge synthesis types were identified; the most prevalent types were systematic reviews (n=341; 35.4%) and scoping reviews (n=88; 9.1%). Knowledge syntheses were cited an average of 53.80 times (SD=107.12, Median=19) and received a mean Altmetric Attention Score of 14.12 (SD=37.59, Median=6). Conclusions There has been considerable growth in knowledge syntheses in medical education over the past 20 years, contributing to medical education’s evidence base. Beyond this increase in volume, researchers have introduced methodological diversity in these publications, and the community has taken to social media to share knowledge syntheses. Implications for the field, including the impact of synthesis types and their relationship to knowledge translation, are discussed.","Maggio, Lauren A.; Costello, Joseph A.; Norton, Candace; Driessen, Erik W.; Artino, Anthony R.",bioRxiv,376,1

Each of the two main types of recent approaches to the problem, feature-driven and generative models, have desired qualities and clear limitations. This paper bridges the gap between these solutions with a new hybrid approach and a new performance benchmark. We model each social cascade with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process, and estimate the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. We then learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade history. To our surprise, Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperform recent feature-driven and generative approaches on existing tweet data [43] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. From these observations, we argue that future work on popularity prediction should compare across feature-driven and generative modeling approaches in both classification and regression tasks.","Mishra, Swapnil; Rizoiu, Marian-Andrei; Xie, Lexing",,376,1

Reverse transcription associated with real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) has been the gold-standard molecular tool for diagnosis and detection of the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, it is used as the main strategy for testing, traceability, and control of positive cases For this reason, the on-top high demand for reagents has produced stock-out on several occasions and the only alternative to keep population diagnosis has been the use of different RT-qPCR kits. Therefore, we evaluate the performance of three of the commercial RT-qPCR kits currently in use for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in Chile, consisting in: TaqMan 2019-nCoV Assay Kit v1 (Thermo). Real-Time Fluorescent RT-PCR Kit for Detecting SARS-CoV-2 (BGI), and LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master (Roche). Results of quantification cycle (Cq) and relative fluorescence units (RFU) obtained from their RT-qPCR reactions revealed important discrepancies on the total RNA required for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 genes and diagnosis. Marked differences between kits in samples with 30>Cq value< 34 was observed. Samples with positive diagnoses for Covid-19 using the Thermo Fisher kit had different results when the same samples were evaluated with Roche and BGI kits. The displacement on the Cq value for SARS-CoV-2 identification between the three different RT-qPCR kits was also evident when the presence of single nucleotide variants was evaluated in the context of genomic surveillance. Taken together, this study emphasizes the special care adjusting RT-qPCR reaction conditions of the different kits must be taken by all the laboratories before carrying out the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes from total RNA nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples.","Santibanez, A.; Luraschi, R.; Barrera-Avalos, C.; Vallejos-Vidal, E.; Alarcon, J.; Cayunao, J.; Mella, A.; Figueroa, M.; Hernandez, F.; Plaza, B.; Inostroza-Molina, A.; Valdes, D.; Imarai, M.; Acuna-Castillo, C.; Reyes-Lopez, F.

In 2020, the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic, which led to severe nationwide blockade measures, unexpectedly provided a valuable opportunity to study the synergistic reduction in greenhouse gases and polluting gases. This paper uses a combination of NO2, O3, and CO2 column concentration products from different satellites and surface concentrations from ground-based stations to investigate potential correlations between these monitoring indicators in four Chinese representative cities. We found that XCO2 decreased in March to varying degrees in different cities. It was witnessed that the largest decrease in CO2, −1.12 ppm, occurred in Wuhan, i.e., the first epicenter of COVID-19. We also analyzed the effects of NO2 and O3 concentrations on changes in XCO2. First, in 2020, we used a top-down approach to obtain the conclusion that the change amplitude of NO2 concentration in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan were −24%, −18%, −4%, and −39%, respectively. Furthermore, the O3 concentration increments were 5%, 14%, 12%, and 14%. Second, we used a bottom-up approach to obtain the conclusion that the monthly averaged NO2 concentrations in Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan in March had the largest changes, changing to −39%, −40%, and −61%, respectively. The corresponding amounts of changes in monthly averaged O3 concentrations were −14%, −2%, and 9%. However, the largest amount of change in monthly averaged NO2 concentration in Guangzhou was found in December 2020, with a value of −40%. The change in O3 concentration was −12% in December. Finally, we analyzed the relationship of NO2 and O3 concentrations with XCO2. Moreover, the results show that the effect of NO2 concentration on XCO2 is positively correlated from the point of the satellite (R = 0.4912) and the point of the ground monitoring stations (R = 0.3928). Surprisingly, we found a positive (in satellite observations and R = 0.2391) and negative correlation (in ground monitoring stations and R = 0.3333) between XCO2 and the O3 concentrations. During the epidemic period, some scholars based on model analysis found that Wuhan’s carbon emissions decreased by 16.2% on average. Combined with satellite data, we estimate that Wuhan’s XCO2 fell by about 1.12 ppm in February. At last, the government should consider reducing XCO2 and NO2 concentration at the same time to make a synergistic reduction.","Zhang, Haowei Ma Xin Han Ge Xu Hao Shi Tianqi Zhong Wanqin Gong Wei",Remote Sensing,376,16

Accurately predicting the impact of environmental changes on the evolution of Arctic fishery cooperation, identifying its key influencing elements, and formulating appropriate corresponding measures have practical value for the sustainable development of Arctic fisheries. Based on the collection of fisheries trade data in Arctic sustainable fisheries trade cooperation countries, this paper builds a trade cooperation network, identifies key influencing factors, establishes a network game model, and uses simulation methods to verify the variables. The results show that the reward value given by neighboring countries has a positive effect on such cooperation. The higher the reward value is, the more countries choose to cooperate. The cooperation cost has the opposite effect, the lower the cost, the more countries choose to cooperate. The impact of cost on cooperation is greater than the incentives. The game structure also affects the outcome of cooperation, and the number of countries participating in cooperation based on the Stag Hunt Model is the largest. The change of network structure will have an impact on cooperation, and the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced cooperation on Arctic sustainable fisheries trade cooperation in the short term.","Zhao, Changping Xie Xiya Song Jun",Sustainability,376,32

In this work, we simulated nicotinamide synthesis in laminar flow microreactors with nitrile hydratase enzyme uniformly attached on the microchannel wall and/or immobilized on the surface of microparticles dispersed in the liquid phase. Hydrodynamic/diffusional limitations of laminar flow microreactors are greatly alleviated in intensified flow microreactors and microreactors with an enhanced enzymatic process, which greatly improves when nitrile hydratase loading on the surface of microparticles increases (more enzyme works as a free solution-phase enzyme).

However, no clinical studies have yet compared DARA maintenance versus SoC maintenance. The ongoing phase 3 AURIGA study will evaluate the addition of DARA to lenalidomide maintenance among pts with NDMM who are MRD positive after SoC induction and ASCT. The primary endpoint is the conversion rate to MRD negativity after 1 year of maintenance therapy. Methods: This openlabel, multi center, randomized phase 3 study will enroll approximately 214 pts in the United States aged 18-79 years with NDMM who receive ≥4 cycles of induction followed by ASCT. Pts must enroll within 6 months of ASCT, be naïve for anti-CD38 treatment, have a very good partial response or better per IMWG criteria, and be MRD positive at a threshold of 10-5 by next generation sequencing (NGS) within 30 days of screening. Pts will be stratified by cytogenetic risk (high vs standard/unknown) and randomized 1:1 to 28-day cycles of lenalidomide maintenance (10 mg PO;D1-28 [dose increasing to 15 mg if tolerated]) ± DARA SC (DARA 1,800 mg co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 [rHuPH20;2,000 U/mL;ENHANZE®drug delivery technology, Halozyme, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA;QW Cycle 1-2, Q2W Cycles 3-6, Q4W C7+). Treatment will continue for up to 36 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. The primary endpoint is MRD conversion rate after 12months of maintenance treatment, defined as the proportion of pts who achieve MRD negativity (10-5) by NGS. Additional MRD assessments occur after 18, 24, and 36 months of maintenance. While MRD negativity is associated with improved long-term outcomes for pts with MM and is an emerging, validated prognostic factor, this study is among the first to use MRD negativity as a primary study endpoint. Importantly, MRD negativity allows for earlier efficacy assessment than traditional endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints include overall MRD conversion rate at any time, sustained MRD negativity lasting ≥12 months, PFS, OS, response rates, duration of complete response, changes in health-related quality of life, and safety. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study has been amended to improve enrollment access by allowing up to 12 months from start of induction therapy to ASCT to mitigate against ASCT delays and to allow greater flexibility for screening and laboratory assessments.","Shah, N.; Patel, S.; Pei, H.; Qi, M.; Krevvata, M.; Lin, T.

Total Triage (TT), where all consultations should be triaged first, and Remote-by-Default (RbD) consulting, where a clinician should consult remotely unless there is a clinical exception, were advised. It is unclear how these new ways of working were implemented in practice, and how they impacted vulnerable patients. Aim: To assess the impact of TT and RbD on vulnerable patients and identify mitigation strategies. Design and Setting: A mixed methods service evaluation in Lewisham, London, an area of high deprivation. Method: Three parallel datasets were collected and analysed: Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders working with vulnerable groups and qualitative data from forums with black and ethnic minority patients, a survey of General Practitioners exploring implementation of TT and RbD, and a mystery shopper exercise reviewing access and messaging of ten practices. Results: Barriers to access for vulnerable patients included challenges navigating the new model, difficulty engaging with remote consultations and digital exclusion. There was wide variation in messaging regarding changes to services and the practical application of TT and RbD. Potential solutions included clearer practice guidance and patient messaging, more consistent implementation, and identification and recording of patient access needs to enable better tailoring of care provision. Conclusion: This pilot study identified perceived and actual barriers to accessing general practice for vulnerable patients following the rapid introduction of TT and RbD consulting.

The decrease in volume has not only important implications for cancer diagnosis, surveillance, and management, but also for revenue generation by gynecologic oncology practices. We sought to explore how the implementation of telehealth could aid in maintaining revenue in a time of limited in-person encounters. We created a model to calculate the outpatient clinic production of a theoretical gynecologic oncology practice with a volume of 600 patients per month in revenue value units (RVUs) and US dollars. We modeled 3 scenarios including a baseline case with all in-person visits, a 30% drop in volume with all in-person visits, and a 30% telehealth/70% in-person visit scenario at baseline volume. We determined the loss of revenue and number of in-person visits avoided in each scenario. Additionally, we modeled how revenue may change if the incorporation of additional telehealth visits allowed for an increased number of in-person new patient visits. A practice with a monthly volume of 600 in-person patient visits would generate 1050 RVUs/$66,150 per month. If this theoretical practice suffered a 30% decrease in volume to 420 in person visits per month, production would drop to 736 RVUs/$46,368 per month. This decrease in $19,844 of monthly revenue would avoid 180 in-person encounters. If baseline practice volume was maintained by transitioning to 30% telehealth/70% in-person visits, revenue only drops by $7,372 per month, while avoiding 180 in-person encounters. If clinic structure utilizes independent advance practitioners for in-person encounters, clinic density can increase if physicians concurrently perform televisits. This increased clinic density and the downstream revenue generating effect of more new patient visits results in higher practice revenue. If transitioning 2 follow-up patients to telehealth allowed for one additional in-person new patient per clinic, production would increase by 308 RVUs/$19,404 per month. If transitioning 4 patients to telehealth allowed 2 additional new patient visits, production would increase by 656 RVUs/$41,476 per month. Though the optimal telehealth strategy for oncology is still unknown, implementing telehealth during a time of limited in-person visits may help ameliorate the financial loss to a practice. Additionally, if utilization of advanced practitioners and telehealth allows for more new patient evaluations and increased clinic density, a practice may stand to increase revenue substantially. A thorough understanding of the tradeoffs associated with telehealth are essential for establishing an optimal strategy for delivering, safe high-quality cancer care during this unprecedented global pandemic.

Mobility between residents and facilities may result in staff acting as vectors of COVID-19 infection in these spaces. Vaccine uptake has been shown to markedly reduce the spread of COVID-19, yet there is little data on vaccine uptake and the continued COVID-19 risk among residents. Methods Data for this study were extracted from two publicly available. First, Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) public data included characteristics of nursing homes, weekly reported observations of residential COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 vaccine coverage of staff and residents. Second, the average weekly COVID-19 infection rates from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (MDHSS) were extracted and aggregated. A zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model was constructed to predict (1) if COVID-19 infections were reported, and if so, (2) the number of cases reported using a priori variables as predictors. ZIP regression was used due to the count nature of the outcome and due to the pre-determined overdispersion of observations when zero COVID-19 cases were reported during the study period. Results A total of 504 nursing homes were included in the study and 1124 COVID-19 infections were reported during the study period. As the percent of vaccinated staff increased, the risk of COVID-19 infections among residents significantly decreased. Percent of residents vaccinated was not significantly associated with whether COVID-19 cases were reported, nor the number of cases reported. Other factors, such as county COVID-19 rate and CMS staff rating, were significantly associated with COVID-19 cases in nursing homes. Discussion This study identified that nursing home staff, likely due to greater mobility, are important to prioritize in vaccination efforts to protect themselves and residents of their facilities from COVID-19 infections. Further, the CMS staff ratings were significant predictors of infection as well, which highlight the structural challenges that exist within and outside the context of a highly infectious and deadly pandemic. These results also provide insights to optimizing vaccination roll-out to best protect vulnerable community residents","Scroggins, S.; Ellis, M.; Shacham, E.",,376,1

Low screening rates and limited surveillance led us to conduct a study in Dagahaley camp, located in the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya to estimate SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence and, mortality and to identify changes in access to care during the pandemic. Methods: To estimate seroprevalence, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among a sample of individuals (n=587) seeking care at the two main health centres and among all household members (n=619) of community health workers and traditional birth attendants working in the camp. We used a rapid immunologic assay (BIOSYNEX COVID-19 BSS [IgG/IgM]) and adjusted for test performance and mismatch between the sampled population and that of the general camp population. To estimate mortality, we exhaustively interviewed all households (n=12860) in the camp about deaths occurring from January 2019 through March 2021. Results: We included 1206 participants in the seroprevalence study. In total, 8% (95% CI: 6.6%-9.7%) had a positive serologic test. After adjusting for test performance and standardizing on age, we estimated a seroprevalence of 5.8% (95% CI: 1.6%-8.4%). The mortality rate for 10,000 persons per day was 0.05 (95% CI 0.05-0.06) prior to the pandemic and 0.07 (95% CI 0.06-0.08) during the pandemic, representing a significant 42% increase (p<0.001). MSF health centre consultations and hospital admissions decreased by 38% and 37% respectively. Conclusion: We estimated that the number of infected people was 67 times higher than the number of reported cases. Participants aged 50 years or more where among the most affected. The mortality survey shows an increase in the mortality rate during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. A decline in attendance at health facilities was observed and sustained despite the easing of restrictions.","GIGNOUX, E.; ATHANASSIADIS, F.; GARAT YARROW, A.; JIMALE, A.; MUBUTO, N.; DEGLISE, C.; ONSONGO MOSOTI, D.; AZMAN, A.

Methods: A survey was developed by the authors including demographics, and eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS;scored out of 40, higher score reflecting higher eHealth literacy). Women with PFDs attending one of 3 urogynecology clinics were recruited (July-September 2020). Due to COVID-19 restrictions, participants completed the survey online (via SimpleSurvey) or by phone. 99 women were successfully contacted. 45 declined to participate or did not complete the survey (13 reported no access to email or smartphone) and 54 completed the survey (54.5%). Statistics are descriptive. Results: 41 (75.9%) were aged 30-69, and 52 (96.3%) had a high school diploma or higher. 51 (94.4%) owned a smartphone deviceand 42 (77.8%) ever used a smartphone application. Mean eHEALS score was 28.1 +/- 6.2. Most reported knowing how/where to find useful health information online. Only 29 (53.7%) were comfortable assessing quality of online resources, and 18 (33.3%) felt confident using online information to make health decisions. 45 (83.3%) felt that a smartphone application could positively impact satisfaction, communication and coordination of PFD care. Most valued application features included PFD information resources (94.4%), decision aids (92.6%), and communication with healthcare team (90.7%). Conclusions: Many women with PFD would value a smartphone application to support shared decision-making. Users should be involved in the feature selection process. Barriers to use of this technology among women with PFDs should be further explored.","Jamal, A.; Walter, J.

From a supply chain perspective, market uncertainty, which in this study is proxied by the Covid-19 pandemic, has great potential to reduce performance and disrupt production and distribution lines as well as consumer demand. This encourages affected SMEs, such as SMEs that focus on providing tourism products, such as fashion and merchandise, to maintain their performance with product innovation, and minimize the use of non-environmentally friendly products. The object of research is Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) producing tourism souvenirs in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Using the analysis technique of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with 150 respondents, the findings indicate that market uncertainty serves as a catalyst for SMEs to maintain performance through marketing innovation and product reorientation. Specifically, the results show that there is a positive and significant influence between innovation and green orientation on SME performance, and the mediating effect of market uncertainty to increase marketing innovation and environmentally friendly orientation. These findings theoretically contribute to explaining the relationship between supply chain management in the context of market uncertainty. In practical terms, this study confirms the need for support by stakeholders to support limited domestic tourism, according to health protocols, as well as digitalization of marketing for tourism SMEs. © 2021 by the authors;license Growing Science, Canada.","Syarief, E.",Uncertain Supply Chain Management,376,26

The combination of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), injurious invasive ventilation, micro/macro thrombi and the potential for direct myocardial injury create conditions where RVD is likely to occur. No study has prospectively explored the prevalence of RVD, and its association with mortality, in a cohort requiring mechanical ventilation. Methods Prospective, multi-centre, trans-thoracic echocardiographic, cohort study of ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Scottish intensive care units. RVD was defined as the presence of severe RV dilatation and interventricular septal flattening. To explore role of myocardial injury, high sensitivity troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured in all patients. Results One hundred and twenty-one patients were recruited to COVID-RV, 118 underwent imaging and it was possible to determine the primary outcome in 112. RVD was present in seven (6.2% [95%CI; 2.5%, 12.5%]) patients. Thirty-day mortality was 85.7% in those with RVD, compared to 44.8% in those without (p=0.051). Patients with RVD were more likely to have; pulmonary thromboembolism (p<0.001), higher plateau pressure (p=0.048), lower dynamic compliance (p=0.031), higher NT-proBNP (p<0.006) and more frequent abnormal troponin (p=0.048). Abnormal NT-proBNP (OR 4.77 [1.22, 21.32], p=0.03) and abnormal Troponin (16.54 [4.98, 67.12], p<0.001) independently predicted 30-day mortality. Conclusion COVID-RV demonstrates a prevalence of RVD in ventilated patients with COVID-19 of 6.2% and is associated with a mortality of 85.7%. Association is observed between RVD and each of the aetiological domains of; ARDS, ventilation, micro/macro thrombi and myocardial injury.","McCall, P.; Willder, J.; Stanley, B.; Messow, C.-M.; Allan, J.; Gemmell, L.; Puxty, A.; Strachan, D.; Berry, C.; Shelley, B.; investigators., The COVID-RV",,376,13

Compared to some other countries and continents, Europe has gained an early awareness of energy and environmental problems in general. At the theoretical level, free-market environmentalism indicates that based on the principle of private property rights, with fewer state interventionist and regulation policies, entrepreneurs, as the driving force of the market economy, can provide better services to meet the necessity of offering RE to protect the environment more effectively. Previous studies have revealed that Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom have made some progress in using the market to develop RE. However, this research did not analyze the three countries’ RE conditions from the perspective of free-market environmentalism. Based on our review of the principles of free-market environmentalism, this paper originally provides an empirical study of how Germany, Denmark, and the United Kingdom have partly conducted free-market-oriented policies to successfully achieve their policy goal of RE since the 1990s on a practical level. In particular, compared with Germany and Denmark, the UK has maintained a relatively low energy tax rate and opted for more pro-market measures since the Hayekian-Thatcherism free-market reform of 1979. The paper also discovers that Fredrich A. Hayek’s theories have strongly impacted its energy liberalization reform agenda since then. Low taxes on the energy industry and electricity have alleviated the burden on the electricity enterprises and consumers in the UK. Moreover, the empirical results above show that the energy enterprises play essential roles in providing better and more affordable RE for household and industrial users in the three sampled countries. Based on the above results, the paper also warns that state intervention policies such as taxation, state subsidies, and industrial access restrictions can impede these three countries’ RE targets. Additionally, our research provides reform agendas and policy suggestions to policymakers on the importance of implementing free-market environmentalism to provide more efficient RE in the post-COVID-19 era.","Wang, William Hongsong Moreno-Casas Vicente Huerta de Soto Jesús",Energies,376,24

In this paper, we present a data-driven, mean-risk, multi-stage, stochastic epidemics-vaccination-logistics model that evaluates various disease growth scenarios under the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) risk measure to optimize the distribution of treatment centers, resources, and vaccines, while minimizing the total expected number of infections, deaths, and close contacts of infected people under a limited budget. We integrate a new ring vaccination compartment into a Susceptible-Infected-Treated-Recovered-Funeral-Burial epidemics-logistics model. Our formulation involves uncertainty both in the vaccine supply and the disease transmission rate. Here, we also consider the risk of experiencing scenarios that lead to adverse outcomes in terms of the number of infected and dead people due to the epidemic. Combining the risk-neutral objective with a risk measure allows for a trade-off between the weighted expected impact of the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing extremely disastrous scenarios. We incorporate human mobility into the model and develop a new method to estimate the migration rate between each region when data on migration rates is not available. We apply our multi-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model to the case of controlling the 2018-2020 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) using real data. Our results show that increasing the risk-aversion by emphasizing potentially disastrous outbreak scenarios reduces the expected risk related to adverse scenarios at the price of the increased expected number of infections and deaths over all possible scenarios. We also find that isolating and treating infected individuals are the most efficient ways to slow the transmission of the disease, while vaccination is supplementary to primary interventions on reducing the number of infections. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that vaccine acceptance rates affect the optimal vaccine allocation only at the initial stages of the vaccine rollout under a tight vaccine supply.","Yin, X.; Buyuktahtakin, E.",,376,16

Mathematical models can be used to understand aspects of the dynamics of epidemics and to increase the chances of control strategies. We propose a SIR graph network model, in which each node represents an individual and the edges represent contacts between individuals. For this purpose, we use the healthy S (susceptible) population without immune behavior, two I-compartments (infectious) and two R-compartments (recovered) as a SIR model. The time steps can be interpreted as days and the spatial spread (limited in distance for a singe step) shell take place on a 200 by 200 torus, which should simulate 40 thousand individuals. The disease propagation form S to the I-compartment should be possible on a k by k square (k=5 in order to be in small world network) with different time periods and strength of propagation probability in the two I compartments. After the infection, an immunity of different lengths is to be modeled in the two R compartments. The incoming constants should be chosen so that realistic scenarios can arise. With a random distribution and a low case number of diseases at the beginning of the simulation, almost periodic patterns similar to diffusion processes can arise over the years. Mean value operators and the Laplace operator on the torus and its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are relevant reference points. The torus with five compartments is well suited for visualization. Realistic neighborhood relationships can be viewed with a inhomogeneous graph theoretic approach, but they are more difficult to visualize. Superspreaders naturally arise in inhomogeneous graphs: there are different numbers of edges adjacent to the nodes and should therefore be examined in an inhomogeneous graph theoretical model. The expected effect of corona control strategies can be evaluated by comparing the results with various constants used in simulations. The decisive benefit of the models results from the long-term observation of the consequences of the assumptions made, which can differ significantly from the primarily expected effects, as is already known from classic predator-prey models.","Schuster, R.; Thiele, K.

This research field, however, is relatively more recent and limited compared to investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying object and scene category recognition. Motion is particularly important for the perception of non-rigid materials, but the neural basis of non-rigid material motion remains unexplored. Using fMRI, we investigated which brain regions respond preferentially to material motion versus other types of motion. We introduce a new database of stimuli – dynamic dot materials – that are animations of moving dots that induce vivid percepts of various materials in motion, e.g. flapping cloth, liquid waves, wobbling jelly. Control stimuli were scrambled versions of these same animations and rigid three-dimensional rotating dots. Results showed that isolating material motion properties with dynamic dots (in contrast with other kinds of motion) activates a network of cortical regions in both ventral and dorsal visual pathways, including areas normally associated with the processing of surface properties and shape, and extending to somatosensory and premotor cortices. We suggest that such a widespread preference for material motion is due to strong associations between stimulus properties. For example viewing dots moving in a specific pattern not only elicits percepts of material motion; one perceives a flexible, non-rigid shape, identifies the object as a cloth flapping in the wind, infers the object’s weight under gravity, and anticipates how it would feel to reach out and touch the material. These results are a first important step in mapping out the cortical architecture and dynamics in material-related motion processing.","Schmid, Alexandra C.; Boyaci, Huseyin; Doerschner, Katja",bioRxiv,376,1

Objectives: To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppression during the first wave, concerning a) (self-)management of their disease;b) interaction with the health care team;c) emotional well-being and d) overall health. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted following a phenomenological approach. Adults (&gt;18 years) with a rheumatic disease from four European countries (Cyprus, England, Greece, Portugal). Patients were recruited through patient's associations and social media and were invited to participate in semi-structured, audio-recorded interview or focus groups, between July -August 2020. Following a pilot study the information provided was transcribed verbatim, anonymized and translated into English where necessary. An inductive approach was adopted to carry out a thematic framework analysis with the assistance of ATLAS.ti to identify key themes and subthemes. Data validation strategies were employed, and Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. Results: Participants were 24 patients (21 women, age range 33 to 74 years) divided by 7 focus-groups and 1 individual interview. Most frequent diagnoses were rheumatoid arthritis (n=7), lupus (n=4), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (n=3). Three key themes with 3-7 subthemes were identified within the analytical framework, centred around the impact of the Covid-19 on patients' lives (Figure 1): i) individual person (e.g. fear for myself and family, social isolation and lack of personal freedom, more time with family) ii) health settings (e.g. (un)clear information about risks of contamination, fear or risk of shortages of medication, remote consultations), and iii) work and community (e.g. persistent stress due to mass media exposure, lack of awareness by others about patients' rheumatic disease and its disclosure, hope and suspicion about new vaccine development: ""I hear that they will ask vulnerable groups to have the vaccine first (.) Why is that we will be again the innocent victims"")?. Findings were similar across countries, except for spirituality (i.e. the pandemic as ""the hand of God""), a coping subtheme particular to Portugal. These main themes resonated well with the social ecological model and Walsh's Family Resilience Process [1,2]. Conclusion: When experiencing a significant life-event people require some time to process the different lived experiences. This study provides insights on how patients from four countries coped with the new challenges. Such insights are invaluable for health care providers and policy makers, in guiding more meaningful support tailored to individual needs, especially at times of crisis.

The things we take for granted become no longer true. When the disease is contagious then in-person communication is fraught with danger for all parties. Despite all these dangers people still required to meet in person for various reasons that could range from personal to official to government business. Can we have a way to understand the risk of a person being infected as compared to another person so that we can make decisions of segregating the two people or to decline entry to a person? In this paper we provide an architecture and an approach that caters to estimating a score for each person based on GPS (Global Positioning System) locations. A score is computed by an application running in cloud and receiving as input the GPS trajectory information from each person's device (like a mobile or a smart watch). With the scores of any two people in hand one can predict who is more likely to be infected. We complement this approach with extensive simulation results to validate our approach. Our results show that we can achieve a high accuracy (80% to 90%) of predicting which person (of the two being compared) has an infection. © 2020 IEEE.,"Gupta, P.; Gupta, M.","9th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets, CCEM 2020",376,16

One proposed explanation for this illusion is based on predictive motion extrapolation of trajectories. In this interpretation, the diverging effects of velocity on the perceived position of the moving object suggest that FLE might be based on the neural representation of perceived, rather than physical velocity. By contrast, alternative explanations based on differential latency or temporal averaging would predict that the FLE does not rely on such a representation of perceived velocity. Here we examined whether the FLE is sensitive to illusory changes in perceived speed that result in changes to perceived velocity, while physical speed is constant. The perceived speed of the moving object was manipulated using revolving wedge stimuli with variable pattern textures (Experiment 1) and luminance contrast (Experiment 2). The motion extrapolation interpretation would predict that the changes in the FLE magnitude should correspond to the changes in the perceived speed of the moving object. In the current study, two experiments demonstrated that the perceived speed and FLE magnitude increased in dynamic relative to static pattern conditions, and that the same effect was found in low contrast compared to high contrast conditions. These results showed that manipulations of texture and contrast that are known to alter judgments of perceived speed also modulate perceived position. We interpret this as a consequence of motion extrapolation mechanisms and discuss possible explanations for why we observed no cross-effect correlation.","Yook, Jane; Lee, Lysha; Vossel, Simone; Weidner, Ralph; Hogendoorn, Hinze",bioRxiv,376,1

From the common sense of individual tests, the idea of mixing multiple samples seems taboo, however in fact many samples can be tested with a smaller number of tests by the method. As a retired researcher of mathematical engineering, the author was deeply interested in the idea and absorbed in the mathematical formulation and intensive analysis of the method. Later, he found that the original basic equation was already proposed in the old (1943) treatise [1] and so many related research works have been done and available as materials on the web [2], although many of those seem to be based on qualitative or intuitive analysis. In that sense, some of the analysis here seems to be already known in the field, but some results might be novel, such as boundary conditions, derivation of limit values, estimation of infection rate and adaptive optimization scheme of pool test, strict extension to multi-stage pool test, and explicit derivation of asymptotic approximate solutions of optimal pooling number and achieved efficiency measure, etc. In any case, he decided to put it together here as a material rather than a formal treatise, hoping that the results here would be useful for deeper mathematical insights into and better understanding of the pool inspection, and also in its actual practice.","Otsu, N.",,376,19

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The document is based on the evidence on SARS/Cov-2 and the authors' experience in managing COVID-19 in their institutions, including specialists from Andalusia, Madrid, Cantabria,the Valencian Community and Catalonia. A web and PubMed search was performed using ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""COVID-19 Urology"", ""COVID19 urology complications"", ""COVID-19 reconstructive surgery"".A narrative review of the literature was carried out (5/17/2020) and after the nominal group technique modified due to the extraordinary restrictions, a first draft was made to unify criteria and reach a quick consensus. Finally, a definitive version was made, agreed by all the authors (5/22/2020). RESULTS: The authors defined the following surgical priorities for Urological Reconstructive Surgery: Emergency/Urgency (life-threatening or emergencies still in anormal situation), Elective Urgency/High priority (potentially dangerous pathology if postponed for more than 1month), Elective Surgery/Intermediate priority (pathology with little probability of being dangerous but it is recommended not to delay more than 6 months), Delayed surgery/Low priority (non-dangerous pathology if it is postponed for more than 6 months). According to this classification, the Working Group agreed on the distribution of the different surgical scenarios of Reconstructive Urology. In addition, consensus was reached on recommendations regarding the diagnosis and follow-up of pathology in the field of Reconstructive Urology. CONCLUSIONS: Tools should be implemented to facilitate the gathering of the medical visit and diagnostic tests. Redistribution of surgical procedures based on priority degrees is necessary during the pandemic and transition period.

Recent reports showed a high prevalence of one main IBV genotype (Brazil or BR-I) with low genetic diversity in commercial poultry flocks from Brazil. This research analyzed IBV positive poultry flocks from different rearing regions to verify the S1 gene variability and geographic distribution of variant IBV strains in recent years (2010 and 2011). Samples of IBV-positive flocks were obtained from 60 different farms. Forty-nine partial S1 gene sequences were determined and aligned for phylogenetic and amino acid similarity analyses. Eleven samples (22.4%) were similar to Massachusetts vaccine strains (Mass genotype) and 34 samples (69.4%) to the previously characterized Brazilian BR-I genotype. Interestingly, the remaining four samples (8.2%) clustered into a new IBV variant genotype (Brazil-II or BR-II), divergent from the BR-I. A unique nucleotide sequence insertion coding for five amino acid residues was observed in all the Brazilian variant viruses (BR-I and BR-II genotypes). These results show a higher genetic diversity in Brazilian IBV variants than previously described.","Fraga, Aline Padilha; Balestrin, Eder; Ikuta, Nilo; Fonseca, André Salvador Kazantzi; Spilki, Fernando Rosado; Canal, Cláudio Wageck; Lunge, Vagner Ricardo",Avian diseases,376,17

We aimed to review the methodology and outcomes of previous studies that have evaluated the use of telemedicine in movement disorders. Methods: This scoping review was performed by searching PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and CINAHL databases from 1946 to November 2020. Studies that assessed the application of telemedicine for delivering care to patients with a movement disorder were included. We reported the aims and employed methodologies and categorized the outcomes from each study. Results: The search retrieved 228 articles, and 41 studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. The majority of telemedicine studies were case series or randomized controlled pilot trials, investigating feasibility and acceptability in Parkinson's disease. Even with heterogeneity among outcome measures, they can be categorized into themes, such as feasibility, satisfaction, and efficacy. Conclusions: Telemedicine use has grown rapidly, due to the demands of providing care during a global pandemic. This application of telemedicine has been considered a promising way to expand care in Neurology, although research evaluating the dissemination of its use is dilatory. This review highlights the number of studies that have found telemedicine to be an acceptable and feasible way to deliver care for movement disorders. Further research is needed to expand on harmonization of outcomes, reach, adoption, and long-term use of telemedicine.","Houston, Emily; Kennedy, Amanda G; O039,; Malley, Donna; Rabinowitz, Terry; Rose, Gail L; Boyd, James",Telemed. j. e. health,376,1

Despite efforts to limit the viral transmission, the vaccine is the only solution to ending the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy could reduce coverage and hinder herd immunity. OBJECTIVE: People's intention to get vaccinated can be shaped by several factors, including risk perception which, in turn, is influenced by affect. The present work aimed at investigating how risk perception and some factors associated with the decision to comply with vaccination modulated vaccine acceptance for COVID-19 as compared to seasonal influenza, and how these have varied during the lockdown phases. METHOD: The study followed the main phases of the emergency in Italy, investigating the intention to get vaccinated against flu and against SARS-CoV-2 (if a vaccine was available) before, during and after the first national lockdown, covering the period from the end of February to the end of June 2020. We investigated the effect of risk perception and other predictors on the decision of getting vaccinated. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-lockdown phase, during the lockdown more people were willing to get vaccinated for COVID-19, regardless of their beliefs about vaccines, and as risk perception increased, so did the intention to accept the vaccine. The acceptance of the flu vaccine increased after the re-opening phase. In addition, the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and against flu increased if there was previous flu vaccination behavior but decreased with increasing doubts about the vaccines in general. CONCLUSIONS: The observation of vaccination intentions across the three main phases of the emergency allows important considerations regarding psychological, affect, and demographic determinants useful to tailor public health communication to improve public response to future epidemics.","Caserotti, Marta; Girardi, Paolo; Rubaltelli, Enrico; Tasso, Alessandra; Lotto, Lorella; Gavaruzzi, Teresa",Soc Sci Med,376,16

The basis of this interest comes from the established effect vitamin D status has on other acute respiratory infections, such as influenza. This article aims to determine the role and effect of vitamin D serum concentration in the prevalence and severity of COVID-19. Recent Findings: Several observational studies have demonstrated that suboptimal levels of vitamin D serum concentrations can significantly increase the risk of developing COVID-19 and lead to a more severe symptomatology. One study suggests, however, that supplementation of vitamin D could potentially increase the incidence of mortality in COVID-19 patients. Summary: Vitamin D status could have an influential role in the development and progression of SARS-CoV2 infection.

The vagus nerve represents one of the main components of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system and is involved in important neurophysiological functions. Previous studies have shown that vagal nerve stimulation is effective in the treatment of resistant major depression, epilepsy and anxiety disorders. In EFD's there are a spectrum of symptoms which with Transcutaneous auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (Ta-VNS) therapy could have a therapeutic efficacy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sample subjects is composed by 15 female subjects aged 18-51. Admitted to a psychiatry community having diagnosed in according to DSM-5: anorexia nervosa (AN) (N=9), bulimia nervosa (BN) (N=5), binge eating disorder (BED) (N=1). Psychiatric comorbidities: bipolar disorder type 1 (N=4), bipolar disorder type 2 (N=6), border line disorder (N=5). The protocol included 9 weeks of Ta-VNS stimulation at a frequency of 1.5-3.5 mA for 4 hours per day. The variables detected in four different times (t0, t1, t2, t3, t4) are the following: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-HDRS-17), Body Mass Index (BMI), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI). RESULTS: Data analysis showed statistically significant differences between recording times (p>0.05) in HAM-D (t0=18.28±5.31; t4=9.14±7.15), in BAI (t0=24.7±10.99; t4=13.8±7.0) the reported values show how during (T0-T4) the treatment there are a decay of the degree in the depressive state, in the state of anxiety and an improvement in the value of BMI. In particular, the BMI in the AN-BN sub-sample had a minimum gain of 5% and a maximum of 11%. The analysis of H.R.V. did not show a significant changes among subjects thus confirming the discordance of the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system in EFD's. CONCLUSIONS: Although the sample does not possess a relevant value to determine long-term efficacy of Ta-VNS or on a larger number of patients, this study reports how the application of neuro-stimulation in EFD's may become an ADD-ON in therapeutic approach. Indeed, substantial improvements are highlighted in the results and confirmed hypotheses proposed by the study.","Melis, Yuri; Apicella, Emanuela; Macario, Marsia; Dozio, Eugenia; Bentivoglio, Giuseppina; Mendolicchio, Leonardo",Psychiatr Danub,376,23

The text is an attempt to summarize the challenges of crisis e-learning from the perspective of the challenges faced by teachers in Poland in the period of March-December 2020. The article reveals a number of new phenomena not present in the literature in the context of e-learning implemented in an intuitive, non-linear way, without methodological support, and thus referred to as crisis e-learning. The aim of the research was to explore the characteristics of crisis e-learning in Poland from the perspective of teachers' experiences. Due to epidemiological limitations, the research area was narrowed down to cyberspace. This text presents the results of research relating to statements made by teachers posting in the largest Polish discussion group on education. The group currently consists of over four thousand people. The study uses an analysis of several thousand posts and then identifies and categorizes statements related to crisis e-learning along with a phenomenological interpretation. The analyses made it possible to identify seven categories of challenges attributed to crisis e-learning, such as: technical problems, use of non-standard solutions, the search for solutions to increase the effectiveness of e-learning, the transfer of proven applications and programmes, problems with students, problems with parents, and the modernisation of workstations. The data presented show teacher micro-worlds in the time of the pandemic in Poland. The article is a response to the need to understand the processes occurring in the Polish educational system under the influence of crisis events related to the pandemic. The text may prove valuable for educating future generations of teachers in the field of e-learning and increasing the effectiveness of training activities aimed at strengthening the digital competence of current teachers.","Tomczyk, Lukasz; Walker, Christopher",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),376,13

The unpredictability of this disease has led to critical care shortages such as ICU beds, ventilator availability and staffing. To our knowledge, a novel scoring criteria is not available that can assist clinicians in predicting who may decompensate and eventually require mechanical ventilation and the highest level of available care. Such a scoring criteria would be beneficial in times of surge capacity, in which the score could be applied to patients upon admission and assist in determining where resources may need to be allocated. Methods: The electronic medical records of the first 150 patients to present to a large, tertiary referral center in the Southeastern US with COVID-19 pneumonia were reviewed. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine odds of requiring mechanical ventilation after admission using demographic and clinical characteristics. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. A prognostic index from aOR was created and validated with one-leave-out cross validation method. SAS v9.4 was used for data management and statistical data analysis. Results: Three variables were found to be directly linked with the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. An increased number of comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease or cardiovascular disease) was associated with a two-fold risk for mechanical ventilation (aOR 1.955 [95% CI=1.27-3.011]). A decreased SpO2/FiO2 ratio compared to normal range was associated with a two-fold risk in need for mechanical ventilation (aOR 1.919 [95% CI=1.226-3.002]. An increase in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio compared to a normal range was associated with an aOR of 1.783 (95% CI=1.142-2.783). Conclusion: Our proposed scoring system is a sum score for number of comorbidities, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. As each of these variables increase, the patients are assigned an increasing patient score based on the values found on admission. A sum score greater than eight was found to have high predictive value for requiring mechanical ventilation, including a sensitivity of 77.1%, specificity of 83.1%, positive predictive value of 71.1% and negative predictive value of 87.1%. Our score was internally validated, accurately predicting mechanical ventilation in 81% of patients, but will have to be applied to a larger sample size prospectively for external validation before clinical application is considered.","Wojnowski, K.; Nettboy, S.; Kumar, N.; Koru-Sengul, T.; Kumar, S.

The fusion between trophoblast cells, first into cytotrophoblast and then into syncytiotrophoblast, is facilitated by the fusogenic protein syncytin. Syncytin derives from an envelope glycoprotein (ENV) of retroviral origin. In exogenous retroviruses, the envelope glycoproteins coded by env genes allow fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and entry of the virus into a host cell. During mammalian evolution, the env genes have been repeatedly, and independently, captured by various mammalian species to facilitate the formation of the placenta. Such a shift in the function of a gene, or a trait, for a different purpose during evolution is called an exaptation (co-option). We discuss the structure and origin of the placenta, the fusogenic and non-fusogenic functions of syncytin, and the mechanism of cell fusion. We also comment on an alleged danger of the COVID-19 vaccine based on the presupposed similarity between syncytin and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.","Kloc, Malgorzata; Uosef, Ahmed; Kubiak, Jacek Z; Ghobrial, Rafik M",,376,1

Autopsy can considerably contribute to our understanding of many disease processes and could provide crucial information to guide management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We report on the relevant cardiopulmonary findings in, to our knowledge, the first autopsy series of ten African American decedents, with the cause of death attributed to COVID-19. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on ten African American decedents aged 44-78 years with cause of death attributed to COVID-19, reflective of the dominant demographic of deaths following COVID-19 diagnosis in New Orleans. Autopsies were done with consent of the decedents' next of kin. Pulmonary and cardiac features were examined, with relevant immunostains to characterise the inflammatory response, and RNA labelling and electron microscopy on representative sections. FINDINGS: Important findings include the presence of thrombosis and microangiopathy in the small vessels and capillaries of the lungs, with associated haemorrhage, that significantly contributed to death. Features of diffuse alveolar damage, including hyaline membranes, were present, even in patients who had not been ventilated. Cardiac findings included individual cell necrosis without lymphocytic myocarditis. There was no evidence of secondary pulmonary infection by microorganisms. INTERPRETATION: We identify key pathological states, including thrombotic and microangiopathic pathology in the lungs, that contributed to death in patients with severe COVID-19 and decompensation in this demographic. Management of these patients should include treatment to target these pathological mechanisms.

Policymakers mostly resorted to normative measures to limit close contacts and impose social distancing. Our study aimed to estimate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by location and activity in crowded metropolitan areas. The risk of exposure to COVID-19 was defined as the product of crowding (people within a six feet distance) and exposure duration (fraction of 15 min). Our epidemiological investigation used aggregated and anonymized mobility data from Google Maps to estimate the visit duration. We collected visit duration data for 561 premises in the metropolitan area of Genoa, Italy from October 2020 to January 2021. The sample was then clustered into 14 everyday activities, from grocery shopping to the post office. Crowding data by activity were obtained from pre-existing building norms and new government measures to contain the pandemic. The study found significant variance in the risk of exposure to COVID-19 among activities and, for the same activity, among locations. The empirical determination of the risk of exposure to COVID-19 can inform national and local public health policies to contain the pandemic's diffusion. Its simple numerical form can help policymakers effectively communicate difficult decisions affecting our daily lives. Most importantly, risk data by location can help us rethink our daily routine and make informed, responsible choices when we decide to go out.","Oliva, C.; Favato, G.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],376,26

Repurposing of approved pharmaceutical drugs for COVID-19 treatment represents an attractive approach to quickly identify promising drug candidates. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is responsible for the maturation of viral functional proteins making it a key antiviral target. Based on the recently revealed crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we herein describe a multi-stage virtual screening protocol including pharmacophore screening, molecular docking and protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (PLIF) post-docking filtration for efficient enrichment of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. Potential hits, along with a cocrystallized control were further studied via molecular dynamics. A 150-ns production trajectory was followed by RMSD, free energy calculation, and H-bond analysis for each compound. The applied virtual screening protocol led to identification of five FDA-approved drugs with promising binding modes to key subsites of the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The identified compounds belong to different pharmaceutical classes, including several protease inhibitors, antineoplastic agents and a natural flavonoid. The drug candidates discovered in this study present a potential extension of the recently reported SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors that have been identified using other virtual screening protocols and may be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment.","Mandour, Yasmine M; Zlotos, Darius P; Alaraby Salem, M",J Biomol Struct Dyn,376,2

However, we do not find corresponding reductions in PM2.5 and ozone globally. Using satellite measurements, we show that the disconnect between NO2 and ozone changes stems from local chemical regimes.

The perceived risk level of developing COVID-19 was 6.5 and it was significantly higher among females, younger subjects, and those who agreed/strongly agreed that COVID-19 is a severe disease. Only 21.4% of respondents were not worried at all regarding the safety of the vaccine. Males, not being married/cohabitant, being a faculty member, those who perceived a lower risk of developing COVID-19, and those who did not need information regarding the vaccination against COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have no concern at all regarding the safety of the vaccine. The vast majority (84.1%) were willing to receive a future vaccine against COVID-19. Almost coherently with predictors of concern on the safety of the vaccine, being male, not being married/cohabitant, being a faculty member, not being concerned at all that COVID-19 vaccination might not be safe, and agreeing that COVID-19 can have serious health consequences were significant predictors of the willingness to receive the vaccine against COVID-19. A considerable proportion of the population had a positive willingness to receive the future COVID-19 vaccine, although some concerns have been expressed regarding the effectiveness and safety and public health activities seem necessary to achieve the rate that can lead to the protection of the community.","Di Giuseppe, Gabriella; Pelullo, Concetta Paola; Della Polla, Giorgia; Pavia, Maria; Angelillo, Italo Francesco",,376,1

We suggest a way to produce value-added chemicals (e.g., aromatic compounds) from the mask with high amounts through catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP). To this end, the effects of zeolite catalyst properties on the upgradation efficiency of pyrolytic products produced from pyrolysis of wasted mask were investigated. The compositions and yields of pyrolytic gases and oils were characterized as functions of pyrolysis temperature and the type of zeolite catalyst (HBeta, HY, and HZSM-5), including the mesoporous catalyst of Al-MCM-41. The mask was pyrolyzed in a fixed bed reactor, and the pyrolysis gases evolved in the reactor was routed to a secondary reactor inside which the zeolite catalyst was loaded. It was chosen 550 °C as the CFP temperature to compare the catalyst performance for the production of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) because this temperature gave the highest oil yield (80.7 wt%) during the non-catalytic pyrolysis process. The large pore zeolite group of HBeta and HY led to 134% and 67% higher BTEX concentrations than HZSM-5, respectively, likely because they had larger pores, higher surface areas, and higher acid site density than the HZSM-5.

While empirical research shows strong evidence that direct-to-consumer relationships in the food system predominantly serve affluent communities, during the COVID-19 pandemic local food providers have become a necessity through their provision of essential services, such as hunger relief and home deliveries for vulnerable populations. In this paper, we examine the challenges and opportunities of food hubs-innovations in local food systems that help connect small farmers with local markets-during the COVID-19 pandemic using quantitative and qualitative data from practitioners on the ground. The hubs were not necessarily equipped or experienced in the response needed, but they quickly adapted to the situation and demonstrated success during the pandemic, as illustrated by 200-300% growth in performance metrics such as revenues generated, employees retained, customers served, and farmers supported. The performance of the hubs in response to the multiple challenges accompanying the pandemic demonstrates their key role in food system resilience through features of diversity, functional redundancy, and connectivity, suggesting that disaster preparation should consider local food hubs a necessary service.

We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. METHODS: We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing and 'shielding' (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. We also present sensitivity analyses for key model parameters subject to uncertainty. RESULTS: We predicted median symptomatic attack rates over the first 12 months of 23% (Niger) to 42% (Mauritius), peaking at 2-4 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R0. The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Mitigation strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand and mortality by around 50%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature, and assumptions on transmissibility, infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and risk of severe disease or death by age. CONCLUSIONS: In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding could achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.","van Zandvoort, Kevin; Jarvis, Christopher I; Pearson, Carl A B; Davies, Nicholas G; Ratnayake, Ruwan; Russell, Timothy W; Kucharski, Adam J; Jit, Mark; Flasche, Stefan; Eggo, Rosalind M; Checchi, Francesco",BMC Med,376,1

PPI use was not associated with increased or decreased risk of COVID-19 infection (OR:3.16, 95% CI=0.74-13.43, P=0.12) or mortality risk of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.91, 95% CI=0.86-4.24, P=0.11).

In summary, PPI use is not associated with an increased risk of infection and may not change the mortality risk of COVID-19, but appeared to be associated with an increased risk of progression to severe disease and secondary infection. However, more original studies to further clarify the relationship between PPI and COVID-19 are still urgently needed.","Yan, Cunye; Chen, Yue; Sun, Chenyu; Ahmed, Mubashir Ayaz; Bhan, Chandur; Guo, Zhichun; Yang, Hongru; Zuo, Yijing; Yan, Yue; Hu, Lei; Sun, Yiceng; Li, Yao; Zhou, Qin",Jpn. j. infect. dis,376,16

Scientists worldwide are competing to develop therapeutics and vaccines; currently, three drugs and two vaccine candidates have been given emergency authorization use. However, there are still questions of efficacy with regard to specific subgroups of patients and the vaccine's scalability to the general public. Under such circumstances, understanding COVID-19 symptoms is vital in initial triage; it is crucial to distinguish the severity of cases for effective management and treatment. This study aimed to discover symptom patterns and overall symptom rules, including rules disaggregated by age, sex, chronic condition, and mortality status, among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patient data made available online by the Wolfram Data Repository through May 27, 2020. We applied a widely used rule-based machine learning technique called association rule mining to identify frequent symptoms and define patterns in the rules discovered. RESULT: In total, 1,560 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study, with a median age of 52 years. The most frequently occurring symptom was fever (67%), followed by cough (37%), malaise/body soreness (11%), pneumonia (11%), and sore throat (8%). Myocardial infarction, heart failure, and renal disease were present in less than 1% of patients. The top ten significant symptom rules (out of 71 generated) showed cough, septic shock, and respiratory distress syndrome as frequent consequents. If a patient had a breathing problem and sputum production, then, there was higher confidence of that patient having a cough; if cardiac disease, renal disease, or pneumonia was present, then there was a higher confidence of septic shock or respiratory distress syndrome. Symptom rules differed between younger and older patients and between male and female patients. Patients who had chronic conditions or died of COVID-19 had more severe symptom rules than those patients who did not have chronic conditions or survived of COVID-19. Concerning chronic condition rules among 147 patients, if a patient had diabetes, prerenal azotemia, and coronary bypass surgery, there was a certainty of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The most frequently reported symptoms in patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough, pneumonia, and sore throat; while 1% had severe symptoms, such as septic shock, respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Symptom rules differed by age and sex. Patients with chronic disease and patients who died of COVID-19 had severe symptom rules more specifically, cardiovascular-related symptoms accompanied by pneumonia, fever, and cough as consequents.","Tandan, Meera; Acharya, Yogesh; Pokharel, Suresh; Timilsina, Mohan",Comput Biol Med,376,10

There are limited data of its impact in Africa. This study aims to characterize COVID-19 response strategies and impact of COVID-19 on cancer care and explore misconceptions in Africa. METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey of oncology providers in Africa between June and August 2020. Descriptive statistics and comparative analysis by income groups were performed. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two participants initiated the survey, of which 79 respondents from 18 African countries contributed data. Ninety-four percent (66 of 70) reported country mitigation and suppression strategies, similar across income groups. Unique strategies included courier service and drones for delivery of cancer medications (9 of 70 and 6 of 70, respectively). Most cancer centers remained open, but > 75% providers reported a decrease in patient volume. Not previously reported is the fear of infectivity leading to staff shortages and decrease in patient volumes. Approximately one third reported modifications of all cancer treatment modalities, resulting in treatment delays. A majority of participants reported &#8804; 25 confirmed cases (44 of 68, 64%) and &#8804; 5 deaths because of COVID-19 (26 of 45, 58%) among patients with cancer. Common misconceptions were that Africans were less susceptible to the virus (53 of 70, 75.7%) and decreased transmission of the virus in the African heat (44 of 70, 62.9%). CONCLUSION: Few COVID-19 cases and deaths were reported among patients with cancer. However, disruptions and delays in cancer care because of the pandemic were noted. The pandemic has inspired tailored innovative solutions in clinical care delivery for patients with cancer, which may serve as a blueprint for expanding care and preparing for future pandemics. Ongoing public education should address COVID-19 misconceptions. The results may not be generalizable to the entire African continent because of the small sample size.","Martei, Yehoda M; Rick, Tara J; Fadelu, Temidayo; Ezzi, Mohammed S; Hammad, Nazik; Quadri, Nasreen S; Rodrigues, Belmira; Simonds, Hannah; Grover, Surbhi; Incrocci, Luca; Vanderpuye, Verna",JCO Glob Oncol,376,1

Material and methods: we designed an observational cohort study of confirmed (PCR-test) COVID-19 patients at the Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre.We analyzed all symptomatic periheral arterial thrombosis diagnosed and treated during March and April 2020, which corresponds to the first wave of the pandemic. All elective scheduled surgery was canceled during this period due to absence of postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) or resuscitation beds and only urgent surgeries were performed. Results: from March 1 to April 30, 2,943 COVID-19 patients were admitted in our hospital and 261 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). During this period, 154 urgent operations were performed on COVID-19 patients in our hospital. Fourteen COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with symptomatic peripheral arterial thrombosis. The average age was 74 (range, 50-92) and these events were more common in men than in women (12:2). Out of these 14 patients, only 7 underwent vascular surgery by acute limb isc hernia. This represented 4.5 %of all urgent operations performed in our hospital. Postoperative mortality was 4 of 7 patients due to re-thrombosis despite anticoagulation. Among the non-operated patients, 2 had floating aortic thrombus and evolved satisfactorily with anticoagulation, while the other 5 patients were managed by palliatives measures due to the poor clinical conditions until they died. No analytical parameter was predictive of arterial thrombosis. No bleedings were recorded in this series. Conclusions: the surgical trauma increased the vulnerability of these patients with COVID-19, and therefore, surgery should be avoided whenever possible. The mortality rate in vascular surgery was dramatically high. The high thrombogenicity of these patients discourages bypass or other revascularization procedures. All hospitalized COVID-19 patients should receive a ntithrombotic prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and those at high risk should be fully anti coagulated.","Gomez-Arbelaez, D.; Vicente, M.

As for other innovative nanopharmaceuticals (NPhs), the advancement of robust methods to assess their quality and safety profiles-in line with regulatory needs-is critical for facilitating their development and clinical translation. Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multiple online optical detectors (MD-AF4) is considered a very versatile and robust approach for the physical characterisation of nanocarriers, and has been used successfully for measuring particle size, polydispersity and physical stability of lipid-based systems, including liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles. However, the unique core structure of LNP-RNA, composed of ionizable lipids electrostatically complexed with RNA, and the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating, is more prone to destabilization during focusing in MD-AF4 than previously characterised nanoparticles, resulting in particle aggregation and sample loss. Hence characterisation of LNP-RNA by MD-AF4 needs significant adaptation of the methods developed for liposomes. To improve the performance of MD-AF4 applied to LNP-RNA in a systematic and comprehensive manner, we have explored the use of the frit-inlet channel where, differently from the standard AF4 channel, the particles are relaxed hydrodynamically as they are injected. The absence of a focusing step minimizes contact between the particle and the membrane, reducing artefacts (e.g. sample loss, particle aggregation). Separation in a frit-inlet channel enables satisfactory reproducibility and acceptable sample recovery in the commercially available MD-AF4 instruments. In addition to slice-by-slice measurements of particle size, MD-AF4 also allows to determine particle concentration and the particle size distribution, demonstrating enhanced versatility beyond standard sizing measurements.","Mildner, R; Hak, S; Parot, J; Hyldbakk, A; Borgos, S E; Some, D; Johann, C; Caputo, F",Eur J Pharm Biopharm,376,1

Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. METHODS: This prospective study compared a 1,500-bed adult and a 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From February 24th until April 10th, 2020, all symptomatic HCW were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCW screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, occupational and non-occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1344 HCW tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no death were reported. Most HCW (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on March 23rd, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment (PPE) for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric setting, respectively (p=0.0022). In the adult setting, HCW more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% versus 15%, p=0.046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. CONCLUSION: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCW and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.","Contejean, Adrien; Leporrier, Jérémie; Canouï, Etienne; Alby-Laurent, Fanny; Lafont, Emmanuel; Beaudeau, Lauren; Parize, Perrine; Lecieux, Fabienne; Greffet, Agnès; Chéron, Gérard; Gauzit, Rémy; Fourgeaud, Jacques; L039,; Honneur, Anne-Sophie; Tréluyer, Jean-Marc; Charlier, Caroline; Casetta, Anne; Frange, Pierre; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Rozenberg, Flore; Lortholary, Olivier; Kernéis, Solen",Clin. infect. dis,376,16

This Perspective seeks to explore newly occurring cardio-renal-pulmonary organ damage induced or aggravated by the disease process of COVID-19 and its implications for the cardiovascular risk management of people with diabetes, especially taking into account potential interactions with mechanisms of cellular intrusion of SARS-CoV-2. Severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 can precipitate myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, and arrhythmias as well as an acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure. They may evolve along with multiorgan failure directly due to SARS-CoV-2-infected endothelial cells and resulting endotheliitis. This complex pathology may bear challenges for the use of most diabetes medications in terms of emerging contraindications that need close monitoring of all people with diabetes diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whenever possible, continuous glucose monitoring should be implemented to ensure stable metabolic compensation. Patients in the intensive care unit requiring therapy for glycemic control should be handled solely by intravenous insulin using exact dosing with a perfusion device. Although not only ACE inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers but also SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, pioglitazone, and probably insulin seem to increase the number of ACE2 receptors on the cells utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for penetration, no evidence presently exists that shows this might be harmful in terms of acquiring or worsening COVID-19. In conclusion, COVID-19 and related cardio-renal-pulmonary damage can profoundly affect cardiovascular risk management of people with diabetes.","Ceriello, Antonio; Standl, Eberhard; Catrinoiu, Doina; Itzhak, Baruch; Lalic, Nebojsa M; Rahelic, Dario; Schnell, Oliver; Skrha, Jan; Valensi, Paul",Diabetes Care,376,20

Testing contacts may improve case ascertainment and reduce onward transmission. This study investigated the acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 testing among contacts of confirmed cases as an integral part of the contact-tracing process. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive survey of case contacts was conducted in the UK. All contacts who completed a telephone call with the NHS Test and Trace Agile Lighthouse team were eligible for inclusion and were offered a molecular test. Consenting participants were sent a self-swab kit. RESULTS: Of the 1523 individuals contacted, 602 (39.5%) accepted the test offer. Of the 240 (39.9%) samples returned for testing, 16.3% tested polymerase chain reaction-positive for SARS-CoV-2.Most individuals who declined with a reason (638/905; 70.5%) reported they had already taken or booked a SARS-CoV-2 test, or were part of a testing programme. Matched laboratory records confirmed 73.1% of those who declined were tested by another route.

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Third Hospital & Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from February 17 to March 22, 2020. We classified the patients according to the presence and number of damaged organs (heart, liver, and kidney). RESULTS: The percentage of patients with no, one, two, or three organs affected was 59.75%, 30.46%, 8.07%, and 1.72%, respectively. With the increasing number of OI, there is a tendency of gradual increase regarding the white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen as well as the incidence of most complications. In a Cox regression model, individuals with OI, old age, and an abnormal level of C-reactive protein were at a higher risk of death compared with those without. Patients with three organ injuries had the highest mortality rate [57.9%; hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) vs. patients without OI: 22.31 (10.42-47.77), those with two (23.6%; HR 8.68, 95% CI 4.58-16.48), one (8.6%; HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.7), or no OI (2.6%); P < 0.001].

However, more preclinical studies of HDAC inhibitors in NSCLC and normal lung epithelial cells are required to evaluate their antitumor activities and mechanisms. The bicellular tight junction molecule claudin-2 (CLDN-2) is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and increase the proliferation of adenocarcinoma cells. Downregulation of the tricellular tight junction molecule angulin-1/LSR induces malignancy via EGF-dependent CLDN-2 and TGF-ß-dependent cellular metabolism in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. In the present study, to investigate the detailed mechanisms of the antitumor activities of HDAC inhibitors in lung adenocarcinoma, human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and normal lung epithelial cells were treated with the HDAC inibitors Trichostatin A (TSA) and Quisinostat (JNJ-2648158) with or without TGF-ß. Both HDAC inhibitors increased anguin-1/LSR, decrease CLDN-2, promoted G1 arrest and prevented the migration of A549 cells. Furthermore, TSA but not Quisinostat with or without TGF-ß induced cellular metabolism indicated as the mitochondrial respiration measured using the oxygen consumption rate. In normal human lung epithelial cells, treatment with TSA and Quisinostat increased expression of LSR and CLDN-2 and decreased that of CLDN-1 with or without TGF-ß in 2D culture. Quisinostat but not TSA with TGF-ß increased CLDN-7 expression in 2D culture. Both HDAC inhibitors prevented disruption of the epithelial barrier measured as the permeability of FD-4 induced by TGF-ß in 2.5D culture.

Despite the enormous progress in structure elucidation, the Mpro's structure-function relationship remains poorly understood. Recently, a peptidomimetic inhibitor has entered clinical trial; however, small-molecule orally available antiviral drugs have yet to be developed. Intrigued by a long-standing controversy regarding the existence of an inactive state, we explored the proton-coupled dynamics of the Mpros of SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV using a newly developed continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (MD) method and microsecond fixed-charge all-atom MD simulations. Our data supports a general base mechanism for Mpro's proteolytic function. The simulations revealed that protonation of His172 alters a conserved interaction network that upholds the oxyanion loop, leading to a partial collapse of the conserved S1 pocket, consistent with the first and controversial crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro determined at pH 6. Interestingly, a natural flavonoid binds SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the close proximity to a conserved cysteine (Cys44), which is hyper-reactive according to the CpHMD titration. This finding offers an exciting new opportunity for small-molecule targeted covalent inhibitor design. Our work represents a first step toward the mechanistic understanding of the proton-coupled structure-dynamics-function relationship of CoV Mpros; the proposed strategy of designing small-molecule covalent inhibitors may help accelerate the development of orally available broad-spectrum antiviral drugs to stop the current pandemic and prevent future outbreaks.","Verma, Neha; Henderson, Jack A; Shen, Jana",J Am Chem Soc,376,24

On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico.

Viral pneumonia and mediastinitis are complicated by respiratory failure and mutually potentiate the negative effect. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with combined antibiotic therapy ensures a favorable outcome even in patients with postoperative mediastinitis and osteomyelitis combined with viral pneumonia.","Kabanov, M Yu; Kryukov, N A; Binienko, M A; Kravtsova, O S; Belikova, M Ya; Sementsov, K V",Khirurgiia (Mosk),376,30

The present study explored young children’s emotional adjustment during the COVID19 outbreak as it relates to their exposure to stress, and their parents’ emotion regulation and playfulness. A sample of 351 Israeli parents of children aged 2–7 years completed online questionnaires. The most frequent stress symptoms in children were nervousness, agitation, and aggression, separation fears and clinging. Parental difficulties in emotion regulation, and the level of exposure to stressogenic situations were both significantly associated with children’s stress reactions. Parental emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between exposure to stress and children’s stress reactions. Parental playfulness was only inversely related to children’s stress reaction in fathers. These findings underscore the importance of parental emotion skills for children's emotional adjustment during stressful times.","Shorer, Maayan; Leibovich, Liat",Early Child Dev. Care,376,10

However, given the temporary closure of UK stop smoking services and vape shops, smokers attempting to quit may instead seek out mobile health support, such as smartphone apps. OBJECTIVE: We examined, using an interrupted time series approach, whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a step change or increasing trend in UK downloads of an otherwise popular smoking cessation app, Smoke Free. METHODS: Data were from daily and nondaily adult smokers in the United Kingdom who had downloaded the Smoke Free app between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020 (secondary analysis). The outcome variable was the number of downloads aggregated at the 12-hourly (primary analysis) or daily level (secondary analysis). The explanatory variable was the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, operationalized as March 1, 2020 (primary analysis), and January 15, 2020 (secondary analysis). Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for relevant covariates were fitted. RESULTS: Data were collected on 45,105 (primary analysis) and 119,881 (secondary analysis) users. In both analyses, there was no evidence for a step change or increasing trend in downloads attributable to the start of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Calculation of Bayes factors (BFs) indicated that the data for the primary analysis favored the null hypothesis compared with large associations (for level, BF=0.25; for slope, BF=0.26) but were insensitive to the detection of small associations (for level, BF=0.78; for slope, BF=1.35). CONCLUSIONS: In the United Kingdom, between January 1, 2020, and March 31, 2020, and between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2020, there was no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been associated with a large step change or increasing trend in downloads of a popular smoking cessation app. Findings on the association of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a small step change or increasing trend were inconclusive.","Perski, Olga; Herbec, Aleksandra; Shahab, Lion; Brown, Jamie",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,376,22

The Statistical Learning framework introduces a mathematically rigorous scheme to this general approach for parameter estimation, adding to the great field of parameter estimation in dynamical systems. The method is specially useful for estimating parameters in epidemiological compartmental models.

Quantitative data were collected and assessed cross-sectionally. Demographically, 85% of the patients identified as Black or African American (n = 265) and 58.2% as female (n = 184). The COVID-19 test was administered by the registered nurse to 78.2% (n = 288) of the patients. More than 90% of patients confirmed high levels of satisfaction with the services they received from the community mobile health clinic. Social determinants were assessed and females reported significantly worse health literacy than their male counterparts (P < 0.05). Study findings suggest that the community mobile health clinic model was effective in attracting hard-to-reach and marginalized individuals, who otherwise may have gone untested or undiagnosed.

Not only the rate and pattern of contagion that threaten our sense of healthy living but also the safety measures put in place for containing the spread of the virus may require social distancing. Three different measures to counteract this pandemic situation have emerged, namely: (i) vaccination, (ii) herd immunity development, and (iii) lockdown. As the first measure is not ready at this stage and the second measure is largely considered unreasonable on the account of the gigantic number of fatalities, a vast majority of countries have practiced the third option despite having a potentially immense adverse economic impact. To mitigate such an impact, this paper proposes a data-driven dynamic clustering framework for moderating the adverse economic impact of COVID-19 flare-up. Through an intelligent fusion of healthcare and simulated mobility data, we model lockdown as a clustering problem and design a dynamic clustering algorithm for localized lockdown by taking into account the pandemic, economic and mobility aspects. We then validate the proposed algorithms by conducting extensive simulations using the Malaysian context as a case study. The findings signify the promises of dynamic clustering for lockdown coverage reduction, reduced economic loss, and military unit deployment reduction, as well as assess potential impact of uncooperative civilians on the contamination rate. The outcome of this work is anticipated to pave a way for significantly reducing the severe economic impact of the COVID-19 spreading. Moreover, the idea can be exploited for potentially the next waves of corona virus-related diseases and other upcoming viral life-threatening calamities.","Rahman, Md Arafatur; Zaman, Nafees; Asyhari, A.

The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a membrane-bound homolog of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Henceforth, this has brought the attention of the scientific community to study the interaction between COVID-19 and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), as well as RAS inhibitors. However, these inhibitors are commonly used to treat hypertension, chronic kidney disorder, and diabetes. Obesity is a known risk factor for heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, whereas diabetes and hypertension may be indirectly related to each other through the effects of obesity. Furthermore, people with hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and other related complications like cardiovascular and kidney diseases have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection than the general population and usually exhibit poor prognosis. This severity could be due to systemic inflammation and compromised immune response and RAS associated with these comorbid conditions. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop evidence-based treatment methods that do not affect the severity of COVID-19 infection and effectively manage these chronic diseases in people with COVID-19.","Shah, Harsh; Khan, Md Shahjalal Hossain; Dhurandhar, Nikhil V; Hegde, Vijay",Acta diabetol,376,16

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines represent an opportunity to decrease the rate of severe COVID-19 cases in patients with cancer and also to restore normal cancer care. Patients with cancer to be targeted for vaccination are difficult to define owing to the limited contribution of these patients in the phase III trials testing the different vaccines. It seems appropriate to vaccinate not only patients with cancer with ongoing treatment or with a treatment having been completed less than 3 years ago but also household and close contacts. High-risk patients with cancer who are candidates for priority access to vaccination are those treated by chemotherapy. The very high-priority population includes patients with curative treatment and palliative first- or second-line chemotherapy, as well as patients requiring surgery or radiotherapy involving a large volume of lung, lymph node and/or haematopoietic tissue. When possible, vaccination should be carried out before cancer treatment begins. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can be performed during chemotherapy while avoiding periods of neutropenia and lymphopenia. For organisational reasons, vaccination should be performed in cancer care centres with messenger RNA vaccines (or non-replicating adenoviral vaccines in non-immunocompromised patients). Considering the current state of knowledge, the benefit-risk ratio strongly favours SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of all patients with cancer. To obtain more data concerning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, it is necessary to implement cohorts of vaccinated patients with cancer.","Tougeron, David; Hentzien, Maxime; Seitz-Polski, Barbara; Bani-Sadr, Firouze; Bourhis, Jean; Ducreux, Michel; Gaujoux, Sébastien; Gorphe, Philippe; Guiu, Boris; Hoang-Xuan, Khê; Huguet, Florence; Lecomte, Thierry; Lièvre, Astrid; Louvet, Christophe; Maggiori, Léon; Mansi, Laura; Mariani, Pascale; Michel, Pierre; Servettaz, Amélie; Thariat, Juliette; Westeel, Virgine; Aparicio, Thomas; Blay, Jean-Yves; Bouché, Olivier",Eur J Cancer,376,29

This is causing them to search the differences between broiler lines. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the percentage of moisture, crude protein and fat muscles and cut yields of the breasts of 18 broiler females from commercial strains (A, B and C). For breast yield were used twenty females of each treatment in which were analyzed the percentage of full breast, skinless breast and skinless breast without skin or bone on the body weight of the birds. We used 6 females from each treatment to the attainment of moisture analysis, protein and ether extract of the chest muscles. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and comparison of means by Tukey test at 5% significance level. There were no differences with respect to moisture, crude protein and ether extract of the chest between the lines. In relation to breast yield, the C strain showed better values when compared with the strain (P = 0.0084), and the same value the line B. It was concluded that the strain should be a question to be assessed for production broilers, since the breast is a noble and valued part.(AU)","Gotardo, Luciana Ruggeri; Litz, Fernanda Heloisa; Fernandes, Evandro de Abreu; Souza, Milena Miziara; Saar, Anna Gabriella Lima; Martins, Julyana Machado da Silva",Vet.

Distribution and scores of salt-related knowledge, salt reduction behavior and high-salt intake behavior between 2019 and 2020 were compared. Data of 2109 participants in 2019 and 12,732 participants in 2020 were left for analysis. Overall, 88.2% of participants in 2019 had a willingness to reduce the amount of cooking salt in their households, significantly lower than 90.2% in 2020 (p-value < 0.05). In 2019 and 2020, over 80% of the participants knew fine dried noodles contain salt, but less than 30% knew ice cream contains salt. Over 78% of participants chose 5 g or 6 g for the maximum daily salt intake of healthy adults, and about 98% of participants knew that excessive salt intake would increase the risk of hypertension in both years. The percentage of participants who used salt measuring spoons asked restaurants to use less salt, read the sodium content on the nutrition facts table, chose foods with low sodium content and regularly used low-sodium salt, were 36.1%, 45.0%, 44.1%, 40.3% and 35.8% in 2019, and the percentage increased significantly to 46.4%, 49.2%, 50.8%, 47.1% and 43.4% in 2020 (all p-value < 0.05). The percentage of people regularly eating pickled mustard tubers, salted vegetables and sauce foods or using high-salt condiments also increased from 2019 to 2020. The median of salt-related knowledge scores, salt reduction behavior scores and high-salt intake behavior scores were 11, 2, 5 points in 2019, and 10, 3, 5 points in 2020, respectively. Compared to 2019, the salt-related knowledge score was relatively lower, while the salt reduction behavior score and high-salt intake behavior score were relatively higher in 2020. Besides, the score of salt-related knowledge and behaviors differed in different gender, age and hypertension groups.

The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Arkansas occurred on 11 March 2020. Since then, approximately 8% of all Arkansans have tested positive. Given the resource limitations of Arkansas, COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) was explored as a potentially lifesaving, therapeutic option. Therefore, the Arkansas Initiative for Convalescent Plasma was developed to ensure that every Arkansan has access to this therapy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: This brief report describes the statewide collaborative response from hospitals, blood collectors, and the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) to ensure that CCP was available in a resource-limited state. RESULTS: Early contact tracing by ADH identified individuals who had come into contact with ""patient zero"" in early March. Within the first week, 32 patients tested positive for COVID-19. The first set of CCP collections occurred on 9 April 2020. Donors had to be triaged carefully in the initial period, as many had recently resolved their symptoms. From our first collections, with appropriate resource and inventory management, we collected sufficient CCP to provide the requested number of units for every patient treated with CCP in Arkansas. CONCLUSIONS: The Arkansas Initiative, a statewide effort to ensure CCP for every patient in a resource-limited state, required careful coordination among key players. Collaboration and resource management was crucial to meet the demand of CCP products and potentially save lives.","Ipe, Tina S; Le, Tuan; Quinn, Brian; Kellar, Stan; Clark, Melisa; Carlisle, Suzanna; Rassmann, Anja; Hennigan, Steve; Ridenour, Terry; Roberts, Anthony; Avery, David; Ryan, Stefanie; Pearson, Shanna; Kothari, Atul; Patil, Naveen",Transfusion,376,20

Muscle weakness and deconditioning caused by COVID-19-induced critical illness requires rehabilitation. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 74-year-old male patient complained of general weakness after COVID-19, requiring ventilator treatment. DIAGNOSIS: He was confirmed as having COVID-19 using a polymerase chain reaction test. INTERVENTIONS: During admission in the intensive care unit, medical staff wearing level D protective equipment performed the bedside manual range of motion exercise. After a negative COVID-19 test, the patient was transferred to a general ward, where sitting balance training and pulmonary rehabilitation were additionally performed by rehabilitation therapists wearing protective gear. When the patient was able to stand up with support, standing balance training and sit-to-stand training were performed. OUTCOMES: After a month of rehabilitation, the patient could sit alone, but he needed help with standing balance. The Berg Balance Scale score improved from 0 to 4, and the Modified Barthel Index score improved from 8 to 18. He was able to breathe in room air without an oxygen supply. LESSONS: This case report shows an example of how safe and effective rehabilitation can be provided to COVID-19 patients.","Gwak, Dae-Won; Hwang, Jong-Moon",Medicine (Baltimore),376,16

From April to December 2020, the positive rate of universal pre-admission screening was 0.005% (4/76,521) in a tertiary care hospital in Korea. The positive rates were not different between the periods (period 1 (daily new patients of <1 per million inhabitants) vs. period 2 (1-8.3 per million inhabitants) vs. period 3 (10.3 to 20 per million inhabitants); P = 0.45). Universal pre-admission screening for SARS-CoV-2 had a lower positive rate than that of symptom-based screening (0.005% vs. 0.049% (53/109,257), p < 0.001). In addition, seven patients with negative pre-admission test results had subsequent positive PCR during hospitalization, and four patients had secondary transmission. Universal pre-admission PCR screening may not be practical in settings of low prevalence of COVID-19, and negative PCR results at admission should not serve as a basis for underestimating the risk of nosocomial spread from asymptomatic patients.","Jung, Jiwon; Kim, Jinyeong; Lim, Joon Seo; Kim, Eun Ok; Kim, Mi-Na; Kim, Sung-Han",Viruses,376,22

It seems that it affects mostly adults older than 40 years of age, and the death rate is highest for older individuals in the population. What should I tell parents worried about their children contracting the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19, and what symptoms should I look for to determine if there is a need to test for the virus?Answer The COVID-19 global pandemic affects all ages. Severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults, with what seems to be rapid deterioration necessitating mechanical ventilation. Only 5% of those tested and found to have COVID-19 have been younger than 19 years, possibly owing to limited testing, as the symptoms in children are usually mild. Symptoms in children include fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and fatigue, and in 10% diarrhea or vomiting. Rarely dyspnea or hypoxemia were also described. Blood tests and imaging have been shown to be of little value in children and should only be ordered for those in whom you would normally order these investigations for viral-like illness. No specific therapy is available and supportive care with rest, fluids, and antipyretics for children is the recommended approach. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and pain can be given. Antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment is not recommended at this time for otherwise healthy children, and corticosteroids should also not be used.

METHODS: To account for health consequences, we estimated mortality for HCWs and present a cost-effectiveness and return on investment (ROI) analysis using a decision-analytic model with Bayesian multivariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. Data sources included inputs from the World Health Organization Essential Supplies Forecasting Tool and the Imperial College of London epidemiologic model. RESULTS: An investment of $9.6 billion USD would adequately protect HCWs in all LMICs. This intervention would save 2,299,543 lives across LMICs, costing $59 USD per HCW case averted and $4,309 USD per HCW life saved. The societal ROI would be $755.3 billion USD, the equivalent of a 7,932% return. Regional and national estimates are also presented. DISCUSSION: In scenarios where PPE remains scarce, 70-100% of HCWs will get infected, irrespective of nationwide social distancing policies. Maintaining HCW infection rates below 10% and mortality below 1% requires inclusion of a PPE scale-up strategy as part of the pandemic response. In conclusion, wide-scale procurement and distribution of PPE for LMICs is an essential strategy to prevent widespread HCW morbidity and mortality. It is cost-effective and yields a large downstream return on investment.","Risko, Nicholas; Werner, Kalin; Offorjebe, O Agatha; Vecino-Ortiz, Andres I; Wallis, Lee A; Razzak, Junaid",PLoS One,376,26

Day-to-day life changed for 15% of the Swedish population. The aim of the study was to explore how adults 70+ experienced and managed changes in everyday life due to the COVID-19 pandemic and how those changes affected wellbeing at the beginning of the virus outbreak. METHODS: Eleven women and six men, (mean age 76 years), living in ordinary housing, participated in remote semi-structured interviews in April 2020. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. FINDINGS: The theme Suddenly at risk - ' but it could have been worse' included four categories My world closed down; Negotiations, adaptations and prioritizations to manage staying at home; Barriers and facilitators to sustain occupational participation; and Considerations of my own and other's health and wellbeing emerged from the data analysis. CONCLUSION: Everyday life changes had implications for health and well-being.

Cardiovascular disease and sexual health share common risk factors (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking) and common mediating mechanisms (endothelial dysfunction, subclinical inflammation, and atherosclerosis). This generated a shift of thinking about the pathophysiology and subsequently the management of sexual dysfunction. The introduction of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors revolutionized the management of sexual dysfunction in men. This article will focus on erectile dysfunction and its association with arterial hypertension. This update of the position paper was created by the Working Group on Sexual Dysfunction and Arterial Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension. This working group has been very active during the last years in promoting the familiarization of hypertension specialists and related physicians with erectile dysfunction, through numerous lectures in national and international meetings, a position paper, newsletters, guidelines, and a book specifically addressing erectile dysfunction in hypertensive patients. It was noted that erectile dysfunction precedes the development of coronary artery disease. The artery size hypothesis has been proposed as a potential explanation for this observation. This hypothesis seeks to explain the differing manifestation of the same vascular condition, based on the size of the vessels. Clinical presentations of the atherosclerotic and/or endothelium disease in the penile arteries might precede the corresponding manifestations from larger arteries. Treated hypertensive patients are more likely to have sexual dysfunction compared with untreated ones, suggesting a detrimental role of antihypertensive treatment on erectile function. The occurrence of erectile dysfunction seems to be related to undesirable effects of antihypertensive drugs on the penile tissue. Available information points toward divergent effects of antihypertensive drugs on erectile function, with diuretics and beta-blockers possessing the worst profile and angiotensin receptor blockers and nebivolol the best profile.","Viigimaa, Margus; Vlachopoulos, Charalambos; Doumas, Michael; Wolf, Jacek; Imprialos, Konstantinos; Terentes-Printzios, Dimitios; Ioakeimidis, Nikolaos; Kotsar, Andres; Kiitam, Urmo; Stavropoulos, Konstantinos; Narkiewicz, Krzysztof; Manolis, Athanasios; Jelakovic, Bojan; Lovic, Dragan; Kreutz, Reinhold; Tsioufis, Konstantinos; Mancia, Giuseppe",J Hypertens,376,0

Variable success with HAI prevention efforts has suggested that management practices are critical to support clinical infection prevention practices. This study examined hospital leaders' management practices around the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) to identify actions that leaders can take to promote HAI prevention efforts. METHODS: We conducted interviews with 420 key informants, including managers and frontline staff, in 18 hospitals across the United States. Interviewees were asked about management practices supporting HAI prevention. We analyzed interview transcripts using rigorous qualitative methods to understand how management practices were operationalized in infection prevention efforts. RESULTS: Across hospitals and interviewees, three management practices were characterized as important facilitators of HAI prevention: (1) engagement of executive leadership; (2) information sharing; and (3) manager coaching. We found that visible executive leadership, efficient communication, and frequent opportunities to provide and promote learning from feedback were perceived to promote and sustain HAI prevention efforts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide insight into management practices for leaders that support successful HAI prevention. In practice, these tactics may need to be adjusted to accommodate the current restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to maintain HAI prevention efforts as a priority.","McAlearney, Ann Scheck; Gaughan, Alice A; DePuccio, Matthew J; MacEwan, Sarah R; Hebert, Courtney; Walker, Daniel M",Am. j. infect. control,376,20

However, little is known about potentially vulnerable groups during the final stage of the lockdown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to assess the mental health burden of different professions in China in order to find vulnerable groups, possible influencing factors, and successful ways of coping during the last 4 weeks of the lockdown in Hubei Province. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey asked participants about current residence, daily working hours, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and media preferences. We used a shortened version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess mental health. Further assessments included perceived stress (Simplified Chinese version of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale), coping strategies for all participants, and specific stressors for health care workers. We followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement for observational studies. RESULTS: The sample (N=687) consisted of 158 doctors, 221 nurses, 24 other medical staff, 43 students, 60 teachers/government staff, 135 economy staff, 26 workers/farmers, and 20 professions designated under the ""other"" category. We found increased depression (n=123, 17.9%), anxiety (n=208, 30.3%), and stress (n=94, 13.7%) in our sample. Professions that were vulnerable to depression were other medical staff and students. Doctors, nurses, and students were vulnerable to anxiety; and other medical staff, students, and economy staff were vulnerable to stress. Coping strategies were reduced to three factors: active, mental, and emotional. Being female and emotional coping were independently associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. Applying active coping strategies showed lower odds for anxiety while mental coping strategies showed lower odds for depression, anxiety, and stress. Age, being inside a lockdown area, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and having a high workload (8-12 hours per day) were not associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. WeChat was the preferred way of staying informed across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: By the end of the lockdown, a considerable part of the Chinese population showed increased levels of depression and anxiety. Students and other medical staff were the most affected, while economy staff were highly stressed. Doctors and nurses need support regarding potential anxiety disorders. Future work should focus on longitudinal results of the pandemic and develop targeted preventive measures.","Du, Junfeng; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Gronewold, Nadine; Zafar, Ali; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik",J Med Internet Res,376,16

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests is an acute respiratory infectious disease. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects and safety of oral CPM for COVID-19. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested oral CPM for the treatment of COVID-19 identified from publications in CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Web of Science, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv before November 2nd, 2020. The risk of bias for each trial was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. RevMan 5.4 software was used for data analyses. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool. RESULTS: Seven RCTs including 1079 participants were identified. The overall bias was assessed as ""-high risk of bias"" for all included trials. Oral CPM investigated were: Lianhua Qingwen capsule/granules (LHQW), Jinhua Qinggan granules (JHQG), Huoxiang Zhengqi dripping pills (HXZQ), Toujie Quwen granules (TJQW) and Lianhua Qingke granules (LHQK). Compared with conventional western therapy alone for people with COVID-19: regarding the main outcomes, the results showed that oral CPM combined with conventional western therapy improved cure rate (RRâ¯=â¯1.20, 95 % CI 1.04-1.38, involving LHQW and TJQW), reduced aggravation rate (RRâ¯=â¯0.50, 95 % CI 0.29 - 0.85, involving LHQW, JHQG, LHQK and TJQW); with regard to additional outcomes, the results showed that add-on oral CPM shortened the duration of fever, cough and fatigue, improved the recovery rate of cough and fatigue, and increased the improvement and recovery rate of chest CT manifestations. There were some differences in therapeutic effects among various CPMs for the same COVID-19 outcome. The use of TJQW and LHQG appeared not to increase the risk of adverse events, but JHQG may cause mild diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Low-certainty or very low-certainty evidence demonstrated that oral CPM may have add-on potential therapeutic effects for patients with non-serious COVID-19. These findings need to be further confirmed by well-designed clinical trials with adequate sample sizes.","Liang, Shi-Bing; Fang, Min; Liang, Chang-Hao; Lan, Hui-Di; Shen, Chen; Yan, Li-Jiao; Hu, Xiao-Yang; Han, Mei; Robinson, Nicola; Liu, Jian-Ping",Complement Ther Med,376,29

However, there are inconsistencies in the current body of evidence regarding the magnitude of the effects of alternative set structures (i.e., cluster sets and rest redistribution) on these acute mechanical, metabolic, and perceptual responses during and after RT. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse current evidence on the differences between traditional and alternative (cluster and rest redistribution) set structures on acute mechanical, metabolic, and perceptual responses during and after RT, and to discuss potential reasons for the disparities noted in the literature. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and five databases were searched until June 2019. Studies were included when they were written in English and compared at least one acute mechanical, metabolic, or perceptual response between traditional, cluster or traditional and rest redistribution set structures in healthy adults. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were performed where possible. RESULTS: Thirty-two studies were included. Pooled results revealed that alternative set structures allowed for greater absolute mean [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.60] and peak velocity (SMD = 0.41), and mean (SMD = 0.33) and peak power (SMD = 0.38) during RT. In addition, alternative set structures were also highly effective at mitigating a decline in velocity and power variables during (SMD = 0.83-1.97) and after RT (SMD = 0.58) as well as reducing lactate accumulation (SMD = 1.61) and perceived exertion (SMD = 0.81). These effects of alternative set structures on velocity and power decline and maintenance during RT were considerably larger than for absolute velocity and power variables. Sub-group analyses controlling for each alternative set structure independently showed that cluster sets were generally more effective than rest redistribution in alleviating mechanical, metabolic, and perceptual markers of fatigue. CONCLUSION: Alternative set structures can reduce mechanical fatigue, perceptual exertion, and metabolic stress during and after RT. However, fundamental differences in the amount of total rest time results in cluster sets generally being more effective than rest redistribution in alleviating fatigue-induced changes during RT, which highlights the importance of classifying them independently in research and in practice. Additionally, absolute values (i.e., mean session velocity or power), as well as decline and maintenance of the mechanical outcomes during RT, and residual mechanical fatigue after RT, are all affected differently by alternative set structures, suggesting that these variables may provide distinct information that can inform future training decisions. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: The original protocol was prospectively registered (CRD42019138954) with the PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews).","Jukic, Ivan; Ramos, Amador García; Helms, Eric R; McGuigan, Michael R; Tufano, James J",Sports med,376,24

We aimed to elucidate the effects of different examination conditions on image quality, diagnostic ability, and quantitative value of amyloid PET using 18F-flutemetamol. METHODS: We acquired data on a Discovery PET/computed tomography 710 scanner using Hoffman brain and pillar phantoms with 20 MBq of 18F for 30 min. The images were reconstructed into 10-, 20-, and 30-min periods. The ordered subset-expectation maximization algorithm was used for image reconstruction, which uses a 2- or 4-mm Gaussian filter and a combination of iteration and subset numbers. The percentage contrast and coefficient of variation (CV; as the image noise) were used as physical evaluation indices for reconstructed images, and images with superior contrast and low image noise were selected for clinical evaluation. The imaging data of 15 symptomatic patients (n = 7 and n = 8 for positive and negative diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, respectively) were reconstructed under the phantom study conditions. Radiographers visually evaluated and ranked the clinical images based on the overall contrast and image noise, and nuclear medicine specialists diagnosed Alzheimer's disease. We compared the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) obtained with different acquisition conditions. RESULTS: The basic study using the phantom revealed high convergence of contrast and image noise in five patterns of acquisition time and filter strengths. Regarding visual evaluation, the use of a 2-mm Gaussian filter caused difficulties in diagnosis because the brain parenchymal accumulation was mottled with high image noise. Differences in image quality and diagnostic ability due to different examination times were not significant. Differences in the SUVR were not significant in patients with a negative Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; in patients with a positive diagnosis, the SUVR showed significant fluctuation depending on the acquisition conditions. CONCLUSION: The differences in image quality and diagnostic performance due to the differences in 10-min acquisition time were not significant; however, of note, SUVR showed significant fluctuation depending on the acquisition conditions in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.","Otani, Tamaki; Otsuka, Hideki; Matsushita, Kou; Otomi, Yoichi; Kunikane, Yamato; Azane, Shota; Amano, Masafumi; Harada, Masafumi; Miyoshi, Hirokazu",Ann. nucl. med,376,1

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly associated with cardiovascular complications requiring hospitalizations; however, the mechanisms underlying these complications remain unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are gasotransmitters that regulate key cardiovascular functions. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients and 33 controls and NO and H2S metabolites were assessed. H2S and NO levels were compared between cases and controls in the entire study population and subgroups based on race. The availability of gasotransmitters was examined based on severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. The performance of H2S and NO levels in predicting COVID-19 infection was also analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the effects of traditional determinants of gasotransmitters on NO and H2S levels in the patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Significantly reduced NO and H2S levels were observed in both Caucasian and African American COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher NO and H2S levels compared to COVID-19 patients who survived. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis of NO and H2S metabolites in the study population showed free sulfide levels to be highly predictive of COVID-19 infection based on reduced availability. Traditional determinants of gasotransmitters, namely age, race, sex, diabetes, and hypertension had no effect on NO and H2S levels in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: These observations provide the first insight into the role of NO and H2S in COVID-19 infection, where their low availability may be a result of reduced synthesis secondary to endotheliitis, or increased consumption from scavenging of reactive oxygen species.","Dominic, Paari; Ahmad, Javaria; Bhandari, Ruchi; Pardue, Sibile; Solorzano, Juan; Jaisingh, Keerthish; Watts, Megan; Bailey, Steven R; Orr, A Wayne; Kevil, Christopher G; Kolluru, Gopi K",Redox Biol,376,16

There are clear advantages of ultrasound-guided arterial cannulation, which have shown to be more effective in reducing complications, time to successful cannulation, number of attempts, and overall first-time success rates. Evidence suggests that using palpation alone has a first-time success rate of less than 70% yet is still a widely performed technique. A systematic evaluation may be required to reduce variations in arterial catheterization practices. DESIGN: The arterial insertion method is a systematic evaluation to aid in arterial catheter insertion with ultrasound guidance, intended to improve the procedural approach. The process of arterial insertion method ensures appropriate choice of zone selection to optimize catheter longevity and performance in patients requiring arterial access. Moving the insertion site proximally 4 cm from the red zone into the green zone may reduce mechanical complications and preserve catheter performance and dwell time. CONCLUSION: The standardization of ultrasound guidance in arterial catheterization promotes vessel health and patient safety through device and site optimization.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study on clinical features of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 in the district of Piacenza (Italy). RESULTS: Among 1894 hospitalized patients, 1701 affected by COVID-19 underwent at least two serum creatinine evaluations. According to KDIGO definitions, 233 of 1,701 patients (13.7%) developed AKI: 159, 34, and 40 had stage 1, 2 and 3 AKI, respectively. Patients with AKI were older (mean age 73.5 ± 14 years, range 24-95) than those without AKI (72 ± 14 years, range 20-102). In-hospital mortality was high in COVID patients (567/1701 patients, 33%), which almost doubled among AKI patients (132/233 patients, 57%), compared with those without AKI (p < 0.01).

While this is necessary to combat the worldwide pandemic, it may have trade-offs with respect to publishing research from other disciplines. OBJECTIVES: To assess differences in published research design before and after the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional review of all 322 full-length research studies published between October 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020 in three major medical journals. We compared the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and studies with a control group before and after January 31, 2020, when Covid-19 began garnering international attention. RESULTS: The number of full-length research studies per issue was not statistically different before and after the Covid-19 pandemic (from 3.7 to 3.5 per issue, p = 0.17). Compared to before January 31, 2020, 0.7 fewer non-Covid-19 studies per issue were published versus after January 31, 2020 (p<0.001), a change that was offset by Covid-19 studies. Among non-Covid-19 studies, 0.9 fewer studies with a control group per issue were published after January 31, 2020, with RCTs contributing to nearly all the decline (p<0.001, p = 0.001, respectively). In the same timeframe, non-Covid-19 studies without a control group and non-Covid-19 studies without randomization experienced relatively small changes that did not meet our threshold for statistical significance (increases of 0.1 and 0.1 per issue, p = 0.80, p = 0.88, respectively). LIMITATIONS: Using a simple heuristic for assessing research design and lack of generalizability to the general medical literature.

Therefore, we investigated the rate of pediatric infection-related hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a retrospective cohort design and included all Danish children < 18 years. Infection-related hospitalizations were assessed during study periods in 2020 vs. 2018/2019, and we computed incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Poisson regression. In the 2020 study period, 3093 children were hospitalized with an infection, while the corresponding figures for 2018 and 2019 study periods were 4824 and 3830, respectively. When comparing the 2020 to the 2018/2019 study period prior to nationwide lockdown, we observed a decline in infection-related hospitalizations (12.68 (95% CI, 12.22-13.16) vs. 15.49 (95% CI, 15.12-15.86) per 1000 person-years).

At the beginning of the vaccine era, understanding the epitope profiles of vaccine-elicited antibodies will be the first step in assessing functionality of vaccine-induced immunity. In this study, the high-resolution linear epitope profiles of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and COVID-19 patients were delineated by using microarrays mapped with overlapping peptides of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The vaccine-induced antibodies targeting RBD had broader distribution across the RBD than that induced by the natural infection. Thus, relatively lower neutralizability was observed when a half-maximal neutralization titer measured in vitro by live virus neutralization assays was normalized to a total anti-RBD IgG titer. However, mutation panel assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have shown that the vaccine-induced epitope variety, rich in breadth, may grant resistance against future viral evolutionary escapes, serving as an advantage of vaccine-induced immunity. ImportanceEstablishing vaccine-based population immunity has been the key factor in attaining herd protection. Thanks to expedited worldwide research efforts, the potency of messenger RNA vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now incontestable. The next debate is regarding the coverage of SARS-CoV-2 variants. At the beginning of this vaccine era, it is of importance to describe the similarities and differences between the immune responses of COVID-19 vaccine recipients and naturally infected individuals. In this study, we demonstrated that the antibody profiles of vaccine recipients are richer in variety, targeting a key protein of the invading virus, than those of naturally infected individuals. Yet vaccine-elicited antibodies included more non-neutralizing antibodies than infection-elicited, their breadth in antibody variations suggested possible resilience against future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

It can lead to multiorgan failure, including respiratory and cardiovascular decompensation, and kidney injury, with significant associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, respiratory or kidney disease. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, has shown significant cardio- and renoprotective benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes (with and without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), heart failure and chronic kidney disease, and may provide similar organ protection in high-risk patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DARE-19 (NCT04350593) is an investigator-initiated, collaborative, international, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study testing the dual hypotheses that dapagliflozin can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular, kidney and/or respiratory complications or all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 but not critically ill on admission. Eligible patients will have &#8805;1 cardiometabolic risk factor for COVID-19 complications. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Primary efficacy endpoints are time to development of new or worsened organ dysfunction during index hospitalization, or all-cause mortality, and the hierarchical composite endpoint of change in clinical status through day 30 of treatment. Safety of dapagliflozin in individuals with COVID-19 will be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: DARE-19 will evaluate whether dapagliflozin can prevent COVID-19-related complications and all-cause mortality, or improve clinical recovery, and assess the safety profile of dapagliflozin in this patient population. Currently, DARE-19 is the first large randomized controlled trial investigating use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with COVID-19.","Kosiborod, Mikhail; Berwanger, Otavio; Koch, Gary G; Martinez, Felipe; Mukhtar, Omar; Verma, Subodh; Chopra, Vijay; Javaheri, Ali; Ambery, Philip; Gasparyan, Samvel B; Buenconsejo, Joan; Sjöström, C David; Langkilde, Anna Maria; Oscarsson, Jan; Esterline, Russell",Diabetes obes. metab,376,24

COVID-19 has caused widespread anxiety, which at healthy levels leads to adaptive, protective behavioral changes. For some individuals, a pandemic outbreak can lead to excessive, maladaptive levels of anxiety, particularly among those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and health anxiety. In the present paper, we review past research studies that examined anxiety in response to other disease outbreaks (including Swine Flu, Zika, and Ebola) to serve as a guide for expectable responses to COVID-19. Our review focused on the role of belief-based cognitive variables (obsessive beliefs, contamination cognitions), transdiagnostic processes (disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, an intolerance of uncertainty), social factors, and environmental/situational variables as contributing factors to excessive concerns about past pandemics. These factors in combination with unique characteristics of the virus (disease, behavioral, social and economic factors) and media consumption might enhance vulnerability to excessive anxiety about COVID-19, in line with a diathesis-stress model. COVID-19 is also unique from past pandemics due to its severity, easy transmissibility, and the nature of prescribed behavioral responses (i.e., hand washing and social distancing).

Early vaccines were developed empirically however, rational design of vaccines can allow us to optimise their efficacy, by tailoring the immune response. Establishing the immune correlates of protection greatly informs the rational design of vaccines. This facilitates the selection of the best vaccine antigens and the most appropriate vaccine adjuvant to generate optimal memory immune T cell and B cell responses. This review outlines the range of vaccine types that are currently authorised and those under development. We outline the optimal immunological correlates of protection that can be targeted. Finally we review approaches to rational antigen selection and rational vaccine adjuvant design.

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is reported to originate in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and spreading rapidly around world. SARS-CoV-2 is structurally similar to the other coronaviruses, causing the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), both binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter human cells. ACE 2 is widely expressed in several cells including, neural tissue. COVID-19 presents with fever and respiratory symptoms, possibly leading to acute respiratory distress (ARDS) but there are several published reports of acute cerebrovascular diseases, seizures, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, isolated involvement of cranial nerves, myositis/rabdhomyolisis as well myasthenic crisis (MC) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The ARDS described during COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with respiratory muscle failure occurring in myasthenia gravis (MG), may result in a life-threatening condition, challenging for intensivists, pulmonologists and neurologists. Infections are recognized trigger of exacerbations and crisis in MG and patients with MG probably exhibit a mortality higher than the general population during this COVID-19 pandemic. We review the current state of knowledge on MG during the COVID-19 pandemic to focus the immunological and respiratory interplay between these two conditions.","Galassi, Giuliana; Marchioni, Alessandro",Acta Neurol Belg,376,30

Severe disruption of research, innovation, global health programs, and compromised antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention and control programs, especially in low-and middle-income countries, could affect antimicrobial resistance. However, factors such as strict lockdown, social distancing, vaccination, and the extensive implementation of hand hygiene and face masks, with limited international travel and migration, may also contribute to decreasing AMR.

Malnutrition-screening tools will also be discussed to screen and diagnose the patients at higher risk of COVID-19 severity and related worse outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 can occur in a wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic to severe forms. Among the major risk factors for worse severity, overnutrition, undernutrition and body composition play a role in the ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat accumulation (i.e. obesity) or lean mass loss and functionality (i.e. sarcopenia) or a combination of both (i.e. sarcopenic obesity) can affect whole-body functioning. These body composition alterations in the short-term can influence susceptibility and immunological responses to the virus, inflammatory reaction, metabolic and respiratory distress, while in the long-term can modulate disease outcomes, namely length of stay, time required for recovery, risk of ICU-acquired weakness and long-term disabilities, and potentially increase the risk of death. SUMMARY: Individuals with malnutrition, sarcopenia, obesity, sarcopenic obesity and older adults with abnormal body composition or malnutrition risk may require tailored medical nutrition therapy to improve short and long-term COVID-19 outcomes.","Cava, Edda; Carbone, Salvatore",Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care,376,1

The molecular mechanism leading to melanoma metastasis is currently unclear. METHODS: With the goal of revealing the underlying mechanism, three data sets with accession numbers GSE8401, GSE46517 and GSE7956 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After identifying the differentially expressed gene (DEG) of primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma, three kinds of analyses were performed, namely functional annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module construction, and co-expression and drug-gene interaction prediction analysis. RESULTS: A total of 41 up-regulated genes and 79 down-regulated genes was selected for subsequent analyses. Results of pathway enrichment analysis showed that extracellular matrix organization and proteoglycans in cancer are closely related to melanoma metastasis. In addition, seven pivotal genes were identified from PPI network, including CXCL8, THBS1, COL3A1, TIMP3, KIT, DCN, and IGFBP5, which have all been verified in the TCGA database and clinical specimens, but only CXCL8, THBS1 and KIT had significant differences in expression. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, CXCL8, THBS1 and KIT may be the hub genes in the metastasis of melanoma and thus may be regarded as therapeutic targets in the future.","Su, Wenxing; Guan, Yi; Huang, Biao; Wang, Juanjuan; Wei, Yuqian; Zhao, Ying; Jiao, Qingqing; Ji, Jiang; Yu, Daojiang; Xu, Longjiang",BMC Cancer,376,6

Studies adressing the clinical-functional presentation of viral infection and physiotherapy management in children are scarce. The purpose statement was to provide current perspectives on the physiotherapy interventions for managing children based on COVID-19 evidences. METHODS: In this review, databases were searched between 1th January and 26 th March 2020. The following descriptors were considered: (novel coronavirus); (novel corona virus); Coronavirus; (corona vírus); 2019-nCoV; nCovor; COVID-19; SARSCoV-2; in the electronic databases National Library of Medicine (PubMed/Medline), Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). The results were described through the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. RESULTS: 16 papers were included in this review. COVID-19 seems to lead to restriction of participation and interfere in tasks, such as recreation and leisure activities, respiratory muscle function and exercise tolerance. Personal protective equipments and contact precautions are important part of treatment. Effective oxygen therapy should be given immediately in presence of hypoxia. Nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, lung-protective ventilation strategies and prone position, should be undertaken when necessary under appropriate conditions. Airway clearance techniques should be administered only strictly needed and early activities must be encouraged. CONCLUSIONS: Potential physiotherapy interventions for children with COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 consist on ventilatory management, airway clearance techniques and early activities and mobilization.","Magalhães, Paulo F; Lanza, Fernanda C; Bernardo Figueiredo, Bárbara",Minerva pediatr,376,32

Millions of people have contracted the virus and a significant number of them lost their lives, resulting in a tremendous social and economic shock across the globe. Amid the growing burden of the pandemic, there are parallel emergencies that need to be simultaneously tackled: the proliferation of fake medicines, fake news and medication misinformation surrounding COVID-19. Pharmacists are key health professionals with the required skills and training to contribute to the fight against these emergencies. Primarily, they can be a relevant source of accurate and reliable information to the public or other fellow health professionals thereby reducing the spread of COVID-19 medication misinformation. This can be achieved by providing accurate and reliable information based on recommendations given by relevant health authorities and professional associations to make sure the community understand the importance of the message and thus minimise the detrimental consequences of the pandemic. This commentary aims to summarise the existing literature in relation to the promising treatments currently under trial, the perils of falsified medications and medicine-related information and the role of pharmacists in taking a leading role in combating these parallel global emergencies.","Erku, Daniel A; Belachew, Sewunet A; Abrha, Solomon; Sinnollareddy, Mahipal; Thomas, Jackson; Steadman, Kathryn J; Tesfaye, Wubshet H",Res. soc. adm. pharm,376,16

(2) Methods: We conducted a two-phase observational study. In the first phase, we offered and then executed serum COVID-19 screening to all the convicted inmates. For those who had a doubtful or positive result, a swab was executed in the shortest time possible. In the second phase, a pharyngeal swab was offered and executed to all the police officers, the penitentiary administrative staff and the medical personnel working in the prison.

So far, the disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been countered with extreme measures at national level that attempt to suppress epidemic growth. However, these approaches require quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and may cause unprecedented socio-economic impact. A viable alternative to mass surveillance and rule enforcement is harnessing collective intelligence by means of citizen empowerment. Mobile applications running on personal devices could significantly support this kind of approach by exploiting context/location awareness and data collection capabilities. In particular, technology-assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end-user awareness and enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures. In this paper, we outline general requirements and design principles of personal applications for epidemic containment running on common smartphones, and we present a tool, called 'diAry' or 'digital Ariadne', based on voluntary location and Bluetooth tracking on personal devices, supporting a distributed query system that enables fully anonymous, privacy-preserving contact tracing.

Although medical advances have improved survival rates, men treated for prostate cancer experience side-effects that can reduce their work capacity, increase financial stress, and affect their career and/or retirement plans. Working-age males comprise a significant proportion of new prostate cancer diagnoses. It is important, therefore, to understand the connections between prostate cancer and men's work lives. This scoping review aimed to summarize and disseminate current research evidence about the impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's work lives. Electronic databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed articles published between 2006 and 2020 that reported on the impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's work. Following scoping review guidelines, 21 articles that met inclusion criteria were identified and analyzed. Evidence related to the impact of prostate cancer on work was grouped under three themes: (1) work outcomes after prostate cancer treatment; (2) return to work considerations, and (3) impact of prostate cancer treatment on men's finances. Findings indicate that men's return to work may be more gradual than expected after prostate cancer treatment. Some men may feel pressured by financial stressors and masculine ideals to resume work. Diverse factors including older age and social benefits appear to play a role in shaping men's work-related plans after prostate cancer treatment. The findings provide direction for future research and offer clinicians a synthesis of current knowledge about the challenges men face in resuming work in the aftermath of prostate cancer treatment.","Yu Ko, Wellam F; Oliffe, John L; Bottorff, Joan L",Am J Mens Health,376,24

This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of HSCT recipients after developing COVID-19. METHODS: In response to the pandemic, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) implemented a special form for COVID-19-related data capture on March 27, 2020. All patients-irrespective of age, diagnosis, donor type, graft source, or conditioning regimens-were included in the analysis with data cutoff of Aug 12, 2020. The main outcome was overall survival 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Factors associated with mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. FINDINGS: 318 HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported to the CIBMTR. The median time from HSCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 17 months (IQR 8-46) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 23 months (8-51) for autologous HSCT recipients. The median follow-up of survivors was 21 days (IQR 8-41) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 25 days (12-35) for autologous HSCT recipients. 34 (18%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients were receiving immunosuppression within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was mild in 155 (49%) of 318 patients, while severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 45 (14%) of 318 patients-ie, 28 (15%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 17 (13%) of 134 autologous HSCT recipients. At 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% (95% CI 58-77) for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% (55-78) for recipients of autologous HSCT. Age 50 years or older (hazard ratio 2·53, 95% CI 1·16-5·52; p=0·020); male sex (3·53; 1·44-8·67; p=0·006), and development of COVID-19 within 12 months of transplantation (2·67, 1·33-5·36; p=0·005) were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic HSCT recipients, and a disease indication of lymphoma was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with plasma cell disorder or myeloma (2·41, [1·08-5·38]; p=0·033) in autologous HSCT recipients. INTERPRETATION: Recipients of autologous and allogeneic HSCT who develop COVID-19 have poor overall survival. These data emphasise the need for stringent surveillance and aggressive treatment measures in HSCT recipients who develop COVID-19.

The Tidepool Experience,12.854403,3.0789554,2021,"BACKGROUND: Haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients are considered at high risk of poor outcomes after COVID-19 on the basis of their immunosuppressed status, but data from large studies in HSCT recipients are lacking. This study describes the characteristics and outcomes of HSCT recipients after developing COVID-19. METHODS: In response to the pandemic, the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) implemented a special form for COVID-19-related data capture on March 27, 2020. All patients-irrespective of age, diagnosis, donor type, graft source, or conditioning regimens-were included in the analysis with data cutoff of Aug 12, 2020. The main outcome was overall survival 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall survival probabilities were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Factors associated with mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. FINDINGS: 318 HSCT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reported to the CIBMTR. The median time from HSCT to COVID-19 diagnosis was 17 months (IQR 8-46) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 23 months (8-51) for autologous HSCT recipients. The median follow-up of survivors was 21 days (IQR 8-41) for allogeneic HSCT recipients and 25 days (12-35) for autologous HSCT recipients. 34 (18%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients were receiving immunosuppression within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. Disease severity was mild in 155 (49%) of 318 patients, while severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation occurred in 45 (14%) of 318 patients-ie, 28 (15%) of 184 allogeneic HSCT recipients and 17 (13%) of 134 autologous HSCT recipients. At 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19, overall survival was 68% (95% CI 58-77) for recipients of allogeneic HSCT and 67% (55-78) for recipients of autologous HSCT. Age 50 years or older (hazard ratio 2·53, 95% CI 1·16-5·52; p=0·020); male sex (3·53; 1·44-8·67; p=0·006), and development of COVID-19 within 12 months of transplantation (2·67, 1·33-5·36; p=0·005) were associated with a higher risk of mortality among allogeneic HSCT recipients, and a disease indication of lymphoma was associated with a higher risk of mortality compared with plasma cell disorder or myeloma (2·41, [1·08-5·38]; p=0·033) in autologous HSCT recipients. INTERPRETATION: Recipients of autologous and allogeneic HSCT who develop COVID-19 have poor overall survival. These data emphasise the need for stringent surveillance and aggressive treatment measures in HSCT recipients who develop COVID-19.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of behavioral problems in school-aged children during home confinement. METHODS: We conducted an internet-based survey involving 1264 children (grades 2-6) and their parents from two primary schools between February 25 and March 8, 2020, in Hubei province, China. Behavioral problems were evaluated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). RESULTS: The prevalence of prosocial behaviors among children was 10.3%, followed by total difficulty (8.2%), conduct problems (7.0%), peer problems (6.6%), hyperactivity-inattention (6.3%) and emotional problems (4.7%). Compared with children who did not exercise, children with psychical activity had a lower hyperactivity-inattention risk (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.44 for 1-2 days/week; OR: 0.56 for more than 2 days/week) and less prosocial behaviors problems (OR: 0.65 for 1-2 days/week; OR: 0.55 for more than 2 days/week). Children of parents with anxious symptoms were associated with increased risks of emotional symptoms and total difficulty (OR: 5.64 and 3.78, respectively). LIMITATIONS: We adopted self-report questionnaires and did not collect baseline information before COVID-19 outbreak. The potential self-selection bias inherent in the study should be noted. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of behavioral problems among school-aged children varied from 4.7% to 10.3% in home quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak. Taking physical exercise may be an efficient measure to reduce behavioral problems for school-aged children in home confinement.","Liu, Qi; Zhou, Yu; Xie, Xinyan; Xue, Qi; Zhu, Kaiheng; Wan, Zihao; Wu, Hao; Zhang, Jiajia; Song, Ranran",J Affect Disord,376,23

It is unclear if screening and diagnostic mammography volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels and whether utilization has varied by women's characteristics. METHODS: We collected data on 461,083 screening mammograms and 112,207 diagnostic mammograms conducted during January 2019 through July 2020 at 62 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We compared monthly screening and diagnostic mammography volumes before and during the pandemic, stratified by age, race/ethnicity, breast density, and family history of breast cancer. RESULTS: Screening and diagnostic mammography volumes in April 2020 were 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5% to 2.4%) and 21.4% (95% CI = 18.7% to 24.4%) of April 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively, but by July 2020 rebounded to 89.7% (95% CI = 79.6% to 101.1%) and 101.6% (95% CI = 93.8% to 110.1%) of July 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively. The year-to-date cumulative volume of screening and diagnostic mammograms performed through July 2020 was 66.2% (95% CI = 60.3% to 72.6%) and 79.9% (95% CI = 75.4% to 84.6%), respectively, of year-to-date volume through July 2019. Screening mammography rebound was similar across age groups and by family history of breast cancer. Monthly screening mammography volume in July 2020 for Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian women reached 96.7% (95% CI = 88.1% to 106.1%), 92.9% (95% CI = 82.9% to 104.0%), 72.7% (95% CI = 56.5% to 93.6%), and 51.3% (95% CI = 39.7% to 66.2%) of July 2019 pre-pandemic volume, respectively. CONCLUSION: Despite a strong overall rebound in mammography volume by July 2020, the rebound lagged among Asian and Hispanic women and a substantial cumulative deficit in missed mammograms accumulated, which may have important health consequences.","Sprague, Brian L; Lowry, Kathryn P; Miglioretti, Diana L; Alsheik, Nila; Bowles, Erin J A; Tosteson, Anna N A; Rauscher, Garth; Herschorn, Sally D; Lee, Janie M; Trentham-Dietz, Amy; Weaver, Donald L; Stout, Natasha K; Kerlikowske, Karla",J. natl. cancer inst,376,28

The aim of this study was to describe the dynamics over time of mortality among patients hospitalised for COVID-19 in Sweden, using nationwide data compiled by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Methods: Observational cohort study where all patients hospitalised in Sweden between March 1 and September 30, 2020, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA positivity 14 days before to 5 days after admission and a discharge code for COVID-19 were included. Outcome was 60-day all-cause mortality. Patients were categorised according to month of hospital admission. Poisson regression was used to estimate the relative risk of death by month of admission, adjusting for, age, sex, comorbidities, care dependency, country of birth, healthcare region, and Simplified Acute Physiology, version 3 (patients in intensive care units;ICU). Findings: A total of 17,140 patients were included, of which 2943 died within 60 days of admission. The overall 60-day mortality was thus 17.2% (95% CI, 16.6%-17.7%), and it decreased from 24.7% (95% CI, 23.0%-26.5%) in March to 10.4% (95% CI, 8.9%-12.1%) post-wave (July-September). Adjusted relative risk (RR) of death was 0.46 (95% CI, 0.39-0.54) post-wave, using March as reference. Corresponding RR for patients not admitted to ICU and those admitted to ICU were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.42-0.59) and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.33-0.72), respectively. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU decreased from 19.4% (95% CI, 17.9%-21.1%) in the March cohort to 8.9% (95% CI, 7.5%-10.6%) post-wave. Interpretation: There was a gradual decline in mortality during the spring of 2020 in Swedish hospitalised COVID-19 patients, independent of baseline patient characteristics. Future research is needed to explain the reasons for this decline. The changing COVID-19 mortality should be taken into account when management and results of studies from the first pandemic wave are evaluated.

Inhibiting this protease may open an alternative avenue toward therapeutic intervention. In this work, a computational docking approach was developed to identify potential small-molecule inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Totally 288 potential hits were identified from a half-million bioactive chemicals via a protein-ligand docking protocol. To further evaluate the docking results, a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model of 3CLpro inhibitors was developed based on existing small molecule inhibitors of the 3CLpro(SARS- CoV- 1) and their corresponding IC50 data. The QSAR model assesses the physicochemical properties of identified compounds and estimates their inhibitory effects on 3CLpro(SARS- CoV- 2). Seventy-one potential inhibitors of 3CLpro were selected through these computational approaches and further evaluated via an enzyme activity assay. The results show that two chemicals, i.e., 5-((1-([1,1 '-biphenyl]-4-yl)-2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methylene)pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione and N-(4-((3-(4-chlorophenylsulfonamido)quinoxalin-2-yl)amino)phenyl)acetamide, effectively inhibited 3CLpro SARS-CoV-2 with IC50's of 19 +/- 3 mu M and 38 +/- 3 mu M, respectively. The compounds contain two basic structures, pyrimidinetrione and quinoxaline, which were newly found in 3CLpro inhibitor structures and are of high interest for lead optimization. The findings from this work, such as 3CLpro inhibitor candidates and the QSAR model, will be helpful to accelerate the discovery of inhibitors for related coronaviruses that may carry proteases with similar structures to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.","Zhai, T.

In cases with a severe disease course or threatening long-term impairment due to disease, the German health care system offers insured persons the possibility of medical rehabilitation. In contrast to what was observed and expected at the beginning of the pandemic, COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity are represented in rehabilitation. To date, there is no common consensus on the content and aftercare of rehabilitation nor is there any knowledge about the short- and long-term effects of such a rehabilitation programme. In addition, these aspects were not considered with regard to the varying severity of the course of the disease. The present research project investigates this question. METHODS: The study sample will consist of N = 350 rehabilitants after COVID-19 and a comparison group (CG) with N = 230 rehabilitants suffering from an obstructive respiratory disease. The participants will be recruited at five German rehabilitation facilities and undergo medical rehabilitation. This prospective, exploratory, multicentre, mixed-methods study will be evaluated as follows: (A) The quantitative portion includes questionnaires at different points in time (at the beginning and end of rehabilitation, after six and twelve months) and contains standardised measurement instruments. For example, participation limitations, quality of life, health status, fatigue, psychomental limitations and disorders, performance in different areas of life and ability to work are measured. (B) Qualitative interviews are held at different times (end of rehabilitation, after six and twelve months), and an expert workshop is conducted. Topics are rehabilitation content, satisfaction and aftercare as well as different outcomes on subjective health and participation impairments. DISCUSSION: Studies on other indications have already shown that pneumological rehabilitation has positive effects. Thus, it is expected that an improvement in different dimensions will be observed at the end of rehabilitation in both groups. With regard to the different severities of COVID-19, this study evaluates the long-term developments. Subsequently, the authors will elaborate concrete recommendations for medical rehabilitation after different courses of disease with regard to existing pneumological rehabilitation concepts.

Various Solidago-canadensis-L.-derived biochars prepared through pyrolysis from 400 to 600 °C were applied to coastal saline-alkali soil samples to optimise the biochar pyrolysis temperature and investigate its actual ecological responses. All biochars reduced the soil bulk density and exchangeable sodium stress and increased soil water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, and organic matter content. Principal-component-analysis results showed that pyrolysis temperature played an important role in the potential application of biochars to improve the coastal saline-alkali soil, mainly contributed to ameliorating exchangeable sodium stress and decreasing biochar-soluble toxic compounds. Furthermore, soil bulk density and organic matter, as well as carboxylic acids, phenolic acids and amines of biochar were major driving factors for bacterial community composition. Compared to low-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed below 550 °C), which showed higher toxicity for Brassica chinensis L. growth due to the higher content of carboxylic acids, phenols and amines, high-temperature biochar (pyrolyzed at or above 550 °C) possessed less amounts of these toxic functional groups, more beneficial soil bacteria and healthier for plant growth. Therefore, high-temperature biochar could be applied as an effective soil amendment to ameliorate the coastal saline-alkali soil with acceptable environmental risk.","Tang, Jiawen; Zhang, Shudong; Zhang, Xiaotong; Chen, Jinhuan; He, Xinyu; Zhang, Qiuzhuo",Sci Total Environ,376,21

With the ongoing large-scale vaccination in different countries and continuous surge of new variants of global concerns, a convenient, cost-effective and high-throughput neutralization test is urgently needed. Conventional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test is tedious, time-consuming and requires a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Despite recent reports of neutralizations using different pseudoviruses with a luciferase or green fluorescent protein reporter, the laborious steps, inter-assay variability or high background limit their high-throughput potential. In this study we generated lentivirus-based pseudoviruses containing a monomeric infrared fluorescent protein reporter to develop neutralization assays. Similar tropism, infection kinetics and mechanism of entry through receptor-mediated endocytosis were found in the three pseudoviruses generated. Compared with pseudovirus D614, pseudovirus with D614G mutation had decreased shedding and higher density of S1 protein present on particles. The 50% neutralization titers to pseudoviruses D614 or D614G correlated with the plaque reduction neutralization titers to live SARS-CoV-2. The turn-around time of 48-72 h, minimal autofluorescence, one-step image quantification, expandable to 384-well, sequential readouts and dual quantifications by flow cytometry support its high-throughput and versatile applications at a non-reference and biosafety level 2 laboratory, in particular for assessing the neutralization sensitivity of new variants by sera from natural infection or different vaccinations during our fight against the pandemic.","Tsai, Wen-Yang; Ching, Lauren L; Hsieh, Szu-Chia; Melish, Marian E; Nerurkar, Vivek R; Wang, Wei-Kung",Emerg Microbes Infect,376,16

The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine the cumulative prevalence and incidence rates of COVID-19 among dentists and to assess their level of engagement in specific infection control practices. METHODS: US dentists were invited to participate in a monthly web-based survey from June through November 2020. Approximately one-third of initial respondents (n = 785) participated in all 6 surveys, and they were asked about COVID-19 testing received, symptoms experienced, and infection prevention procedures followed in their primary practice. RESULTS: Over a 6-month period, the cumulative COVID-19 infection prevalence rate was 2.6%, representing 57 dentists who ever received a diagnosis of COVID-19. The incidence rates ranged from 0.2% through 1.1% each month. The proportion of dentists tested for COVID-19 increased over time, as did the rate of dentists performing aerosol-generating procedures. Enhanced infection prevention and control strategies in the dental practice were reported by nearly every participant monthly, and rates of personal protection equipment optimization, such as changing masks after each patient, dropped over time. CONCLUSIONS: US dentists continue to show a high level of adherence to enhanced infection control procedures in response to the ongoing pandemic, resulting in low rates of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19. Dentists are showing adherence to a strict protocol for enhanced infection control, which should help protect their patients, their dental team members, and themselves. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 infections among practicing dentists will likely remain low if dentists continue to adhere to guidance.","Araujo, Marcelo W B; Estrich, Cameron G; Mikkelsen, Matthew; Morrissey, Rachel; Harrison, Brittany; Geisinger, Maria L; Ioannidou, Effie; Vujicic, Marko",J Am Dent Assoc,376,1

The secondary objectives of the presented study are to evaluate different outcomes of the rehabilitation program in comparison to standard of care regarding: functional performance at 4-week and 12-week post- discharge mark; health-related quality of life, the impact on the health services (namely days of hospitalization), the cost-effectiveness of the intervention proposed. TRIAL DESIGN: This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-arm clinical trial of treatment, with an allocation ratio 1:1 and framework of superiority. PARTICIPANTS: The study will be conducted at Centro Hospitalar Entre Douro e Vouga, Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Potential participants will be adult patients (&#8805;18 years old) hospitalized in ICU with respiratory insufficiency due to COVID-19, who are referred to respiratory and functional rehabilitation. Only patients approved by physical rehabilitation doctors to perform respiratory and functional rehabilitation will be considered potential participants. To be eligible for inclusion participants must have been independent in their activities of daily living before the onset of critical illness (verbal statement by their proxy) and have to meet the safety criteria defined by the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Both groups will receive usual medical and nursing care in the ICU, which involves assessment and treatment of the respiratory system and may include positioning, hyperinflation techniques and suctioning. The physical function of the patient is assessed, and active bed exercises and mobility are encouraged as soon as possible and may include sitting out of bed. The intervention group will receive a functional and respiratory multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocol (that includes medical, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy interventions) during their entire hospital stay. After reassurance that the patients fulfil the safety criteria, they will initiate the rehabilitation protocol, individualized to each patient based on the clinical status. The rehabilitation interventions and exercises implemented will be consistent with recommendations from the Portuguese Society of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine. The intervention will occur 6 days per week (Monday to Saturday), fifteen minutes, twice per day for each participant. Throughout all activities, progression will be increased successively, depending on the individual's tolerance and stability. After discharge, the intervention group will continue with rehabilitation exercises, prescribed by physical rehabilitation doctors. These exercises are designed for the patient to do at home, and then report their execution to rehabilitation nurses through teleconsultation, until 12 weeks after ICU discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES: Baseline descriptive data collection will include age, sex, comorbidities and date of admission to ICU. The need of mechanical ventilation and length of use, as well as the need for oxygen therapy, length of ICU stay (days/hours), incidence of ICU readmission, discharge destination and survival will also be recorded. Prior to intervention, every two days and at discharge, participants will be evaluated using the following scales: Glasgow Coma Scale, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment, 5 standardized questions for cooperation, Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test and Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. At discharge, Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will be evaluated. The primary outcome measure will be functional capacity using the 6-Minute Walk Test, and it will be measured at discharge and at the 4-week and 12-week mark. Medical Research Council Sum-Score, Handgrip strength test, Medical Research Council dyspnea scale and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion will also be re-evaluated at the 4-week and 12-week mark. The health related quality of life will also be used as an outcome measure, using the 12-Item Short Form Survey, at 12 weeks of follow-up. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be divided into two groups, standard care and intervention, by means of balanced randomization at a 1:1 ratio using blocks of 10 participants. The randomization sequence is going to be created using a free software ( http://www.randomized.org/ ). In order to ensure the confidentiality of the randomisation sequence, this process will be conducted by an assessor external to the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The evaluators in the study will be blinded during the entire process. The evaluators will be unaware of the study objectives and the randomized distribution of patients to study groups and will not have access to the randomization sequence. Although blinding for patients will not be possible to achieve completely, subjects will be unaware of other treatment modalities, and they will not know if they belong to the intervention or standard group. As for the treating physiotherapists and ICU staff, blinding will not be possible to achieve, but they will not be responsible for assessing outcomes. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We plan to randomise 40 participants to each group. 80 participants in total.

Data from different surveys revealed a high degree of hesitation rather than outright opposition to vaccines. The most frequent complaint related to the COVID-19 vaccination was the fear of side effects. Within the Spanish and European legislative framework, both compulsory vaccination and government regulation of FN (Fake News) appear to be feasible options, counting on sufficient legal support, which could be reinforced by additional amendment. However, following current trends of good governance, policymakers must have public legitimation. Rather than compulsory COVID-19 vaccination, an approach based on education and truthful information, persuading the population of the benefits of a vaccine on a voluntary basis, is recommended. Disagreements between health professionals are positive, but they should be resolved following good practice and the procedures of the code of ethics. Furthermore, citizens do not support the involvement of government authorities in the direct control of news.

METHODS: An anonymous course evaluation survey was conducted at the end of the academic year 2019/2020. The organization of classes due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided our students with a unique opportunity to compare online and contact classes. Students' responses were analyzed according to the type of obtained data (ratio, ordinal, and categorical). RESULTS: The response rate was 95.58%. Approximately 90% of students found anatomical dissection and practical work in general to be the most important aspect of teaching, which could not be replaced by online learning. During online classes, students missed the most the interaction with other students, followed by the interaction with student teaching assistants and teaching staff. Very few students found contact lectures useful, with most students reporting that they could be replaced with recorded video lectures. In contrast, recorded video lectures were perceived as extremely helpful for studying. Regular weekly quizzes were essential during online classes as they gave students adequate feedback and guided their learning process. Students greatly benefitted from additional course materials and interactive lessons, which were made easily available via e-learning platform. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical dissection and interaction during contact classes remain the most important aspects of teaching anatomy. However, online teaching increases learning efficiency by allowing alternative learning strategies and by substituting certain components of contact classes, thus freeing up more time for practical work.","Banovac, I.; Katavic, V.; Blazevic, A.; Bicanic, I.; Hladnik, A.; Kovacic, N.; Petanjek, Z.",Croatian Medical Journal,376,4

In this direction, one appropriate alternative approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus protein at low level i.e., femtomolar (fM) is exploring plasmonic metasensor technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However, the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed using toroidal metasurface technology. This research is focused on the fabrication of a miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal antibody specific to spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse concentrations of the spike protein are monitored. Possessing molecular weight around ~76 kDa allowed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein with significantly low as limit of detection (LoD) was achieved as ~4.2 fM. We envisage that outcomes of this research will pave the way toward the use of toroidal metasensors as practical technologies for rapid and precise screening of SARS-CoV-2 virus carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and spike proteins in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and site of infection.","Ahmadivand, Arash; Gerislioglu, Burak; Ramezani, Zeinab; Kaushik, Ajeet; Manickam, Pandiaraj; Ghoreishi, S Amir",Biosens Bioelectron,376,33

METHODS: We analyzed fasting blood glucose (FBG) after hospital discharge in a cohort of 621 adult cases with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: At admission, 18.8% of the patients in our cohort had pre-existing diabetes, 9.3% fasting glucose in the diabetes range without a prior diagnosis (DFG), 26% impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 44.9% normal fasting glucose (NFG), while 2% had no FBG available. FBG categories were similarly distributed in the 71 patients without confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. During follow-up (median time 6 month) FBG was available for 321 out of the 453 (70.9%) surviving patients and showed a trend to a marginal increase [from 97 (87-116) to 100 (92-114) mg/dL; p = 0.071]. Transitions between FBG categories were analyzed in subjects without pre-existing diabetes (265 out of 321). We identified three groups: (i) patients who maintained or improved FBG during follow-up [Group A, n = 185; from 100 (86-109) to 94 (88-99) mg/dL; p < 0.001]; (ii) patients who moved from the NFG to IFG category [Group B, n = 66: from 89 (85-96) to 106 (102-113) mg/dl; p < 0.001]; (iii) patients who maintained or reached DFG during follow-up [Group C, n = 14: from 114 (94-138) to 134 (126-143) mg/dl; p = 0.035]. Male sex and ICU admission during the hospitalization were more prevalent in Group C compared to Group A or B.

Therefore, estimation of the distribution of these two quantities is of distinct interest. However, this is a challenging problem since it is normally not possible to obtain precise observations of these two variables. Instead, in the beginning of a pandemic, it is possible to observe for infection pairs the time of symptom onset for both people as well as a window for infection of the first person (e.g. because of travel to a risk area). In this paper we suggest a simple semi-parametric sieve-estimation method based on Laguerre-Polynomials for estimation of these distributions. We provide detailed theory for consistency and illustrate the finite sample performance for small datasets via a simulation study.","Kreiss, Alexander; Keilegom, Ingrid Van",,376,1

We aimed to describe the clinical profile and risk factors for severe disease in children hospitalized with COVID-19 from India. METHODS: In this multicentric retrospective study, we retrieved data related to demographic details, clinical features, including the severity of disease, laboratory investigations and outcome. RESULTS: We included 402 children with a median (IQR) age of 7 (2-11) years. Fever was the most common symptom, present in 38.2% of children. About 44% had underlying comorbidity. The majority were asymptomatic (144, 35.8%) or mildly symptomatic (219, 54.5%). There were 39 (9.7%) moderate-severe cases and 13 (3.2%) deaths. The laboratory abnormalities included lymphopenia 25.4%, thrombocytopenia 22.1%, transaminitis 26.4%, low total serum protein 34.7%, low serum albumin 37.9% and low alkaline phosphatase 40%. Out of those who were tested, raised inflammatory markers were ferritin 58.9% (56/95), c-reactive protein 33.3% (41/123), procalcitonin 53.5% (46/86) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) 76%. The presence of fever, rash, vomiting, underlying comorbidity, increased total leucocyte count, thrombocytopenia, high urea, low total serum protein and raised c-reactive protein was factors associated with moderate to severe disease. CONCLUSION: Fever was the commonest symptom. We identified additional laboratory abnormalities, namely lymphopenia, low total serum protein and albumin and low alkaline phosphatase. The majority of the children were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. We found high urea and low total serum protein as risk factors for moderate to severe disease for the first time.","Jat, Kana Ram; Sankar, Jhuma; Das, Rashmi Ranjan; Ratageri, Vinod H; Choudhary, Bharat; Bhat, Javeed Iqbal; Mishra, Baijayantimala; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Behera, Bijayini; Charoo, Bashir Ahmad; Goyal, Jagdish P; Gupta, Aditya Kumar; Gulla, Krishna Mohan; Gera, Rani; Illalu, Shivanand; Kabra, S K; Khera, Daisy; Kumar, Balbir; Lodha, Rakesh; Mohan, Anant; Mohanty, Pankaj Kumar; Satapathy, Amit Kumar; Singh, Kuldeep; Singh, Amitabh; Sharma, Sumant Vinayak; Tiwari, Pawan; Trikha, Anjan; Wari, Prakash K",J. trop. pedriatr,376,16

Being primarily a respiratory disease, it is highly transmissible through both direct and indirect contacts. It displays a range of symptoms in different individuals and thus has been grouped into mild, moderate, and severe diseases. The virus utilizes spike proteins present on its surface to recognize ACE-2 receptors present on the host cells to enter the cell cytoplasm and replicate. The viral invasion of cells induces damage response, pyroptosis, infiltration of immune cells, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), and activation of the adaptive immune system. Depending on viral load and host factors like age and underlying medical conditions, the immune responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and death. In this review, we specify and justify both viral and host therapeutic targets that can be modulated to relieve the symptoms and treat the disease. Furthermore, we discuss vaccine development in the time of pandemic and the most promising vaccine candidates by far, according to WHO database. Finally, we discuss the conventional re-purposed drugs and potential alternative treatments as adjuvants.","Chugh, Heerak; Awasthi, Amardeep; Agarwal, Yashi; Gaur, Rajesh K; Dhawan, Gagan; Chandra, Ramesh",Eur J Pharmacol,376,16

Thus, the present study assessed burnout among HCWs during the MERS outbreak to identify the influential factors involved in this process. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of the psychological tests and questionnaires completed by 171 hospital employees from two general hospitals that treated MERS patients. The tests included the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, Positive Resources Test, the questionnaires assessed exposure to the MERS outbreak event and perceptions about MERS. RESULTS: Of the 171 HCWs, 112 (65.5%) experienced disengagement and 136 (79.5%) suffered from exhaustion. Disengagement was associated with lower levels of purpose and hope, a higher perception of job risk, and exposure to the media. Exhaustion was associated with lower levels of purpose and hope, a higher perception of little control of the infection, a higher perception of job risk, prior experience related to infections, and being female. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed the risk and protective factors associated with burnout among HCWs during an outbreak of MERS. These findings should be considered when determining interventional strategies aimed at ameliorating burnout among HCWs.","Seo, Yae Eun; Kim, Hyun Chung; Yoo, So Young; Lee, Kang Uk; Lee, Hae Woo; Lee, So Hee",,376,3

On this day, India and the world should rise to an effective step to analyze this disease and eliminate the effects of this epidemic. In this paper presented, the growing database of COVID-2019 has been analyzed from March 1, 2020, to April 11, 2020, and the next one is predicted for the number of patients suffering from the rising COVID-2019. Different regression analysis models have been utilized for data analysis of COVID-2019 of India based on data stored by Kaggle in between 1 March 2020 to 11 April 2020. In this study, we have been utilized six regression analysis based models namely quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, sixth degree, and exponential polynomial respectively for the COVID-2019 dataset. We have calculated the root mean square of these six regression analysis models. In these six models, the root mean square error of sixth degree polynomial is very less in compared other like quadratic, third degree, fourth degree, fifth degree, and exponential polynomial. Therefore the sixth degree polynomial regression model is very good models for forecasting the next 6 days for COVID-2019 data analysis in India. In this study, we have found that the sixth degree polynomial regression models will help Indian doctors and the Government in preparing their plans in the next 7 days. Based on further regression analysis study, this model can be tuned for forecasting over long term intervals.","Yadav, Ramjeet Singh",Int J Inf Technol,376,25

Nurses are assuming expanded roles for a broad range of patients in community-based care. Nurse educators have a responsibility to teach nursing students about the needs of patients and families in the home care setting. METHOD: To describe how the creation of a home care video series and a medication reconciliation simulation scenario were used as a teaching strategy in a simulation center. RESULTS: The teaching strategy supported senior-level nursing students' understanding of the complexity of home care nursing and the nurse's role and responsibilities in care coordination, care transitions, and interprofessional practice. CONCLUSION: The home care video scenario was received favorably by nursing students. Additional simulation video scenarios are needed that address the health disparities among underrepresented and vulnerable groups. There is potential to offer the simulation in a virtual-online format during the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing mandates.

Integration of NGS into clinical drug development has the potential to accelerate clinical trial conduct and ultimately will shape the landscape of clinical care by making it easier to identify patients who would benefit from particular therapy(ies) and to monitor treatment outcomes with less invasive tests. This has led to an increased use of NGS service providers by pharmaceutical sponsors: to screen patients for clinical trials eligibility and for patient stratification, expanded Companion Diagnostic (CDx) development for treatment recommendations and Comprehensive Genomic profiling (CGP). These changes are reshaping the face of clinical quality considerations for precision medicine. Although some clinical quality considerations do exist in Health Authorities (HA) guidances and regulations (e.g., International Conference of Harmonization Good Clinical Practices-GCP), there is currently no holistic GxP-like detailed framework for pharmaceutical sponsors using NGS service providers in clinical trials, or for the development of CDx and CGP. In this research, we identified existing and applicable regulations, guidelines and recommendations that could be translated into clinical quality considerations related to technology, data quality, patients and oversight. We propose these considerations as a basis for pharmaceutical sponsors using NGS service providers in clinical drug development to develop a set of guidelines for NGS clinical quality.","Ménard, Timothé; Barros, Alaina; Ganter, Christopher",Ther. innov. regul. sci.

Since currently no definitive therapies or vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus are available, there is an urgent need to identify effective drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of the best-known targets available is the main protease of this virus, crucial for the processing of polyproteins codified by viral RNA. In this work, we used a computational virtual screening procedure for the repurposing of commercial drugs available in the DrugBank database as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Molecular docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been applied. The computational model was validated through a self-docking procedure. The screening procedure highlighted five interesting drugs that showed a comparable or higher docking score compared to the crystallographic compound and maintained the protein binding during the MD runs. Amongst these drugs, Ritonavir has been used in clinical trials with patients affected by COVID-19 and Nelfinavir showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The five identified drugs could be evaluated experimentally as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease in view of a possible COVID-19 treatment. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Recent history involving SARS-like coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) have demonstrated the significant role of intermediate and reservoir hosts in viral maintenance and transmission cycles. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and experimental infections of a wide variety of animal species has been demonstrated, and in silico and in vitro studies have indicated that deer are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are amongst the most abundant, densely populated, and geographically widespread wild ruminant species in the United States. Human interaction with white-tailed deer has resulted in the occurrence of disease in human populations in the past. Recently, white-tailed deer fawns were shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we investigated the susceptibility and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in adult white-tailed deer. In addition, we examined the competition of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates, representatives of the ancestral lineage A (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/WA1/2020) and the alpha variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020), through co-infection of white-tailed deer. Next-generation sequencing was used to determine the presence and transmission of each strain in the co-infected and contact sentinel animals. Our results demonstrate that adult white-tailed deer are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can transmit the virus through direct contact as well as vertically from doe to fetus. Additionally, we determined that the alpha VOC B.1.1.7 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 outcompetes the ancestral lineage A isolate in white-tailed deer, as demonstrated by the genome of the virus shed from nasal and oral cavities from principal infected and contact animals, and from virus present in tissues of principal infected deer, fetuses and contact animals.","Cool, Konner; Gaudreault, Natasha N.; Morozov, Igor; Trujillo, Jessie D.; Meekins, David A.; McDowell, Chester; Carossino, Mariano; Bold, Dashzeveg; Kwon, Taeyong; Balaraman, Velmurugan; Madden, Daniel W.; Artiaga, Bianca Libanori; Pogranichniy, Roman M.; Sosa, Gleyder Roman; Henningson, Jaimie; Wilson, William C.; Balasuriya, Udeni B.

METHODS: This study used a large medical claims clearinghouse database representing 5%-7% of the Medicare fee-for-service population to characterize changes in the utilization of cancer care services and gain insight into the impact of COVID-19 on the US cancer population, including identification of new patients, gaps in access to care, and disruption of treatment journeys. RESULTS: In March-July 2020, in comparison with the baseline period of March-July 2019, there is a substantial decrease in cancer screenings, visits, therapy, and surgeries, with variation by cancer type and site of service. At the peak of the pandemic in April, screenings for breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers were lower by 85%, 75%, 74%, and 56%, respectively. Significant utilization reductions were observed in April for hospital outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visits (-74%), new patient E&M visits (-70%), and established patient E&M visits (-60%). A decrease in billing frequency was observed for the top physician-administered oncology products, dropping in both April (-26%) and July (-31%). Mastectomies were reduced consistently in April through July, with colectomies similarly reduced in April and May and prostatectomies dipping in April and July. CONCLUSION: The current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in the United States has resulted in decreases and delays in identifying new cancers and delivery of treatment. These problems, if unmitigated, will increase cancer morbidity and mortality for years to come.","Patt, Debra; Gordan, Lucio; Diaz, Michael; Okon, Ted; Grady, Lance; Harmison, Merrill; Markward, Nathan; Sullivan, Milena; Peng, Jing; Zhou, Anan",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,376,16

METHODS: The photograph rotation tool in the iPhone PHOTO app was used by 75 examiners to evaluate 22 photographs from only 9 patients, captured in infra- and supra-dextroversion, and infra- and supra-levoversion, as not all the patients were photographed in the 4 positions mentioned. Each patient received a score for the superior and inferior oblique muscle functions, ranging from -4 (hypofunction) to 4 (hyperfunction) or 0 (normal function), using preediting and postediting photographs. These values were compared with the scores previously given by trained personnel in strabismus screening. The difference in score between the two groups was expressed in natural (whole and non-negative) numbers. The mean and pattern deviation were then calculated. RESULTS: The scores of most of the edited photos showed a lower mean than those of the unedited ones, except for a patient with left superior oblique hyperfunction. The patients with no oblique dysfunction and those with right superior oblique hyperfunction demonstrated (after editing the photograph) scores with greater similarity with their initial scores (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Similar results were found in the patients with oblique hypofunctions and right inferior oblique hyperfunction (p<0.01).

Most Australian parents support vaccines, but some refuse and are often judged harshly by their community, especially during an outbreak. We sought the perspectives of Australian public health experts on the key issues faced when managing a measles outbreak in an area with high anti-vaccination sentiment. METHODS: A measles outbreak scenario formed the basis of a 3-round modified Delphi process to identify key practitioner concerns in relation to parents/carers who don't follow the recommended vaccination schedule. We surveyed a range of professionals in the field: policymakers, infectious disease experts, immunisation program staff, and others involved in delivering childhood vaccinations, to identify key priorities when responding to an outbreak in a community with low vaccination coverage. RESULTS: Findings indicate that responses to measles outbreaks in communities with high anti-vaccination sentiment are motivated by concerns about the potential for a much larger outbreak event. The highest operational priority is to isolate infected children. The two most highly ranked practical issues are mistrust from non-vaccinating members of the local region and combatting misinformation about vaccines. Trying to change minds of such individuals is not a priority during an outbreak, nor is vaccinating their children. Using media and social media to provide information about the outbreak and measures the public can take to limit the spread of the disease was a focus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the challenges faced during an outbreak and priorities for communicating with communities where there is a high level of anti-vaccination sentiment. In the context of a global pandemic, the results of this study also have implications for managing public health responses to community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as COVID-19 vaccines becomes widely available.","Robinson, Penelope; Wiley, Kerrie; Degeling, Chris",BMC Public Health,376,20

However, the question to whether continue or withdraw metformin therapy in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains contentious. This study aims to investigate the association between metformin and poor COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: Eligible studies published up to 21 October 2020 were included and appraised for validity, importance, and applicability. The included studies were further ranked according to the level of evidence (LOE). Results: Nine studies were included for further assessments, of which seven studies stated that metformin was not associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes (LOE II-V), while the other two with poorer designs stated otherwise (LOE V). Although metformin may increase the risk of developing acidosis and lactic acidosis (LOE IV), the observed risks were more accentuated in patients with severe COVID-19 disease or kidney impairment and in patients with > 2 daily metformin doses. Interestingly, one study revealed that metformin may even yield therapeutic role in reducing the risk of COVID-19 mortality (LOE II), although further studies are required to confirm these findings. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that metformin may be safely continued in COVID-19 patients. The benefit of metformin therapy with simultaneous continuous monitoring of COVID-19 severity and kidney function may outweigh the risks of lactic acidosis, of which incidence is relatively rare.

In particular, accurate modeling of lockdown effects on human behaviour and epidemic evolution is a key issue in order e.g. to inform health-care decisions on emergency management. In this regard, the compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Our estimation strategy does not require significant Bayes prior information and exploits regularization theory. Hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This also permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before in the literature. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around [Formula: see text] of people in Lombardy and [Formula: see text] in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2, with the fatality rate being 1.14%. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number dangerously increased in the summer, due to holiday relax, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Finally, we also document how Italy faced the second wave of infection in the last part of 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic and others could be subject to other waves, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions on human behaviour to contain the spread.","Pillonetto, G; Bisiacco, M; Palù, G; Cobelli, C",Sci Rep,376,16

A formulation of niclosamide, a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment candidate, optimized for inhalation and intranasal administration (UNI91104) was developed. Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre, dose-ascending Phase 1 trial to assess the safety of UNI91104 in Denmark (NCT04576312). Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a ascending single dose in cohort 1-4 and five doses over 2.5 days in cohort 5. Inclusion criteria included a minimum 80% of predicted lung function. Exclusion criteria included severe, clinically significant allergies and current acute or chronic condition especially airway diseases. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs) and pulmonary function tests including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests. The primary endpoints were defined as the frequency of reported AEs and the change of safety variables relative to pre-dose. Data from all enroled healthy volunteers receiving any amount of IMP was included in the primary analyses. The pharmacokinetics of UNI91104 was determined. Findings: The trial was conducted between 29 June 2020 and 08 August 2020. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received UNI91104 and ten placebo. No serious AEs or discontinuation were reported. Mild irritation in the upper respiratory tract following inhalation of UNI91104 was reported as most frequent AE (45 events in 26 healthy volunteers, 59% of all healthy volunteers). Nasal application was well-tolerated. There was no evidence of difference in the change of mean levels of pulmonary function tests between active and placebo group across all cohorts. Five healthy volunteers (11.4%) (1 on placebo) had signs of increased transient FeNO and 4 on active (9.1%) experienced asymptomatic drops in FEV1, which resolved spontaneously or were reversible with a ß2-agonist. Niclosamide exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following inhalation and intranasal administration. Interpretation: UNI91104, a promising candidate for inhalation and intranasal therapy against COVID-19 and other viral respiratory tract infections is well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and warrants further testing in patient trials. Funding: The study was funded by Innovationsfonden Denmark and UNION therapeutics.","Backer, Vibeke; Sjöbring, Ulf; Sonne, Jesper; Weiss, Anne; Hostrup, Morten; Johansen, Helle Krogh; Becker, Victoria; Sonne, David P; Balchen, Torben; Jellingsø, Mads; Sommer, Morten Otto Alexander",Lancet Reg Health Eur,376,24

In this work, ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of Etek lignin in presence of Na, Ce, NiCe, MgCe, Fe and FePd on ZrO2 was studied. The largest combined yield of monomeric phenolics and alkylphenols was produced by Na/ZrO2 catalysts. A parametric study of the most promising Na/ZrO2 then resulted in using a catalyst:lignin ratio of 3:1 at 500 °C as the best option, enhancing at 17.5 wt% the recovery of total phenolics including 6 wt% alkyl phenols, which is equivalent to 27.8 wt% and 9.5 wt% of the starting lignin in Etek lignin waste. The study of the catalyst basicity indicates that the mild basicity of Na/ZrO2 was mostly responsible for the enhanced mono phenols recovery. Due to formation of thermally stable Na2CO3 during pyrolysis, successful Na/ZrO2 regeneration requires temperature of 900 °C or higher.","Hendry, Abbie; Åhlén, Michelle; Fernandes, Tony; Cheung, Ocean; Sanna, Aimaro",Bioresour Technol,376,1

COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by fever, cough, and dyspnea. On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Quarantine authorities are constantly working to prevent the spread of COVID-19. One of the control measures is preparing for national antibody testing, as another wave of infection is expected to occur in the fall of 2021. There are three reasons for antibody testing from a prevention perspective. First, it can identify people with asymptomatic infection. Second, it can detect whether neutralizing antibodies are produced in individuals who have already been infected. Third, it can confirm collective immunity at a community or population level. Considering the lack of effective antiviral drugs or vaccines, the strategy of implementing an effective antibody testing program is an important control measure to minimize the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The importance of these accounts appears to have increased given the unprecedented changes with COVID-19 and the dramatic and unpredictable change to the application cycle including the use of virtual interviews, suggesting a perceived need for increased online engagement with applicants. The purpose of this study was to determine the patterns of creation and usage of Twitter and Instagram accounts of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited General Surgery residency programs and their associated surgical departments. METHORDS: A cross-sectional study of the use of Twitter and Instagram by the 332 ACGME-accredited General Surgery residency programs and their associated departments was conducted in February 2021. Twitter and Instagram accounts were identified by accessing program/department websites as well as social media platform and internet searches. Year of creation, number of followers, and number of posts (July 1, 2018-December 31, 2020) were collected. Trends in usage were compared across years stratified by platform and by account owner (department vs. residency). RESULTS: Instagram accounts are more than five-times greater for residencies compared to departments (42% vs 8%, p < 0.001). There was not a significant difference between the number of department and residency Twitter accounts (26% vs 23%, pâ¯=â¯0.37). Significantly more residency Instagram and Twitter accounts were created or first posted in 2020 compared to department accounts (Instagram: 100 vs 7, p < 0.001; Twitter: 31 vs 6, pâ¯=â¯0.001). Over 18% of residency programs had both Twitter and Instagram accounts compared to only 6% of departments (p < 0.001). However, department Twitter and Instagram accounts had significantly higher median total posts from 7/1/2018-12/31/2020 (Twitter: pâ¯=â¯0.0001, Instagram pâ¯=â¯0.004). While the number of Instagram followers and accounts being followed were similar between residencies and departments, department Twitter accounts had a larger median number of followers (1141 vs. 430, p=0.003) and account followings (308 vs. 192, pâ¯=â¯0.001) compared to residency accounts. CONCLUSIONS: The number of residency social media accounts has significantly increased in 2020 compared to account creation of departments, with Instagram account creation exceeding that of Twitter and of departments. The opposite pattern in usage was seen related to number of posts, and with Twitter, followers, and number of followings, with departments outpacing residencies. This significant increase in account creation may have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the change to a virtual interview season, suggesting an unprecedented need for online engagement with applicants. As the increased social media presence will likely persist in future application cycles, further study about the impact of residency social media use on recruitment and applicant decision-making as well as effective strategies, is needed.","Bludevich, Bryce M; Fryer, Madeline; Scott, Erin M; Buettner, Hannah; Davids, Jennifer S; LaFemina, Jennifer",J. surg. educ,376,1

METHODS: The following data were retrieved for 260 eyes of 260 patients undergoing cataract surgery: preoperative simulated keratometry, mean keratometry of posterior surface, axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and white-to-white diameter; model and power of implanted IOL; and subjective refraction at 3 months post surgery. These data were used to train different machine learning models (k-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, etc). Implanted lens characteristics and biometric data were used as input to predict IOL power and refractive outcomes. For external validation, a dataset of 52 eyes was used. The accuracy of the trained models was compared with that of the power formulas Holladay 2, Haigis, Barrett Universal II, and Hill-RBF v2.0. RESULTS: The SD of the prediction error in order of lowest to highest was the new method (designated Karmona) (0.30), Haigis (0.36), Holladay 2 (0.38), Barrett Universal II (0.38), and Hill-RBF v2.0 (0.40).

Given physical distancing recommendations, access to traditional in-person telehealth training for providers has been limited. Telesimulation is an alternative to in-person telehealth training. Telesimulation training with both remote participants and facilitators using telehealth software has not been described. Objective: We investigated the feasibility of a large group telesimulation provider training of telehealth software for remote team leadership skills with common neonatal cases and procedures. Methods: We conducted a 90-min telesimulation session with a combination of InTouch&#8482; provider access software and Zoom&#8482; teleconferencing software. Zoom facilitators activated InTouch software and devices and shared their screen with remote participants. Participants rotated through skill stations and case scenarios through Zoom and directed bedside facilitators to perform simulated tasks using the shared screen and audio connection. Participants engaged in a debrief and a pre- and postsurvey assessing participants' comfort and readiness to use telemedicine. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and paired t tests. Results: Twenty (n = 20) participants, five Zoom and eight bedside facilitators participated. Twenty-one (21) pre- and 16 postsurveys were completed. Most participants were attending neonatologists who rarely used telemedicine software. Postsession, participants reported increased comfort with some advanced InTouch features, including taking and sharing pictures with the patient (p < 0.01) and drawing on the shared image (p < 0.05), but less comfort with troubleshooting technical issues, including audio and stethoscope (p < 0.01). Frequently stated concerns were troubleshooting technical issues during a call (75%, n = 16) and personal discomfort with telemedicine applications and technology (56%, n = 16). Conclusion: Large group telesimulation is a feasible way to offer telehealth training for physicians and can increase provider comfort with telehealth software.","Brei, Brianna K; Neches, Sara; Gray, Megan M; Handley, Sarah; Castera, Mark; Hedstrom, Anna; D039,; Cruz, Ravi; Kolnik, Sarah; Strandjord, Thomas; Mietzsch, Ulrike; Cooper, Christine; Moore, Jami M; Billimoria, Zeenia; Sawyer, Taylor; Umoren, Rachel",Telemed. j. e. health,376,16

These strategies are known to benefit students by increasing performance, enhancing mastery of class content, and augmenting affect, particularly in underrepresented racial/ethnic minority students. Among these strategies, case study and project-based learning allow students to master course content while collectively tackling relevant, real-world societal problems. In particular, environmental pollution with paper-based products provide a current problem by which microbiology students learn about the role of microorganisms in paper waste management as well as the microbiological and biochemical processes involved in protein secretion, nutrient uptake, and energy metabolism. Delivered in a flipped, hybrid class in a Technology-Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) laboratory, this lesson taught students about exoenzyme secretion, biopolymer hydrolysis, intracellular transport of sugars, and sugar catabolic reactions. Students demonstrated increased comprehension of exoenzyme function and secretion, as well as how cells uptake the products of exoenzyme hydrolysis. However, students had challenges in placing the transported exoenzyme products within metabolic processes. Our results show increased perceived learning from the students as well as an understanding of the societal implications of these microbiological concepts. Our lesson deviated from knowledge silos in which students learn information in discrete topics. While departing from employing traditional, compartmentalized learning approaches, this student-centered guided lesson frames the systemic nature of the microbiological and biochemical processes underlying the decomposition of organic matter in a real-world context.","Shay, Jackie E; Solis, Ruth; García-Ojeda, Marcos E",Front Microbiol,376,26

This work proposes a patient-independent model for the estimation of well-aerated volume of lungs in CT images (WAVE). METHODS: A Gaussian fit, with mean (Mu.f) and width (Sigma.f) values, was applied to the lower CT histogram data points of the lung to provide the estimation of the well-aerated lung volume (WAVE.f). Independence from CT reconstruction parameters and respiratory cycle was analysed using healthy lung CT images and 4DCT acquisitions. The Gaussian metrics and first order radiomic features calculated for a third cohort of COVID-19 patients were compared with those relative to healthy lungs. Each lung was further segmented in 24 subregions and a new biomarker derived from Gaussian fit parameter Mu.f was proposed to represent the local density changes. RESULTS: WAVE.f resulted independent from the respiratory motion in 80% of the cases. Differences of 1%, 2% and up to 14% resulted comparing a moderate iterative strength and FBP algorithm, 1 and 3 mm of slice thickness and different reconstruction kernel. Healthy subjects were significantly different from COVID-19 patients for all the metrics calculated. Graphical representation of the local biomarker provides spatial and quantitative information in a single 2D picture. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other metrics based on fixed histogram thresholds, this model is able to consider the inter- and intra-subject variability. In addition, it defines a local biomarker to quantify the severity of the disease, independently of the observer.","Berta, L; De Mattia, C; Rizzetto, F; Carrazza, S; Colombo, P E; Fumagalli, R; Langer, T; Lizio, D; Vanzulli, A; Torresin, A",Phys Med,376,16

Most deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as a result of an excessive immune response and a cytokine storm elicited by severe SARS-CoV-2 lung infection, rather than by a direct cytopathic effect of the virus. In the most severe forms of the disease therapies should aim primarily at dampening the uncontrolled inflammatory/immune response responsible for most fatalities. Pharmacological agents - antiviral and anti-inflammatory molecules - have not been able so far to achieve compelling results for the control of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Cells derived from the placenta and/or fetal membranes, in particular amniotic epithelial cells (AEC) and decidual stromal cells (DSC), have established, well-characterized, potent anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory properties that make them attractive candidates for a cell-based therapy of COVID19 pneumonia. Placenta-derived cells are easy to procure from a perennial source and pose minimal ethical issues for their utilization. In view of the existing clinical evidence for the innocuousness and efficiency of systemic administration of DSCs or AECs in similar conditions, we advocate for the initiation of clinical trials using this strategy in the treatment of severe COVID-19 disease.","Berishvili, Ekaterine; Kaiser, Laurent; Cohen, Marie; Berney, Thierry; Scholz, Hanne; Floisand, Yngvar; Mattsson, Jonas",,376,16

Currently, there are no effective therapies available for corona virus infections. Since the three viruses belong to the same family and share many common features, we can theoretically design a drug that can be effective on all the three of them. In this study, using computational approach, we designed a peptide (Peptide 7) that can bind to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV thereby preventing the entry of the viruses into the host cell. The peptide inhibitor was designed as a consensus peptide from three different peptides that might individually bind to the RBD of the three viruses. Docking studies and molecular dynamic simulations using Peptide 7 has shown that it binds with higher affinity than the native receptors of the RBD and forms a stable complex thereby preventing further viral-receptor interaction and inhibiting their cellular entry. This effective binding is observed for the three RBDs, despite the Peptide 7 interactions being slightly different. Hence; this peptide inhibitor can be used as a potential candidate for the development of peptide based anti-viral therapy against Corona viruses.","V K, Priya; Rath, Satish Prasad; Abraham, Parvin",PLoS One,376,2

COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread quickly across China and the rest of the world. This study aims to evaluate initial chest thin-section CT findings of COVID-19 patients after their admission at our hospital. METHODS: Retrospective study in a tertiary referral hospital in Anhui, China. From January 22, 2020 to February 16, 2020, 110 suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were examined using chest thin-section CT. Patients in group 1 (n = 51) presented with symptoms of COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria. Group 2 (n = 29) patients were identified as a high degree of clinical suspicion. Patients in group 3 (n = 30) presented with mild symptoms and normal chest radiographs. The characteristics, positions, and distribution of intrapulmonary lesions were analyzed. Moreover, interstitial lesions, pleural thickening and effusion, lymph node enlargement, and other CT abnormalities were reviewed. RESULTS: CT abnormalities were found only in groups 1 and 2. The segments involved were mainly distributed in the lower lobes (58.3%) and the peripheral zone (73.8%). The peripheral lesions, adjacent subpleural lesions, accounted for 51.8%. Commonly observed CT patterns were ground-glass opacification (GGO) (with or without consolidation), interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular interstitial thickening. Compared with group 1, patients in group 2 presented with smaller lesions, and all lesions were distributed in fewer lung segments. Localized pleural thickening was observed in 51.0% of group 1 patients and 48.2% of group 2 patients. The prevalence of lymph node enlargement in groups 1 and 2 combined was extremely low (1 of 80 patients), and no significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax was observed (0 of 80 patients). CONCLUSION: The common features of chest thin-section CT of COVID-19 are multiple areas of GGO, sometimes accompanied by consolidation. The lesions are mainly distributed in the lower lobes and peripheral zone, and a large proportion of peripheral lesions are accompanied by localized pleural thickening adjacent to the subpleural region.","Long, Cheng-Juan; Fang, Ping; Song, Tie-Jun; Zhang, Jing-Chao; Yang, Qing",BMC Med Imaging,376,1

We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR]â¯=â¯1.06) and CD4 T cell count (ORâ¯=â¯0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission.

BodyGrip, a novel prototype system, is used for handgrip strength over 10 s time interval tests. A cross-sectional study with a non-probabilistic sample of community-dwelling elderly women was conducted. The force/time data collected from the dominant handgrip strength test, together with the Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) test results, were used to train artificial neural networks. Different models were tested, and the frailty matching of TFI scores reached a minimum accuracy of 75%. Despite the small sample size, the BodyGrip system appears to be a promising tool for exploring new frailty-related features. The adopted strategy foresees ultimately configuring the system to be used as an expedite mode for identifying individuals at risk, allowing an easy, quick, and frequent person-centered care approach. Additionally, it is suitable for following up of the elderly in particular, and it may assume a relevant role in the mitigation of the increase in frailty evolution during and after the imposed isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further use of the system will improve the robustness of the artificial neural network algorithm.","Urbano, D.; Restivo, M. T.; Barbosa, M. R.; Fernandes, A.; Abreu, P.; Chousal, M.

Participants included 1046 healthcare staffs (56.8% females) aged 20-61 years (mean age = 30.29 years, SD = 7.80), who completed the measures of coronavirus stress, optimism, social connectedness, and COVID-19 burnout. Females reported more coronavirus stress and burnout and less social connectedness. People confirmed with COVID-19 reported lower optimism. The results indicated that coronavirus stress did not only have a direct effect on increased COVID-19 burnout but also had an indirect effect on it through reduced optimism and social connectedness. These results are important given the shortage of intervention efforts targeting coronavirus stress. Future intervention efforts aimed at reducing coronavirus stress and related outcomes may benefit from simultaneously focusing on optimism and social connectedness.","Yildirim, Murat; Çiçek, Ilhan; Sanli, Mehmet Emin",Curr Psychol,376,1

In this virus-cell interaction study, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection or viral spike protein expression alone inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein expression. The spike protein promoted an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediated signaling cascade, induced the transcriptional regulatory molecules NF-&#954;B and AP-1/c-Fos via MAPK activation, and increased IL-6 release. SARS-CoV-2 infected patient sera contained elevated levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R. Up-regulated AT1 receptor signaling also influenced the release of extracellular soluble IL-6R by the induction of the ADAM-17 protease. Use of the AT1 receptor antagonist, Candesartan cilexetil, resulted in down-regulation of IL-6/soluble IL-6R release in spike expressing cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue plays an important role as a transcriptional inducer for SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Further study indicated that inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected and viral spike protein expressing epithelial cells did not induce SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Introduction of culture supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells on a model human liver endothelial cell line (TMNK-1), where transmembrane IL-6R is poorly expressed, resulted in the induction of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation as well as MCP-1 expression. In conclusion, our results indicated that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in epithelial cells promotes IL-6 trans-signaling by activation of the AT1 axis to initiate coordination of a hyper-inflammatory response.","Patra, Tapas; Meyer, Keith; Geerling, Lizzie; Isbell, T Scott; Hoft, Daniel F; Brien, James; Pinto, Amelia K; Ray, Ratna B; Ray, Ranjit",PLoS Pathog,376,24

It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations will foster addiction-related habits such as caloric/salty food intake, screen use, and substance use. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France. METHODS: A web-based survey was provided from day 8 to day 13 of the containment and was completed by 11,391 participants. The questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress, mental well-being, and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors. Global changes were described and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Overall, the respondents reported more increases in addiction-related habits than decreases, specifically 28.4% (caloric/salty food intake), 64.6% (screen use), 35.6% (tobacco use), 24.8% (alcohol use), and 31.2% (cannabis use). Reduced well-being scores and increased stress scores were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (P<.001 for all habits). Factors of increase in caloric/salty food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.77), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having a partner (aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per 1 square meter/person decrease: aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49), and reporting current (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.31) or past (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment. Factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.43), age less than 29 years (P<.001), having no partner (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32), being employed (P<.001), intermediate/high education level (P<.001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32), living in an urban environment (P<.01), and not working (P<.001). Factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2787) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.59), intermediate/low education level (P<.01), and still working in the workplace (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.86). Factors of increase in alcohol use (n=7108) were age 30-49 years (P<.05), a high level of education (P<.001), and current psychiatric treatment (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.88). The only significant factor of increase in cannabis use (n=620) was intermediate/low level of education (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The early phase of COVID-19 containment in France led to widespread increases in addiction-related habits in the general population. Reduced well-being and increased stress were universal factors of increase. More specific factors were associated with increases in each of the explored habits.","Rolland, Benjamin; Haesebaert, Frédéric; Zante, Elodie; Benyamina, Amine; Haesebaert, Julie; Franck, Nicolas",JMIR Public Health Surveill,376,24

According to the WHO, there have been more than 26.3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in more than 190 countries to date. In light of the outbreak, various treatment modalities have been considered, including traditional medicine, which has been widely used in the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; influenza. Ayurveda contributes a measurable ratio in the world's traditional practices. As per the guideline of directorate of AYUSH, Government of Madhya Pradesh, cases of COVID-19 were intervened with Arogya Kashayam (AK-20), a decoction prepared from the herbs at 88 COVID Care Centers (CCC) across the state. Aim: To evaluate retrospectively, the effect of the intervention of AK-20 in COVID-19 positive cases as stand alone or in combination with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) administered at CCC in Madhya Pradesh. Materials and Methods: It is a retrospective study with 4432 COVID-19 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) tested positive cases including 2750 males and 1682 females between 5 and 80 years of age. All the cases were intervened with AK-20 as stand alone or in combination with HCQ. Moreover, these patients were also given Zinc and Vitamin C simultaneously. The intervention of AK-20 was made through the district level government AYUSH machinery, and the related data were collected in specially designed case report form. The data were analyzed retrospectively, and outcomes included the RTPCR testing or asymptomatic discharge from the CCC as per the prevailing ICMR guidelines. Results: The present study reveals that out of 4432 COVID-19 RTPCR-positive cases, 2817 (63.56%) received HCQ with AK-20 and 1615 cases (36.43%) received AK-20 as a stand alone treatment. Among the cases that received HCQ and AK-20, 2681 cases (94.17%) recovered completely in an average of 6.8 days and among those who were on standalone AK-20, 1502 cases (93.00%) recovered completely in the same average days. The Chi-square test showed that both the groups were equally effective (P &lt; 0.01;F = 0.3764). Conclusion: The retrospective analysis showed that the treatment practices of AK-20 standalone or in combination with HCQ applied in COVID-19 positive cases at CCC in Madhya Pradesh were effective against SARS coronavirus 2 disease. A significant number of cases was tested negative or asymptomatically discharged from both the groups of interventions.

La emergencia ha forzado a los gobiernos europeos a cerrar los colegios y, como consecuencia, todas las actividades escolares han pasado a ser online. Haciendo referencia a algunos trabajos de Giorgio Agamben, Paul Virilio y Walter Benjamin, los autores proponen algunas observaciones críticas a la transformación del espacio escolar y del tiempo escolar que caracteriza la práctica del aprendizaje a distancia. Esta transformación no solo se refiere a aspectos escolares accidentales, sino que también afecta a la propia identidad de la experiencia escolar. En una escuela completamente digitalizada, el tiempo se caracteriza por su instantaneidad: el tiempo como duración es sustituido por el «tiempo de exposición», como argumentaba Paul Virilio. Además, el colegio completamente desmaterializado se reduce al espacio bidimensional de la pantalla. El artículo tiene por objeto demostrar que el tiempo instantáneo y el espacio desmaterializado dificultan la experiencia de «cruzar». Por tanto, siguiendo algunas observaciones de Jan Masschelein y Gert Biesta, se afirma que la experiencia de «cruzar», amenazada por la digitalización escolar, es esencial para vivir una auténtica experiencia escolar. No se pretenden negar las innovaciones digitales en sí, sino «ponerlas sobre la mesa» para suspender su uso inmediato y analizarlas de manera crítica.","Gobbi, Annachiara Rovea Federico",Teoría de la Educación |Revista Interuniversitaria,376,16

Given that most viruses use endocytosis to enter the host cell, mechanistic investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to consider the diversity of endocytic pathways available for SARS-CoV-2 entry in the human lung epithelium. Taking advantage of the well-established methodology of membrane trafficking studies, this research direction allows for the rapid characterisation of the key cell biological mechanism(s) responsible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, 11 clinically approved generic drugs are identified as potential candidates for repurposing as blockers of several potential routes for SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis. More broadly, the paradigm of targeting a fundamental aspect of human cell biology to protect against infection may be advantageous in the context of future pandemic outbreaks.","Glebov, Oleg O",FEBS j,376,0

Several significant decisions were made to postpone or cancel major swimming events by FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation). Swimmers were no longer allowed to continue their usual training in swimming pools and were confined to their homes. These unusual circumstances may represent a good opportunity to strengthen different areas of swimmer preparation and potentially enhance performance when resuming regular aquatic training. We searched major databases for relevant information, and the present article provides practical information on home-based training for swimmers of all ages. The COVID-19 crisis and its consequences on the swimming community have created a myriad of challenges for swimmers around the world, including maintaining their fitness level and preparing to return optimally and safely to pool training and competitions. Unfortunately, the mental consequences that might arise after the pandemic may also have an impact. We strongly recommend encouraging the swimmers to consider quarantine as an opportunity for development in specific areas of preparation and learn how to best cope with this special situation of self-isolation and/or ""physical distancing"" for their mental health and in case a similar situation is faced again in the future.","Haddad, Monoem; Abbes, Zied; Mujika, Iñigo; Chamari, Karim",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),376,26

Voluntary participation in this strategy will depend on individual preferences towards and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for test results. We distributed a web-based, contingent valuation survey to social-media users in 16 Latin American countries to evaluate regional attitudes towards the emerging COVID-19 outbreak and WTP for COVID-19 testing. We observe that the cost of the test and household income are important determinants of testing intentions. We find higher WTP among those reporting greater concern relative to the average respondent. Accounting for uncertainty, our results indicate a WTP of approximately $45 dollars or 4.2 % of monthly income among respondents. These results, paired with our predicted participation rate of between 84-94 % for a $1 test, suggest that local officials will be able to effectively recruit participation in this mitigation strategy given the appropriate subsidization structure.","Trudeau, Jennifer M; Alicea-Planas, Jessica; Vásquez, William F",Econ Hum Biol,376,33

Social influences on subjective distress associated with COVID-19 remain understudied in the Chinese context. Wuhan with its surrounding areas in Hubei province was not only the locale where first COVID-19 cases were detected in the world but was also the hardest hit across China. Data from Hubei provide a unique opportunity to investigate COVID-19-related subjective distress and its social correlates. METHODS: We use original data (N=3,465) from the General Social Survey on COVID-19 in Hubei, China, conducted in August 2020. Regression analysis is employed to examine the impact of socioeconomic status, family structure, and social policies on COVID-19-related subjective distress measured by the Impact of Event-Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: First, individuals with higher socioeconomic status are not more immune to distress, and actually it is those better-educated ones who are more distressed. Second, family structure influences distress. Divorced and widowed individuals are more prone to distress than those who are married or single. Those living with COVID-19-infected family members or living with a larger family are particularly more distressed. Third, stricter lockdown measures promote real and perceived protection and also increase individuals' psychological distance from the disease, thereby reducing subjective distress. LIMITATIONS: The sample is not totally random so we should use caution when generalizing the findings to the general population. CONCLUSIONS: The findings contribute to our understanding of mental health disparity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain social groups are at a higher risk of distress than others.","Zhou, Min; Guo, Wei",J Affect Disord,376,1

Although vaccine hesitancy has existed among a small percentage of people for centuries, its harmful effects are likely to be more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy will pose substantial risks for both people who delay or refuse to be vaccinated and the wider community. It will make communities unable to reach thresholds of coverage necessary for herd immunity against COVID-19, thus unnecessarily perpetuating the pandemic and resulting in untold suffering and deaths. Vaccine hesitancy is pervasive, misinformed, contagious, and is not limited to COVID-19 vaccination. Our work shows that vaccine hesitancy is a complex and dynamic social process that reflects multiple webs of influence, meaning, and logic. People's vaccination views and practices usually comprise an ongoing engagement that is contingent on unfolding personal and social circumstances, which can potentially change over time. Therefore, as COVID-19 vaccination rolls out globally, scientists and decision-makers need to investigate the scale and determinants of vaccine hesitancy in each setting; so that tailored and targeted strategies can be developed to address it.","Wiysonge, Charles Shey; Ndwandwe, Duduzile; Ryan, Jill; Jaca, Anelisa; Batouré, Oumarou; Anya, Blanche-Philomene Melanga; Cooper, Sara",Hum Vaccin Immunother,376,29

Uric acid (UA) lowering therapies may reduce the risk of appearance or the progression of these comorbidities. In this work, we investigated the relationship between serum UA levels and inflammation in subjects with AHU. METHODS: Serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), TNF-&#945; and IL-6, and mRNA expression of TNFa and IL6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured in individuals with AHU and without comorbid conditions and in a control group with similar characteristics and normal serum UA levels. Additionally, we determined the variations in the inflammatory profile in a subgroup of subjects after 6 months of treatment with allopurinol. RESULTS: Subjects at higher tertiles of serum UA presented higher levels of hsCRP and increased serum and mRNA expression levels of both cytokines (P < 0.001). UA levels constituted an independent predictor of increased levels of inflammatory parameters in multiple regression models (P < 0.001) and a risk factor for the presence of a subclinical inflammation in multivariate logistic regression (P < 0.001). Allopurinol reduced UA and serum and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between the variations in serum UA and the variations in serum TNF-&#945; (P < 0.01) and IL-6 (P < 0.05), and mRNA expression of these cytokines (P < 0.05). This association remained significant and independent (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: In subjects with AHU, serum UA may be an inductor of subclinical inflammation. Therapeutic reduction of serum UA was associated with a modulation of the inflammatory profile.","Luis-Rodríguez, Desirée; Donate-Correa, Javier; Martín-Núñez, Ernesto; Ferri, Carla; Tagua, Víctor G; Pérez Castro, Atteneri; Mora-Fernández, Carmen; Navarro-González, Juan F",Rheumatology (Oxford),376,12

Such symbiosis occurs only in a clade of angiosperms known as the nitrogen-fixing clade (NFC). It has long been proposed that root nodule symbiosis evolved several times (in parallel) in the NFC. Two recent phylogenomic studies compared the genomes of nodulating and related non-nodulating species across the four orders of the NFC and found that genes essential for nodule formation are lost or pseudogenized in the non-nodulating species. As these symbiosis genes are specifically involved in the symbiotic interaction, it means that the presence of pseudogenes and the loss of symbiosis genes strongly suggest that their ancestor, which still had functional genes, most likely had a symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These findings agree with the hypothesis that nodulation evolved once at the common ancestor of the NFC, and challenge the hypothesis of parallel evolution. In this chapter, we will cover the current understandings on actinorhizal-type and legume nodule development, and discuss the evolution of the legume nodule type.","Shen, Defeng; Bisseling, Ton",Results Probl Cell Differ,376,1

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis code for COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1) from 1 April to 31 October 2020 were identified in the Premier Healthcare COVID-19 Database. Patient demographics, hospitalization characteristics, and concomitant medical conditions were assessed. Hospital length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, hospital charges, and hospital costs were evaluated overall and stratified by age groups, insurance types, and 4 COVID-19 disease progression states based on intensive care unit (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) usage. RESULTS: Of the 173,942 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 63 years, 51.0% were male, and 48.5% were covered by Medicare. The most prevalent concomitant medical conditions were cardiovascular disease (73.5%), hypertension (64.8%), diabetes (40.7%), obesity (27.0%), and chronic kidney disease (24.2%). Approximately one-fifth (21.9%) of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU and 16.9% received IMV; most patients (73.6%) did not require ICU admission or IMV, and 12.4% required both. The median hospital LOS was 5 days, in-hospital mortality was 13.6%, median hospital charges were $43,986, and median hospital costs were $12,046. Hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality increased with ICU and/or IMV usage and age; hospital charges and costs increased with ICU and/or IMV usage. Patients with both ICU and IMV usage had the longest median hospital LOS (15 days), highest in-hospital mortality (53.8%), and highest hospital charges ($198,394) and hospital costs ($54,402). LIMITATIONS: This retrospective administrative database analysis relied on coding accuracy and a subset of admissions with validated/reconciled hospital costs. CONCLUSIONS: This study summarizes the severe health outcomes and substantial hospital costs of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the US. The findings support the urgent need for rapid implementation of effective interventions, including safe and efficacious vaccines.","Di Fusco, Manuela; Shea, Kimberly M; Lin, Jay; Nguyen, Jennifer L; Angulo, Frederick J; Benigno, Michael; Malhotra, Deepa; Emir, Birol; Sung, Anita H; Hammond, Jennifer L; Stoychev, Sophia; Charos, Apostolos",J Med Econ,376,1

It is well known that personality plays a role in lifestyle behaviors such that certain traits predict health and well-being. The present study examined the relationship between grit and lifestyle behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and initial lockdowns in the United States. It was hypothesized that those with more grit would engage in healthier lifestyle behaviors of increased physical activity, less sedentary time, and better eating habits. Using an internet-based survey, data was collected from adults from April 13th to May 4th, 2020. Survey questions focused on demographics, grit, physical activity and sedentary time, and dietary habits. Associations between grit and lifestyle were examined using a combination of hierarchical multiple regression analyses and ANCOVAs. The sample of 888 adults (age: 34.8±14.0) was 74.2% female. Those with higher grit were more physically active, reported less sedentary time, and practiced better dietary habits. Collectively, these findings suggest that grit may help individuals lead a healthier lifestyle during stressful or negative events such as a global pandemic. Future work should examine the role of grit on lifestyle behaviors as the quarantine continues.","Totosy de Zepetnek, J O; Martin, J; Cortes, N; Caswell, S; Boolani, A",Pers Individ Dif,376,16

By pooling data from multiple studies that are similar, we can increase the ability to achieve sufficient power to determine effectiveness more quickly through meta-analysis. A scoping review of registered clinical trials using cell-based interventions for COVID-19 was conducted to identify candidate studies for meta-analysis that could support an accelerated regulatory review. ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched April 23, 2020. Trials were included if they utilized cell or cell-derived products to treat or prevent COVID-19. Fifty-four registered cellular therapy trials were identified and included for analysis. Studies of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs; 41 studies; 1129 subjects projected to receive cells) and natural killer (NK) cells (5 studies; 135 projected to received cells) were observed most commonly. A subset of studies are controlled (34 studies, or 63%), including 27 studies of MSCs and 3 of NK cells. While heterogeneity in study design exists, the cumulative projected enrolment of patients from similar studies appears sufficient to allow the detection of meaningful differences in clinically important outcomes such as mortality, admission to intensive care and need for mechanical ventilation by September 2020-sooner than any individual study could determine effectiveness. MSCs are the predominant cell type in registered trials for severe or critical COVID-19 and represent the most promising candidates for future meta-analysis. Sufficient pooled sample size to detect clinically important reductions in multiple outcomes, including mortality, is anticipated by September 2020, but may require accessing supplementary data to align outcome reporting. Regulatory approval, funding and implementation by cell manufacturing partners will be accelerated by our framework for rapid meta-analysis.","Liao, Gary; Zheng, Katina; Lalu, Manoj M; Fergusson, Dean A; Allan, David S",Transfus Med Rev,376,16

While the majority of WT is sporadic in origin, germline intragenic mutations of predisposition genes such as WT1, REST and TRIM28 have been described in apparently isolated (non-familial) WT.Despite constitutional CNVs being a well-studied cause of developmental disorders, their role in cancer predisposition is less well defined, so that the interpretation of cancer risks associated with specific CNVs can be complex. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the role of a constitutional deletion CNV (delCNV) encompassing the REST tumour suppressor gene in diffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis (HPLN). METHODS/RESULTS: Array comparative genomic hybridisation in an infant presenting with apparently sporadic diffuse HPLN revealed a de novo germline CNV, arr[GRCh37] 4q12(57,385,330-57,947,405)x1. The REST tumour suppressor gene is located at GRCh37 chr4:57,774,042-57,802,010. CONCLUSION: This delCNV encompassing REST is associated with nephroblastomatosis. Deletion studies should be included in the molecular work-up of inherited predisposition to WT/nephroblastomatosis. Detection of delCNVs involving known cancer predisposition genes can yield insights into the relationship between underlying genomic architecture and associated tumour risk.","Hyder, Zerin; Fairclough, Adele; Groom, Mike; Getty, Joan; Alexander, Elizabeth; van Veen, Elke M; Makin, Guy; Sethuraman, Chitra; Tang, Vivian; Evans, D Gareth; Maher, Eamonn R; Woodward, Emma R",J. medical. genet,376,24

METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 136 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. The serum ACE activity was measured at baseline and during the recovery phase, and its relationship with clinical condition was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 136 patients with confirmed COVID-19, the 16 severe patients were older and had a higher body mass index (BMI) and proportion of hypertension than the 120 nonsevere patients. In comparison to those of normal controls, the baseline serum ACE activities of subjects in the severe group and nonsevere group were decreased, with the lowest level in the severe group. However, the serum ACE activity increased in the recovery phase, and there were no significant differences among the severe group, nonsevere group and normal control group. CONCLUSION: Serum ACE activity could be used as a marker to reflect the clinical condition of COVID-19 since low activity was associated with the severity of COVID-19 at baseline, and the activity increased with the remission of the disease.","Zhu, Zhe; Cai, Ting; Fan, Lingyan; Lou, Kehong; Hua, Xin; Huang, Zuoan; Gao, Guosheng",BMC Infect Dis,376,1

We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple mobility trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data from Descartes Labs, and 4) Twitter mobility calculated via weighted distance. We further design a Responsive Index (RI) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the RI between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearson r coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The positive correlation between RI and income at the county level is significant in all mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in RI between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that cross-compares multi-source mobility datasets.

For this goal, teachers are tasked with the complex responsibility of supporting students in understanding not only the conceptual knowledge of science, but also its disciplinary practices, norms, and epistemologies. In order for teachers to teach in such ways, they must be afforded opportunities to develop and reflect on their own disciplinary understandings about science. Research Experiences for Teachers’ (RETs) programs, in which teachers engage in research with scientists, may be fertile contexts for the development of teachers’ robust understandings about science. As such, the purpose of this naturalistic single-case study is to explore the ways in which one elementary teacher (Ava) describes shifts in her disciplinary understandings about science after participating in a 6-week summer Research Experience for Teachers’ program. Through examination of interviews and observations, this study takes a critical event narrative analysis approach to unpack the ways in which Ava interprets certain disciplinary understandings about science in light of events during her research experience that to her had lasting and important impact on her understandings of science.

It is imperative to have sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 to manage patients in the dental operatory. AIM: To assess the knowledge and perceptions of dentists from different specialities about COVID-19 disease. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a descriptive cross-sectional study design with a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included three sets of 23 questions [Demographic-4; Source of information-1; Knowledge-10 and Perceptions-8]. The comparison of mean scores of knowledge and perceptions were interpreted based on the occupation of dental specialists. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The association between demographic variables and dental specialists’ knowledge and perception scores was carried out using SPSS (Version IBM 21.0, NY, USA). RESULTS: A total of 429 dentists from various specialties participated in the present study. The study had obtained a overall good knowledge score (92.7%) with a mean value of 8.86 + 0.22, and a perception score (70.7%) with a mean value of 5.4+0.3. The present study reports a statistically significant difference between age (p=0.03) and knowledge source (p<0.05). The multi variate regression analysis showed that dentists’ specialty had no significant effect on knowledge and perception. CONCLUSION: The study reports sufficient knowledge and perception scores.

Median time with symptoms before RDSV treatment was 5 days (IQR: 3–6) and the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR: 7–15); 19 patients (10.3%) died after a median stay of 13.5 days (IQR: 9.7–24 days), 58 patients (12.9%) were admitted to ICU, 58 (31.4%) needed higher levels of oxygen support, 0.5% abandoned the treatment due to adverse effects, and there were no readmissions. The only mortality-related factor was the need for higher levels of oxygen support (odds ratio 12.02; 95% confidence interval 2.25–64.2). All studied patients were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and in respiratory failure, needing initial low-flow oxygen support, and all received RDSV within 1 week of symptom onset. The percent mortality was lower in these patients than was observed in all patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to our center (10.3% vs 20.3%, respectively).

Conventional methods for inferring FOI estimate a time‐averaged value and are based on population‐level processes. Because many pathogens exhibit epidemic cycling and FOI is the result of processes acting across the scales of individuals and populations, a flexible framework that extends to epidemic dynamics and links within‐host processes to FOI is needed. Specifically, within‐host antibody kinetics in wildlife hosts can be short‐lived and produce patterns that are repeatable across individuals, suggesting individual‐level antibody concentrations could be used to infer time since infection and hence FOI. Using simulations and case studies (influenza A in lesser snow geese and Yersinia pestis in coyotes), we argue that with careful experimental and surveillance design, the population‐level FOI signal can be recovered from individual‐level antibody kinetics, despite substantial individual‐level variation. In addition to improving inference, the cross‐scale quantitative antibody approach we describe can reveal insights into drivers of individual‐based variation in disease response, and the role of poorly understood processes such as secondary infections, in population‐level dynamics of disease.","Pepin, Kim M.; Kay, Shannon L.; Golas, Ben D.; Shriner, Susan S.; Gilbert, Amy T.; Miller, Ryan S.; Graham, Andrea L.; Riley, Steven; Cross, Paul C.; Samuel, Michael D.; Hooten, Mevin B.; Hoeting, Jennifer A.; Lloyd‐Smith, James O.; Webb, Colleen T.; Buhnerkempe, Michael G.",Ecol Lett,376,16

METHODS: Prospective data was collected for patients receiving open and endovascular thoracic aortovascular intervention over two-time points; January-May 2020 and January-May 2019 at three tertiary cardiovascular centres. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk and COVID-19 screening results were noted. Primary outcomes were median length of intensive care unit and hospital stay, intra-operative mortality, 30-day mortality, post-operative stroke, and spinal cord injury. RESULTS: Patients operated in 2020 (41) had significantly higher median EuroSCORE II than 2019 (53) (7.44 vs. 5.86, P = 0.032) and rates of previous cardiac (19.5% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.019), aortic (14.6% vs. 1.9%, P = 0.041), and endovascular (22.0% vs. 3.8%, P = 0.009) intervention.

There were no significant differences (P ≥ 0.05) in 30-day mortality (4.9% vs. 13.2%), median intensive care unit length of stay (72 vs. 70 hr), median hospital length of stay (8 vs. 9 days), post-operative stroke (3 vs. 6), or spinal cord injury (2 vs. 1) between 2020 and 2019 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the increased mortality risk of patients and urgency of cases during COVID-19, complicated by the introduction of cohorting and screening regimens, thoracic aortovascular intervention remained safe with comparable in outcomes to pre-COVID-19.","McPherson, Iain; Chilvers, Nicholas; Freystaetter, Kathrin; Sivaharan, Ashwin; Kanani, Mazyar; Williams, Robin; McCaslin, James; Nandhra, Sandip; Booth, Karen",Ann Vasc Surg,376,1

Anti-P2 antibodies and the sera from SARS patients could specifically detect the recombinant SARS protein 3a expressed in Escherichia coli and in Vero E6 cells. Expression of SARS protein 3a was detected at 8–12 h after infection and reached a higher level after ∼24 h in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Protein 3a was also detected in the alveolar lining pneumocytes and some intra-alveolar cells of a SARS-CoV-infected patient's lung specimen. Recombinant protein 3a expressed in Vero E6 cells and protein 3a in the SARS-CoV-infected cells was distributed over the cytoplasm in a fine punctate pattern with partly concentrated staining in the Golgi apparatus.

Procalcitonin testing may help identify patients for whom antibiotics should be prescribed or withheld. This study describes the use of procalcitonin in English and Welsh hospitals during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based survey of antimicrobial leads gathered data about the use of procalcitonin testing. Responses were received from 148/151 (98%) eligible hospitals. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was widespread introduction and expansion of PCT use in NHS hospitals. The number of hospitals using PCT in emergency/acute admissions rose from 17 (11%) to 74/146 (50.7%) and use in Intensive Care Units (ICU) increased from 70 (47.6%) to 124/147 (84.4%). This increase happened predominantly in March and April 2020, preceding NICE guidance. Approximately half of hospitals used PCT as a single test to guide decisions to discontinue antibiotics and half used repeated measurements. There was marked variation in the thresholds used for empiric antibiotic cessation and guidance about interpretation of values. Procalcitonin testing has been widely adopted in the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic in an unevidenced, heterogeneous way and in conflict with relevant NICE guidance. Further research is needed urgently that assesses the impact of this change on antibiotic prescribing and patient safety.","Powell, Neil; Howard, Philip; Llewelyn, Martin J.; Szakmany, Tamas; Albur, Mahableswhar; Bond, Stuart E; Euden, Joanne; Brookes-Howell, Lucy; Dark, Paul; Hellyer, Thomas P; Hopkins, Susan; McCullagh, Iain J; Ogden, Margaret; Pallmann, Philip; Parsons, Helena; Partridge, David G; Shaw, Dominick E.; Shinkins, Bethany; Todd, Stacy; Thomas-Jones, Emma; West, Robert; Carrol, Enitan D; Sandoe, Jonathan A.

The benefit of critical care in these patients remains unclear. We compared outcomes in elderly versus very elderly subjects receiving mechanical ventilation. METHODS: In total, 5,557 mechanically ventilated subjects were included in our post hoc retrospective analysis, a subgroup of the VENTILA study. We divided the cohort into 2 subgroups on the basis of age: very elderly subjects (age ≥ 80 y; n = 1,430), and elderly subjects (age 65-79 y; n = 4,127). A propensity score on being very elderly was calculated. Evaluation of associations with 28-d mortality was done with logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Very elderly subjects were clinically sicker as expressed by higher SAPS II scores (53 ± 18 vs 50 ± 18, P < .001), and their rates of plateau pressure < 30 cm H2O were higher, whereas other parameters did not differ. The 28-d mortality was higher in very elderly subjects (42% vs 34%, P < .001) and remained unchanged after propensity score adjustment (adjusted odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI 1.16-1.49], P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Age was an independent and unchangeable risk factor for death in mechanically ventilated subjects. However, survival rates of very elderly subjects were > 50%.

METHODS: COVID-19 deaths were identified from death certificates. Age-adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) were compared across race/ethnicity. Proportionate mortality rates (PMR) were compared across race/ethnicity and by ethnicity/nativity. RESULTS: We identified 10,200 COVID-19 deaths in CA occurring February 1 through July 31, 2020. The most frequently observed characteristics among decedents were age 65 years or above, male, Hispanic, foreign-born, and educational attainment of High School or below. MRR indicated elevated COVID-19 morality rates among Asian/Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic groups compared with the White group, with Black and Hispanic groups having the highest MRR at 2.75 (95%CI: 2.54–2.97) and 4.18 (95%CI: 3.99–4.37), respectively. Disparities were larger at younger ages. Similar results were observed with PMR, and patterns of age-racial/ethnic disparities remained in analyses stratified by education. Elevated PMR were observed in all ethnicity/nativity groups, especially foreign-born Hispanic individuals, relative to U.S.-born non-Hispanic individuals. These were generally larger at younger ages and persisted after stratifying by education. CONCLUSIONS: Differential COVID-19 mortality was observed in California across racial/ethnic groups and by ethnicity/nativity groups with evidence of greater disparities among younger age groups.

Highly sensitive laboratory techniques played a critical role in clinical COVID-19 diagnosis and management. In this study the feasibility of using a new digital PCR-based detection assay for clinical COVID-19 diagnosis was investigated by comparing its performance with that of RT-PCR. Clinical patient samples and samples obtained from potentially contaminated environments were analyzed. The study included 10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, 32 validated samples of various types derived from different clinical timepoints and sites, and 148 environmentally derived samples. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were more readily detected in respiratory tract samples (35.0%). In analyses of environmentally derived samples, the positivity rate of air samples was higher than that of surface samples, probably due to differences in virus concentrations. Digital PCR detected SARS–CoV–2 in several samples that had previously been deemed negative, including 3 patient-derived samples and 5 environmentally derived samples. In this study digital PCR exhibited higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, suggesting that it may be a useful new method for clinical SARS-CoV-2 detection. Improvement of SARS-CoV-2 detection would substantially reduce the rates of false-negative COVID-19 test results, in particular those pertaining to asymptomatic carriers.","Jiang, Yanfang; Wang, Haifeng; Hao, Sijia; Chen, Yukun; He, Jiaxue; Liu, Yong; Chen, Liguo; Yu, Yuanhua; Hua, Shucheng",Clin Chim Acta,376,21

In this study, mefloquine was administered orally to seven clinically healthy cats twice weekly for four doses and mefloquine concentrations in blood were measured to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile—the movement of drug in the body. The maximum blood concentration of mefloquine was 2.71 ug/mL and was reached 15 h after a single oral dose was administered. Mefloquine side effects included vomiting following administration without food in some cats, and mild increases in symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), an early kidney biomarker. This study provides valuable information on mefloquine’s profile in cats as an introductory step towards investigating it as a potential treatment for feline coronavirus and feline calicivirus infection in cats. ABSTRACT: The pharmacokinetic profile of mefloquine was investigated as a preliminary study towards a potential treatment for feline coronavirus infections (such as feline infectious peritonitis) or feline calicivirus infections. Mefloquine was administered at 62.5 mg orally to seven clinically healthy cats twice weekly for four doses and mefloquine plasma concentrations over 336 h were measured using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after a single oral dose of mefloquine was 2.71 ug/mL and time to reach Cmax (Tmax) was 15 h. The elimination half-life was 224 h. The plasma concentration reached a higher level at 4.06 ug/mL when mefloquine was administered with food. Adverse effects of dosing included vomiting following administration without food in some cats. Mild increases in serum symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), but not creatinine, concentrations were observed. Mefloquine may provide a safe effective treatment for feline coronavirus and feline calicivirus infections in cats.","Yu, Jane; Kimble, Benjamin; Norris, Jacqueline M.; Govendir, Merran",Animals (Basel),376,23

Data were obtained from two waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) conducted in March (wave 1) and May to June of 2020 (wave 2) (n = 4445); UAS is a nationally representative panel of US adults. We conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) using wave 2 data to identify our outcome, patterns of 10 COVID-preventive behaviors (e.g., wearing a facemask, handwashing, social distancing), and then used a three-step regression (R3STEP) to test associations between the likelihood of class membership with (1) health beliefs and sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational attainment) in bivariate models and (2) health beliefs adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics in multivariate models. The LCA identified a three-class model of preventive behaviors characterized by high likelihood of engagement in the set of preventive behaviors (“high”), low likelihood of the preventive behaviors (“low”), or engagement in some behaviors (“mixed”). Respondents of older age (i.e., age 50 or older) and those with higher levels of educational attainment (i.e., a 4-year college degree or higher) were less likely to be in the low engagement versus the mixed engagement class compared to those who are younger (18–29) and have lower levels of educational attainment (i.e., high school), respectively. Women (compared to men) and respondents who were Black and/or Hispanic/Latinx (compared to White) were more likely to be in the high (vs. mixed) engagement class. In separate models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, respondents with a high perceived risk of infection, high perceived risk of death, and high perceived effectiveness of COVID-preventive behaviors were statistically significantly less likely to be in the low engagement relative to the mixed engagement class. Engagement in COVID-preventive behaviors varies by sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex, race/ethnicity and educational attainment) and health beliefs (i.e., perceived risk of infection, perceived risk of death, and perceived effectiveness of CDC-recommended behaviors). Our findings highlight the potential utility of using health beliefs to inform targeted prevention efforts to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Smail, Emily; Schneider, Kristin E.; DeLong, Stephanie M.; Willis, Kalai; Arrington-Sanders, Renata; Yang, Cui; Alexander, Kamila A.; Johnson, Renee M.",Prev Sci,376,5

In Italy, HCWs have been among the first exposed to unprecedented pressure, dealing with large numbers of infections during the first pandemic wave. However, the severe psychological consequences on HCWs find little evidence in the literature, especially in terms of comparison to the status quo ante pandemic. The aim of this study was to provide an assessment of the mental health burden in a cohort of Italian HCWs during the COVID‐19 pandemic, comparing their condition with that before the emergency, to direct the promotion of mental well‐being among HCWs worldwide. In this retrospective study, we included physicians, physical therapists, and nurses working in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit, Neurology Unit, and Rehabilitation Unit from a Southern Italy University Hospital. All study participants underwent a battery of psychological tests, aimed at verifying their state of mental health during the COVID‐19 emergency and before it. Depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms were assessed using the following questionnaires: Maslach Burnout Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9), and General Anxiety Disorder‐7. Depressive, anxiety, and burnout clinical relevance symptoms were present in HCWs during the COVID‐19 pandemic more than those before the emergency. Fifty percent of the HCWs obtained a score clinically significant during the emergency. Moreover, a depersonalization factor showed a statistically significant increase in average scores (p < 0.0001). The PHQ‐9 scale showed that 47.1% of the operators reported depressive state presence. The number of operators scoring above the cut‐off for the anxiety scale tripled during the emergency (p < 0.0001). The female gender conferred greater risks for depression. Taken together, the findings of this study showed that our sample of Italian HCWs showed a greater risk for depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID‐19 pandemic. These data might be a starting point to plan mental health monitoring and prevention programs for HCWs, thus ensuring patients receive the best possible care performances even during healthcare crises such as the current pandemic.","Farì, Giacomo; de Sire, Alessandro; Giorgio, Vincenzo; Rizzo, Laura; Bruni, Antonella; Bianchi, Francesco P.; Zonno, Alessandra; Pierucci, Paola; Ranieri, Maurizio; Megna, Marisa",J Med Virol,376,13

The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability and validity properties of the Turkish version of the PCFS in Turkish post-COVID-19 patients with hospitalized and non-hospitalized during infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred participants with post-COVID-19 were included in this cross-sectional study. Test-retest reliability of the Turkish version of PCFS assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach?s alpha was calculated for internal consistency. For construct validity, correlation coefficients between the Turkish version of PCFS developed by translation-back translation method and Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (MMRC), London Chest Activities of Daily Living Scale (LCADL), Barthel Index (BI) were analyzed. RESULTS For test-retest reliability analysis, ICC ranged between 0.734 and 0.880. The total ICC score was 0.821, indicating excellent reliability. The Cronbach?s alpha value of the PCFS test and retest scores were recorded as 0.821 indicating that the scale is quite reliable. The PCFS score was moderately correlated with the MMRC score (r=0.534, p<0.001) and weakly correlated with the LCADL self care (r=0.311, p=0.002), domestic (r=0.277, p=0.005), physical activity (r=0.342, p<0.001), leisure subscores (r=0.434, p<0.001) and total score (r=0.399, p<0.001). CONCLUSION The Turkish version of the the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status Scale (PCFS) is reliable scale that reflects activity limitation and functional status after COVID-19. The Turkish version of the PCFS will be a guide for rehabilitation professionals to understand functional limitation after COVID-19 and to direct interventions accordingly to functional status of the patients at discharge and in long term.","Çalik Kütükcü, Ebru; Çakmak, Aslihan; Kinaci, Esra; Uyaroğlu, Oğuz Abdullah; Vardar Yağli, Naciye; Sain Güven, Gülay; Sağlam, Melda; Özişik, Lale; Çalik Başaran, Nursel; Inal Ince, Deniz",Turkish journal of medical sciences,376,33

The cytokine storm and viral evasion of cellular immune responses may play an equally important role in the pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and outcomes of COVID-19. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers are elevated as the disease progresses towards its advanced stages, and correlate with worse chances of survival. Immune modulators have the potential to inhibit cytokines and treat the cytokine storm. A literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted through 8 July 2020 using the search terms ‘coronavirus’, ‘immunology’, ‘cytokine storm’, ‘immunomodulators’, ‘pharmacology’, ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome 2’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, and ‘COVID-19’. Specific immune modulators include anti-cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 receptor antagonists (e.g. anakinra, tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g. baricitinib, ruxolitinib), anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (e.g. adalimumab, infliximab), granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factors (e.g. gimsilumab, lenzilumab, namilumab), and convalescent plasma, with promising to negative trials and other data. Non-specific immune modulators include human immunoglobulin, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, interferons, statins, angiotensin pathway modulators, macrolides (e.g. azithromycin, clarithromycin), hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, colchicine, and prostaglandin D2 modulators such as ramatroban. Dexamethasone 6 mg once daily (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for 10 days may result in a reduction in mortality in COVID-19 patients by one-third for patients on ventilators, and by one-fifth for those receiving oxygen. Research efforts should focus not only on the most relevant immunomodulatory strategies but also on the optimal timing of such interventions to maximize therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we discuss the potential role and safety of these agents in the management of severe COVID-19, and their impact on survival and clinical symptoms.","Rizk, John G.; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Mehra, Mandeep R.; Lavie, Carl J.; Rizk, Youssef; Forthal, Donald N.",Drugs,376,16

In Aotearoa New Zealand, there are long-standing ethnic inequalities in cervical-cancer screening, incidence, and mortality, particularly for indigenous Māori women, as well as Pacific and Asian women. METHODS: We invited never- and markedly under-screened (≥5 years overdue) 30-69-year-old Māori, Pacific, and Asian women to participate in an open-label, three-arm, community-based, randomised controlled trial, with a nested sub-study. We aimed to assess whether two specific invitation methods for self-sampling improved screening participation over usual care among the least medically served populations. Women were individually randomised 3:3:1 to: clinic-based self-sampling (CLINIC – invited to take a self-sample at their usual general practice); home-based self-sampling (HOME – mailed a kit and invited to take a self-sample at home); and usual care (USUAL – invited to attend a clinic for collection of a standard cytology sample). Neither participants nor research staff could be blinded to the intervention. In a subset of general practices, women who did not participate within three months of invitation were opportunistically invited to take a self-sample, either next time they attended a clinic or by mail. FINDINGS: We randomised 3,553 women: 1,574 to CLINIC, 1,467 to HOME, and 512 to USUAL. Participation was highest in HOME (14.6% among Māori, 8.8% among Pacific, and 18.5% among Asian) with CLINIC (7.0%, 5.3% and 6.9%, respectively) and USUAL (2.0%, 1.7% and 4.5%, respectively) being lower. In fully adjusted models, participation was statistically significantly more likely in HOME than USUAL: Māori OR=9.7, (95%CI 3.0-31.5); Pacific OR=6.0 (1.8-19.5); and Asian OR=5.1 (2.4-10.9). There were no adverse outcomes reported. After three months, 2,780 non-responding women were invited to participate in a non-randomised, opportunistic, follow-on substudy. After 6 months,192 (6.9%) additional women had taken a self-sample. INTERPRETATION: Using recruitment methods that mimic usual practice, we provide critical evidence that self-sampling increases screening among the groups of women (never and under-screened) who experience the most barriers in Aotearoa New Zealand, although the absolute level of participation through this population approach was modest. Follow-up for most women was routine but a small proportion required intensive support.

The objective of this research is to design and develop a deep learning-based multi-modal for the screening of COVID-19 using chest radiographs and genomic sequences. The modal is also effective in finding the degree of genomic similarity among the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 and other prevalent viruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, and Human T-cell Leukaemia Virus. The experimental results on the datasets available at National Centre for Biotechnology Information, GitHub, and Kaggle repositories show that it is successful in detecting the genome of ‘SARS-CoV-2’ in the host genome with an accuracy of 99.27% and screening of chest radiographs into COVID-19, non-COVID pneumonia and healthy with a sensitivity of 95.47%. Thus, it may prove a useful tool for doctors to quickly classify the infected and non-infected genomes. It can also be useful in finding the most effective drug from the available drugs for the treatment of ‘COVID-19’.","Rani, Geeta; Oza, Meet Ganpatlal; Dhaka, Vijaypal Singh; Pradhan, Nitesh; Verma, Sahil; Rodrigues, Joel J.

Especially the fact that university students take their lessons with e-learning in times of crisis (COVID-19 pandemic) has forced them to spend more time with the computer. This situation will also affect their academic motivation. This research aimed to test whether the fear of contracting COVID-19 (CoVFC) had a moderating effect on the prediction of preservice teachers’ academic motivation (AMOTV) with their computer self-efficacy perceptions (CSE). With a combined approach, a single model was employed to test the moderating role of CoVFC and the mediating role of Attitudes towards E-Learning (ATEL) in the prediction of preservice teachers’ AMOTV with their CSE. 522 preservice teachers from 21 different branches participated in this research. As a result of the research, the CSE of preservice teachers were determined to predict their AMOTV significantly and positively. The increase in CoVFC was found to have a negative moderating effect on the prediction of AMOTV with the CSE of preservice teachers. Also, ATEL was found to have a partial mediating effect in the relationship between the CSE and AMOTV of preservice teachers.","Çevik, Mustafa; Bakioğlu, Büşra",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),376,26

Cancer patients are a very special population in this setting since they are more susceptible to viral infections than the general population. Several recommendations have been made on this issue, most of them based on expert opinion and institutional experience. It is essential to gather the evidence available for decision making. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence available in order to create a multi-institutional position from the perspective of scientific societies in Argentina involved in the management of cancer patients. METHODOLOGY: The review included two phases: 1) search and systematic revision of the medical literature; 2) consensus and revision of the document drafted by national scientific societies involved in the management and care of cancer patients using the modified Delphi method. The final results were presented at a videoconference with all the participants. Also, additional comment and recommendations were discussed. The final document was revised and approved for publication by the members of the panel. RESULTS: The consensus panel included 18 representatives from scientific societies from Argentina who assessed the evidence and then made recommendations for the management of cancer patients in our country. International guidelines (CDC; ASCO, NCCN and ESMO) were considered as a background for analysis, as well as institutional guidelines and an open ad hoc survey administered to 114 healthcare professionals from the scientific societies involved in this study. The recommendations are grouped as follows: 1) general care interventions—training of the personnel, cleaning and disinfection of the hospital premises and patient scheduling; 2) treatment decisions—patient care, surgeries, immunosuppressive therapy, radiotherapy and screening; 3) ethical considerations—optimisation of resources, end-of-life care for critically-ill patients; 4) management of hospitalised patients; and 5) wellbeing of the healthcare team. The general recommendation arising from the study is that the management of cancer patients must adapt to the exceptional pandemic status quo without disregarding treatment or cure options. Moreover, healthcare professional accompaniment of all patients should not be neglected. All healthcare professionals must make a significant joint effort to create multidisciplinary teams to discuss the most appropriate measures for each particular situation. CONCLUSIONS: The scientific evidence available on this topic worldwide is in progress. This together with the epidemiologically shifting scenario poses unprecedented challenges in the management of cancer amidst this global pandemic. Furthermore, the key role of the healthcare structural organisation appears evident, such as the drafting of clear guidelines for all the stakeholders, adaptability to constant change and an interdisciplinary shared vision through consensus to provide adequate care to our cancer patients in the light of uncertainty and fast-paced change.","Ismael, Julia; Losco, Federico; Quildrian, Sergio; Sanchez, Pablo; Pincemin, Isabel; Lastiri, Jose; Bella, Santiago; Chinellato, Alejandro; Dellamea, Guillermo; Ahualli, Alejandro; Rompato, Silvana; Velez, Julio; Escobar, Rafael; Zwenger, Ariel; Rosales, Cristina; Bagnes, Claudia; Puyol, Jorge; Niewiadomski, Dario; Smecuol, Edgardo; Nachman, Fabio; Gonzalez, Eduardo; Ferraris, Gustavo; Suppicich, Juan Ramos; Price, Paola; Medina, Luis; O’Connor, Juan",Ecancermedicalscience,376,16

Our objective is to prioritize repurposable drugs using a drug repurposing pipeline that systematically integrates multiple SARS-CoV-2 and drug interactions, deep graph neural networks, and in-vitro/population-based validations. We first collected all the available drugs (n= 3,635) involved in COVID-19 patient treatment through CTDbase. We built a SARS-CoV-2 knowledge graph based on the interactions among virus baits, host genes, pathways, drugs, and phenotypes. A deep graph neural network approach was used to derive the candidate drugâ€™s representation based on the biological interactions. We prioritized the candidate drugs using clinical trial history, and then validated them with their genetic profiles, in vitro experimental efficacy, and electronic health records. We highlight the top 22 drugs including Azithromycin, Atorvastatin, Aspirin, Acetaminophen, and Albuterol. We further pinpointed drug combinations that may synergistically target COVID-19.

However, no special therapeutic drugs have been identified for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to search for drugs to effectively treat COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a total of 162 adult inpatients (≥18 years old) from Ruijin Hospital (Shanghai, China) and Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) between January 27, 2020, and March 10, 2020. The enrolled COVID-19 patients were first divided into the Lianhuaqingwen (LHQW) monotherapy group and the LHQW + Arbidol combination therapy group. Then, these two groups were further classified into moderate and severe groups according to the clinical classification of COVID-19. RESULTS: The early combined usage of LHQW and Arbidol can significantly accelerate the recovery of patients with moderate COVID-19 by reducing the time to conversion to nucleic acid negativity, the time to chest CT improvement, and the length of hospital stay. However, no benefit was observed in severe COVID-19 patients treated with the combination of LHQW + Arbidol. In this study, both Arbidol and LHQW were well tolerated without serious drug-associated adverse events. CONCLUSION: The early combined usage of LHQW and Arbidol may accelerate recovery and improve the prognosis of patients with moderate COVID-19.","Fang, Jie; Li, Hui; Du, Wei; Yu, Ping; Guan, Ying-Yun; Ma, Shi-Yu; Liu, Dong; Chen, Wei; Shi, Guo-Chao; Bian, Xiao-Lan",Front Pharmacol,376,20

For each of the immune biomarkers, the mean, standard deviation and number of subjects were extracted for both the HS treated and untreated group. These values were used in the computation of standardized mean difference (SMD). Statistical analysis and forest plot were done with R statistical software (version 3.6.1). Twenty seven (27) studies met the eligibility criteria. Twenty two (22) of the studies were used for the meta-analysis which included a total of 1211 subjects.

We assessed the short-term mortality effects of daily loss of visibility. During 1996–2006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5 km decrease in visibility at lag 0–1 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1.76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over. The estimated ER% for daily mortality derived from both visibility and air pollutant data were comparable in terms of magnitude, lag pattern, and exposure–response relationships especially when using particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm to predict the mortality associated with visibility. Visibility provides a useful proxy for the assessment of environmental health risks from ambient air pollutants and a valid approach for the assessment of the public health impacts of air pollution and the benefits of air quality improvement measures in developing countries where pollutant monitoring data are scarce.","Thach, Thuan-Quoc; Wong, Chit-Ming; Chan, King-Pan; Chau, Yuen-Kwan; Chung, Yat-Nork; Ou, Chun-Quan; Yang, Lin; Hedley, Anthony J.",Environ Res,376,1

During this COVID-19 pandemic, several variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have been found. Some of these new variants like the VOC-202012/01 of lineage B.1.1.7 or the most recently B.1.617 emerging in India have a higher infectiousness than those previously prevalent. We propose a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations to investigate potential consequences of the appearance of a new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 strain in a given region. The proposed mathematical model incorporates the presymptomatic and asymptomatic subpopulations in addition to the more usual susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered subpopulations. This is important from a realistic point of view since it has been found recently that presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are relevant spreaders of the SARS-CoV-2. Using the next-generation matrix method, we find the basic reproduction number, [Formula: see text] , an important threshold parameter that provides insight regarding the evolution and outcome of a certain instance of the COVID-19 pandemic. The local and global stability of system equilibria are also presented. In particular, for the global stability we construct a Lyapunov functional and use the LaSalle invariant principle to prove that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. On the other hand, if [Formula: see text] the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Finally, we present numerical simulations to numerically support the analytic results and to show the impact of the introduction of a new more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population.","González-Parra, Gilberto; Arenas, Abraham J.",Comp,376,17

The health effects caused by these adverse macroeconomic conditions will be complex, and will differ across generations, regions and socioeconomic groups. Groups that are vulnerable to poor health are likely to be hit hardest even if the crisis hit all individuals equally, and we already see that some groups such as young workers and women are worse hit by the recession than others. Government policies during and after the pandemic will play an important role in determining the eventual health consequences. This article is protected by copyright.

Although it was detected in veal calves and beef cattle, little is known on the infection impact and on its temporal morbidity pattern in Italian dairy herds. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the involvement of M. bovis on fatal calf pneumonia outbreaks that occurred during 2009–2019 in 64 Italian dairy farms. Furthermore, a deeper diagnostic workup of concurrent infection with other viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens was assessed. Out of the investigated fatal pneumonia cases, M. bovis was frequently detected (animal prevalence, 16.16%; 95%CI, 11.82–21.33; herd prevalence, 26.56; 95%CI, 16.29–39.08) either as the single agent of the disease in more than half of the positive samples (20/37) or in concurrent infections with Histophilus somni (9/37, 24.3%), Mannheimia haemolytica (6/37, 16.621%), Trueperella pyogenes (1/37, 2.70%), Pasteurella multocida (1/37, 2.70%), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (5/37, 13.51%), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (2/37, 5.55%). Based on time-series analysis, M. bovis was recorded in the area since 2009 with outbreaks displaying a clear morbidity seasonal pattern with peaks in April (43.21%) and in September (13.51%). This might be due to the stressing conditions during spring and late summer periods. Results of this study highlight that M. bovis infection warrants consideration, and control measures are needed given its involvement in lethal pneumonia outbreaks in dairy herds from an extended area.","Fanelli, Angela; Cirilli, Margie; Lucente, Maria Stella; Zarea, Aya Attia Koraney; Buonavoglia, Domenico; Tempesta, Maria; Greco, Grazia",Front Vet Sci,376,12

We directly compared matched saliva and NPS specimens from symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19. An enhanced saliva specimen (i.e., strong sniff, elicited cough, and collection of saliva/secretions) was collected without transport medium prior to collection of NPS from 224 patients with symptoms deemed consistent with COVID-19. Both specimens were tested with the CDC 2019 nCoV real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel (4 February 2020 version), with the NPS result used as the reference standard.

METHODS: We developed the COVID-19 Acuity Score (CoVA) based on a single-center study of adult outpatients seen in respiratory illness clinics or the emergency department. Data were extracted from the Partners Enterprise Data Warehouse, and split into development (n = 9381, 7 March–2 May) and prospective (n = 2205, 3–14 May) cohorts. Outcomes were hospitalization, critical illness (intensive care unit or ventilation), or death within 7 days. Calibration was assessed using the expected-to-observed event ratio (E/O). Discrimination was assessed by area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS: In the prospective cohort, 26.1%, 6.3%, and 0.5% of patients experienced hospitalization, critical illness, or death, respectively. CoVA showed excellent performance in prospective validation for hospitalization (expected-to-observed ratio [E/O]: 1.01; AUC: 0.76), for critical illness (E/O: 1.03; AUC: 0.79), and for death (E/O: 1.63; AUC: 0.93).

However, few studies report on the relative perceptions of students about face-to-face (F2F) and blended learning (BL) in periods when Covid-19 is/not a consideration. Using a sample of 103/79 undergraduate students, a mixed-method approach is utilized to report qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding student perceptions. The results demonstrate BL is perceived more positively during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, F2F is preferred to BL when Covid is not an issue. F2F learning is perceived more positively to BL because students feel that there are limitations to BL in terms of; interactions with the lecturer; group work; peer engagement; class involvement; and the ability to ask questions about technical information. Moreover, qualitative evidence shows that students perceive F2F to be superior to BL because social elements expected in a F2F environment may not be embedded into netiquette frameworks. From a policymaking standpoint, we encourage embedding social elements into BL to enhance student experience so that student's negative attitudes regarding the transition from F2F delivery to online/BL can be minimized. From a practical standpoint, we provide insights about strategies to embed socials elements into netiquette frameworks.","Mali, Dafydd; Lim, Hyoungjoo",The International Journal of Management Education,376,21

RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple.

(1986) J. Virol. 57, 328–334). In the present study, the fate of the residual genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was determined. Nearly all of the genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of drug was incorporated into nucleocapsid structures, suggesting that even in the absence of protein synthesis, genomic RNA synthesis and encapsidation are coupled in MHV-infected cells. Sufficient free nucleocapsid N protein was available for this purpose, since the pool of soluble N protein was determined to decay with a half-life of approximately one hour. Negative strand RNA is the template for the synthesis of both genomic and subgenomic positive strand RNA, and would be predicted to accumulate primarily during the early phases of the lytic cycle. In agreement with this prediction, negative strand RNA accumulated during the first 5–6 h of infection, with little additional accumulation occurring over the next 2.5 h. In marked contrast, positive strand RNA increased 5–6-fold over the same 2.5 h period. These results, taken in conjunction with published data, suggest that negative strand RNA is synthesized during the early period of the infectious cycle and is stable in infected cells and also suggest that treatment with cycloheximide at late times does not inhibit positive strand RNA synthesis indirectly by blocking the formation of negative strand templates.","Perlman, Stanley; Ries, Dana; Bolger, Eric; Lung-Ji, Chang; Stoltzfus, C.Martin",Virus Research,376,20

Anticipating the worst from the pandemic, Island and state authorities implemented a series of public health actions to contain the epidemic. This paper, reporting the results of the first wave of a cohort study, documents the measures and their effects through a cohort study. Methods: Measures were documented at the time of implementation. A random sample of 904 residents were selected from the health register, interviewed and tested for COVID-19 (RT-PCR and serology). The survey explored socioeconomic variables and adherence to prevention behaviors. Results: Flights were reduced from 38 to once a week, FNA was closed to tourism, schools were closed, and testing and tracing contacts was mandated along with social distancing and use of masks. A household lockdown was briefly imposed for residents. A prevalence of 5.1% was found, and a total of 158 cases of COVID-19 was estimated, although only 28 had been reported in routine surveillance. Half of the population reported food insecurity and applied for government COVID-19 benefits. Adherence to control measures was high, except for intrahousehold mask use with family and friends. Conclusion: Despite high levels of COVID-19 in Pernambuco, continued exposure through the provision of essential services from the mainland, and lack of direction from national authorities, FNA was able to implement a series of prevention measures unique in Brazil that contained the epidemic on the island.","Sales, M.

METHODS: The number of clinical visits and surgical cases per month for six pediatric surgical specialties (Otolaryngology, Orthopedic Surgery, Urology, Neurosurgery, Plastic Surgery, and General Surgery) for 12 months prior to the pandemic and 12 months following the onset of the pandemic was collected. Poisson regression analysis was performed for the number of visits and cases per season adjusting for specialty, season, staffing changes, and the pandemic to determine adjusted rate ratios (aRR) post-pandemic for the surgical fields compared to Otolaryngology. RESULTS: A percentage decrease in median visits per paired month (-15.63%, IQR = -23.01, -1.66) and operative cases (-19.86%, IQR = -29.39, -10.17) was seen for Pediatric Otolaryngology. Regression analysis showed a significant negative effect on the number of visits (aRR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.70-0.77) and cases (aRR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.60-0.71) due to the pandemic. While many of the other specialties had predicted reductions in volume (notably Orthopedics), they all experienced significant predicted increases in productivity following the pandemic compared to Otolaryngology. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Pediatric Otolaryngology is particularly vulnerable to this change in clinical pattern, which could be due to a decline in community infections from mask wearing and social distancing, and may result in a longer-term volume deficit when compared to other pediatric surgical subspecialties.","Jones, Joel W; D039,; Souza, Jill N; Mantle, Belinda; Joseph, Jonathan M; Arjmand, Ellis M; McMurray, James S",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,376,16

Observed effects on the central nervous system includes neurological symptoms (headache, nausea, dizziness), fatal microclot formation and in rare cases encephalitis. However, our understanding of how the virus causes these mild to severe neurological symptoms and how the cerebral vasculature is impacted remains unclear. Thus, the results presented in this report explored whether deleterious outcomes from the SARS-COV-2 viral spike protein on primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMVECs) could be observed. First, using postmortem brain tissue, we show that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (a known binding target for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), is expressed throughout various caliber vessels in the frontal cortex. Additionally, ACE2 was also detectable in primary human brain microvascular endothelial (hBMVEC) maintained under cell culture conditions. Analysis for cell viability revealed that neither the S1, S2 or a truncated form of the S1 containing only the RBD had minimal effects on hBMVEC viability within a 48hr exposure window. However, when the viral spike proteins were introduced into model systems that recapitulate the essential features of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), breach to the barrier was evident in various degrees depending on the spike protein subunit tested. Key to our findings is the demonstration that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity in an advanced 3D microfluid model of the human BBB, a platform that most closely resembles the human physiological conditions at this CNS interface. Subsequent analysis also showed the ability for SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins to trigger a pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells that may contribute to an altered state of BBB function. Together, these results are the first to show the direct impact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have on brain endothelial cells; thereby offering a plausible explanation for the neurological consequences seen in COVID-19 patients.","Buzhdygan, Tetyana P.; DeOre, Brandon J.; Baldwin-Leclair, Abigail; McGary, Hannah; Razmpour, Roshanak; Galie, Peter A.; Potula, Raghava; Andrews, Allison M.; Ramirez, Servio H.",bioRxiv,376,1

Few population‐based studies of cattle have investigated how the microbiota is impacted during diarrhea. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the fecal microbiota and predict the functional potential of the microbial communities in healthy and diarrheic calves. METHODS: Fifteen diarrheic calves between the ages of 1 and 30 days and 15 age‐matched healthy control calves were enrolled from 2 dairy farms. The Illumina MiSeq sequencer was used for high‐throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (Illumina, San Diego, CA). RESULTS: Significant differences in community membership and structure were identified among healthy calves from different farms. Differences in community membership and structure also were identified between healthy and diarrheic calves within each farm. Based on linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), the genera Bifidobacterium, Megamonas, and a genus of the family Bifidobacteriaceae were associated with health at farm 1, whereas Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis, Dietzia and an unclassified genus of the family Veillonellaceae were significantly associated with health at farm 2. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis indicated that diarrheic calves had decreased abundances of genes responsible for metabolism of various vitamins, amino acids, and carbohydrate. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The fecal microbiota of healthy dairy calves appeared to be farm specific as were the changes observed during diarrhea. The differences in microbiota structure and membership between healthy and diarrheic calves suggest that dysbiosis can occur in diarrheic calves and it is associated with changes in predictive metagenomic function.","Gomez, D.E.; Arroyo, L.G.; Costa, M.C.; Viel, L.; Weese, J.S.",J Vet Intern Med,376,10

Consequently, the winter period commonly associated with epidemic respiratory illnesses shows an increase in the number of blood cultures (BC) and to occasional saturation of automated BC systems. Here, we explored the seasonal variations in BC samples and the potential impact of shortening the incubation time of BC when automated BC systems are close to saturation. A retrospective study was conducted during a 3-year period in 4 hospitals located in the Paris region, France. All aerobic and anaerobic bottles were included, except pediatric bottles and those sampled for suspicion of endocarditis. The number of BC bottles collected during the winter period was compared to the annual baseline. All bottles positive after a 4-day incubation were analyzed regarding clinical and microbiological findings. The number of BC bottles was significantly higher during the winter periods, compared to the annual baseline (up to 14%). A total of 292,349 BC bottles were analyzed with 23,363 (8.0%) positive, including 236 (1%) after a 4-day incubation. Of these 236 bottles, 76 (64.8%) were positive with a contaminant, 78 (33.1%) with a clinically significant microorganism identified for the same patient in the previous 4 days, and only 5 (2.1%) with a clinically significant microorganism not previously identified. Winter periods were associated with a significant increase in BC samples. Shortening the incubation time of BC bottles from 5 to 4 days seems a relevant option when automated BC systems are close to saturation.

However, measures to limit the population health impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic have caused significant disruptions to their lives. The objective of this study was to explore the experiences of young people predominantly living in the south-west of England during the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Rapid qualitative study. METHODS: Following advertisement on social media, a purposive sample of young people by age and gender who had expressed an interest were invited to participate. In June 2020, 21 young people (12–17 years) took part in 18 semi-structured interviews, either through a digital platform or by telephone. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was undertaken, assisted by NVvivo Software. RESULTS: Young people felt the greatest impacts of the pandemic have been disruption to how they learned because of school closures and limited face-to-face interaction with their social networks. There was variation in terms of how satisfied young people were with self-directed learning at home, and some anxieties in relation to its effectiveness outside the school environment. Most young people reported maintaining social relationships remotely, but some young people appeared to have little social interaction outside their household. High levels of adherence to social distancing and handwashing were reported, which could lead to a sense of injustice resulting from visibility of other people breaching social distancing guidance. Young people were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine became available, with the greatest motivator being to protect others above themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Young people have experienced significant disruption to their education and social networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. During lockdown, high levels of compliance to government public health guidelines to reduce transmission of COVID-19 were reported by young people. If an effective vaccine is developed, a schools-based vaccination programme could be an efficient method to interrupt transmission to more at-risk populations and prevent further disruptions to young people's education.","Fisher, Harriet; Lambert, Helen; Hickman, Matthew; Yardley, Lucy; Audrey, Suzanne",Public Health Pract (Oxf),376,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty‐nine paediatric inpatient cases were retrospectively analysed using their clinical, laboratory and imaging features. The National Public Health Guide was used in the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric patients. COVID‐19 infections for all patients were confirmed by the COVID‐19 nucleic acid test using a pharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 11 years [3‐15]. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (40.6%) and cough (33.3%). When the laboratory findings of patients were examined, the median white blood cell (WBC) count was 5.8/mm(3) (4.8‐8.05/mm(3)), median lymphocyte count was 2.3/mm(3) (1.7‐3.55/mm(3)) and median C‐reactive protein (CRP) level was 2.3/mm(3) (1‐2.1/mm(3)). All patients had chest radiographs (CRXs), while only 44.9% of the patients underwent a chest CT. The 8.7% of CXRs and 12.8% of chest CT findings were found as pathological. Ground‐glass opacity was the most frequent finding. In the tomography group, the count of lymphocytes was lower, and creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher. The patients with pathological tomography findings demonstrated no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte count and CK and LDH levels; however, their CRP value was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: In this study, it is emphasised that chest CT should be requested by considering the underlying diseases and severity of clinical findings in paediatric patients. In this way, unnecessary chest CT could be prevented in the paediatric population.","Erat, Tuğba; Güler, Şükran",Int J Clin Pract,376,9

Due to multifaceted issues and challenges in the implementation of the safety and preventive measures, inconsistent coordination between societies-governments and most importantly lack of specific vaccine to SARS-CoV-2, the spread of the virus that initially emerged at Wuhan is still uprising after taking a heavy toll on human life. In the present study, we mapped immunogenic epitopes present on the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and we designed a multi-epitope peptide based vaccine that, demonstrated a high immunogenic response with a vast application on world’s human population. On codon optimization and in-silico cloning, we found that candidate vaccine showed high expression in E. coli and immune simulation resulted in inducing a high level of both B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity. The results predicted that exposure of vaccine by administrating three injections significantly subsidized the antigen growth in the system. The proposed candidate vaccine found promising by yielding desired results and hence, should be validated by practical experimentations for its functioning and efficacy to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.","Singh, Abhishek; Thakur, Mukesh; Sharma, Lalit Kumar; Chandra, Kailash",Sci Rep,376,10

A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients also develop various cardiac complications, among which dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) appears particularly common, especially in severe forms of the disease, and which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Echocardiographic studies indeed reveal right ventricular dysfunction in up to 40% of patients, a proportion even greater when the RV is explored with strain imaging echocardiography. The pathophysiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction in COVID-19 include processes increasing the pulmonary vascular hydraulic load and others reducing RV contractility, which precipitate the acute uncoupling of the RV with the pulmonary circulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides the fundamental basis for the adequate therapeutic management of RV dysfunction, which incorporates protective mechanical ventilation, the prevention and treatment of pulmonary vasoconstriction and thrombotic complications, as well as the appropriate management of RV preload and contractility. This comprehensive review provides a detailed update of the evidence of RV dysfunction in COVID-19, its pathophysiological mechanisms, and its therapy.","Bonnemain, Jean; Ltaief, Zied; Liaudet, Lucas",J Clin Med,376,1

In some cases, the disease can be fatal which resulted in more than one million deaths worldwide according the WHO. Currently, there is no effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19, however many small-molecule inhibitors have shown potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and some of them are now under clinical trials. Despite their promising activities, the development of these small molecules for the clinical use can be limited by many factors like the off-target effect, the poor stability, and the low bioavailability. The clusters of differentiation CD147, CD209, CD299 have been identified as essential entry co-receptors for SARS-CoV-2 species specificity to humans, although the underlying mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. In this paper, protein-protein docking was utilized for identifying the critical epitopes in CD147, CD209 and CD299 which are involved in the binding with SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD). The results of binding free energies showed a high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to CD299 receptor which was used as a reference to derive hypothetical peptide sequences with specific binding activities to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations of the newly designed peptides showed favorable binding features and stability with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and therefore can be further considered as potential candidates in future anti-SARS CoV-2 drug discovery studies.","Akachar, Jihane; Bouricha, El Mehdi; Hakmi, Mohammed; Belyamani, Lahcen; El Jaoudi, Rachid; Ibrahimi, Azeddine",Heliyon,376,18

This review analyzes the intersection of IL with nursing and offers analyses for a better understanding of integrating IL into nursing education settings. METHOD Scholarly literature was searched, and Covidence was used to track themes regarding how (and where) IL literature (n = 179) connects to nursing educational settings. RESULTS Librarians are not involved consistently within nursing education. Research and discussion on IL in nursing are published in librarianship, education, and health sciences literature, and the terminology does not always align across these disciplines. CONCLUSION Findings indicate an opportunity for librarians to share the Framework and its connections to the research literature with the nursing community.

A pathway consisting of home pulse oximetry with telephone follow-up was devised and implemented at a London District General Hospital to facilitate the safe discharge of these patients from the ED. Twenty patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 with oxygen saturations between 90%-94% were discharged on this novel ambulatory care pathway. Eighty-five percent of patients successfully avoided hospitalisation, whilst 15% were re-assessed and subsequently admitted to hospital. Home pulse oximetry monitoring was utilised to aid discharge from the ED and therefore prevent hospital admission. Telephone follow-up identified patients requiring further assessment.

This retrospective study investigated the implications of changes in blood coagulation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Records were reviewed for patients admitted with COVID-19 between February 4 and 16, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. A total of 85 patients were included, of whom 12 died in the hospital. The admission prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and levels of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors, while the reverse was true for prothrombin time activity (PT-act) and PaO(2)/FiO(2). Multivariate logistic regression showed that PT-act < 75% was independently associated with mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for PT-act, D-dimer, and FDP at admission could significantly predict mortality. The AUCs for PT-act were larger than those for D-dimer and FDP; however, there was no significant difference. After 2 weeks of treatment, the coagulation parameters of the surviving patients improved. COVID-19 is often accompanied by abnormal coagulation. PT-act at admission is able to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 as can D-dimer and FDP levels. PT-act < 75% is independently associated with mortality.","Luo, Hong-chun; You, Cheng-yan; Lu, Si-wei; Fu, Yue-qiang",Ann Hematol,376,16

Methods Patients (47 pre and 54 post) undergoing lung transplantation were identified from institutional database from January 2016 to October 2019. Detailed chart review and analysis of institutional cost data was performed. Univariate analysis was performed to compare eras. Results Similar short-term mortality and primary graft dysfunction were observed between groups. Decreased local donation (68% vs 6%, p < 0.001), increased travel distance (145 vs 235 miles, p = 0.004), travel cost ($8,626 vs $14,482, p < 0.001), and total procurement cost ($60,852 vs. $69,052, p = 0.001) were observed post implementation.

In addition to classical cardiovascular risk factors, these include a lack of patient adherence, knowledge deficits with respect to the rules of conduct after transplantation and living donation, lack of exercise and coping strategies and also occupational health and social law issues. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to clarify how rehabilitation measures can optimize the aftercare following kidney transplantation and living donation, what the need for rehabilitation is based on, what goals are pursued and which multidisciplinary therapy modules have been established. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For this purpose, the experiences of a rehabilitation clinic offering rehabilitation after kidney transplantation and living donation and currently treats approximately 600 patients per year since 2000, have been considered in addition to a literature search. RESULTS: Given the complexity surrounding posttransplantation aftercare, specialized rehabilitation measures focusing on nephrology and transplantation medicine can meaningfully supplement outpatient aftercare after kidney transplantation and living donation, if the rehabilitation clinic fulfils conceptual, personnel, and structural quality requirements. A close cooperation between the rehabilitation clinic, the transplantation center, and the treating nephrologist is essential. CONCLUSION: Controlled studies on the effects of long-term aftercare including inpatient rehabilitation are still needed. In this context, prerehabilitation should also be included.","Gerbig, Doris",Nephrologe,376,18

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis and patient survey of adult patients who completed a virtual video visit at our institution from 18 March 18 through to 27 April 2020. All video visit encounters were assessed for patient characteristics, diagnoses, management, and follow-up outcomes. Patients were surveyed for their feedback on acceptability and utility of their virtual video consultation. RESULTS: A total of 219 patients (mean age 55 years; range 21–89 years) completed 231 video visit encounters at our department over a 6-week period, of whom 118 were women (54%). About half of these encounters were acute visits (102 visits, 47%). The most common diagnosis of these visits was postoperative state (20 visits, 9% of the total), followed by conjunctivitis (16 visits, 7%), and keratitis (14 visits, 6%). The most common management decisions were medication prescription (102 visits, 46%) or reassurance (86 visits, 39%), while 17 video visit patients (8%) were escalated to an urgent, in-person evaluation. Ninety-two patients completed a follow-up survey (42% response rate), of whom 45 (49%) indicated that they might have delayed seeking care during this pandemic in the absence of a virtual video option. Seventy-two (78%) reported that they would consider participating in a video visit as an alternative to an office-based encounter in the future, and the overall video visit experience was rated highly, with a weighted mean Likert scale rating of 4.3 out of 5 (Cronbach’s α = 0.88). CONCLUSION: Virtual video visits may be used to manage a range of ophthalmic complaints. Patients participating in this survey found such video visits acceptable and timesaving, and the majority would consider using video consultations for future eyecare encounters.","Kalra, Gagan; Williams, Andrew M.; Commiskey, Patrick W.; Bowers, Eve M.

Thus, the authors are organizing a scoping review aiming to explore application of integrated health service delivery approaches during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs. Methods and analysis This scoping review adheres to the six steps for scoping reviews from Arksey and OMalley (2005). Peer reviewed scientific literature will be systematically assembled utilizing a standardized and replicable search strategy from seven electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, the World Health Organization Global Research Database on COVID-19, and LitCovid. Initially, the title and abstract of the collected literature, published in English from December 2019 to June 2020, will be screened for inclusion which will be followed by a full text review by two independent reviewers. Data will be charted using a data extraction form and reported in narrative format with accompanying data matrices. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required for the review. The study will be conducted from June to December 2020. Results from this study will provide a snapshot of the evidence currently being generated related to integrated health service delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will be developed into reports and a peer-reviewed articles and will assist policy makers in making pragmatic and evidence-based decisions for current and future pandemic response.","Neill, R.; Hasan, Z.; Das, P.; Venugopal, V.; Jain, N.; Arora, D.; Gupta, S.",,376,1

Severe forms of infection associate cytokine release syndrome and acute lung injury due to hyperinflammatory responses even though virus clearance is achieved. Key components of inflammation include immune cell recruitment in infected tissues, a step which is under the control of endothelial cells. Here, we review endothelial cell responses in inflammation and infection due to SARS‐CoV‐2 together with phenotypic and functional alterations of monocytes, T and B lymphocytes with which they interact. We surmise that endothelial cells function as an integrative and active platform for the various cells recruited, where fine tuning of immune responses takes place and which provides opportunities for therapeutic intervention.","Degauque, Nicolas; Haziot, Alain; Brouard, Sophie; Mooney, Nuala",FASEB J,376,18

Peptidylarginine deiminases cause post-translational deimination/citrullination, leading to changes in structure and function of a wide range of target proteins. Deimination can facilitate protein moonlighting, modify protein-protein interaction, cause protein dysfunction and induce inflammatory responses. Peptidylarginine deiminases also regulate the biogenesis of extracellular vesicles, which play important roles in cellular communication through transfer of extracellular vesicle-cargo, e.g., proteins and genetic material. Both peptidylarginine deiminases and extracellular vesicles are linked to a number of pathologies, including in the central nervous system, and their modulation with pharmacological peptidylarginine deiminase inhibitors have shown great promise in several in vitro and in vivo central nervous system disease models. Furthermore, extracellular vesicles derived from mesenchymal stem cells have been assessed for their therapeutic application in central nervous system injury. As circulating extracellular vesicles can be used as non-invasive liquid biopsies, their specific cargo-signatures (including deiminated proteins and microRNAs) may allow for disease “fingerprinting” and aid early central nervous system disease diagnosis, inform disease progression and response to therapy. This mini-review discusses recent advances in the field of peptidylarginine deiminase and extracellular vesicle research in the central nervous system, focusing on several central nervous system acute injury, degeneration and cancer models.","Lange, Sigrun",Neural Regen Res,376,12

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. METHODS: We present a data-driven method to quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), could lead to the change of malaria transmission potential in 2020. First, we adopt a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate epidemiological parameters in each country by fitting the time series of the cumulative number of reported COVID-19 cases. Then, we simulate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 under two groups of NPIs: (1) contact restriction and social distancing, and (2) early identification and isolation of cases. Based on the simulated epidemic curves, we quantify the impact of COVID-19 epidemic and NPIs on the distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Finally, by treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020, we evaluate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential based on the notion of vectorial capacity. RESULTS: We conduct case studies in four malaria-endemic countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Zambia, in Africa. The epidemiological parameters (i.e., the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the duration of infection [Formula: see text] ) of COVID-19 in each country are estimated as follows: Ethiopia ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ), Nigeria ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ), Tanzania ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ), and Zambia ([Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] ). Based on the estimated epidemiological parameters, the epidemic curves simulated under various NPIs indicated that the earlier the interventions are implemented, the better the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, the effect of combined NPIs is better than contact restriction and social distancing only. By treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020 as a baseline, our results show that even with stringent NPIs, malaria transmission potential will remain higher than expected in the second half of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: By quantifying the impact of various NPI response to the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential, this study provides a way to jointly address the syndemic between COVID-19 and malaria in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. The results suggest that the early intervention of COVID-19 can effectively reduce the scale of the epidemic and mitigate its impact on malaria transmission potential.","Shi, Benyun; Zheng, Jinxin; Xia, Shang; Lin, Shan; Wang, Xinyi; Liu, Yang; Zhou, Xiao-Nong; Liu, Jiming",Infect Dis Poverty,376,16

Cleome amblyocarpa has been reported as an important medicinal plant. However, its essential oil (EO) has not been well studied; therefore, the present study aimed to characterize the chemical composition of the C. amblyocarpa, collected from Egypt, and assess the allelopathic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of its EO. The EO of C. amblyocarpa was extracted by hydrodistillation and characterized via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The chemometric analysis of the EO composition of the present studied ecospecies and the other reported ecospecies was studied. The allelopathic activity of the EO was evaluated against the weed Dactyloctenium aegyptium. Additionally, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were determined. Forty-eight compounds, with a prespondence of sesquiterpenes, were recorded. The major compounds were caryophyllene oxide (36.01%), hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (7.92%), alloaromadendrene epoxide (6.17%), myrtenyl acetate (5.73%), isoshyobunone (4.52%), shyobunol (4.19%), and trans-caryophyllene (3.45%). The chemometric analysis revealed inconsistency in the EO composition among various studied ecospecies, where it could be ascribed to the environmental and climatic conditions. The EO showed substantial allelopathic inhibitory activity against the germination, seedling root, and shoot growth of D. aegyptium, with IC(50) values of 54.78, 57.10, and 74.07 mg L(−1). Additionally, the EO showed strong antioxidant potentiality based on the IC(50) values of 4.52 mg mL(−1) compared to 2.11 mg mL(−1) of the ascorbic acid as standard. Moreover, this oil showed significant anti-inflammation via the suppression of lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygenases (COX1, and COX2), along with membrane stabilization. Further study is recommended for analysis of the activity of pure authentic materials of the major compounds either singularly or in combination, as well as for evaluation of their mechanism(s) and modes of action as antioxidants or allelochemicals.","Abd-ElGawad, Ahmed M.; Elgamal, Abdelbaset M.; EI-Amier, Yasser A.; Mohamed, Tarik A.; El Gendy, Abd El-Nasser G.; I.

METHOD: We tested patients and asymptomatic citizens for SARS-CoV-2, exploring the efficiency and utility of CovidNudge (i) for detection in individuals’ sputum (compared to nasopharyngeal swabs), (ii) for detection in pooled sputum samples, and (iii) by modelling roll out scenarios for pooled sputum testing. RESULTS: Across 295 paired samples, we find no difference (p = 0.1236) in signal strength for sputum (mean amplified replicates (MAR) 25.2, standard deviation (SD) 14.2, range 0–60) compared to nasopharyngeal swabs (MAR 27.8, SD 12.4, range 6–56). At 10-sample pool size we find some drop in absolute strength of signal (individual sputum MAR 42.1, SD 11.8, range 13–60 vs. pooled sputum MAR 25.3, SD 14.6, range 1–54; p < 0.0001), but only marginal drop in sensitivity (51/53,96%). We determine a limit of detection of 250 copies/ml for an individual test, rising only four-fold to 1000copies/ml for a 10-sample pool. We find optimal pooled testing efficiency to be a 12–3-1-sample model, yet as prevalence increases, pool size should decrease; at 5% prevalence to maintain a 75% probability of negative first test, 5-sample pools are optimal. CONCLUSION: We describe for the first time the use of sequentially dipped sputum samples for rapid pooled point of care SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. The potential to screen asymptomatic cohorts rapidly, at the point-of-care, with PCR, offers the potential to quickly identify and isolate positive individuals within a population “bubble”.

This changing world can evoke negative emotions that have been traditionally linked to higher anxiety. Researches have been focused on the positive outcomes of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) preventing psychological disorders. However, the possibility that TEI might have a dark side has been neglected. Hence, this study aimed to explore the mediating effect of the three dimensions of TEI in the relationship between negative affect and anxiety symptoms among college students. Participants of this research were 467 undergraduates who completed an online self-reported questionnaire including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger et al., 1970), and Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24, Salovey et al., 1995). The global serial mediation model showed that the total amount of variance explained by the global model was 30.8% (R(2) = 0.31). Negative affectivity and age accounted for the 15.1% of state anxiety variance (R(2) = 0.15; c: B = 0.63, p < 0.001) while 15.7% of the variance of state anxiety was attributed to the direct or indirect effect of the three dimensions of TEI (R(2) = 0.16). Five indirect effects presented statistical significance (95% BootCI). The contrast analyses between mediators showed that three indirect effects had higher statistical weigh; the ability of negative affect to increase state anxiety through (i) emotional attention; (ii) emotional clarity, and (iii) serially through emotional clarity and mood repair. Our results indicated that students’ negative emotions lead to higher emotional attention which in turn may enhance state anxiety in two ways: by a direct effect of emotional attention on state anxiety and by a serial effect through emotional clarity. Moreover, when negative affect is associated with lower emotional clarity, anxiety symptoms may also arise. However, when attention and clarity are connected, the negative effect is reversed into a positive one, decreasing state anxiety.","Guil, Rocio; Gómez-Molinero, Rocio; Merchán-Clavellino, Ana; Gil-Olarte, Paloma",Front Psychol,376,29

Evidence suggests that increased distress during ICU stay increases risk of PICS-F, resulting in difficulty returning to their normal lives after the ICU experience. Effective interventions to improve PICS-F are currently lacking. In the present trial, we hypothesised that information provision using ICU-specific Virtual Reality for Family members/relatives (ICU-VR-F) may improve understanding of the ICU and subsequently improve psychological well-being and quality of life in relatives of patients admitted to the ICU. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multicentre, clustered randomised controlled trial will be conducted from January to December 2021 in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We aim to include adult relatives of 160 ICU patients with an expected ICU length of stay over 72 hours. Participants will be randomised clustered per patient in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention or control group. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive ICU-VR-F, an information video that can be watched in VR, while the control group will receive usual care. Initiation of ICU-VR-F will be during their hospital visit unless participants cannot visit the hospital due to COVID-19 regulations, then VR can be watched digitally at home. The primary objective is to study the effect of ICU-VR-F on psychological well-being and quality of life up to 6 months after the patients’ ICU discharge. The secondary outcome is the degree of understanding of ICU treatment and ICU modalities. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, approved the study and local approval was obtained from each participating centre (NL73670.078.20).

CASE REPORT: This patient presented with cough, sore throat, anorexia and pyrexia. On examination, he had gross cervical lymphadenopathy and palpable splenomegaly. Nose and throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and blood tests revealed pancytopaenia with very high ferritin, triglyceride and d-dimer levels. The patient’s HScore(2) was calculated at 220, suggesting probability of HLH of 93-96%. Considering Russell and colleagues’(3) comments about potential harm of corticosteroid use in patients with Covid-19 infection, the patient was commenced on treatment with the selective IL-1 receptor antagonist drug, Anakinra, and a two day course of intravenous immunoglobulin. RESULTS: The patient responded rapidly to treatment, becoming apyrexial after 24 hours. His lymph nodes and spleen began to normalise after the first 48 hours, at which time point the ferritin also started to decrease. He was discharged after 11 days feeling fit and well. CONCLUSION: This case certainly illustrates the importance of hyperinflammation syndromes in Covid-19. It also raises the question – is the severe pneumonitis seen in patients with Covid-19 an immunological phenomenon? We know that the viral load of patients with Covid-19 seems to peak in the early stages of illness(4, 5), however patients deteriorate later in the disease course, at around days 10-14. This patient, who had risk factors for deterioration (male, pancytopaenic), did not develop an oxygen requirement and clinically and biochemically improved rapidly on Anakinra with no adverse events. We might suggest Anakinra to the scientific community as a treatment option in Covid-19 infection.","Haigh, Kathryn; Syrimi, Zoe Joanna; Irvine, Sharon; Blanchard, Tom J.; Pervaiz, Muhammad Sajid; Toth, Arpad G.; Ratcliffe, Libuse",Clin Infect Pract,376,24

METHODS: A questionnaire (n = 19 questions) was sent to all members of the Italian Society of Radiology two months after the first Italian national lockdown was lifted. RESULTS: A total of 327 Italian radiologists took part in the survey (mean age: 49 ± 12 years). After national lockdown, the working-flow came back to normal in the vast majority of cases (285/327, 87.2%). Participants reported that a total of 462 radiological trials were recruiting patients at their institutions prior to COVID-19 outbreak, of which 332 (71.9%) were stopped during the emergency. On the other hand, 252 radiological trials have been started during the pandemic, of which 156 were non-COVID-19 trials (61.9%) and 96 were focused on COVID-19 patients (38.2%).

However, it is not clear whether recent household exposure to HCoVs reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods In a nationwide cohort study we followed all adults in Denmark aged 18 to 60 years from February 27 to November 15, 2020. Hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection by number of young children aged ten months to five years living in the household were estimated using Cox regression adjusted for adult age, gender, and other potential confounders. In sensitivity analyses we investigated the effect of age of children in the household, number of children living outside of the household, and number of other adult household-members. Results Among 449,915 adults in Denmark living in households with young children, 5,761 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while among 2,629,821 adults without young children in their household, 33,788 were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.09). Sensitivity analyses of age of children in the household, number of children living outside of the household, and number of additional adult household members found increasing number of children, and especially increasing number of older children, to substantially increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions Living in a household with young children was not associated with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby suggesting no strong preventive effect of recent exposure to HCoVs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Husby, A.; Corn, G.; Krause, T.

In this study, we inserted the frameshift region of HIV-1 (a slippery heptanucleotide motif followed by a stem-loop) in a reporter gene coding for firefly luciferase. The ability of the corresponding mRNA, generated by in vitro transcription, to be translated in an Escherichia coli cell-free extract is the first demonstration that the HIV-1 frameshift can be reproduced in a bacterial cell-free extract, providing a powerful approach for analysis of the frameshift mechanism. The responses of the frameshift signal to chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of peptide bond formation, and spectinomycin, an inhibitor of translocation, suggest that the frameshift complies with the same rules found in eukaryotic translation systems. Furthermore, when translation was performed in the presence of streptomycin and neamine, two errorinducing antibiotics, or with hyperaccurate ribosomes mutated in S12, the frameshift efficiency was increased or decreased, respectively, but only in the presence of the stem-loop, suggesting that the stem-loop can influence the frameshift through a functional interaction with the ribosomes.","Brunelle, Marie-Noëlle; Payant, Catherine; Brakier-Gingras, Léa; Lemay, Guy",Nucleic Acids Research,376,22

IHCDs may cause hospital closure, evacuations of patients and loss of healthcare capacity. The consequences may be ruinous for local communities. Although IHCDs occur with regularity, information on the frequency and types of these events is scarcely published in the medical literature. However, gray literature and popular media reports are widely available. We therefore conducted a scoping review of these literature sources to identify and characterize the IHCDs that occurred in Dutch hospitals from 2000 to 2020. The aim is to develop a systematic understanding of the frequency of the various types of IHCDs occurring in a prosperous nation such as the Netherlands. METHODS: A systematic scoping review of news articles retrieved from the LexisNexis database, Google, Google News, PubMed and EMBASE between 2000 and 2020. All articles mentioning the closure of a hospital department in the Netherlands were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 134 IHCDs were identified in a 20-year time period. Of these IHCDs, there were 96 (71.6%) emergency department closures, 76 (56.7%) operation room closures, 56 (41.8%) evacuations, 26 (17.9%) reports of injured persons, and 2 (1.5%) reported casualties. Cascading events of multiple failures transpired in 39 (29.1%) IHCDs. The primary causes of IHCDs (as reported) were information and communication technology (ICT) failures, technical failures, fires, power failures, and hazardous material warnings. An average of 6.7 IHCDs occurred per year. From 2000–2009 there were 32 IHCDs, of which one concerned a primary ICT failure. Of the 102 IHCDs between 2010–2019, 32 were primary ICT failures. CONCLUSIONS: IHCDs occur with some regularity in the Netherlands and have marked effects on hospital critical care departments, particularly emergency departments. Cascading events of multiple failures transpire nearly a third of the time, limiting the ability of a hospital to stave off closure due to failure. Emergency managers should therefore prioritize the risk of ICT failures and cascading events and train hospital staff accordingly.","Klokman, Vincent W.; Barten, Dennis G.; Peters, Nathalie A. L.

First, we surveyed public sources about Brazilian measures for the sector, as we are interested in verifying policies used by the private and public sectors, not only at the national level, but also at regional (state of Minas Gerais) and local (city of Belo Horizonte) levels. Second, we investigate the impact of the pandemic on the city's music sector, considering various categories of the profession such as composers, interpreters, arrangers, music teachers, DJs, among others. This work is part of a scenario of academic research and economic reports on the impacts of the pandemic in the music industry. More specifically, it aims to contribute to discussion on the effects of the social distance on livelihood of professionals of that area.","Teixeira, Nísio; Mello Vianna, Graziela; Lima, Ricardo; Jáuregui, Carlos; Furtado, Lucianna; Pereira Alberto, Thiago; Medeiros, Rafael",Front Sociol,376,20

Multiple studies identify environmental factors such as overcrowded housing and poor workplace conditions as contributing factors for the disproportionate COVID-19 rates amongst BAME and BIPOC communities. This paper will show that to fully understand the phenomenon, both an ecological and biological approach is needed. An ecological approach highlights how a person's habitat and the experiences within it mediate their susceptibility to disease. Moreover, to understand how this mediation works, this paper will use allostatic load as a biological pathway to link a person to their habitat and the poor health outcomes that contributed to COVID-19 susceptibility. In introducing this new approach, the paper will serve as an anti-racist framework for understanding how COVID-19 affected BAME and BIPOC communities. It is anti-racist by centering poor health outcomes on the habitats people are forced to live in due to structural racism rather than the physiology of a person's race or ethnicity. This is important in order to avoid similar crises in the future and to improve the health of marginalised communities.","Camargo, A.; Hossain, E.; Aliko, S.; Akinola-Odusola, D.; Artus, J.; Kelman, I.",,376,1

This study examined the prevalence of anxiety and depression, including associated factors and coping methods, among undergraduate students. METHODS: This cross-sectional study, which involved 386 undergraduate students, was assigned approval number UI/EC/20/0242. An online questionnaire consisting mainly of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the McMaster Family Assessment Device was circulated among the students. The results were analysed by means of descriptive statistics, chi-square, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and linear logistical regression, at α 0.05. RESULTS: Mean age was 21 ± 2.9 years, with females constituting 60.1% of the sample. The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were 41.5 and 31.9%, respectively. Students in health-related faculties were significantly less anxious than others. Inability to afford three square meals, negative family functioning, chronic illness and living in a State/Region with a high incidence of COVID-19 were significantly associated with depression. These factors jointly accounted for 14% of depression. Coping methods included the use of social media, watching movies and participating in online skills-development programs. CONCLUSION: The overall level of anxiety and depression among undergraduate students during the COVID-19 lockdown was higher than the levels previously reported. Inadequate nutrition and poor family functioning contributed significantly to this. Proactive measures ought to be taken to support undergraduate students in order to prevent the negative consequences of poor mental health.","OJEWALE, LUCIA YETUNDE",J Prev Med Hyg,376,23

The process by which aptamers are taken into cells depends on their targets but is typically clathrin-mediated endocytosis or macropinocytosis. After internalization, most aptamers are transported to endosomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and occasionally mitochondria and autophagosomes. Intracellular aptamers, or “intramers,” have versatile functions ranging from intracellular RNA imaging, gene regulation, and therapeutics to allosteric modulation, which we discuss in this review. Immune responses to therapeutic aptamers and the effects of G-quadruplex structure on aptamer function are also discussed.","Yoon, Sorah; Rossi, John J.",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,376,16

Its success relies on having safe and effective vaccines and also on high levels of uptake by the public over time. Addressing questions of population-level acceptability, stability of acceptance, and sub-population variation in acceptability are imperative. Using a prospective design, a repeated measures two-wave online survey was conducted to assess key sociodemographic variables and intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine. The first survey (Time 1) was completed by 3436 people during the period of national lockdown in Scotland and the second survey (n = 2016) was completed two months later (Time 2) when restrictions had been eased. In the first survey, 74% reported being willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Logistic regression analyses showed that there were clear sociodemographic differences in intention to accept a vaccine for COVID-19 with intention being higher in participants of white ethnicity as compared with Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, and in those with higher income levels and higher education levels. Intention was also higher in those who had “shielding” status due to underlying medical conditions. Our results suggest that future interventions, such as mass media and social marketing, need to be targeted at a range of sub-populations and diverse communities.","Williams, Lynn; Flowers, Paul; McLeod, Julie; Young, David; Rollins, Lesley",Vaccines (Basel),376,23

GAP STATEMENT: Given that the symptoms of influenza are largely indistinguishable from those of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), both SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza viruses require concurrent testing by RT-PCR in patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory tract infection. AIM: We adapted and evaluated a laboratory-developed multiplex RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 (dual target), influenza A and influenza B (SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT) on a fully automated high-throughput system (cobas6800). METHODOLOGY: Analytical performance was assessed by serial dilution of quantified reference material and cell culture stocks in transport medium, including pretreatment for chemical inactivation. For clinical evaluation, residual portions of 164 predetermined patient samples containing SARS-CoV-2 (n=52), influenza A (n=43) or influenza B (n=19), as well as a set of negative samples, were subjected to the novel multiplex assay. RESULTS: The assay demonstrated comparable analytical performance to currently available commercial tests, with limits of detection of 94.9 cp ml(−1) for SARS-CoV-2, 14.6 cp ml(−1) for influenza A and 422.3 cp ml(−1) for influenza B. Clinical evaluation showed excellent agreement with the comparator assays (sensitivity of 98.1, 97.7 and 100 % for Sars-CoV-2 and influenza A and B, respectively). CONCLUSION: The SC2/InflA/InflB-UCT allows for efficient high-throughput testing for all three pathogens and thus provides streamlined diagnostics while conserving resources during the influenza season.","Nörz, Dominik; Hoffmann, Armin; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Pfefferle, Susanne; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Med Microbiol,376,1

Catalysis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, which contains many proteins, most of which are secretory in nature and that have at least one s-s bond. Protein disulphide isomerase A3 (PDIA3) is a member of the PDI family that acts as a chaperone. PDIA3 is highly expressed in response to cellular stress, and also intercept the apoptotic cellular death related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and protein misfolding. PDIA3 expression is elevated in almost 70% of cancers and its expression has been linked with overall low cell invasiveness, survival and metastasis. Viral diseases present a significant public health threat. The presence of PDIA3 on the cell surface helps different viruses to enter the cells and also helps in replication. Therefore, inhibitors of PDIA3 have great potential to interfere with viral infections. In this review, we summarize what is known about the basic structure, functions and role of PDIA3 in viral infections. The review will inspire studies of pathogenic mechanisms and drug targeting to counter viral diseases.","Mahmood, Faisal; Xu, Ruixian; Awan, Maher Un Nisa; Song, Yuzhu; Han, Qinqin; Xia, Xueshan; Zhang, Jinyang",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,376,16

In addition, four different coping strategies were investigated. The study was conducted in Germany with data from 665 participants (53.8% female; 18–73 years), who completed an online questionnaire in April 2020. The results revealed that COVID‐19 worry was associated with impaired well‐being and sleep. Meaning‐ and problem‐focused coping were the most frequently used coping strategies, and showed positive associations with well‐being and sleep. Social and avoidance coping were associated with decreased well‐being and worse sleep outcomes. Three coping strategies showed moderating effects. People who worried more showed higher levels of positive affect when they used problem‐focused coping compared to those who did not. Similarly, highly worried participants showed lower levels of negative affect when they reported using meaning‐focused coping more often. In contrast, social coping increased the risk of high negative affect levels in worried participants. In conclusion, problem‐focused and meaning‐focused coping strategies seemed to be most effective in coping with COVID‐19 challenges.","Saalwirth, Christina; Leipold, Bernhard",Stress Health,376,1
