While immune dysregulation can be attributed to several factors, the risk of associated thrombogenic disruption varies across individuals. This variation depends on several factors, such as comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. When considering ethnic variations, the vulnerability of Caucasians, African Americans and Hispanics needs to be addressed before arriving at strategies to handle thromboembolic complications, which have been identified in recent reports as the leading causes of mortality in COVID-19. Although evaluation of D-dimer and prothrombin during admission is considered to predict prognosis and mortality, there are no preventive or prophylactic strategies before hospital admission. Herein, we present our perspectives on the effect of regular supplementation with the biological response modifier beta glucan based on its relevance to immune modulation. This effect is of paramount importance in decreasing the development of severe COVID-19 and reducing mortality against the background of coagulopathy, especially in vulnerable populations.","Ikewaki, Nobunao; Rao, Kosagi-Sharaf; Archibold, Armando Durant; Iwasaki, Masaru; Senthilkumar, Rajappa; Preethy, Senthilkumar; Katoh, Shojiro; Abraham, Samuel J K",Thromb J,,971

491763,Peer Review of “No Time to Waste: Real-World Repurposing of Generic Drugs as a Multifaceted Strategy Against COVID-19”,2020,"BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are at increased risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cancer and its treatment affect many haematological and biochemical parameters, therefore we analysed these prior to and during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and correlated them with outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with cancer testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in centres throughout the United Kingdom were identified and entered into a database following local governance approval. Clinical and longitudinal laboratory data were extracted from patient records. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, logistic regression, or linear regression for outcomes. Hierarchical clustering of heatmaps was performed using Ward's method. RESULTS: In total, 302 patients were included in three cohorts: Manchester (n = 67), Liverpool (n = 62), and UK (n = 173). In the entire cohort (N = 302), median age was 69 (range 19-93 years), including 163 males and 139 females; of these, 216 were diagnosed with a solid tumour and 86 with a haematological cancer. Preinfection lymphopaenia, neutropaenia and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were not associated with oxygen requirement (O2) or death. Lymphocyte count (P < 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.03), LDH (P < 0.0001) and albumin (P < 0.0001) significantly changed from preinfection to during infection. High rather than low neutrophils at day 0 (P = 0.007), higher maximal neutrophils during COVID-19 (P = 0.026) and higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; P = 0.01) were associated with death. In multivariable analysis, age (P = 0.002), haematological cancer (P = 0.034), C-reactive protein (P = 0.004), NLR (P = 0.036) and albumin (P = 0.02) at day 0 were significant predictors of death. In the Manchester/Liverpool cohort 30 patients have restarted therapy following COVID-19, with no additional complications requiring readmission. CONCLUSION: Preinfection biochemical/haematological parameters were not associated with worse outcome in cancer patients. Restarting treatment following COVID-19 was not associated with additional complications. Neutropaenia due to cancer/treatment is not associated with COVID-19 mortality. Cancer therapy, particularly in patients with solid tumours, need not be delayed or omitted due to concerns that treatment itself increases COVID-19 severity.","Lee, R J; Wysocki, O; Bhogal, T; Shotton, R; Tivey, A; Angelakas, A; Aung, T; Banfill, K; Baxter, M; Boyce, H; Brearton, G; Copson, E; Dickens, E; Eastlake, L; Gomes, F; Hague, C; Harrison, M; Horsley, L; Huddar, P; Hudson, Z; Khan, S; Khan, U T; Maynard, A; McKenzie, H; Palmer, D; Robinson, T; Rowe, M; Thomas, A; Tweedy, J; Sheehan, R; Stockdale, A; Weaver, J; Williams, S; Wilson, C; Zhou, C; Dive, C; Cooksley, T; Palmieri, C; Freitas, A; Armstrong, A C",ESMO Open,,971
