New York State (NY) is the hotspot with most coronavirus cases, while there are spatial/temporal variations. Yet, few examined county-level factors of mortality in COVID-19 patients in NY. Based on the sociological framework in health, this study links large and representative public data to understand COVID-19 mortality in NY over different stages of pandemic. METHODS: Mortality cases were from Mar 17 (state of emergency; 0.1 per 100,000), Apr 18 (coronavirus peak; 87.4), Apr 25 (expand testing; 108.7), and May 11 (daily reduced to original; 137.6). Three domains (compositional, contextual, and collective) and 28 county-level predictors of mortality were extracted from American Community Survey, Area Health Resources, US Crime Data, and Religious Data systems for each county. Compositional domain covered socio-demographic characteristics in local areas (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, housing). Contextual domain covered include social and physical opportunities (e.g., health insurance coverage, transportation, mental health providers). Collective domain covered neighborhood safety and religious adherents. Mixed effect regression with the least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) was used to select the predictors and estimate the parameters after adjusting the time effect and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19. 有道词典 ; 0.1 per 100,000 people 详细X ;每100000人0.1 RESULTS: NYC and the nearby boroughs (i.e., Bronx, Kings, Manhattan, Queens) had the highest cumulative mortality (231.69 per 100,000 people). Counties far from New York Cities (e.g., Allegany, Cortland, Delaware) had the lowest cumulative mortality. Spatial variation showed counties with larger population density (β=.01, p=.022) and/or higher proportion of people with at least high school education (β=227.24, p=.03) were at risk of higher cumulative mortality in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Unique spatial clustering mortality risk of COVID-19s was detected, highlighting important but understudied roles of contextual and collective factors. Tailored policy efforts shall be designed to support counties with large population density and high levels of education to prevent the mortality related to COVID-19 infection in NY.

44306,44306,44306,Controlling a Random Population,7.973197,2.0864694,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: Data on incidence, clinical presentation and outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) are limited. METHODS: Case series of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to a single ICU in France. All consecutive patients requiring MV with RT-PCR–confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 12th and April 24(th), 2020 were included. Frequency, clinical characteristics, responsible pathogens and outcomes of VAP were assessed, and compared to an historical cohort of patients with severe influenza-associated pneumonia requiring MV admitted to the same ICU during the preceding three winter seasons. RESULTS: Fifty-four consecutive patients with COVID-19–associated respiratory failure requiring MV were included (median (IQR) age 48 (42–58) years; 74% male; 93% requiring veno-venous ECMO). VAP occurred in 46 (85%) of them (median (IQR) prior MV duration before the first episode, 11 (8–16) days) (Table 1). Pathogens responsible for VAP were predominantly Enterobacteriaceae (72%), and particularly inducible AmpC-cephalosporinase producers (41%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35%) (Table 2). Pulmonary infection recurrence and death were observed in 46 (85%) and 17 (31%) patients, respectively. Details on recurrent episodes and pathogens responsible for recurrences are given in Table 3. Most recurrences were relapse (i.e. infection with the same pathogen), with a high proportion occurring during antimicrobial treatment despite its adequacy. Despite a high rate of P. aeruginosa VAP in patients with influenza-associated ARDS, pulmonary infection recurrence rate was significantly lower than in patients with COVID-19. Overall mortality was similar in the two groups. Baseline characteristics of patients [Image: see text] Characteristics of first ventilator-associated pneumonia episode [Image: see text] Characteristics of recurrent VAP episodes in Covid-19 and influenza patients. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19–associated respiratory failure requiring MV had a very high late-onset VAP rate. Inducible AmpC cephalosporinase–producing Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared to be frequently responsible for VAP, with multiple subsequent episodes and difficulties to eradicate the pathogen from the lung.

44313,44313,44313,Quantum Programming with Inductive Datatypes: Causality and Affine Type Theory,7.928884,2.041351,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: The distinct shift in peripheral monocyte activation and infiltration of these cells into the respiratory tract observed in severe cases of COVID-19 suggests that like SARS-CoV-1, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs) observed in SARS-CoV-2 infections may result from damage to the respiratory epithelia by improperly activated macrophages (MPs). In this study, we examined the ability of non-neutralizing antibodies to sensitize MPs to killing by SARS-CoV-2, as well as the impact of these cells on downstream epithelial cells. METHODS: Raw 264.7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1x10(4)/well and incubated overnight in the presence or absence of heat-inactivated LPS derived from either E. coli (EC) or S. enteritidis (Sal). Cells were then treated with non-neutralizing antibodies or vehicle control at the time of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Viability was assessed 48 hours post-infection by luminescence following the addition of CellTiter-Glo® (Promega). RESULTS: While no decrease in cell viability was observed with SARS-CoV-2 alone, the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies against either the nucleocapsid or spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 decreased cell survival to 35.98% and 53.67% of the cell control, respectively (p< 0.0001 and p=0.0003). Activation of MPs with Sal-derived LPS sensitized MPs to viral killing, even in the absence of non-neutralizing antibody (20.12% viability, p< 0.0001). This was not observed in MPs activated by EC LPS. MP activation by both Sal and EC LPS further enhanced viral killing in the presence of anti-nucleocapsid, reducing cell viability to 12.21% (0.0001) and 6.46% (p< 0.0001). Finally, supernatants collected from naïve MPs subjected to ADE markedly increased the susceptibility of Vero E6 cells to SARS-CoV-2 nearly 9.8-fold (p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate that naïve MPs, normally resistant to infection by SARS-CoV-2, are rendered susceptible to viral killing by activation and the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, MPs secrete an as yet, unknown factor that enhances the susceptibility of Vero E6 to SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, these data suggest that MPs play an important role in determining the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Our objective is to describe the short-term outcomes of the first 15 cases with MIS-C, who presented for care to a tertiary pediatric referral center. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of patients who met MIS-C criteria based on the New York State Department of Health case definition and who were admitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, between April 24 and May 14, 2020. We collected clinical and laboratory data during their hospital admission and subsequent outpatient follow up. RESULTS: The range of the length of hospital stay was 6–13 days (mean=7 days). One patient expired on day 9 of hospitalization. At the time of discharge, all patients had normalization of inflammatory markers. All patients were discharged on anticoagulation therapy for 14 days. One patient was readmitted with a subdural hematoma at day 13 post discharge and 3 patients had bruising at their follow up visit 7–12 days after hospital discharge. All patients had normalization of cardiac enzymes prior to hospital discharge. Abnormalities in coronary arteries and cardiac function which were observed during hospitalizations in 4 (27%) and 8 (53%) patients respectively, had resolved by day 6–35 post discharge (mean=20 days). CONCLUSION: Although patients with MIS-C can present with severe multi-organ involvement and shock, the majority of the patients in our experience had resolution of symptoms and normalization of laboratory parameters within a few weeks of initial symptoms. Our findings underscore the need to carefully weigh the risk and benefits of anticoagulation therapy and to monitor this treatment closely. Further research is needed to determine long-term outcomes of these patients.

They ease administration of work hours, work tasks, evaluations or log book remarks; they support communication with peers, co-workers and trainers; and they come in handy for idea development and creative work. Overarching trends in terms of changing learning cultures in apprenticeship training, such as individualization, flexibilization, self-organized learning, project work or coaching, support the introduction of these technologies and also benefit from them. Based on three in-depth case studies, results on the usage and impact of digital technologies will be presented. This chapter addresses the following research questions: Which digital tools are used in workplace training? What are potential benefits and extended justifications for the use of digital tools? How are modern learning cultures impacting the use of digital tools? We will outline how and where digital technologies are used at the workplace in apprenticeship training, why management has introduced them and how apprentices and their trainers benefit from it. Based on our findings, we will draw conclusions about how learning cultures are influencing the use of technologies and vice versa how the introduction of these technologies shapes innovative learning cultures in VET.","Barabasch, Antje; Keller, Anna",Digital Transformation of Learning Organizations,811,7

These two perspectives are discussed as a “double meaning”, which often occurs simultaneously in different forms. The concept of “multi-stakeholder dialogues” takes up this challenge. Following on from this, dimensions of the design and research of group discussions will be discussed. The contribution relates to the subproject “Multi-stakeholder Dialogues and Qualitative Evaluation” of the joint project “#ko.vernetzt”. The subproject had the task of accompanying, structuring and researching organisational development in a networked educational institution with dialogue formats. A total of nine dialogues were conducted with different groups of participants, six of which were analysed using qualitative methods. The research perspective is based on a concept of organisations from a praxeological perspective and an understanding of organisational culture as collective conjunctive experience. Thus, the object of qualitative research is the reconstruction of typical modus operandi of the processing of requirements. The results show that structural deficits in educational organisations are reproduced and reinforced by digitisation.","Helbig, Christian; Hofhues, Sandra; Lukács, Bence",Digital Transformation of Learning Organizations,811,7

However, the question arises whether these positive changes could be maintained in the post-COVID world, with an increase in economic activities alongside the unrestricted mobility of people and goods. The paper tries to gauge the situation beyond this short-lived moment of environmental rejuvenation, which seems quite grave. The entire work has been based on extensive literature review and perception studies. The adequate provision of sanitary landfills and medical incinerators for safe disposal of medical wastes was already in question in developing countries. The high usage of protective gear like personal protective equipment, gloves, masks, face shields, etc. will incite unscientific disposal and burning—leading to soil and air pollution. The quantum of air pollution may get higher due to avoidance of mass and para-transit modes of communication and over-reliance on personal vehicles to continue social distancing. Besides, maintaining self-hygiene at regular intervals, an antidote for corona infectivity, in a water-stressed world where 2.2 billion people do not have access to safe potable water will add to water scarcity. Further, indiscriminate usage of low-quality sanitizer to fight the virus causes serious health hazards and affects the environment detrimentally. For reaping the benefit of the current green environment, sustainable strategies have to be developed to cope with the new normal.","Basu, Anindya; Basu, Lopamudra Bakshi",COVID-19 Pandemic Trajectory in the Developing World,811,1

Due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), when preschools were shut down for months and children's social interactions were greatly limited, preschoolers' ATL might be negatively affected. However, strengthened family-school connections might have the potential to reduce the adverse effects of the pandemic. Based on a sample of 340 preschoolers from 30 classes of 6 preschools in Wuhan, China, we explored the association between family-preschool connections and preschoolers' ATL scores. The findings showed that the preschoolers' ATL were statistically and positively associated with parental attendance at the online parent-teacher meetings initiated by the preschools (standardized coefficient = 0.15). Policy implications regarding the enhancement of family-preschool connections are discussed.
