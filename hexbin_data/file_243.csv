Initial CHMI studies showed significantly higher durable protection against homologous than heterologous strains, suggesting the presence of strain-specific vaccine-induced protection. However, interpretation of these results and understanding of their relevance to vaccine efficacy have been hampered by the lack of knowledge on genetic differences between vaccine and CHMI strains, and how these strains are related to parasites in malaria endemic regions. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing using long-read (Pacific Biosciences) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing platforms was conducted to generate de novo genome assemblies for the vaccine strain, NF54, and for strains used in heterologous CHMI (7G8 from Brazil, NF166.C8 from Guinea, and NF135.C10 from Cambodia). The assemblies were used to characterize sequences in each strain relative to the reference 3D7 (a clone of NF54) genome. Strains were compared to each other and to a collection of clinical isolates (sequenced as part of this study or from public repositories) from South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. RESULTS: While few variants were detected between 3D7 and NF54, we identified tens of thousands of variants between NF54 and the three heterologous strains. These variants include SNPs, indels, and small structural variants that fall in regulatory and immunologically important regions, including transcription factors (such as PfAP2-L and PfAP2-G) and pre-erythrocytic antigens that may be key for sporozoite vaccine-induced protection. Additionally, these variants directly contributed to diversity in immunologically important regions of the genomes as detected through in silico CD8(+) T cell epitope predictions. Of all heterologous strains, NF135.C10 had the highest number of unique predicted epitope sequences when compared to NF54. Comparison to global clinical isolates revealed that these four strains are representative of their geographic origin despite long-term culture adaptation; of note, NF135.C10 is from an admixed population, and not part of recently formed subpopulations resistant to artemisinin-based therapies present in the Greater Mekong Sub-region. CONCLUSIONS: These results will assist in the interpretation of vaccine efficacy of whole-organism vaccines against homologous and heterologous CHMI.

In this paper, an effective oversampling method called evolutionary Mahalanobis distance oversampling (EMDO) is proposed for multi-class imbalanced data classification. EMDO utilizes a set of ellipsoids to approximate the decision regions of the minority class. Furthermore, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) is integrated with the Gustafson–Kessel algorithm in EMDO to learn the size, center, and orientation of every ellipsoid. Synthetic minority samples are generated based on Mahalanobis distance within every ellipsoid. The number of synthetic minority samples generated by EMDO in every ellipsoid is determined based on the density of minority samples in every ellipsoid. The results of computer simulations conducted herein indicate that EMDO outperforms most of the widely used oversampling schemes.","Yao, Leehter; Lin, Tung-Bin",Sensors (Basel),243,1

The environment has been implicated as a reservoir of AMR and is suggested to play a role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Currently, most research has focused on measuring concentrations of antibiotics and characterising the abundance and diversity of ARGs and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the environment. To date, there has been limited empirical research on whether humans are exposed to this, and whether exposure can lead to measureable impacts on human health. Therefore, the objective of this work is to produce two linked systematic maps to investigate previous research on exposure and transmission of AMR to humans from the environment. The first map will investigate the available research relating to exposure and transmission of ARB/ARGs from the environment to humans on a global scale and the second will investigate the prevalence of ARB/ARGs in various environments in the UK. These two maps will be useful for policy makers and research funders to identify where there are significant gluts and gaps in the current research, and where more primary and synthesis research needs to be undertaken. METHODS: Separate search strategies will be developed for the two maps. Searches will be run in 13 databases, and grey literature will be sought from key websites and engagement with experts. Hits will be managed in EndNote and screened in two stages (title/abstract then full text) against predefined inclusion criteria. A minimum of 10% will be double screened with ongoing consistency checking. All included studies will have data extracted into a bespoke form designed and piloted for each map. Data to be extracted will include bibliographic details, study design, location, exposure source, exposure route, health outcome (Map 1); and prevalence/percentage of ARB/ARG (Map 2). No validity appraisal will be undertaken. Results will be tabulated and presented narratively, together with graphics showing the types and areas of research that has been undertaken and heatmaps for key exposure-health outcomes (Map 1) and exposure-prevalence (Map 2).","Stanton, Isobel C.; Bethel, Alison; Leonard, Anne F.

Moreover, lockdown measurements may disproportionately affect elderly, since they are less familiar with communication technology used to overcome the lack of in person social contacts. The present study aimed at exploring how older adults residing in Lombardy are experiencing the lockdown period, in relation to loneliness, social isolation and use of communication technology. METHOD: In the first two weeks of May (2020) a telephone interview was conducted with people aged between 81 and 85, residing in the community, who participated in a study aimed at evaluating the impact of Social Networking Sites (SNS) use and older people’s social relationship (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04242628). We collected information on SNS use, self‐perceived loneliness (UCLA scale 3‐item), social engagement with family and friends (Lubben Social Network Scale 6‐item). Among the eligible individuals (N=144), 1 deceased, 4 refused and 9 were unreachable, resulting in a sample of 130 interviewed. For the aim of the present investigation, participants were stratified as trained (N=60) and untrained (N=70) for SNS use, based on their attendance to group courses held last year as part of the main experimental study. RESULT: Trained and untrained participants were comparable for age, sex, education, percentage of living alone, global cognition, depressive symptoms and comorbidity (Table 1). Participants trained for SNS use reported significantly higher usage of Facebook and WhatsApp and reduced feeling of being left out during the COVID‐19 lockdown (Table 2). Moreover, a trend toward significance was found for an inverse relationship between WhatsApp usage frequency and feeling of lack of companionship (r(s) = ‐0.257, p = 0.051; Table 3). CONCLUSION: Though SNS are unable to completely replace in person contact, these preliminary results support the utility to train older adults for SNS use in order to improve their social inclusion, even in extreme conditions of self‐isolation and vulnerability due to COVID‐19 pandemic.","Rolandi, Elena; Vaccaro, Roberta; Abbondanza, Simona; Casanova, Georgia; Pettinato, Laura; Colombo, Mauro; Guaita, Antonio",Alzheimers Dement,243,6

To reduce the number of cases occurring worldwide, the development of an effectual vaccine against these bacteria can be the only prevention. This conjectural work was performed using modern bioinformatics tools for investigation of proteome of ETEC strain E24377A. Different computational vaccinology approaches were deployed to assess several parameters including antigenicity, allergenicity, stability, localization, molecular weight and toxicity of the predicted epitopes required for good vaccine candidate to elicit immune response against diarrhea. We estimated two known control antigens, epitope (141)STLPETTVV(149) of Hepatitis B virus and epitope (265)ILRGSVAHK(273) of H1N1 Nucleoprotein in an attempt to corroborate our research work. Furthermore molecular docking was performed to evaluate the interaction between HLA allele and peptide, the peptide QYGGGNSAL and peptide LPYFELRWL were considered to be the most promiscuous T cell epitopes with the highest binding energy value of −2.09 kcal/mol and −1.84 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, dynamic simulation revealed good stability of the vaccine construct as well as population coverage analysis exhibits the highest population coverage in the regions of East Asia, India, Northeast Asia, South Asia and North America. Therefore, these two epitopes can be further synthesized for wet lab analysis and could be considered as a promising vaccine against diarrhea.

The two most prevalent forms are pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PH due to left heart disease (PH-LHD). Therapeutic options do exist for PAH to decrease symptoms and improve functional capacity; however, the mortality rate remains high and clinical improvements are limited. PH-LHD is the most common cause of PH, however, no treatment exists and the use of PAH-therapies is discouraged. Pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) is an innovative catheter-based ablation technique targeting the afferent and efferent fibers of a baroreceptor reflex in the main pulmonary artery (PA) trunk and its bifurcation. This reflex is involved in the elevation of the PA pressure seen in PH. Since 2013, both animal trials and human trials have shown the efficacy of PADN in improving PAH, including improved hemodynamic parameters, increased functional capacity, decreased PA remodeling, and much more. PADN has been shown to decrease the rate of rehospitalization, PH-related complications, and death, and is an overall safe procedure. PADN has also been shown to be effective for PH-LHD. Additional therapeutic mechanisms and benefits of PADN are discussed along with new PADN techniques.

Case reports use wide intra-mammary width and certain breast appearances as markers of breast hypoplasia. However, the reliability of these variables has not been determined. RESEARCH AIMS To test the (i) interrater and intrarater reliability of intra-mammary width measurement and interrater reliability of categorizing women's breasts into breast types, and (ii) feasibility and acceptability of study procedures for the participants. METHODS This was a prospective, longitudinal, non-experimental design with survey and observational components of a convenience sample of early postpartum women (N = 31). Interrater and intrarater reliability were measured using intraclass correlation coefficient for agreement for intra-mammary width measurements. Interrater reliability was measured using weighted kappa for agreement for categorizing breast type. Feasibility and acceptability of study procedures were collected 1 month later. RESULTS Excellent intrarater and interrater reliability for the intra-mammary width measurement (ICC = 0.99, 95% CI [0.99, 0.997] and ICC = 0.88, 95% CI [0.74, 0.94], respectively) and fair interrater reliability for breast type categorization (k = 0.35, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.75]) with high level of agreement between raters (97%) were achieved. Proportions of participants agreeing to breast photography and acceptability of study procedures were 68% (21/31) and 100% (28/28) respectively. CONCLUSION The excellent reliability for the intra-mammary width measurement means it provides a useful measure for future research. Since the ""fair"" reliability of categorizing breast type was due to lack of breast shape range in our sample, future research could assess the breasts of women with different medical profiles.","Kam, Renee L; Cullinane, Meabh; Vicendese, Don; Amir, Lisa H",Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,243,16

However, physiological mechanisms of enhanced salt tolerance in leaves and roots of trees rarely have been compared. To reveal the different mechanisms, our study utilized comprehensive analyses of leaves and roots to examine the effects of Funneliformis mosseae on the salinity tolerance of Zelkova serrata. Seedlings of Z. serrata were exposed to four salt levels in a greenhouse with and without F. mosseae inoculation. Treatment comparisons revealed that following F. mosseae inoculation, (1) nutrient deficiency caused by osmotic stress was mitigated by the fungus enhancing nutrient contents (K, Ca, and Mg) in roots and (N, P, K, Ca, and Mg) in leaves, with Ca and K contents being higher in both leaves and roots; (2) mycorrhizas alleviated ion toxicity by maintaining a favorable ion balance (e.g., K+/Na+), and this regulatory effect was higher in leaves than that in roots; and (3) oxidative damage was reduced by an increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes and accumulation of antioxidant compounds in mycorrhizal plants although the increase differed in leaves and roots. In particular, AM fungus-enhanced catalase activity and reduced glutathione content only occurred in leaves, whereas an enhanced content of reduced ascorbic acid was only noted in roots. Growth, root vitality, leaf photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthetic rate, and dry weight were higher in seedlings with AM fungus inoculation. These results suggest that AM fungus inoculation improved salinity tolerance of Z. serrata, but the physiological mechanisms differed between leaves and roots.","Wang, Jinping; Zhai, Lu; Ma, Jieyi; Zhang, Jinchi; Wang, G Geoff; Liu, Xin; Zhang, Shuifeng; Song, Juan; Wu, Yingkang",Mycorrhiza,243,12

Lifestyle changes towards a healthy diet, increased physical activity and reduced sedentary activities are recommended to prevent and treat obesity. Evidence suggests that changing these health behaviours can benefit cognitive function and school achievement in children and adolescents in general. There are various theoretical mechanisms that suggest that children and adolescents with excessive body fat may benefit particularly from these interventions. OBJECTIVES To assess whether lifestyle interventions (in the areas of diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and behavioural therapy) improve school achievement, cognitive function (e.g. executive functions) and/or future success in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight, compared with standard care, waiting-list control, no treatment, or an attention placebo control group. SEARCH METHODS In February 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and 15 other databases. We also searched two trials registries, reference lists, and handsearched one journal from inception. We also contacted researchers in the field to obtain unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural interventions for weight management in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. We excluded studies in children and adolescents with medical conditions known to affect weight status, school achievement and cognitive function. We also excluded self- and parent-reported outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Four review authors independently selected studies for inclusion. Two review authors extracted data, assessed quality and risks of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We contacted study authors to obtain additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Where the same outcome was assessed across different intervention types, we reported standardised effect sizes for findings from single-study and multiple-study analyses to allow comparison of intervention effects across intervention types. To ease interpretation of the effect size, we also reported the mean difference of effect sizes for single-study outcomes. MAIN RESULTS We included 18 studies (59 records) of 2384 children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. Eight studies delivered physical activity interventions, seven studies combined physical activity programmes with healthy lifestyle education, and three studies delivered dietary interventions. We included five RCTs and 13 cluster-RCTs. The studies took place in 10 different countries. Two were carried out in children attending preschool, 11 were conducted in primary/elementary school-aged children, four studies were aimed at adolescents attending secondary/high school and one study included primary/elementary and secondary/high school-aged children. The number of studies included for each outcome was low, with up to only three studies per outcome. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low and 17 studies had a high risk of bias for at least one item. None of the studies reported data on additional educational support needs and adverse events.Compared to standard practice, analyses of physical activity-only interventions suggested high-quality evidence for improved mean cognitive executive function scores. The mean difference (MD) was 5.00 scale points higher in an after-school exercise group compared to standard practice (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 9.32; scale mean 100, standard deviation 15; 116 children, 1 study). There was no statistically significant beneficial effect in favour of the intervention for mathematics, reading, or inhibition control. The standardised mean difference (SMD) for mathematics was 0.49 (95% CI -0.04 to 1.01; 2 studies, 255 children, moderate-quality evidence) and for reading was 0.10 (95% CI -0.30 to 0.49; 2 studies, 308 children, moderate-quality evidence). The MD for inhibition control was -1.55 scale points (95% CI -5.85 to 2.75; scale range 0 to 100; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.28; 1 study, 84 children, very low-quality evidence). No data were available for average achievement across subjects taught at school.There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of physical activity interventions combined with healthy lifestyle education on average achievement across subjects taught at school, mathematics achievement, reading achievement or inhibition control. The MD for average achievement across subjects taught at school was 6.37 points lower in the intervention group compared to standard practice (95% CI -36.83 to 24.09; scale mean 500, scale SD 70; SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.58; 1 study, 31 children, low-quality evidence). The effect estimate for mathematics achievement was SMD 0.02 (95% CI -0.19 to 0.22; 3 studies, 384 children, very low-quality evidence), for reading achievement SMD 0.00 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.24; 2 studies, 284 children, low-quality evidence), and for inhibition control SMD -0.67 (95% CI -1.50 to 0.16; 2 studies, 110 children, very low-quality evidence). No data were available for the effect of combined physical activity and healthy lifestyle education on cognitive executive functions.There was a moderate difference in the average achievement across subjects taught at school favouring interventions targeting the improvement of the school food environment compared to standard practice in adolescents with obesity (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.66; 2 studies, 382 adolescents, low-quality evidence), but not with overweight. Replacing packed school lunch with a nutrient-rich diet in addition to nutrition education did not improve mathematics (MD -2.18, 95% CI -5.83 to 1.47; scale range 0 to 69; SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.72 to 0.20; 1 study, 76 children, low-quality evidence) and reading achievement (MD 1.17, 95% CI -4.40 to 6.73; scale range 0 to 108; SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.61; 1 study, 67 children, low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Despite the large number of childhood and adolescent obesity treatment trials, we were only able to partially assess the impact of obesity treatment interventions on school achievement and cognitive abilities. School and community-based physical activity interventions as part of an obesity prevention or treatment programme can benefit executive functions of children with obesity or overweight specifically. Similarly, school-based dietary interventions may benefit general school achievement in children with obesity. These findings might assist health and education practitioners to make decisions related to promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools. Future obesity treatment and prevention studies in clinical, school and community settings should consider assessing academic and cognitive as well as physical outcomes.","Martin, Anne; Booth, Josephine N; Laird, Yvonne; Sproule, John; Reilly, John J; Saunders, David H",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,243,1

The aim of this study is to clarify the potential benefits and safety of diverting ileostomy (DI) following laparoscopic LAR in rectal cancer patients. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of 417 rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic LAR in a single institute. The risk factors for AL and the DI-related morbidity were assessed. RESULTS DI was performed in 226 patients (54.2%). The incidence rates of symptomatic AL showed no significant difference between patients with and without DI (8.4% vs. 10.0%, p = 0.612). AL requiring a surgical intervention was relatively lower in patients with DI than in those without DI (1.8% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.097). DI construction was an independent risk factor for AL requiring a surgical intervention (OR 3.47, p = 0.041), as was the serum albumin level (p = 0.003), and being male was a relative risk factor (p = 0.058). Focusing on sex, the rate of AL requiring a surgical intervention was significantly different in male (1.7 and 7.9%, p = 0.021) but not in female patients (1.9 and 1.1%, p = 1.000) with and without DI. The DI construction-related morbidity was 9.7%, and no patient required a reoperation. Of 226 patients with DI, 209 (92.5%) underwent stoma closure 118 days (median 30-509 days) after LAR. The stoma closure-related morbidity was 9.1% and 1 patient (0.5%) required a reoperation due to anastomotic leakage. CONCLUSIONS DI following laparoscopic LAR can decrease the risk of AL, requiring a surgical intervention, especially in male patients with malnutrition. However, due to DI-related morbidity, DI is not recommended in female patients.","Shimizu, Hiroki; Yamaguchi, Shigeki; Ishii, Toshimasa; Kondo, Hiroka; Hara, Kiyoka; Takemoto, Kenichi; Ishikawa, Shintaro; Okada, Takuhisa; Suzuki, Asami; Koyama, Isamu",Surgical endoscopy,243,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS In this phase I pilot study, twelve consecutive patients were anesthetized using conventional ventilator settings (CV) and then OV strategy during which oxygenation and lung compliance were noted. Subsequently, a lung resection was performed. Data were collected during both modes of ventilation in each patient, with each patient acting as his own control. The postoperative course was monitored for complications. RESULTS Twelve patients underwent open thoracotomies for seven lobectomies and five segmentectomies. The OV strategy provided consistent one-lung anesthesia and improved static compliance (40 ± 7 versus 25 ± 4 mL/cm H2O, P = 0.002) with airway pressures similar to CV. Postresection oxygenation (SpO2/FiO2) was better during OV (433 ± 11 versus 386 ± 15, P = 0.008). All postoperative chest x-rays were free of atelectasis or infiltrates. No patient required supplemental oxygen at any time postoperatively or on discharge. The mean hospital stay was 4 ± 1 d. There were no complications or mortality. CONCLUSIONS The OV strategy, previously shown to have benefits during mechanical ventilation of patients with respiratory failure, proved safe and effective in lung resection patients. Because postoperative pulmonary complications may be directly attributable to the anesthetic management, adopting an OV strategy that optimizes lung mechanics and gas exchange may help reduce postoperative problems and improve overall surgical results. A randomized trial is planned to ascertain whether this technique will reduce postoperative pulmonary complications.","Downs, John B; Robinson, Lary A; Steighner, Michael L; Thrush, David; Reich, Richard R; Räsänen, Jukka O",The Journal of surgical research,243,17

This article describes the experience of introducing this technique in a training hospital, the first reported cohort in The Netherlands. From March 2006 to November 2008, all patients operated on for proven or suspected lung cancer were analyzed. Prospective data from these patients were evaluated. A subgroup analysis for the c-VATS lobectomy is presented. A total of 184 operations were performed on 172 patients. In 122 (66.3%) of the operations the resection ended in a lobectomy of which 70 were done by complete thoracoscopic procedure. For the c-VATS lobectomy the mean operating time was 179 min, with a mean blood loss of 444 ml. The median hospital stay was four days. Complications were present in 10% of c-VATS lobectomies. No mortality was seen in the c-VATS group. After thorough evaluation and training, c-VATS lobectomy is a safe procedure that can be performed in a relatively low volume hospital. It has exceptional short-term benefits. For training purposes all operations must start thoracoscopically. All patients must be operated according the intention to treat method.","Belgers, Eric H J; Siebenga, Jan; Bosch, Anne Marie; van Haren, Eric H J; Bollen, Ewald C M",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,243,17

METHODS A total of 222 (of 1,375, 16.2%) physician trainees from an academic medical center responded to a Web-based survey. We compared the physician trainees who reported that their EHR use increased versus those whose EHR use stayed the same or decreased on outcomes related to depression, anxiety, stress, PTSD, and burnout using univariable and multivariable models. We examined whether self-reported exposure to COVID-19 patients moderated these relationships. RESULTS Physician trainees who reported increased use of EHR had higher burnout (adjusted mean, 1.48 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24, 1.71] vs. 1.05 [95% CI 0.93, 1.17]; p = 0.001) and were more likely to exhibit symptoms of PTSD (adjusted mean = 15.09 [95% CI 9.12, 21.05] vs. 9.36 [95% CI 7.38, 11.28]; p = 0.035). Physician trainees reporting increased EHR use outside of work were more likely to experience depression (adjusted mean, 8.37 [95% CI 5.68, 11.05] vs. 5.50 [95% CI 4.28, 6.72]; p = 0.035). Among physician trainees with increased EHR use, those exposed to COVID-19 patients had significantly higher burnout (2.04, p < 0.001) and depression scores (14.13, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION Increased EHR use was associated with higher burnout, depression, and PTSD outcomes among physician trainees.

Methods and Results The MONICA Risk, Genetics, Archiving, and Monograph (MORGAM) Project was conducted in 30 cohorts from 11 countries; 90 487 men and women, aged 30 to 74 years, predominantly white, with no history of cardiovascular disease, were recruited in 1986 to 2010 and followed up for up to 24 years. Hazard ratios were estimated using sex-specific Cox models, stratified by cohort, with age as the time scale. Models included baseline categorical obesity measures, age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive drugs, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. A total of 9105 all-cause deaths were recorded during a median follow-up of 10 years. Hazard ratios for all-cause death presented J- or U-shaped associations with most obesity measures. With waist and hip circumference included in the same model, for all hip sizes, having a smaller waist was strongly associated with lower risk of death, except for men with the smallest hips. In addition, among those with smaller waists, hip size was strongly negatively associated with risk of death, with ≈20% more people identified as being at increased risk compared with waist circumference alone. Conclusions A more complex relationship between hip circumference, waist circumference, and risk of death is revealed when both measures are considered simultaneously. This is particularly true for individuals with smaller waists, where having larger hips was protective. Considering both waist and hip circumference in the clinical setting could help to best identify those at increased risk of death.","Cameron, Adrian J; Romaniuk, Helena; Orellana, Liliana; Dallongeville, Jean; Dobson, Annette J; Drygas, Wojciech; Ferrario, Marco; Ferrieres, Jean; Giampaoli, Simona; Gianfagna, Francesco; Iacoviello, Licia; Jousilahti, Pekka; Kee, Frank; Moitry, Marie; Niiranen, Teemu J; Pająk, Andrzej; Palmieri, Luigi; Palosaari, Tarja; Satu, Männistö; Tamosiunas, Abdonas; Thorand, Barbara; Toft, Ulla; Vanuzzo, Diego; Veikko, Salomaa; Veronesi, Giovanni; Wilsgaard, Tom; Kuulasmaa, Kari; Söderberg, Stefan",Journal of the American Heart Association,243,16

Trans-oral CM has been described using a rigid stapling device for two decades; however, this remains problematic for severely kyphotic patients. This problem can be overcome with flexible endoscopy utilizing an electrosurgical needle knife. We sought to compare clinical outcomes between these techniques to stratify patient selection. METHODS Patients undergoing ZD treatment from 1992 to 2015 were reviewed. Demographics, diverticulum size, post-operative complications, and length of stay (LOS) were compared between open cricopharyngeal myotomy (OpenCM), rigid trans-oral stapling myotomy (RigidCM), and flexible endoscopic myotomy (FlexCM). Dysphagia scores (DS, 0:best-4:worst) and pneumonia incidence were assessed pre-operatively and post-operatively. RESULTS 62 patients underwent OpenCM (39/62(63 %)) or endoscopic CM (23/62(37 %) (8 RigidCM/15 FlexCM)). CM significantly reduced dysphagia for all approaches [OpenCM:2(2-3)-0(0-0); RigidCM:2(2-2)-0(0-0); FlexCM:3(3-3)-0(0-0)]. FlexCM patients had significantly worse pre-operative DS. Endoscopic CM was attempted and completed in 23/35(66 %) patients. Reasons for OpenCM conversion included inability to position the diverticular retractor due to patient body habitus (RigidCM), and the inability to position the overtube due to small ZD (FlexCM). Major post-operative complications were rare and similar in all groups. Medium-to-long-term post-myotomy pneumonia was comparable between groups. LOS (days) was reduced for FlexCM (1(1-2)) versus RigidCM (3(2-6)) and OpenCM (4(3-7)). CONCLUSIONS CM is highly effective for treating ZD. Open and endoscopic approaches offer comparable outcomes and dysphagia resolution. FlexCM is efficacious for large ZD and can be performed in most patients irrespective of body habitus. FlexCM represents an excellent approach for large ZD, while OpenCM should be reserved for small ZD for which an overtube cannot be positioned.","Jones, Daniel; Aloraini, Abdullah; Gowing, Stephen; Cools-Lartigue, Jonathan; Leimanis, Mara; Tabah, Roger; Ferri, Lorenzo",World journal of surgery,243,1

This review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DRE in screening for prostate cancer in primary care settings. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) from their inception to June 2016. Six reviewers, in pairs, independently screened citations for eligibility and extracted data. Pooled estimates were calculated for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of DRE in primary care settings using an inverse-variance meta-analysis. We used QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2) and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) guidelines to assess study risk of bias and quality. RESULTS Our search yielded 8,217 studies, of which 7 studies with 9,241 patients were included after the screening process. All patients analyzed underwent both DRE and biopsy. Pooled sensitivity of DRE performed by primary care clinicians was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.36-0.67; I2 = 98.4%) and pooled specificity was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.41-0.76; I2 = 99.4%). Pooled PPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.31-0.52; I2 = 97.2%), and pooled NPV was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.58-0.70; I2 = 95.0%). The quality of evidence as assessed with GRADE was very low. CONCLUSION Given the considerable lack of evidence supporting its efficacy, we recommend against routine performance of DRE to screen for prostate cancer in the primary care setting.","Naji, Leen; Randhawa, Harkanwal; Sohani, Zahra; Dennis, Brittany; Lautenbach, Deanna; Kavanagh, Owen; Bawor, Monica; Banfield, Laura; Profetto, Jason",Annals of family medicine,243,24

The main purpose of this study was to develop a sprint interval protocol that stimulated both anaerobic and aerobic systems while maximizing power output and minimizing fatigue. The secondary goal was to investigate the influence of inter-sprint recovery duration. METHODS Sixteen (8 females) participants (age: 23.5 ± 3.4 years, peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak): 45.6 ± 9.2 ml kg-1 min-1) took part in this study. The exercise protocol involved 30 bouts of 4 s maximal cycling sprints using an 'Inertial Load Ergometer'. Recovery durations between sprints of 15, 30 and 45 s were studied in three trials. RESULTS Peak power output (PPO) was maintained while taking 45 and 30 s of recovery, although it was 9% higher (p < 0.05) during 45 vs. 30 s. PPO with 15 s recovery declined 18% (p < 0.05) and then stabilized as did oxygen consumption (72±2% VO2peak) at a level that might reflect the peak rate of ATP-PC resynthesis from oxidative metabolism. The 15-, 30-, and 45 s trials elicited 72, 56, and 49% VO2peak and 86, 80, and 75% of maximal heart rate (all p<0.001). Perceived exertion increased with shorter recovery periods but remained at 12.6-14.7 and never became 'very hard'. CONCLUSION The present study describes the use of an inertial-load ergometer to accommodate repeated 4 s maximal cycling sprints that elicit 72% VO2peak when the recovery period is 15 s. However, a recovery duration of 15 s was insufficient for the maintenance of power generation.

Thus, it is fundamental to elucidate the effects of insecticides on bees. This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/μL of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The results showed enzymes such as CaE3, GST, AChE, ALP, SOD, and GPX, as well as the TBARS assay, are useful biomarkers on bees. They may be used in combination as a promising tool for characterizing bee exposure to insecticides.","Decio, Pâmela; Miotelo, Lucas; Pereira, Franco Dani Campos; Roat, Thaisa Cristina; Marin-Morales, Maria Aparecida; Malaspina, Osmar",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,243,1

Lower extremity edema, fatigue, excessive weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and pancytopenia were the presenting symptoms and lab findings. Revisional surgery was performed at a mean 19 ± 9.7 months after OAGB-MGB after failure of supportive measures. The mean BMI at the time of revision was 22.5 ± 2.6 kg/m2 with an excess weight loss of 109.2 ± 22.1%. After revisional surgery, one patient developed profound liver failure and expired. Another patient developed severe steatohepatitis but ultimately recovered. In the remaining five, edema and fatigue completely resolved at 1 month and hypoalbuminemia and anemia normalized at 2 months. CONCLUSION A one-fits-all BPL length of 200 cm is increasingly being questioned as it may result in an inadequate absorptive area and PCM in a subset of patients with shorter total bowel lengths, potentially placing them in danger and depriving them of bariatric surgery benefits.","Khalaj, Alireza; Kalantar Motamedi, Mohammad Ali; Mousapour, Pouria; Valizadeh, Majid; Barzin, Maryam",Obesity surgery,243,1

The immunopathology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the production of an excess amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines ""a cytokine-storm"". The respiratory system (main), cardiovascular system and the gastrointestinal tract are the most affected body systems during viral infection. It has been found that most of the patients who require admission to hospital are elderly or have chronic underlying diseases. Higher cases of malnutrition and co-morbidities like diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are reported in elderly patients due to which, the immune system weakens and hence, the response to the virus is diminished in magnitude. A deficiency of micronutrients results in impaired immune responses leading to improper secretion of cytokines, alterations in secretory antibody response and antibody affinity which increases susceptibility to viral infection. The deficiency of various micronutrients in COVID-19 patient can be treated by appropriate nutritional supplements, prescribed after evaluating the patients' nutritional status. Here we aim to highlight the role of a few particular nutrients namely Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Omega-3 fatty acids, Zinc and Magnesium along with the synergistic roles they play in enhancing immunity and thus, maintaining homeostasis.","Muthuvattur Pallath, Meghana; Ahirwar, Ashok Kumar; Chandra Tripathi, Satyendra; Asia, Priyanka; Sakarde, Apurva; Gopal, Niranjan",Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,243,28

Urea is one treatment option, which is thought to improve the efficacy of topical and oral antifungal agents. Despite a theoretical basis for the use of urea for the treatment of onychomycosis, the evidence-base for this treatment has not been systematically reviewed. Aim The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to determine the efficacy and safety of urea as a monotherapy and as adjunct therapy, compared to other treatment regimens for onychomycosis. Method A systematic literature search of ten electronic databases was conducted. Only studies that used microscopy and culture or other validated laboratory-based testing method to confirm the presence of a fungal infection before treatment were included. The outcome measures assessed were efficacy (defined in terms of mycological, clinical and complete cure) and safety (defined as self-reported adverse events). Results The systematic search yielded 560 unique studies for review. Of these, only six were eligible for inclusion. All studies were observed to have methodological concerns, most studies consisted of small sample sizes and were difficult to compare given heterogeneity in outcome measures and follow-up time. Despite this, a trend was observed to suggest that urea, when added to topical or oral antifungal treatment regimens, improved efficacy of the treatment. Conclusion This review suggests that topical urea, as an adjunct to topical and oral antifungal treatment regimens, may improve the efficacy of treatment. However, further research is needed.","Dars, S; Banwell, H A; Matricciani, L",Journal of foot and ankle research,243,27

The cellular receptor for these viruses was heretofore unknown. We report here that expression of human cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) enables the cells normally unsusceptible to RV-C infection to support both virus binding and replication. A coding single nucleotide polymorphism (rs6967330, C529Y) was previously linked to greater cell-surface expression of CDHR3 protein, and an increased risk of wheezing illnesses and hospitalizations for childhood asthma. Compared with wild-type CDHR3, cells transfected with the CDHR3-Y529 variant had about 10-fold increases in RV-C binding and progeny yields. We developed a transduced HeLa cell line (HeLa-E8) stably expressing CDHR3-Y529 that supports RV-C propagation in vitro. Modeling of CDHR3 structure identified potential binding sites that could impact the virus surface in regions that are highly conserved among all RV-C types.

Contraceptive-induced menstrual bleeding changes (CIMBCs) are linked to these concerns. Research on women's responses to CIMBCs has not been mapped or summarized in a systematic scoping review. METHODS We conducted a systematic scoping review of data on women's responses to CIMBCs in peer-reviewed, English-language publications in the last 15 years. Investigator dyads abstracted information from relevant studies on pre-specified and emergent themes using a standardized form. We held an expert consultation to obtain critical input. We provide recommendations for researchers, contraceptive counselors, and product developers. RESULTS We identified 100 relevant studies. All world regions were represented (except Antarctica), including Africa (11%), the Americas (32%), Asia (7%), Europe (20%), and Oceania (6%). We summarize findings pertinent to five thematic areas: women's responses to contraceptive-induced non-standard bleeding patterns; CIMBCs influence on non-use, dissatisfaction or discontinuation; conceptual linkages between CIMBCs and health; women's responses to menstrual suppression; and other emergent themes. Women's preferences for non-monthly bleeding patterns ranged widely, though amenorrhea appears most acceptable in the Americas and Europe. Multiple studies reported CIMBCs as top reasons for contraceptive dissatisfaction and discontinuation; others suggested disruption of regular bleeding patterns was associated with non-use. CIMBCs in some contexts were perceived as linked with a wide range of health concerns; e.g., some women perceived amenorrhea to cause a buildup of ""dirty"" or ""blocked"" blood, in turn perceived as causing blood clots, fibroids, emotional disturbances, weight gain, infertility, or death. Multiple studies addressed how CIMBCs (or menstruation) impacted daily activities, including participation in domestic, work, school, sports, or religious life; sexual or emotional relationships; and other domains. CONCLUSIONS Substantial variability exists around how women respond to CIMBCs; these responses are shaped by individual and social influences. Despite variation in responses across contexts and sub-populations, CIMBCs can impact multiple aspects of women's lives. Women's responses to CIMBCs should be recognized as a key issue in contraceptive research, counseling, and product development, but may be underappreciated, despite likely - and potentially substantial - impacts on contraceptive discontinuation and unmet need for modern contraception.","Polis, Chelsea B; Hussain, Rubina; Berry, Amanda",Reproductive health,243,33

We conducted a molecular epidemiology study to investigate different genotypes and potential recombination in HCoV-OC43. Twenty-nine HCoV-OC43 strains from nasopharyngeal aspirates, collected from 2004 to 2011, were subjected to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike, and nucleocapsid gene analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed at least three distinct clusters of HCoV-OC43, although 10 unusual strains displayed incongruent phylogenetic positions between RdRp and spike genes. This suggested the presence of four HCoV-OC43 genotypes (A to D), with genotype D most likely arising from recombination. The complete genome sequencing of two genotype C and D strains and bootscan analysis showed recombination events between genotypes B and C in the generation of genotype D. Of the 29 strains, none belonged to the more ancient genotype A, 5 from 2004 belonged to genotype B, 15 from 2004 to 2006 belonged to genotype C, and 1 from 2004 and all 8 from 2008 to 2011 belonged to the recombinant genotype D. Molecular clock analysis using spike and nucleocapsid genes dated the most recent common ancestor of all genotypes to the 1950s, genotype B and C to the 1980s, genotype B to the 1990s, and genotype C to the late 1990s to early 2000s, while the recombinant genotype D strains were detected as early as 2004. This represents the first study to describe natural recombination in HCoV-OC43 and the evolution of different genotypes over time, leading to the emergence of novel genotype D, which is associated with pneumonia in our elderly population.","Lau, Susanna K P; Lee, Paul; Tsang, Alan K L; Yip, Cyril C Y; Tse, Herman; Lee, Rodney A; So, Lok-Yee; Lau, Yu-Lung; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,243,1

The closed-loop anesthesia delivery system (CLADS) is a method to automatically administer propofol total intravenous anesthesia using bi-spectral index (BIS) feedback and attain general anesthesia (GA) steady state with greater consistency. This study assessed whether dexmedetomidine is effective in further lowering the propofol requirements for total intravenous anesthesia facilitated by CLADS. METHODS After ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 80 patients undergoing elective major laparoscopic/robotic surgery were randomly allocated to receive GA with propofol CLADS with or without the addition of dexmedetomidine. Quantitative reduction of propofol and quality of depth-of-anesthesia (primary objectives), intraoperative hemodynamics, incidence of postoperative adverse events (sedation, analgesia, nausea, and vomiting), and intraoperative awareness recall (secondary objectives) were analyzed. RESULTS There was a statistically significant lowering of propofol requirement (by 15%) in the dexmedetomidine group for induction of anesthesia (dexmedetomidine group: mean ± standard deviation 0.91 ± 0.26 mg/kg; nondexmedetomidine group: 1.07 ± 0.23 mg/kg, mean difference: 0.163, 95% CI, 0.04-0.28; P = .01) and maintenance of GA (dexmedetomidine group: 3.25 ± 0.97 mg/kg/h; nondexmedetomidine group: 4.57 ± 1.21 mg/kg/h, mean difference: 1.32, 95% CI, 0.78-1.85; P < .001). The median performance error of BIS control, a measure of bias, was significantly lower in dexmedetomidine group (1% [-5.8%, 8%]) versus nondexmedetomidine group (8% [2%, 12%]; P = .002). No difference was found for anesthesia depth consistency parameters, including percentage of time BIS within ±10 of target (dexmedetomidine group: 79.5 [72.5, 85.3]; nondexmedetomidine group: 81 [68, 88]; P = .534), median absolute performance error (dexmedetomidine group: 12% [10%, 14%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 12% [10%, 14%]; P = .777), wobble (dexmedetomidine group: 10% [8%, 10%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 8% [6%, 10%]; P = .080), and global score (dexmedetomidine group: 25.2 [23.1, 35.8]; nondexmedetomidine group: 24.7 [20, 38.1]; P = .387). Similarly, there was no difference between the groups for percentage of time intraoperative heart rate and mean arterial pressure remained within 20% of baseline. However, addition of dexmedetomidine to CLADS propofol increased the incidence of significant bradycardia (dexmedetomidine group: 14 [41.1%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 3 [9.1%]; P = .004), hypotension (dexmedetomidine group: 9 [26.5%]; nondexmedetomidine group: 2 [6.1%]; P = .045), and early postoperative sedation. CONCLUSIONS The addition of dexmedetomidine to propofol administered by CLADS was associated with a consistent depth of anesthesia along with a significant decrease in propofol requirements, albeit with an incidence of hemodynamic depression and early postoperative sedation.","Dutta, Amitabh; Sethi, Nitin; Sood, Jayashree; Panday, Bhuwan C; Gupta, Manish; Choudhary, Prabhat; Puri, Goverdhan D",Anesthesia and analgesia,243,1

Over the last 30 years a large amount of the physics and engineering effort in PET has been motivated by the dominant clinical application during that period, oncology. This has led to important developments such as PET/CT, whole-body PET, 3D PET, accelerated statistical image reconstruction, and time-of-flight PET. Despite impressive improvements in image quality as a result of these advances, the emphasis on static, semi-quantitative ""hot spot"" imaging for oncologic applications has meant that the capability of PET for quantifying biologically relevant parameters based on tracer kinetics has not been fully exploited. More recent advances, such as PET/MR and total body PET, have opened up the ability to address a vast range of new research questions from which a future expansion of applications and radiotracers appears highly likely. Many of these new applications and tracers will, at least initially, require quantitative analyses that more fully exploit the exquisite sensitivity of PET and the tracer principle on which it is based. It is also expected that they will require more sophisticated quantitative analysis methods than those that are currently available. At the same time, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing data analysis and impacting the relationship between the statistical quality of the acquired data and the information we can extract from the data. In this roadmap, leaders of the key sub-disciplines of the field identify the challenges and opportunities to be addressed over the next 10 years that will enable PET to realise its full quantitative potential, initially in research laboratories and, ultimately, in clinical practice.","Meikle, Steven R; Sossi, Vesna; Roncali, Emilie; Cherry, Simon R; Banati, Richard; Mankoff, David A; Jones, Terry; James, Michelle L; Sutcliffe, Julie; Ouyang, Jinsong; Petibon, Yoann; Ma, Chao; El Fakhri, Georges; Surti, Suleman; Karp, Joel S; Badawi, Ramsey D; Yamaya, Taiga; Akamatsu, Go; Schramm, Georg; Rezaei, Ahmadreza; Nuyts, Johan; Fulton, Roger R; Kyme, Andre Z; Lois, Cristina; Sari, Hasan; Price, Julie; Boellaard, Ronald; Jeraj, Robert; Bailey, Dale L; Eslick, Enid M; Willowson, Kathy P; Dutta, Joyita",Physics in medicine and biology,243,7

Neuroimaging studies showed that (complex) circular dynamic GPs mainly activate areas along both the ventral and the dorsal stream such as hMT+, V3b/KO, dorsal V4 and LOC, whereas directional motion from rotating random dot kinematograms (RDKs) mainly activates the human MT complex (hMT+) and area V6. However, despite the large number of correlational information from fMRI studies, there is scarce evidence about the causal involvement of these brain areas in the perception of dynamic circular GPs and rotating RDKs. The aim of this study is to compare the neural basis of dynamic circular GPs and rotating RDKs by temporarily interfering with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) delivered over two visual areas largely involved in form and motion processing, such as V1/V2 and hMT+. Our results showed that rTMS over hMT+ interfered only with the processing of rotating RDKs but not with the processing of circular dynamic GPs. On the other hand, rTMS delivered over early visual areas (V1/V2) did not interfere with the processing of both visual stimuli.

Propofol at clinically used concentrations modestly inhibits the intact (wild-type) IKs channels and is therefore unlikely to appreciably prolong QT interval in electrocardiogram during anesthesia. However, little information is available concerning the inhibitory effect of propofol on IKs channel associated with its gene variants implicated in QT prolongation. The KCNE1 single nucleotide polymorphism leading to D85N is associated with drug-induced QT prolongation and therefore regarded as a clinically important genetic variant. This study examined whether KCNE1-D85N affects the sensitivity of IKs to inhibition by propofol. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Whole-cell patch-clamp and immunostaining experiments were conducted in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and/or mouse cardiomyocyte-derived HL-1 cells, transfected with wild-type KCNQ1, wild-type or variant KCNE1 cDNAs. KEY RESULTS Propofol inhibited KCNQ1/KCNE1-D85N current more potently than KCNQ1/KCNE1 current in HEK293 cells and HL-1 cells. Immunostaining experiments in HEK293 cells revealed that pretreatment with propofol (10 μM) did not appreciably affect cell membrane expression of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 proteins in KCNQ1/KCNE1 and KCNQ1/KCNE1-D85N channels. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS The KCNE1 polymorphism D85N significantly elevates the sensitivity of IKs to inhibition by propofol. This study detects a functionally important role of KCNE1-D85N polymorphism in conferring genetic susceptibility to propofol-induced QT prolongation and further suggests the possibility that the inhibitory action of anesthetics on ionic currents becomes exaggerated in patients carrying variants in genes encoding ion channels.","Kojima, Akiko; Mi, Xinya; Fukushima, Yutaka; Ding, Wei-Guang; Omatsu-Kanbe, Mariko; Matsuura, Hiroshi",British journal of pharmacology,243,24

With the ongoing media coverage and spread of misinformation, public health authorities need to identify effective strategies and create culturally appropriate and evidence-based messaging that best encourage preventive health behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 sources of information and knowledge, and how US adults' knowledge may be associated with preventive health behaviors to help mitigate COVID-19 cases and deaths. DESIGN AND SETTING For this cross-sectional study, survey data pertaining to COVID-19 were collected via online platform, Qualtrics, in February and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS Data responses included 718 US adults from the February survey and 672 US adults from the May survey-both representative of the US adult population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 knowledge score, COVID-19 reliable sources of information, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The main findings showed that disseminating COVID-19 information across various sources, particularly television, health care providers, and health officials, to increase people's COVID-19 knowledge contributes to greater adherence to infection prevention behaviors. Across February and May 2020 survey data, participants 55 years and older and those with higher educational background reported a higher average COVID-19 knowledge score. In addition, among the racial and ethnic categories, Black/African American and Native American/Alaska Native participants reported a lower average COVID-19 knowledge score than white participants-signaling the need to establish COVID-19 communication that is culturally-tailored and community-based. Overall, health care authorities must deliver clear and concise messaging about the importance of adhering to preventive health behaviors, even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available to the general public. Health officials must also focus on increasing COVID-19 knowledge and dispelling misinformation.","Shafiq, Mehr; Elharake, Jad A; Malik, Amyn A; McFadden, SarahAnn M; Aguolu, Obianuju Genevieve; Omer, Saad B",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,243,7

However, end-of-life discussions can alleviate distress and uncertainties in both old and young adults, but only a minority uses this option in palliative care. Even in healthy populations, talking about death is often seen as alleviative and worthwhile, but rarely initiated. OBJECTIVE To investigate different psychological interventions (a) encouraging the readiness for end-of-life discussions and (b) changing death attitudes in healthy adults of different ages. METHODS 168 participants were randomized to four different interventions (IG1: value-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG2: motivation-based intervention with end-of-life perspective, IG3: combination of IG1 and IG2, CG: control group). Primary outcome was the readiness to engage in end-of-life topics. Secondary outcomes were fear of death, fear of dying and death acceptance. Assessments took place before, directly after the intervention and at 2 weeks of follow up. RESULTS IG2 and IG3 reported significantly more changes in the readiness to engage in end-of-life discussions than the CG (F[5.61, 307] = 4.83, p < 0.001, ηp2 = 0.081) directly after the intervention. The effect of IG3 remained stable at the follow-up. There were no significant effects of the interventions on end-of-life fears or death acceptance. Acceptability of the interventions was very high. CONCLUSIONS Short interventions can be useful to encourage end-of-life discussions and could be integrated in health care programs. The efficacy and effectiveness of these short interventions in palliative patients are currently examined.","von Blanckenburg, Pia; Leppin, Nico; Nagelschmidt, Katharina; Seifart, Carola; Rief, Winfried",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,243,16

Here, however, we show that some group 1 coronavirus spike proteins carry a furin enzyme recognition motif and can actually be cleaved, as demonstrated for a feline coronavirus. Interestingly, this feature can be lost during cell culture adaptation by a single mutation in the cleavage motif; this, however, preserves a heparan sulfate binding motif and renders infection by the virus heparan sulfate dependent.

Their prevalence negatively impacts work satisfaction. Prior research identified factors present when physicians perceive patients as difficult. Numerous variables are unrelated to vexing patient visits. Three additive patient characteristics predict difficult encounters: 1) depressive or anxiety comorbidity, 2) polysymptomatic patients, and 3) high symptom severity. The sole physician variable was their score on the Physician Belief Scale (PBS) which quantifies negative attitudes towards psychosocial problems. When all three patient predictors exist, high PBS scorers judge twice as many patients as difficult. Five clinic milieu variables correlated weakly with clinic satisfaction among primary care residents. They are: 1) minimal role conflict, 2) autonomy, 3) collegiality, 4) encouragement of professional growth, and 5) work group loyalty. ""Positive affect"" was among the strongest physician variables but the author labeled it a confounding variable. Finally, a small ""n"" QI study conducted in this author's residency explored the role of physician affectivity and identified additional physician characteristics and clinic milieu factors correlating with overall enjoyment of ambulatory clinic practice. Surprisingly, none of the five previously identified clinic milieu variables correlated directly with resident clinic satisfaction. ""Supportive staff cohesion"" was one milieu variable that correlated significantly with clinic satisfaction. Resident affective characteristics that significantly reduced clinic satisfaction were ""hostility"" and ""negative affectivity."" ""Joviality"" was positively related to clinic satisfaction. While patient variables are uncontrollable, it is plausible that by physicians changing their beliefs and affectivity the percentage of vexing visits could be cut in half improving work satisfaction.","Spruill, Timothy Eugene",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,243,31

The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of human saliva on the infectivity and survival of airborne virus and to compare it with those of artificial saliva and cell culture medium. A stock of MS2 bacteriophage was diluted in one of three nebulizer suspensions, aerosolized, size selected (100 to 450 nm) using a differential mobility analyzer, and collected onto gelatin filters. Uranine was used as a particle tracer. The resulting particle size distribution was measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. The amounts of infectious virus, total virus, and fluorescence in the collected samples were determined by infectivity assays, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and spectrofluorometry, respectively. For all nebulizer suspensions, the virus content generally followed a particle volume distribution rather than a number distribution. The survival of airborne MS2 was independent of particle size but was strongly affected by the type of nebulizer suspension. Human saliva was found to be much less protective than cell culture medium (i.e., 3% tryptic soy broth) and artificial saliva. These results indicate the need for caution when extrapolating laboratory results, which often use artificial nebulizer suspensions. To better assess the risk of airborne transmission of viral diseases in real-life situations, the use of natural suspensions such as saliva or respiratory mucus is recommended.","Zuo, Zhili; Kuehn, Thomas H; Bekele, Aschalew Z; Mor, Sunil K; Verma, Harsha; Goyal, Sagar M; Raynor, Peter C; Pui, David Y H",Applied and environmental microbiology,243,17

There are more than 150 different types of NMDs, where the common feature is the loss of muscle strength. These disorders are classified according to their neuroanatomical location, as motor neuron diseases, peripheral nerve diseases, neuromuscular junction diseases, and muscle diseases. Over the years, numerous studies have pointed to protein homeostasis as a crucial factor in the development of these fatal diseases. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a fundamental role in maintaining protein homeostasis, being involved in protein degradation, among other cellular functions. Through a cascade of enzymatic reactions, proteins are ubiquitinated, tagged, and translocated to the proteasome to be degraded. Within the ubiquitin system, we can find three main groups of enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzymes), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes), and E3 (ubiquitin-protein ligases). Only the ubiquitinated proteins with specific chain linkages (such as K48) will be degraded by the UPS. In this review, we describe the relevance of this system in NMDs, summarizing the UPS proteins that have been involved in pathological conditions and neuromuscular disorders, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), or Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), among others. A better knowledge of the processes involved in the maintenance of proteostasis may pave the way for future progress in neuromuscular disorder studies and treatments.","Bachiller, Sara; Alonso-Bellido, Isabel M; Real, Luis Miguel; Pérez-Villegas, Eva María; Venero, José Luis; Deierborg, Tomas; Armengol, José Ángel; Ruiz, Rocío",International journal of molecular sciences,243,1

The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of balloon-guiding catheter locations in patients treated for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke using mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The influence of the balloon-guiding catheter location (proximal, balloon-guiding catheter tip proximal to C1 vertebral body; distal, between the skull base and the C1 vertebral body) was analyzed in patients with acute anterior circulation stroke treated with stent-retriever thrombectomy. The baseline angiographic/clinical characteristics, time intervals, recanalization rates, and clinical outcomes were compared. RESULTS The clinical analysis included 102 patients (mean age, 69.5 ± 12.8 years; male/female ratio = 52:50). The balloon-guiding catheter was located distally in 49 patients and proximally in 53 patients for flow control and forced aspiration during stent retrieval. The puncture-to-recanalization time was shorter in the distal group than in the proximal group (40 versus 56 minutes, P = .02). Successful and complete recanalizations were more frequently achieved in the distal group compared with the proximal group (98.0% versus 75.5%. P = .003; 67.3% versus 45.3%, P = .04, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the distal catheterization location was independently associated with successful recanalization (adjusted OR, 13.4; 95% CI, 2.4-254.8; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Location of the balloon-guiding catheter has a significant impact on recanalization in patients with acute stroke. The balloon-guiding catheter should be positioned as distally as safely possible in the cervical ICA for maximally effective thrombectomy.","Jeong, D E; Kim, J W; Kim, B M; Hwang, W; Kim, D J",AJNR.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for use in deep-learning-based medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and classification.","Jiang, Yifan; Chen, Han; Loew, M H; Ko, Hanseok",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,243,1

METHODS Patients with ICH of the prospective UKER-ICH (Universitätsklinikum Erlangen Cohort of Patients With Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage) study (URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03183167) were analyzed by multivariable regression modeling and propensity score matching, and PHE volumes were volumetrically assessed. Outcomes comprised hematoma characteristics, the impact of continuation, discontinuation, and initiation of statins on peak PHE extent, and the influence of statin treatment on the occurrence of seizures, cardiovascular adverse events, and functional recovery after ICH. RESULTS A total of 1275 patients with ICH with information on statin treatment were analyzed. Statin treatment on hospital admission (21.7%) was associated with higher rates of lobar versus nonlobar ICH (odds ratio, 1.57 [1.03-2.40]; P=0.038). Initiation of statins after ICH was associated with increased peak PHE (β=0.12, SE=0.06, P=0.008), whereas continuation versus discontinuation of prior statin treatment was not significantly associated with edema formation (P>0.10). There were no significant differences in the incidence of remote symptomatic seizures according to statin exposure during follow-up (statins: 11.5% versus no statins: 7.8%, subdistribution hazard ratio: 1.15 [0.80-1.66]; P=0.512).

CONCLUSIONS Among statin users, lobar ICH occurs more frequently as compared with nonstatin users. While continuation of prior statin treatment appears to be safe regarding PHE formation, the initiation of statins during the first days after ICH may increase PHE extent. However, statins should be initiated thereafter (eg, at hospital discharge) to prevent cardiovascular events and potentially improve functional recovery.","Sprügel, Maximilian I; Kuramatsu, Joji B; Volbers, Bastian; Saam, Justina I; Sembill, Jochen A; Gerner, Stefan T; Balk, Stefanie; Hamer, Hajo M; Lücking, Hannes; Hölter, Philip; Nolte, Christian H; Scheitz, Jan F; Rocco, Andrea; Endres, Matthias; Huttner, Hagen B",Stroke,243,5

In this study, we tried to elucidate the possibility of using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as an alternative treatment of intermediate-stage HCC. METHODS Among 246 patients who were initially diagnosed with intermediate-stage HCC, 76 who were treated with TACE (TACE group) and 91 who were treated with RFA (RFA group) were enrolled in this study. The risk for survival was analyzed with the Cox Proportional Hazard Model, and the survival rates were compared using propensity score matching. RESULTS About half (50.6%) of the intermediate-stage HCC patients in the RFA group were diagnosed with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer substage-B1 (BCLC-B1) compared with only 19.7% of the patients in the TACE group. Survival of the RFA group was longer than that of TACE group in patients with BCLC-B1 and BCLC-B2. In contrast, no difference between groups was observed in patients with BCLC-B3/4. Multivariate analysis revealed that large tumor size (>30 mm, hazard ratio = 1.685, P = 0.043), high des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (>100 mAU/mL, hazard ratio = 1.920, P = 0.012), and TACE group (hazard ratio = 1.896, P = 0.016) were significant risk factors for survival. Overall 3-year survival of the patients in the RFA group (69.5%) was significantly longer than that of patients in the TACE group (51.5%) after propensity score matching (P = 0.032). No significant adverse events were observed in either group. CONCLUSIONS RFA was useful for the treatment of less advanced intermediate-stage HCC and could be an alternative to TACE in selected cases.","Nouso, Kazuhiro; Kariyama, Kazuya; Nakamura, Shinichiro; Oonishi, Ayano; Wakuta, Akiko; Oyama, Atsushi; Ako, Soichiro; Dohi, Chihiro; Wada, Nozomu; Morimoto, Yuki; Takeuchi, Yasuto; Kuwaki, Kenji; Onishi, Hideki; Ikeda, Fusao; Shiraha, Hidenori; Takaki, Akinobu; Okada, Hiroyuki",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,243,1

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The COVID-19 pandemic has extensively impacted global healthcare systems. We hypothesized that the degree of psychological impact would be higher for surgical providers deployed for COVID-19 work, certain surgical specialties, and for those who knew of someone diagnosed with, or who died, of COVID-19. METHODS We conducted a global web-based survey to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19. The primary outcomes were the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores. RESULTS 4283 participants from 101 countries responded. 32.8%, 30.8%, 25.9% and 24.0% screened positive for depression, anxiety, stress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) respectively. Respondents who knew someone who died of COVID-19 were more likely to screen positive for depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD (OR 1.3, 1,6, 1.4, 1.7 respectively, all p < 0.05). Respondents who knew of someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were more likely to screen positive for depression, stress and PTSD (OR 1.2, 1.2 and 1.3 respectively, all p < 0.05). Surgical specialities that operated in the Head and Neck region had higher psychological distress among its surgeons. Deployment for COVID-19-related work was not associated with increased psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic may have a mental health legacy outlasting its course. The long-term impact of this ongoing traumatic event underscores the importance of longitudinal mental health care for healthcare personnel, with particular attention to those who know of someone diagnosed with, or who died of COVID-19.","Tan, Yi Quan; Wang, Ziting; Yap, Qai Ven; Chan, Yiong Huak; Ho, Roger C; Hamid, Agus Rizal Ardy Hariandy; Landaluce-Olavarria, Aitor; Pellino, Gianluca; Gauhar, Vineet; Chand, Manish; Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Hameed, B M Zeeshan; Ling, Samuel Ka-Kin; Sengupta, Shomik; Gallo, Gaetano; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Tanidir, Yiloren; Tallada, M Pilar Villanova; Garcia, Bernardo Nunez; Colleoni, Ramiro; Abiddin, Zainal Adwin Zainal; Campi, Riccardo; Esperto, Francesco; Carrion, Diego; Elterman, Dean; Chung, Amanda Shu Jun; Ng, Anthony Chi Fai; Moschini, Marco; Rivas, Juan Gomez; Mayol, Julio; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Chiong, Edmund",Annals of surgery,243,8

PPARγ binds to DNA as a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor and it is activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, such as prostaglandins. In addition, the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone, are potent and specific activators of PPARγ. PPARγ is present along the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis and in the testis, where low levels in Leydig cells and higher levels in Sertoli cells as well as in germ cells have been found. High amounts of PPARγ were reported in the normal epididymis and in the prostate, but the receptor was almost undetectable in the seminal vesicles. Interestingly, in the human and in pig, PPARγ protein is highly expressed in ejaculated spermatozoa, suggesting a possible role of PPARγ signaling in the regulation of sperm biology. This implies that both natural and synthetic PPARγ ligands may act directly on sperm improving its performance. Given the close link between energy balance and reproduction, activation of PPARγ may have promising metabolic implications in male reproductive functions. In this review, we first describe PPARγ expression in different compartments of the male reproductive axis. Subsequently, we discuss the role of PPARγ in both physiological and several pathological conditions related to the male fertility.","Santoro, Marta; De Amicis, Francesca; Aquila, Saveria; Bonofiglio, Daniela",Human reproduction,243,25

Psychological therapies have been adapted to the treatment of disordered gut-brain interaction such as FD. OBJECTIVES We sought to determine if psychological interventions were efficacious in providing symptom management and improving health-related quality of life in patients suffering from FD. METHODS Data were sorted that belonged to Embase (1947-January 2020), PsychINFO (1806 - January 2020) and Ovid MEDLINE (1946-January 2020). Randomized controlled trials using a psychological intervention in adults meeting relevant diagnostic criteria for functional dyspepsia were included. Data including symptom scores and quality of life measures were extracted. A random-effect model meta-analysis with standardized mean differences was used. RESULTS Nine randomized controlled trials were identified that met our inclusion criteria. These were small, single-centered studies and used varying psychological therapies. Three studies had a sham treatment arm, leading to a high risk of bias in the remaining studies. All the studies reported beneficial effects of psychological treatment on patient's symptoms, some of which persisted up to one year. Psychological intervention was associated with an improvement in global FD symptom scores (SMD -1.33, 95% CI -1.97 to -0.68). CONCLUSIONS Despite the limited data, the available evidence suggests that psychological therapy is beneficial in treating patients with FD and should be considered by treating physicians if available and patients are willing. Large well-designed, sham controlled trials are needed for this extremely common disorder.","Rodrigues, David M; Motomura, Douglas I; Tripp, Dean A; Beyak, Michael J",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,243,17

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health problem. A fraction of the population is at increased risk of developing complications of this disease, in particular older subjects as well as diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients. With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials. So far the findings regarding this question are reassuring, whether these patients are treated or not. There seems to be no reason to worry when using blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. The observations available to date suggest that COVID-19 vaccine can be administered safely to hypertensive patients. In conclusion, there is no reason to implement changes in the care of hypertensive patients due to the pandemic.","Wuerzner, Grégoire; Waeber, Bernard",Praxis,243,30

While healthcare systems need to cope with the need to treat a large number of people with different degrees of respiratory failure, actions to preserve aliquots of the healthcare system to guarantee treatment to patients are mandatory. METHODS In order to protect the Fondazione IRCCS-Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Milano from the spread of COVID-19, a number of to-hospital and within-hospital filters were applied. Among others, a triage process to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positivity in patients with cancer was developed consisting of high-resolution low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan followed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nose-throat swabs whenever CT was suggestive of lung infection. To serve symptomatic patients who were already admitted to the hospital or in need of hospitalization while waiting for RT-PCR laboratory confirmation of infection, a COVID-19 surveillance zone was set up. RESULTS A total of 301 patients were screened between March 6 and April 3, 2020. Of these, 47 were hospitalized, 53 needed a differential diagnosis to continue with their cancer treatment, and 201 were about to undergo surgery. RT-PCR was positive in 13 of 40 hospitalized patients (32%), 14 of 52 day hospital patients (27%), and 6 of 201 surgical patients (3%). CONCLUSION Applying filters to protect our comprehensive cancer center from COVID-19 spread contributed to guaranteeing cancer care during the COVID-19 crisis in Milan.

The article provides an overview of the status quo of currently available virus-based therapeutics. Expert Opinion: The efficacy of virus-based therapies has been emphasized repeatedly in the clinical trials for virotherapy, gene delivery and virus-like particles (VLPs), with multiple therapeutics approved and marketed. Compared with chemical and biological drugs, viruses represent a unique ""research niche"".

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January and May 2009, 16 adult males presenting with acute scrotum underwent StO2% measurement of the affected and unaffected testis using near infrared spectroscopy followed by color Doppler ultrasound. If surgically explored, near infrared spectroscopy was performed at surgery and on postoperative day 1. Data were presented as means ± SD and/or normalized to the internal control. Cutoff value was generated for the StO2% difference between the affected testis and control side. RESULTS Sixteen males with acute scrotum of mean duration 12 hours were enrolled. Of 11 patients with abnormal Doppler undergoing surgical exploration, mean StO2% of the affected testis at presentation and at surgery decreased from 40.09 ± 2.66 (range 36 to 44) to 37.18 ± 3.31 (range 32 to 42), respectively, while StO2% of the unaffected testis remained 63.09 (range 55 to 69) both at presentation (SD 4.72) and at surgery (SD 4.98). Of the 11 surgically explored, 4 had orchiectomy and 7 patients underwent surgical detorsion. At presentation and at surgical exploration of the detorsed group, the mean normalized difference between the StO2% values of the affected and unaffected sides was -16.12 and -25.9, respectively. A cutoff value of -11.5 was measured for the StO2% difference between the affected testis and control side at presentation in patients who underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS Near infrared spectroscopy identified all surgically confirmed cases of testicular torsion when affected testis StO2% was more than 11.5 units lower than the contralateral testis. In pilot testing, near infrared spectroscopy is a rapid, noninvasive, easy and safe method for the differential diagnosis of adult human testicular torsion.","Burgu, Berk; Aydogdu, Ozgu; Huang, Rong; Soygur, Tarkan; Yaman, Onder; Baker, Linda",The Journal of urology,243,1

Since the reproduction number is below the mortality rate, there is a decrease in rhinos year over year, urgently requiring changes and saving the survivors. In this study, the efficacy of medical grade honey (MGH) for wound care in rhinos was investigated. We presented a case series of seven rhinos with wounds of different etiologies, including gunshots and poaching. Four wounds were around the horns and three on the limbs. It was a challenge to take care and follow-up the wounds of these wild animals in their natural habitat. A well-balanced decision between the need of treatment and risk of immobilization is constantly evaluated. In the presented cases, MGH proved a novel tool with minimal intervention and maximal effectiveness. With the severity of the wounds taken into consideration, there was a rapid healing in all cases, while infection resolved when present. MGH creates a moist and anti-inflammatory wound environment, while promoting almost all aspects in the wound healing processes, such as autolytic debridement, angiogenesis and re-epithelialization. The efficacy of MGH has constantly been confirmed in other cases and literature as well. MGH forms a potent therapy for treating wounded rhinos, independent of the severity of the wound. The strong antimicrobial and healing properties make it an easy and versatile product that can be used in all kinds of wounds.","Marais, Hendrik J; Glyphis, Zoe G; Cremers, Niels A J",Veterinary and animal science,243,27

Nonetheless, the lignocellulose saccharification process, to release sugars for downstream applications, is one of the most crucial challenging economic factors. The synergism required among the various carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) for efficient lignocellulose breakdown is often not satisfactorily achieved with an enzyme mixture from a single strain. To overcome this challenge enrichment strategies can be applied to develop microbial communities with an efficient CAZymes arsenal, incorporating complementary and synergistic properties, to improve lignocellulose deconstruction. We report a comprehensive and deep analysis of an enriched rumen anaerobic consortium (ERAC) established on sugarcane bagasse (SB). The lignocellulolytic abilities of ERAC were confirmed by analyzing the depolymerization of bagasse by scanning electron microscopy, enzymatic assays, and mass spectrometry. Taxonomic analysis based on 16S sequencing elucidated the community enrichment process, which was marked by a higher abundance of Firmicutes and Synergistetes species. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of ERAC disclosed 41 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), harboring cellulosomes and polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs), along with a high diversity of CAZymes. The majority of the CAZymes predicted (60 % of the total) shared less than 90 % amino acid identity compared to sequences found in public databases. Additionally, a clostridial MAG identified in this study produces proteins during consortia development with scaffoldin domains and CAZymes appended to dockerin modules, thus representing a novel cellulosome-producing microorganism.IMPORTANCE The lignocellulolytic ERAC displays a unique set of plant polysaccharide degrading enzymes (with multimodular characteristics), cellulosomal complexes, and PULs. The MAGs described herein represent an expansion of the genetic content of rumen bacterial genomes dedicated to plant polysaccharides degradation, therefore providing a valuable resource for the development of biocatalytic toolbox strategies to be applied towards lignocellulose-based biorefineries.","Tomazetto, Geizecler; Pimentel, Agnes C; Wibberg, Daniel; Dixon, Neil; Squina, Fabio M",Applied and environmental microbiology,243,1

Early vascular remodelling and epigenetic changes occurring on key endothelial genes might precede this altered vascular function. Further, it has been proposed that oxidative stress during development may determine some of these epigenetic modifications. To address this issue, we studied the in vivo and ex vivo vascular function and Nos3 promoter DNA methylation in arteries from eight-months-old guinea pig born from control, FGR and FGR-NAC treated pregnancies. METHODS Femoral and carotid arteries in vivo vascular function was determined by Doppler, whilst ex vivo vascular function and biomechanical properties were assessed by wire-myography. Levels of eNOS mRNA and site-specific DNA methylation in Nos3 promoter in aorta endothelial cells (AEC) were determined by qPCR and pyrosequencing, respectively. RESULTS FGR-adult showed an increased femoral vascular resistance (p < 0.05), stiffness (p < 0.05) and arterial remodelling (p < 0.01), along with an impaired NO-mediated relaxation (p < 0.001). These effects were prevented by maternal treatment with NAC. Endothelial-NOS mRNA levels were decreased in FGR-adult compared to control and FGR-NAC (p < 0.05), associated with increased DNA methylation levels (p < 0.01). Comparison of Nos3 DNA methylation in AEC showed a differential methylation pattern between fetal and adult guinea pigs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Altogether, this data suggests that adult vascular dysfunction in the FGR does not result from early changes in Nos3 promoter DNA methylation, but from an altered vessel structure established during fetal development.

Gastrointestinal weight loss surgery (GIWLS) shows the most promise in achieving significant and sustained weight loss and diabetes resolution. However, a large mismatch exists between the magnitude of the obesity epidemic and the number of surgical procedures performed to produce a significant shift in the distribution of obesity on a population level. This mismatch is fueled by high surgical costs, morbidity and mortality associated with surgical interventions, and the fact that the greatest public health burden of obesity comes from those around the center of the population body mass index distribution with mild to moderate obesity, rather than those at the distribution tail with severe obesity that GIWLS targets. New endoscopic methods, capitalizing on advances in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms by which GIWLS works, are developing to provide viable alternatives in the treatment of bariatric surgical complications, and for the primary treatment of obesity. These methods may have the added advantage of reduced invasiveness, reversibility, cost-effectiveness, and applicability to a larger segment of the population with moderate obesity.","Abu Dayyeh, Barham K; Thompson, Christopher C",Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,243,19

The underlying mechanism of SCF is similar to coronary atherosclerosis. Free radical damage may be responsible for the pathology. In this study, we aimed to investigate ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels and differences with regard to total antioxidant status (TAS) between patients with normal coronary arteries and patients with SCF without significant stenosis. METHODS Thirty patients who were diagnosed with SCF using coronary angiography were included in this cross-sectional observational study (13 male; mean age, 56±10 years). The control group consisted of 30 patients who had normal coronary arteries as shown by coronary angiography (13 male; mean age, 53±11 years). In this study, we assessed serum IMA levels, albumin-adjusted IMA and TAS. The Student t-test was used to compare serum IMA levels and TAS between the two groups. Pearson's correlation test was used to explore the relationship between TAS and serum IMA levels. RESULTS Serum IMA levels and albumin-adjusted IMA were similar in both groups (p=0.432, p=0.349). The mean value of TAS was significantly lower in the SCF group compared to control group (p=0.011). The TAS was negatively correlated with the levels of IMA and albumin-adjusted IMA in the SCF group (r=-0.457, p=0.011; r=-0.509, p=0.004). CONCLUSION This study shows that serum IMA levels and albumin-adjusted IMA were similar between the groups, however the mean value of TAS was significantly lower in the SCF group compared to control group and negatively correlated with IMA. These results are important in terms of understanding the pathophysiological basis of SCF.","Koç, Fatih; Erdem, Sami; Altunkaş, Fatih; Ozbek, Kerem; Gül, Enes Elvin; Kurban, Sevil; Taşyürek, Erkan; Erbay, Ekrem; Söğüt, Erkan",Anadolu kardiyoloji dergisi : AKD = the Anatolian journal of cardiology,243,1

Beside primary mutations, the effect of secondary mtDNA mutations in still unclear. We examined the effect of secondary mtDNA mutations on secondary structure of different mitochondrial RNAs. Whole mitochondrial genome sequence of LHON patients has been obtained from in six non related pedigrees by Sanger sequencing method. The effect of mutations located in mitochondrial RNA genes was examined by creating in silico models of RNA secondary structure, accompanied by sequence conservation analysis. All three primary LHON mutations (m.3460G > A, m.11778G > A and m.14,484 T > C) were revealed in study families. Four mutations in MT-RNR1 gene (m.750 A > G, m.956delC, m.1438 A > G and m.1555 A > G) were identified and only a m.1555 A > G causes significant changes of secondary structure of mitochondrial 12 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Five mutations (m.1811A > G, m.2706 A > G, m.2831G > A, m.3010G > A and m.3197 T > C) were discovered in MT-RNR2 gene and all of them induced substantial alterations of mitochondrial 16 S rRNA secondary structure. A single insertion variant (m.15986insG) has been found in the MT-TP gene which encodes mitochondrial transfer RNA for Proline (tRNA Pro). This mutation does not cause substantial changes of tRNA Pro secondary structure. Most of the mutation loci exhibited high level of sequence conservation. Presence of multiple mutations in a single family can either be of no influence on secondary RNA structure, or it can be a correctable factor for some deleterious effects of individual mutations. The effect of discovered mutations on in silico modeled RNA structure is in a significant correlation with the present knowledge about the potential of these mutation to participate in the pathophysiology of LHON and other human diseases. The presence of certain multiple mitochondrial RNA mutations could be a possible explanation of LHON clinical presentation in some families. All revealed mutations have been evaluated for the first time in terms of in silico structural modeling. The application of bioinformatics tools such as secondary RNA structure prediction can have a great advantage in better understanding of the molecular standpoint of the LHON pathophysiology and clinical phenotype.","Rovcanin, Branislav; Jancic, Jasna; Samardzic, Janko; Rovcanin, Marija; Nikolic, Blazo; Ivancevic, Nikola; Novakovic, Ivana; Kostic, Vladimir",Experimental eye research,243,24

We aimed to evaluate these criteria for the assessment of GERD and to measure interassessor agreement. METHODS We performed a post hoc analysis of data from the Diamond study (NCT 00291746), conducted in Europe and Canada on adults with frequent upper gastrointestinal symptoms who had not taken a proton pump inhibitor in the previous 2 months. GERD was diagnosed based on the presence of 1 or more of the following: reflux esophagitis, pathologic esophageal acid exposure, and/or positive symptom-acid association probability. Nonerosive reflux disease was defined as the presence of pathologic esophageal acid exposure and/or a positive symptom-acid association probability, but no reflux esophagitis. Biopsies collected from 336 patients from 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm above the Z line were evaluable; they were analyzed independently at pathology centers in Germany and Italy (biopsies from 258 and 195 patients, respectively). The primary outcomes were the accuracy of histologic criteria for the diagnosis of GERD, defined by endoscopy and pH monitoring, and interassessor agreement on histologic criteria. RESULTS At the assessment site for basal cell layer thickness, total epithelial thickness was the best-performing criterion for diagnosis of investigation-defined GERD; it also identified nonerosive reflux disease, reflux esophagitis, and pathologic esophageal acid exposure at 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm above the Z line. Basal cell layer thickness and presence of dilated intercellular spaces did not identify patients with GERD. Among the criteria tested, the best agreement between assessments carried out at the 2 pathology centers was for total epithelial thickness at 0.5 cm and 2.0 cm above the Z line. CONCLUSIONS Based on an analysis of 336 patients with frequent upper gastrointestinal symptoms, total epithelial thickness is a robust histologic marker for GERD.","Vieth, Michael; Mastracci, Luca; Vakil, Nimish; Dent, John; Wernersson, Börje; Baldycheva, Irina; Wissmar, Jenny; Ruth, Magnus; Fiocca, Roberto",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,243,1

We examined, for the first time, whether the COVID-19 threat perception is related to attitudes towards Syrian refugees in Turkey, theorizing a dual pathway whereby pandemic-induced threat would relate to both pro- and anti-immigrant feelings. Drawing upon integrated threat theory and models of collective-threat regulation, we expected that pandemic threat would lead to more exclusionary outgroup attitudes through increased immigrant threat, whereas we argued that perceived COVID-19 threat would promote inclusionary attitudes through creating a common ingroup in the face of a global threat. Using online search volume data at the province level (Study 1, N = 81) and self-reporting measures at the individual level (Study 2, N = 294), we found that the COVID-19 threat was directly associated with more positive attitudes towards refugees (Study 1 and 2). Study 2 further revealed indirect positive (through a sense of common identity) and negative (through perceptions of immigrant threat) links between COVID-19 threat perception and outgroup attitudes. These results highlight the importance of integrating threat regulation and social identity perspectives when assessing the implications of pathogen-related threats.","Adam-Troian, J.; Bagci, S.

These disruptions included restricting human movement through local &#x2018;`lockdowns&#x2019;'. This paper applies a multi-temporal analysis of Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) to evaluate the relationship between restrictions on movement and solid waste production in landfill sites. We selected three landfill sites from Africa, Euro-Asia, and America to assess the impact of restricted mobility on waste production. Our research shows that solid waste production and restrictions on human mobility are significantly correlated. Our study indicates that a reduction in human mobility increases human waste production even after accounting for changes in economic activities. The research highlights the benefit of using remote sensing SAR data for monitoring the impact of human activities on the environment. The use of remote sensing data is crucial for these applications, given that the outcomes might be counter-intuitive.

We explored gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men's [GBMSM] preferences for in-person, telephone, and online provision of sexual healthcare and whether preferences change in the presence of symptoms and/or concerns about STI risk. Methods Cross-sectional online survey of GBMSM in Scotland recruited from sexual-social media 12/2019-03/2020 (pre- Covid-19 pandemic). Participants were asked their preferences (or no preference) for accessing appointment booking, providing sexual/medical history, and accessing HIV/STI results in two scenarios: routine check-up (no symptoms/concerns);and concerned about new symptoms/possible infection. Data were analysed using Pearson chi-squared, McNemar-Bowker, and post-hoc McNemar tests. Results 755 GBMSM participated, median age 39, 71.4% completed higher education, 69.9% were White Scottish. When accessing a routine check-up, proportions preferring in person, telephone and online care respectively were: booking appointments [27/755 (3.6%), 113/755 (15.0%), 520/755 (68.9%)];reporting sexual behaviour [184/748 (24.6%), 39/ 748 (5.2%), 382/748 (51.1%)];reporting symptoms [254/747 (34.0%), 46/747 (6.2%), 308/747 (41.2%)];reporting medication [163/745 (21.9%), 46/745 (6.2%), 358/745 (48.1%)];receiving HIV results [200/699 (28.6%), 73/699 (10.4%), 304/ 699 (43.5%)];receiving STI results [143/746 (19.2%), 96/746 (12.9%), 361/746 (48.4%)]. A significant proportion of participants' preferences changed across all elements of care measured, when concerned about symptoms or infection (p<0.005). Post-hoc analyses suggest that these changes were mostly attributed to a shift in preference from online to inperson care in the presence of symptoms/STI risk. Conclusions In this online-recruited sample of highly educated, older GBMSM, online care was highly acceptable but a significant proportion preferred in-person care in the presence of symptoms/STI risk. Choice in sexual healthcare provision is essential as GBMSM's preferences are not static and appear highly associated with emotional context..","Kincaid, R.; Estcourt, C.; Gibbs, J.; Dalrymple, J.; Frankis, J.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,243,1

Though the vaccination process has started, in developing countries such as India, the process has not been fully developed. Thereby, a diagnosis of COVID-19 can restrict its spreading and level the pestilence curve. As the quickest indicative choice, a computerized identification framework ought to be carried out to hinder COVID-19 from spreading more. Meanwhile, Computed Tomography (CT) imaging reveals that the attributes of these images for COVID-19 infected patients vary from healthy patients with or without other respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia. This study aims to establish an effective COVID-19 prediction model through chest CT images using efficient transfer learning (TL) models. Initially, we used three standard deep learning (DL) models, namely, VGG-16, ResNet50, and Xception, for the prediction of COVID-19. After that, we proposed a mechanism to combine the above-mentioned pre-trained models for the overall improvement of the prediction capability of the system. The proposed model provides 98.79% classification accuracy and a high F1-score of 0.99 on the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 CT dataset. The model proposed in this study is effective for the accurate screening of COVID-19 CT scans and, hence, can be a promising supplementary diagnostic tool for the forefront clinical specialists.","Biswas, Shreya Chatterjee Somnath Majee Arindam Sen Shibaprasad Schwenker Friedhelm Sarkar Ram",Applied Sciences,243,1

Hospitalized patients were managed based on national government guidelines. Focusing on moderate patients, i.e., whose oxygen saturation levels were favorable even if presenting characteristics in computed tomography, we conducted a retrospective analysis in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients compared with a control. Of a study total of 102 patients (male 51%, aged 62.2±16.0, BMI 27.6±5.2), 49% were T2D patients (aged 71.2±13.8, A1c 6.8±1.3%, BMI 24.5±5.2). Twenty-five patients (24.5%) moved to the severe classification. Eighteen patients (17.6%) (aged 74.8±8.6, A1c 6.9±1.0%, BMI 24.3±2.5), of whom 88.9% had T2D (aged 76.1±10.2, A1c 6.7±1.1%, BMI 23.8±10.2), were ventilated and transferred to another hospital for advanced treatment. Seven patients (6.9%), of whom 71.4% had T2D, died (aged 85±3.4) after ventilation was declined by the families due to advanced age and dementia. One scleroderma patient on home oxygen therapy for intestinal pneumonia died of sudden respiratory failure. Twenty-five diabetes patients (24.5%) improved. No significant correlation exists between hypertension, body mass index, lung disease, renal failure and receiving insulin therapy. In our study, 88% of moderate patients moving to the severe classification had T2D. In Japanese, diabetes may constitute a much larger risk factor than those factors identified in other countries in the evolution of COVID-19 patients from the moderate to severe classifications.

Health protocols are needed to prevent the spread, including wearing a face mask. Enforcing people to wear face masks is tiring. AI can be used to classify images for face mask detection. There are a lot of image classification algorithm for face mask detection, but there are still no studies that compare their performance. Objective: This study aims to compare the classification algorithms of classical machine learning. They are k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and a widely used deep learning algorithm for image classification which is convolutional neural network (CNN) for face masks detection. Methods: This study uses 5 and 3 cross-validation for assessing the performance of KNN, SVM, and CNN in face mask detection. Results: CNN has the best average performance with the accuracy of 0.9683 and average execution time of 2,507.802 seconds for classifying 3,725 faces with mask and 3,828 faces without mask images. Conclusion: For a large amount of image data, KNN and SVM can be used as temporary algorithms in face mask detection due to their faster execution times. At the same time, CNN can be trained to form a classification model. In this case, it is advisable to use CNN for classification because it has better performance than KNN and SVM. In the future, the classification model can be implemented for automatic alert system to detect and warn people who are not wearing face masks.","Naufal, Mohammad Farid; Kusuma, Selvia Ferdiana; Prayuska, Zefanya Ardya; Yoshua, Ang Alexander; Lauwoto, Yohanes Albert; Dinata, Nicky Setyawan; Sugiarto, David; en,",Journal Of Information Systems Engineering And Business Intelligence,243,1

Understanding virus diversity in livestock is important for identifying potential zoonotic threats and for ensuring animal health and safe livestock production. Here, we report viral metagenomic characterization of chicken feces (N=51) and paired farm dust samples (N=13) using metagenomic deep sequencing. Samples were collected at 4-5 time points in three broiler farms in the Netherlands. Viruses in the Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae families were the most prevalent, detected in all feces and dust samples and in all feces and 85% of dust samples, respectively. Virus composition found in chicken feces and corresponding dust samples were similar. Great genomic diversity was identified in Picornaviridae and 46 sequences from five picornavirus genera (Sicinivirus, Megrivirus, Anatvirus, Gallivirus and Avisvirus) were detected. For calicivirus, Basovirus and an unclassified novel chicken calicivirus were identified in 13 fecal and 1 dust samples. Two distinct types of chicken astroviruses were identified. Phylogenetic analyses of identified virus sequences from Picornaviridae, Astroviridae and Caliciviridae suggested that viral sequences obtained from different farms are often more closely related to each other than global reference sequences, and sequences from feces and paired dust samples also clustered together. Importantly, our sequencing methodology enabled the recover viral genome sequences from farm dusts, allowing the tracking of virus chatter between livestock animals and their farm environment. This study, albeit relative sample size, does expand current knowledge of virus communities in chickens and surrounding dusts. IMPORTANCE Chickens may harbor various zoonotic pathogens, some of which can cause severe clinical outcomes in animals and humans. Farm dust can act as vector to facilitate zoonoses transmission. Here, we report the metagenomic characterization of virus communities of chicken feces and paired farm dust samples collected at multiple time points during the production cycle in broiler farms in the Netherlands. Parvoviridae and Picornaviridae were most frequently detected. We also identified novel astrovirus and calicivirus sequences that would inform future virus taxonomy classification. This is the first study to characterize virus communities in farmed chickens and paired farm dust samples. We also describe a dust sequencing strategy that can be adapted for future dust metagenomic characterization. Our study could help setting up a surveillance baseline for tracking virus flow between chickens and their farm environment which could guide zoonotic outbreak preparedness and health risk assessment of farm exposure.","Kwok, Kirsty T.

Methods: Veterans and service members with PTSD (n=158) who failed previous antidepressant treatment were randomized to 8 infusions administered twice weekly of intravenous placebo (n=54), low dose (0.2mg/kg; n=53) or standard dose (0.5mg/kg; n=51) ketamine. Participants were assessed at baseline, during treatment, and for 4 weeks after their last infusion. Primary analyses used mixed effects models. The primary outcome measure was the self-report PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and secondary outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results: There were no significant group-by-time interactions for PTSD symptoms measured by the PCL-5 or CAPS-5. The standard dose ketamine significantly reduced symptoms after the first infusion, while the low dose showed significant symptom reduction after the last infusion and at the 4-week follow-up. The standard ketamine dose also significantly ameliorated depression measured by the MADRS. Ketamine produced dose-related dissociative and psychotomimetic effects, which returned to baseline within 2 hours and were less pronounced with repeated administration. There was no evidence of differential treatment discontinuation by ketamine dose, consistent with good tolerability. Conclusions: This clinical trial failed to find a significant dose-related effect of ketamine on PTSD symptoms. Secondary analyses suggested that the low dose reduced PTSD symptoms and the standard dose exerted rapid antidepressant effects. Further studies are needed to determine the role of ketamine in PTSD treatment.

Modularity and composability are considered necessary network features for large-scale collaborative efforts to build comprehensive molecular descriptions of disease mechanisms. An effective way to create and manage large systems is to compose multiple subsystems. Composable network components could effectively harness the contributions of many individuals and enable teams to seamlessly assemble many individual components into comprehensive maps. We examine manually-built versions of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade from the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network, PANTHER and Reactome databases and review them in terms of their reusability and composability for assembling new disease models. We identify design principles for managing complex systems that could make it easier for investigators to share and reuse network components. We demonstrate the main challenges including incompatible levels of detail and ambiguous representation of complexes and highlight the need to address these challenges.","Mazein, Alexander; Rougny, Adrien; Karr, Jonathan R.; Rodriguez, Julio Saez; Ostaszewski, Marek; Schneider, Reinhard",bioRxiv,243,16

Methods The FASTA sequence (NC_045512.2) of each of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 genes was retrieved from NCBI.nlm.nih.gov/gene and the Ensembl.org library interrogated for any base-pair match with human ncRNA genes. SARS-CoV-2 gene-matched human ncRNAs were screened for functional activity using bioinformatic analysis. Finally, associations between identified ncRNAs and human diseases were searched in GWAS databases. Results A total of 252 matches were found between the nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-2 genes and human ncRNAs. With the exception of two small nuclear RNAs, all of them were long non-coding (lnc)RNAs expressed mainly in testis and central nervous system under physiological conditions. The percentage of alignment ranged from 91.30% to 100% with a mean nucleotide alignment length of 17.5 ± 2.4. Thirty-three (13.9%) of them contained predicted R-loop forming sequences, but none of these intersected the complementary sequences of SARS-CoV-2. However, in 31 cases matches fell on ncRNA regulatory sites, whose adjacent coding genes are mostly involved in cancer, immunological and neurological pathways. Similarly, several polymorphic variants of detected non-coding genes have been associated with neuropsychiatric and proliferative disorders. Conclusion This pivotal in silico study shows that SARS-CoV-2 genes have Watson-Crick nucleotide complementarity to human ncRNA sequences, potentially disrupting ncRNA epigenetic control of target genes. It remains to be elucidated whether this could result in the development of human disease in the long term.","Talotta, Rossella; Bahrami, Shervin; Laska, Magdalena Janina",,243,1

It has caused outbreaks of illness due to person-to-person transmission of the virus mainly via close contacts and droplets produced by an infected person’s cough or sneeze. Although aerosol therapy is a mainstay procedure for treating obstructive airway diseases at home and healthcare settings, there is concern about the hypothesized enhanced risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the form of aerosolised respiratory droplets during the nebulised treatment of patients with COVID-19. Consequently, the use of hand-held inhalers, particularly pressurised metered dose inhalers, has risen considerably as an alternative to nebulisers, which has led to inadequate supplies in some countries. However, switching to hand-held inhalers may result in unintended consequences for some patients, who may be unable to adequately use their new device or benefit fully from treatment via hand-held inhalers. Furthermore, there is no evidence supporting an increased risk of viral transmission during nebulisation in COVID-19 patients. Thus, there is no compelling reason to alter aerosol modality for patients with established nebuliser-based regimens. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the current evidence and understanding of the use of aerosol therapies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to provide some guidance on the measures to be taken to minimise the hypothetical enhanced risk of infection, if any, during aerosol therapies.","Lavorini, F.; Pregliasco, F.",Rassegna di Patologia dell&#039;Apparato Respiratorio,243,24

Design/methodology/approach: These research data are from a survey of Vietnamese customers. The survey was deployed to a sample of 238 and 218 customers of 20 Vietnamese commercial banks via email in 2018Q4 and 2020Q2, respectively. FP is measured using banks’ quarterly financial statements before Covid-19 and during the lockdown. Findings: CE with DB had a significant and positive impact on FP via customer satisfaction before Covid-19, while the other two intermediate variables (word-of-mouth [WoM] and trust) had no considerable impact. During the lockdown, only WoM had a positive impact on FP. These findings indicate that before Covid-19, when customers could easily interact with their bank through many touchpoints, customer satisfaction with DB services created higher FP for the bank. However, during the lockdown, DB became the customer’s main touchpoint and WoM mediated the CE–FP relationship. Originality/value: During the national lockdown from the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in January 2020, customers in Vietnam may have had different experiences with DB when no alternate modes of payment were available. The study uses Covid-19 as a moderator variable to offer different viewpoints and findings related to CE with DB and its impact on FP. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Nguyen, N. T.

Chitin is a major component of the cuticle and it is synthesized by the enzyme chitin synthase. There is a single chitin synthase gene (kkv) in Drosophila facilitating research on the function of chitin. Previous editing of kkv lead to the recovery of a viable hypomorphic allele. Experiments described in this paper argue that a reduction in chitin synthase leads to the shafts of sensory bristles becoming fragile and frequently breaking off as the animals age. This is likely due to reduced chitin levels and further suggests that chitin plays a role in resilience of insect cuticle. The different layers in cuticle are continuous across the many epidermal cells that secrete the cuticle that covers the body. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this continuity. Using genetic mosaics and scanning electron microscopy this paper establishes that kkv shows short range cell non-autonomy. It also provides evidence for 2 possible mechanisms. One is the intercellular transfer of Kkv protein from one cell to its neighbors and the second is the deposition of cuticular material across the boundaries of neighboring cells.,"Adler, Paul N.",bioRxiv,243,16

Patients and methods: We conducted a nationwide online survey among adult patients with PACS as defined by symptoms persisting over 4 weeks following a confirmed or probable COVID-19, without any identified alternative diagnosis. Information concerning PACS symptoms, vaccine type and scheme and its effect on PACS symptoms were studied. Results: Six hundred and twenty surveys were completed and 567 satisfied the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Respondents were 83.4% of women of median age 44 (IQR 25-75: 37-50). Initial infection was proven in 365 patients (64%) and 5.1% had been hospitalized to receive oxygen. 396 patients had received at least one injection of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at the time of the survey, after a median of 357 [198-431] days following the initially-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 380 patients who reported persistent symptoms at the time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, 201 (52.8%) reported variation of symptoms following the injection, without difference based on the type of vaccine used. After a complete vaccination scheme, 93.3% (28/30) of initially seronegative patients reported a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. 170 PACS patients had not been vaccinated. The most common reasons for postponing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were a fear of worsening PACS symptoms (55.9%) and the idea that vaccination was contraindicated because of PACS (15.6%). Conclusion: Our study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is well tolerated in the majority of PACS patients and has good immunogenicity. Disseminating these reassuring data might prove crucial to increase vaccine coverage in patients with PACS.","SCHERLINGER, M.; Pijnenburg, L.; Chatelus, E.; Arnaud, L.; Gottenberg, J.-E.; Sibilia, J.; Felten, R.",,243,25

When mechanical ventilation and prone position cannot reverse the fatal hypoxia—extra-corporeal-membrane-oxygenation (ECMO) will be applied as a salvage treatment if available. Here, we report a novel coronavirus 2019 pneumonia (NCP) patient, a male, 67 years old, who was treated with ECMO for 30 days. In the midst, bronchoscopy was utilized to comprehend the airway lesions and clear secretions. And computed tomography (CT) scans were performed before and after the treatment of ECMO. In the recovering phase of his disease, the patient experienced multiple times pneumothorax on both sides. Some newly developed lung bullae in the subpleural area and modest bronchiectasis were found by the CT scan. The newly developed lung bullae was the probable cause of pneumothorax. Notably, in the whole process of his illness, the serum IL-6 only had a slight elevation in the early period, there is no typical cytokine storm as that was seen in non-COVID-19 ARDS. After 3-months meticulous treatment, the patient made a full recovery and now is discharged from our hospital. Though COVID-19 may not cause typical cytokine storm, the inflammation in lung may inflict severe damage to lung. Severe NCP may cause lung bullae and bronchiectasis, making the patients hard to be weaned from mechanical ventilation or ECMO.

Methods: We compared 130 cases evaluated for medical liability from March 2020 to January 2021 and compared with 159 cases from March 2019 to January 2020. The cases were divided in four pre-established groups: surgical error, diagnostic/therapeutic errors and nosocomial diseases, delays, and problems related to assistance. Results: Analysis showed a significant increase in cases due to delay in treatment/hospitalization and shortages in health care of non-autonomous patients [chi(2) (1, N = 289) = 5.6746, p = 0.02]. Conclusions: The work showed an increase in medical/legal cases regarding non-COVID-19 emergencies in which the outcome is related to the time of treatment and/or arrival at the hospital. There was also a rise in complaints of deficits in supervision and care for non-autonomous patients. Despite the persistence of preventive measures for the current pandemic, measures should be taken to improve health care in these categories of patients.","Nioi, M.; Napoli, P.

Data were obtained from 16 young healthy adults (12 women, four men; mean [SD] age 23.0 [2.6] years). Motor evoked potentials were recorded from the resting vastus medialis, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, medial and lateral hamstring, and medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscles on the right side of the body using bipolar surface electrodes. TMS was delivered through a 110-mm double-cone coil at 63 sites over the left hemisphere. Location and size of the cortical representation and the number of discrete peaks were quantified for each muscle. Within the quadriceps muscle group there was a main effect of muscle on anterior-posterior centre of gravity (p = 0.010), but the magnitude of the difference was very small. Within the quadriceps there was a main effect of muscle on medial-lateral hotspot (p = 0.027) and map volume (p = 0.047), but no post-hoc tests were significant. The topography of each lower-limb muscle was complex, displaying multiple peaks that were present across the stimulation grid, and variable across individuals. The results of this study indicate that TMS delivered with a 110-mm double-cone coil could not reliably identify discrete cortical representations of resting lower-limb muscles when responses were measured using bipolar surface electromyography. The characteristics of the cortical representation of lower-limb muscles reported here provide a basis against which to evaluate cortical reorganisation in clinical populations.","Davies, Jennifer L",bioRxiv,243,1

The cumulative numbers of cases and deaths, as of July 25th, 2021, recorded in the 33 areas of Montreal are modelled through a bivariate hierarchical Bayesian model using Poisson distributions. The Poisson means are decomposed in the log scale as the sums of fixed effects and latent effects. The areal median age, the educational level, and the number of beds in long-term care homes are included in the fixed effects. To explore the correlation between cases and deaths inside each area and across areas, three bivariate models are considered for the latent effects, namely an independent one, a conditional autoregressive model, and one that allows for both spatially structured and unstructured sources of variability. As the inclusion of spatial effects change some of the fixed effects, we extend the Spatial+ approach to a Bayesian areal set up to investigate the presence of spatial confounding. Results show that the cumulative totals of cases and deaths are negatively correlated inside and across the boroughs of Montreal. The covariates are not associated in a similar manner for the cases and deaths due to COVID-19.

Such a unique situation may often result in emotional turmoil, anxiety, depression, and fear, which could lead to resignation and burnout. The study intended to assess the feelings of nurses toward the COVID-19 outbreak;ascertain the factors that cause stress;and determine their coping strategies and factors contributing to coping. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional design was utilized to recruit 313 nurses working in the Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) hospitals that accommodate COVID-19 patients. The study instrument was adapted and modified from the ""MERS-CoV Staff Questionnaire"" and the Brief COPE. Results: The results showed that female, married, those with a bachelor's degree, and aged 25-34 years had higher significant coping strategies. On the other hand, Filipino nurses assigned in the Outpatient Department and COVID-19 Isolation Ward had more negative feelings and encountered several factors causing stress but were coping in a better way than others. Conclusion: Nurses' commitment to their profession appears to be an intrinsic motivation to continue caring for COVID-19 patients despite the risk of infection. Comfort with religion, spiritual beliefs, and the presence of a support system were the coping strategies used by nurses to ameliorate the stress and negative feelings during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Natividad, M.

Many efforts have been made to prepare specific vac ines for COVID-19 or use of prefabricated vaccines of other similar viruses, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and influenza (flu). We aimed to evaluate the effects of previous flu vaccine injection on severity of incoming COVID-19 infection. Methods: We conducted a large cross-sectional study of 529 hospitalized Iranian COVID patients to evaluate the severity of disease courses in patients with or without previous flu vaccination history using some main factors like length of hospitalization, need for the intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of stay in the ICU for comparison between COVID-19 infected patients with or without flu vaccination history. For the quantitative data, we used independent-samples t and Mann-Whitney tests. The qualitative data were calculated using the Fisher exact and chi-square tests in IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 (SPSS Inc) and P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There were no significant differences in the demographic data of patients, disease, and severity-related parameters between the 2 groups. It means that there were not any significant differences between patients with and without history of flu vaccination regarding mean days of hospitalization, percentage of needing to be admitted to the ICU, days being admitted to the ICU (8.44±6.36 vs 7.94±8.57;17% vs 11.5%;and 1.17±3.09 vs 0.92±3.04, retrospectively) (p=0.883, 0.235, and 0.809, respectively). In the laboratory tests, in comparison between patients with and without history of previous flu vaccination, only lymphocytes count in the vaccine positive group was higher than the vaccine negative group (20.82±11.23 vs 18.04±9.71) (p=0.067) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were higher in the vaccine negative group (146.57±109.72 vs 214.15±332.06) (p=0.006). Conclusion: We did not find any association between flu vaccination and decrease in disease severity in our patients. It seems that patients with previous history of flu vaccination may experience less laboratory abnormalities in some parameters that could be interpreted in favor of lower overall inflammation;however, this study cannot answer this definitely because of its design. As we collected retrospective data from only alive discharged patients and had no healthy con rol group, we could not discuss the probable effect of the vaccine on the mortality rate or its probable protective role against the infection. We need more well-des gned controlled studies with different populations in different geographic areas to address the controversies. © Iran University of Medical Sciences","Kalantari, S.; Sadeghzadeh-Bazargan, A.; Ebrahimi, S.; Yassin, Z.; Faiz, S.

In this work, we revisit the question of learning in volatile environments, in which both the first and second-order statistics of observations dynamically evolve over time. We propose a new model, the volatile Kalman filter (VKF), which is based on a tractable state-space model of uncertainty and extends the Kalman filter algorithm to volatile environments. The proposed model is algorithmically simple and encompasses the Kalman filter as a special case. Specifically, in addition to the error-correcting rule of Kalman filter for learning observations, the VKF learns volatility according to a second error-correcting rule. These dual updates echo and contextualize classical psychological models of learning, in particular hybrid accounts of Pearce-Hall and Rescorla-Wagner. At the computational level, compared with existing models, the VKF gives up some flexibility in the generative model to enable a more faithful approximation to exact inference. When fit to empirical data, the VKF is better behaved than alternatives and better captures human choice data in two independent datasets of probabilistic learning tasks. The proposed model provides a coherent account of learning in stable or volatile environments and has implications for decision neuroscience research.","Piray, Payam; Daw, Nathaniel D.",bioRxiv,243,29

Inadvertent blockade of this channel by drug-like molecules represents a key challenge in pharmaceutical R&D due to frequent overlap between the structure-activity relationships of hERG and many primary targets. Building on our previous work, together with recent cryo-EM structures of hERG, we set about to better understand the energetic and structural basis of promiscuous blocker-hERG binding in the context of Biodynamics theory. We propose a two-step blocker binding process consisting of: Diffusion of a single fully solvated blocker copy into a large cavity lined by the intracellular cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (the initial capture step). Occupation of this cavity is a necessary but insufficient condition for ion current disruption. Translocation of the captured blocker along the channel axis (the IKr disruption step), such that: The head group, consisting of a quasi-linear moiety, projects into the open pore, accompanied by partial de-solvation of the binding interface. One tail moiety packs along a kink between the S6 helix and proximal C-linker helix adjacent to the intra-cellular entrance of the pore, likewise accompanied by mutual de-solvation of the binding interface (noting that the association barrier is comprised largely of the total head + tail group de-solvation cost). Blockers containing a highly planar moiety that projects into a putative constriction zone within the closed channel become trapped upon closing, as do blockers terminating prior to this region. A single captured blocker molecule may associate and dissociate from the pore many times before exiting the CNBHD cavity. Lastly, we highlight possible flaws in the current hERG safety index (SI) and propose an alternate in vivo-relevant strategy factoring in: Benefit/risk. The predicted arrhythmogenic fractional hERG occupancy (based on action potential simulations of the undiseased human ventricular cardiomyocyte). Alteration of the safety threshold due to underlying disease. Risk of exposure escalation toward the predicted arrhythmic limit due to patient-to-patient pharmacokinetic variability, drug-drug interactions, overdose, and use for off-label indications in which the hERG safety parameters may differ from their on-label counterparts.","Wan, Hongbin; Selvaggio, Gianluca; Pearlstein, Robert A.",bioRxiv,243,25

Due to its vasodilatory effect and short half-life, the use of NO as an exogenous inhaled medication (iNO) to target the pulmonary vasculature, in conditions with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, has been studied. The use of iNO in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 has therapeutic importance in improving oxygenation. It also has potential anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties. Herein, we want to share our experience of use of iNO in hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID 19 pneumonia. We hypothesized that iNO may be beneficial at preventing intubation, decreasing invasive mechanical ventilation duration, and consequently improve outcomes including hospital mortality. Methods: This is a descriptive hypothesis generating study of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia who received iNO for hypoxemic respiratory failure, at a single tertiary care center. We collected information on patient demographics, co-morbidities, iNO treatment, need for intubation, arterial blood gas analysis, laboratory values, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Patients were divided into two groups based on the timing of iNO administration: group 1 - pre-intubation (i.e. iNO started at least 1 day prior to endotracheal intubation, if any) and group 2 - post-intubation (i.e. iNO started on the same day as or after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation). Result: A total of 45 (group 1, n=26 [57.8%] vs group2, n=19 [42.2%]) COVID 19 patients who had iNO use. The mean time from hospital admission to iNO administration(days) in group 1 was 2.1 (1.8, SD) vs 4.2 (5.9, SD) in group 2. The mean hospital length of stay from the beginning of iNO treatment until discharge or death was 18.3 vs 26.2 days, with 8 deaths (30.8%) vs 9 deaths (47.4%) in group 1 vs group 2, respectively. Discussion: Our study is unable to demonstrate comparably outcomes benefit of iNO. Although there was a trend towards decreased need for invasive mechanical ventilation in group 1[Only 11 (42.3 %) patients were intubated out of 26 who received iNO early after hospital admission (2.3 days)], no statistical significance could be achieved because of small sample size. Our study demonstrated that iNO administration pre-intubation did not appear harmful and appears to be safe, complementary to HFNC, signalling the domain where systematic investigation is required to confirm or not the potential for iNO to improve patient outcomes in the management of COVID 19-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure. Conclusion: This study showcases the potential benefit of early pre-intubation use of iNO in COVID patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. This study could conclusively form the basis for a prospective trial and could have a tremendous impact in improving patient outcomes.","Giri, A. R.; Yarrarapu, S. N. S.; Kaur, N.; Hochwald, A.

Material and Methods: A snowball sampling method was used in this study. Data were collected through an online questionnaire between March 26 and April 1, 2020. A total of 834 persons were surveyed from 81 cities in Turkey. The demographic questions created by the researchers and a perception scale about COVID-19 were used. The data were analyzed with SPSS 25.0 statistical program. Results: Risk perception and anxiety levels of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic were found to be statistically associated with gender, employ-ment status, income level, general health insurance and the presence of chronic disease (p <0.05). The majority of the participants (83.3%) considered the disease fatal and 59.1% were anxious. The anxiety levels of the participants played a mediator role between perceived risks and avoidance behaviors. Partici-pants’ risk perception for the COVID-19 pandemic was 4.22 ± 0.63, and their anxiety levels were above the average of 3.92 ± 0.71.

Combining projections of future deforestation with species density information provides an improved way to anticipate such declines. Using the endemic and critically endangered Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) as a case study we applied a spatio-temporally explicit deforestation model to forest loss data from 2001-2017 and projected future impacts on orangutans to the 2030s. Our projections point to continued deforestation across the island, amounting to a loss of forest habitat for 26,200 (CI: 19,500–34,000) orangutans. Populations currently persisting in forests gazetted for industrial timber and oil palm concessions, or unprotected forests outside of concessions, were projected to experience the worst losses within the next 15 years, amounting to 15,400 (CI: 12,000–20,500) individuals. Lowland forests with high orangutan densities in West and Central Kalimantan were also projected to be at high risk from deforestation, irrespective of land-use. In contrast, most protected areas and logging concessions currently harboring orangutans will continue to face low levels of deforestation. Our business-as-usual projections indicate the importance of protected areas, efforts to prevent the conversion of logged forests for the survival of highly vulnerable wildlife, and protecting orangutan habitat in plantation landscapes. The modeling framework could be expanded to other species with available density or occurrence data. Our findings highlight that species conservation should not only attempt to act on the current situation, but also be adapt to changes in drivers to be effective.","Voigt, Maria; Kühl, Hjalmar S.; Ancrenaz, Marc; Gaveau, David; Meijaard, Erik; Santika, Truly; Sherman, Julie; Wich, Serge A.; Wolf, Florian; Struebig, Matthew J.; Pereira, Henrique M.; Rosa, Isabel M.D.",bioRxiv,243,13

Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a picornavirus that can cause paralysis, diabetes, and myocarditis within days of infection. The optimal innate immune response against EMCV in vivo requires CD1d. Interaction of antigen-presenting cell CD1d with distinct natural killer T-cell (""NKT"") populations can induce rapid gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production and NK-cell activation. The T-cell response of CD1d-deficient mice (lacking all NKT cells) against acute EMCV infection was further studied in vitro and in vivo. EMCV persisted at higher levels in CD1d-knockout (KO) splenocyte cultures infected in vitro. Furthermore, optimal resistance to repeat cycles of EMCV infection in vitro was also shown to depend on CD1d. However, this was not reflected in the relative levels of NK-cell activation but rather by the responses of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell populations. Repeated EMCV infection in vitro induced less IFN-gamma and alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) from CD1d-deficient splenocytes than with the wild type. Furthermore, the level of EMCV replication in wild-type splenocytes was markedly and specifically increased by addition of blocking anti-CD1d antibody. Depletion experiments demonstrated that dendritic cells contributed less than the combination of NK and NKT cells to anti-EMCV responses and that none of these cell types was the main source of IFN-alpha. Finally, EMCV infection in vivo produced higher levels of viremia in CD1d-KO mice than in wild-type animals, coupled with significantly less lymphocyte activation and IFN-alpha production. These results point to the existence of a previously unrecognized mechanism of rapid CD1d-dependent stimulation of the antiviral adaptive cellular immune response.","Ilyinskii, Petr O; Wang, Ruojie; Balk, Steven P; Exley, Mark A",Journal of virology,243,1

METHODS 115 patients diagnosed with SARS were admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, a large regional hospital in Hong Kong, from March 2003, of whom 100 were either discharged or were dead at 31 May. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to assess their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death or the need for mechanical ventilation RESULTS At the time of writing 18 patients had died, with a crude mortality rate of 15.7% and a 21 day mortality of 10% (standard error 3%). Thirty nine patients (34%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 30 of whom (26%) required mechanical ventilation. Multivariate analysis showed that age above 60 (hazards ratio (HR) 3.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 10.2; p=0.02), presence of diabetes mellitus or heart disease (HR 9.1, 95% CI 2.8 to 29.1; p<0.001), and the presence of other comorbid conditions (HR 5.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 19.7; p=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. However, only the presence of diabetes mellitus and/or cardiac disease (HR 7.3, 95% CI 3.1 to 17.4; p<0.001) was associated with adverse outcomes as a whole. CONCLUSION SARS is a new disease entity that carries significant morbidity and mortality.

However, when we attempted to express the E2 protein from type 2 (890 strain) BVDV in a bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1) vector, we observed that expression was poor. This often happens when genes from a cytoplasmic virus are expressed in the cell nucleus. To counter this effect, we attempted to enhance expression by a strategy employed by viruses. RNAs of retroviruses and hepadnaviruses contain cis-acting elements that facilitate expression of RNAs that otherwise are degraded or retained within the nucleus. In Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, the required RNA sequence element is known as a constitutive transport element (CTE). A related element from woodchuck hepatitis virus is known as the woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE). We tested the ability of the CTE, the WPRE, and introns to enhance expression of E2. All three elements stimulated expression of E2 from plasmids. The combination of the WPRE and an intron yielded the highest level of E2 expression in plasmids. However, when E2 was expressed from a BHV1 vector, the presence of an intron was inhibitory. In contrast, the WPRE was very efficient at stimulating E2 expression from a BHV1 vector. This result represents the first expression of a type 2 BVDV E2 protein from a mammalian virus vector and raises the possibility that the WPRE may provide a general method of enhancing foreign gene expression from BHV1 and other herpesvirus vectors.","Wang, Lingshu; Menon, Sreekumar; Bolin, Steven R; Bello, Leonard J",Journal of virology,243,8

METHODS We assigned one-month-old infants to treatment with two-week courses of inhaled budesonide (400 mug per day) or placebo, initiated after a three-day episode of wheezing, in this single-center, randomized, double-blind, prospective study of three years' duration. The primary outcome was the number of symptom-free days; key secondary outcomes were the time to discontinuation due to persistent wheezing and safety, as evaluated by height and bone mineral density at the end of the study. RESULTS We enrolled 411 infants and randomly assigned 294 to receive budesonide at a first episode of wheezing. The proportion of symptom-free days was 83 percent in the budesonide group and 82 percent in the placebo group (absolute difference, 1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -4.8 to 6.9 percent). Twenty-four percent of children in the budesonide group had persistent wheezing, as compared with 21 percent in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 2.13)--a finding that was unaffected by the presence or absence of atopic dermatitis. The mean duration of the acute episodes was 10 days in both groups and was independent of respiratory viral status. Height and bone mineral density were not affected by treatment.

METHODS A novel electropositive filter was used to concentrate the SARS-CoV from the sewage of two hospitals administered SARS patients in Beijing, including twelve 2,500 ml sewage samples from the hospitals before disinfection, and ten 25,000 ml samples after disinfection; as well as cell culture, RT-PCR and sequencing of gene to detect and identify the viruses from sewage. RESULTS There was no live SARS-CoV detected in the sewage in this study. The nucleic acid of SARS-CoV had been found in the 12 sewage samples before disinfection from both hospitals by semi-nested PCR. After disinfection, SARS-CoV RNA could only be detected from the samples from the 309th Hospital, and the others were negative. CONCLUSION It provides evidence that there is no live SARS-Cov in the sewage from hospitals with SARS patients though SARS-CoV RNA can be detected.","Wang, Xin-Wei; Li, Jin-Song; Guo, Ting-Kai; Zhen, Bei; Kong, Qing-Xin; Yi, Bang; Li, Zhong; Song, Nong; Jin, Min; Xiao, Wen-Jun; Zhu, Xiu-Mei; Gu, Chang-Qing; Yin, Jing; Wei, Wei; Yao, Wei; Liu, Chao; Li, Jian-Feng; Ou, Guo-Rong; Wang, Min-Nian; Fang, Tong-Yu; Wang, Gui-Jie; Qiu, Yao-Hui; Wu, Huai-Huan; Chao, Fu-Huan; Li, Jun-Wen",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],243,24

A major question is whether adaptation in developing countries should be financed under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or whether funding should come from other sources. We present an overview of financial resources and propose the employment of a two-track approach: one track that attempts to secure climate change adaptation funding under the UNFCCC; and a second track that improves mainstreaming of climate risk management in development efforts. Developed countries would need to demonstrate much greater commitment to the funding of adaptation measures if the UNFCCC were to cover a substantial part of the costs. The mainstreaming of climate change adaptation could follow a risk management path, particularly in relation to disaster risk reduction. 'Climate-proofing' of development projects that currently do not consider climate and weather risks could improve their sustainability.","Bouwer, Laurens M; Aerts, Jeroen C J H",Disasters,243,16

Such racial disparities, in Covid-19 testing, cases, and mortality are visible in Connecticut too. Recently, excess deaths have become an important consideration in news reports and academic research. However, data on racial differences in excess death is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study examines racial/ethnic differences in excess deaths in the state of Connecticut during the Covid-19 pandemic. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study to estimate excess deaths by racial/ethnic status utilizing mortality data during the peak months of Covid-19 infections from March 1 to June 30, 2020, in Connecticut. The following assumption is applied: expected non-Covid-19 deaths from March 1 to June 30, 2020, are equal to the number of deaths occurring during the period of March 1 to June 30, 2019. Race/ethnicity are defined as Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Latinx. Descriptive statistics and rates with 95% confidence intervals are presented. Chi-square analyses are performed where applicable. SETTING: Connecticut PARTICIPANTS: All deaths in Connecticut from March 1 to June 30, 2020. EXPOSURE: Covid-19 and race/ethnicity RESULTS: From March 1 to June 30, 2020, a total of 14,226 all-cause deaths occurred including 1514 Blacks (10.6%), 1095 Latinx (7.7%), and 11,617 Whites (81.7%). This represented a 74% increase in mortality for Blacks; 63% for Latinx, and 30% for Whites. In addition, 42.70% of the deaths in Blacks were attributed to Covid-19; 38.5% for Latinx, and 23.0% for Whites (p<0.001). Covid-19 deaths accounted for over 90% of the excess deaths in Blacks and Hispanics. In contrast, in Whites, Covid-19 deaths exceeded the number of excess deaths by 353 cases (113.2%), indicating that some Whites may have died from other underlined health conditions with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis. Furthermore, there was an increase in undetermined deaths in 2020, which accounted for 10.8% of deaths in Blacks, 13% in Latinx, and 6.2% of deaths in Whites. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Excess deaths in Blacks and Latinx were found above the numbers of deaths determined to have occurred due to Covid-19. The fact that a large number of undetermined deaths were found for Blacks and Latinx individuals, and testing rates for Blacks and Latinx individuals (as determined by positivity rates) were lacking during this period strongly suggests, these excess deaths were Covid-19-related deaths. The study findings indicate that Black and Latinx COVID-19-related deaths may be underreported in this pandemic. We advocate for targeted strategies that increase testing capacity, treatment, and vaccine availability in Black and Latinx communities.","Laurencin, Cato T; Wu, Z Helen; McClinton, Aneesah; Grady, James J; Walker, Joanne M",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,243,26

Several units engaged in such endeavors across the country. This article outlines some methodological considerations made by the Cochin Hospital Clinical Ethics Center (the Cec). The Cec was founded in 2002 to provide clinical ethics support services. While its approach was inspired by North American models, it was shaped by and adapted to the French context. This approach is called the ""Commitment Model,"" as it draws upon societal engagement in all phases of its service and places the perspectives of individual patients at its core. During the first outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the Cec received a greater number of requests about recurring care practices or ethical guidelines and recommendations than single clinical ethics dilemmas. Through the presentation of an illustrative consultation, this article describes how, while the Cec made some adjustments to its service for the emergency situation, it preserved its case-by-case approach rather than engaging in what it calls organizational and institutional ethics. Such an approach allowed the Cec to refocus attention to individual patients and their unique circumstances and to support decision makers by the use of case-by-case, problematized, ethical reflections.","Murano, M.

This study was performed to evaluate the clinical validation of reusing N95 respirators following stringent fit test protocols. Methods After passing the first fit test, we prospectively enrolled healthcare workers who used N95 respirators for two hours per shift (duckbill-shaped HPR-R/HPR-S, dome-shaped Hi-Luck 350, and three-panel flat-fold respirators 9211) in settings such as bronchoscopy or respiratory specimen sampling. These procedures were repeated for up to three weeks, with the fit test performed every week. At each timing of the fit test, we used a fit-testing system for quantitatively evaluating particle leakage. Results A total of 41 participants were enrolled, including 24 doctors and 17 nurses, of whom 25 were women. The pass rate of successful reuse over three observational weeks using four fit tests was 85.4%, which was comparable among the three types of N95 respirators. Six (14.6%) participants failed the fit test, while no participants dropped out of protocol due to either N95 respirator damage or contamination. Among the six dropped out participants, four reused the duckbill-shaped type and two reused the three-panel flat-fold type. All participants using the cup-shaped type mask successfully completed the protocol. However, the passing rate of this study was not statistically different among the three types of N95 respirators. Conclusion This study shows that N95 respirators can be safely reused for a short period irrespective of their type, as quantitatively assessed by fit tests.","Nakamoto, Keitaro; Saraya, Takeshi; Kurai, Daisuke; Fukukawa, Naokatsu; Taneoka, Takako; Shimasaki, Teppei; Ishii, Haruyuki",Cureus,243,24

Professional phagocytes (e.g., macrophages) and ECs have co-evolved in vertebrates to adapt to increased physiological demands. Intercellular interactions between components of the hemovascular system facilitate numerous functions in physiology and disease in part through the utilization of shared signaling pathways and factors. Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) 2 and 4 are two such transcription factors with critical roles in both cellular compartments. Decreased expression of either factor in myeloid or endothelial cells increases susceptibility to a multitude of inflammatory diseases, underscoring the essential role for their expression in maintaining cellular quiescence. Given the close evolutionary relationship between macrophages and ECs, along with their shared utilization of KLF2 and 4, we hypothesize that KLF genes evolved in such a way that protected their expression in myeloid and endothelial cells. Within this Perspective, we review the roles of KLF2 and 4 in the hemovascular system and explore evolutionary trends in their nucleotide composition that suggest a coordinated protection that corresponds with the development of mature myeloid and endothelial systems.","Sweet, D.

This emergency situation warrants the taking of extraordinary measures to minimize the negative health impact from an insufficient supply of masks. The decontamination, and reuse of healthcare workers' N95/FFP2 masks is a promising solution which needs to overcome several pitfalls to become a reality. AIM: The overall aim of this article is to provide the reader with a quick overview of the various methods for decontamination and the potential issues to be taken into account when deciding to reuse masks. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), hydrogen peroxide, steam, ozone, ethylene oxide, dry heat and moist heat have all been methods studied in the context of the pandemic. The article first focuses on the logistical implementation of a decontamination system in its entirety, and then aims to summarize and analyze the different available methods for decontamination. METHODS: In order to have a clear understanding of the research that has already been done, we conducted a systematic literature review for the questions: what are the tested methods for decontaminating N95/FFP2 masks, and what impact do those methods have on the microbiological contamination and physical integrity of the masks? We used the results of a systematic review on the methods of microbiological decontamination of masks to make sure we covered all of the recommended methods for mask reuse. To this systematic review we added articles and studies relevant to the subject, but that were outside the limits of the systematic review. These include a number of studies that performed important fit and function tests on the masks but took their microbiological outcomes from the existing literature and were thus excluded from the systematic review, but useful for this paper. We also used additional unpublished studies and internal communication from the University of Geneva Hospitals and partner institutions. RESULTS: This paper analyzes the acceptable methods for respirator decontamination and reuse, and scores them according to a number of variables that we have defined as being crucial (including cost, risk, complexity, time, etc.) to help healthcare facilities decide which method of decontamination is right for them. CONCLUSION: We provide a resource for healthcare institutions looking at making informed decisions about respirator decontamination. This informed decision making will help to improve infection prevention and control measures, and protect healthcare workers during this crucial time. The overall take home message is that institutions should not reuse respirators unless they have to. In the case of an emergency situation, there are some safe ways to decontaminate them.","Peters, Alexandra; Palomo, Rafael; Ney, Hervé; Lotfinejad, Nasim; Zingg, Walter; Parneix, Pierre; Pittet, Didier",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,243,20

Levels of vitamin D receptor, retinoid X receptor, and CYP27A1 in BALF cells of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were found to be reduced. Additionally, 107 differentially expressed, predominantly downregulated genes, as potentially modulated by vitamin D endocrine system, were identified in transcriptomic datasets from patient's cells. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes provided eight novel genes with a conserved motif with vitamin D-responsive elements, implying the role of both direct and indirect mechanisms of gene expression by the dysregulated vitamin D endocrine system in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Protein-protein interaction network of differentially expressed vitamin D-modulated genes were enriched in the immune system, NF-&#954;B/cytokine signaling, and cell cycle regulation as top predicted pathways that might be affected in the cells of such patients. In brief, the results presented here povide computational evidence to implicate a dysregulated vitamin D endocrine system in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","George, Bijesh; Amjesh, Revikumar; Paul, Aswathy Mary; Santhoshkumar, T R; Pillai, Madhavan Radhakrishna; Kumar, Rakesh",Sci Rep,243,4

Advance care planning is essential to assist patient autonomy and prevent non-beneficial medical interventions. AIM: To describe early (taken within 72 h after hospital admission) resuscitation orders in oldest-old hospitalized with COVID-19. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A cohort of patients aged 80 years and older admitted to the acute hospital in March and April 2020 with COVID-19 were retrospectively recruited from 10 acute hospitals in Belgium. Recruitment was done through a network of geriatricians. RESULTS: Overall, 766 octogenarians were admitted of whom 49 were excluded because no therapeutic relationship with the geriatrician and six because of incomplete case report form. Early decisions not to consider intensive care admission were taken in 474/711 (66.7%) patients. This subgroup was characterized by significantly higher age, higher number of comorbidities and higher frailty level. There was a significant association between the degree of the treatment limitation and the degree of premorbid frailty (p < 0.001). Overall in-hospital mortality was 41.6% in patients with an early decision not to consider intensive care admission (67.1% in persons who developed respiratory failure vs 16.7% in patients without respiratory failure (p < 0.001)). Of 104 patients without early decision not to consider intensive care admission but who developed respiratory failure, 59 were eventually not transferred to intensive care unit with in-hospital mortality of 25.4%; 45 were transferred to the intensive care unit with mortality of 64.4%.

We sought to assess the results of continued nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 patients in COVID-19 patients after they were discharged in Lu’an, China. Methods We conducted RT-PCR tests on sputum, throat swabs, fecal or anal swabs, and urine samples collected from 67 COVID-19 patients following discharge. Samples were collected on the 7th and 14th days following discharge. Patients testing positive on the 7th or 14th day were retested after 24 hours until they tested negative twice. Results Seventeen (17/67, 25.4%) discharged COVID-19 patients had a positive RT-PCR retest for SARS-CoV-2. Among them, 14 (82.4%) were sputum positive, five (29.4%) were throat swab positive, seven (41.2%) were fecal or anal swab positive, one (5.9%) was urine sample positive, five (29.4%) were both sputum and throat swab positive, four (23.5%) were both sputum and fecal test positive, and one (5.9%) was positive of all four specimens. The shortest period of time between discharge and the last positive test was 7 days, the longest was 48 days, and the median was 16 days. The proportion of positive fecal or anal swab tests increased from the third week. The median Cq cut-off values after onset were 26.7 after the first week, 37.7 the second to sixth week, and 40 after the sixth week. There were no significant differences between the RT-PCR retest positive group and the unrecovered positive group. Conclusions There was a high proportion of patients who retested positive for COVID-19.

METHODS: Using the HF clinic database, we compared data of patients with HF before, during, and after the peak of the pandemic (January 1 to March 17 [pre-COVID], March 17 to May 31 [peak-COVID], and June 1 to October 1 [post-COVID]). During peak-COVID, all patients were managed by Tele-HFC or hospitalization. After June 1, patients chose either a face-to-face clinic visit or a continuous tele-clinic visit. RESULTS: Cardiovascular death and medical titration rates were similar in peak-COVID compared with all other periods. HF readmission rates were significantly lower in peak-COVID (8.7% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001) and slightly increased (3.5%) post-COVID. Heart transplant rates were substantially increased in post-COVID (4.5% vs. peak-COVID [0%], p = 0.002). After June 1, 38% of patients continued with the Tele-HFC program.

To know the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the city of Madrid and its 21 districts in the first 4 months of the epidemic and its relationship with some socioeconomic and demographic variables. METHODS: Cross-sectional ecological study (39,270 cases). The 39,270 cases diagnosed from the beginning of the pandemic until June 26, 2020, published by the Comunidad de Madrid in were studied. In the districts, the distribution of gross and fair incidence is related to the ones of the independent variables (Municipal Statistics and Estudio de Salud 2018, Madrid Salud). The Incidence and the r and r2 coefficients, obtained with the factors and the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, are studied. RESULTS: The city of Madrid presents a cumulative incidence of COVID-19, which is double the national one (100), with a Standardized Cumulative Incidence Ratio (RIAE) of 204.59 per 100. The districts with the most RIAE were those in the southeast, all&gt;240 per 100. In the districts, the per capita household rate, the per capita income, and the mortality rate from infectious diseases in men reached high and inverse correlations with RIAE (all r&gt;-0.3). The RLM model with these 3 indicators predicts 30% of the RIAES. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between material wealth and the risk of COVID-19 infection is inverse. The knowledge in the districts of per capita income, household rate and mortality rate due to infectious diseases in men reduces the uncertainty about the accumulated incidence by 30%.

217683,217683,217683,SARS-CoV-2: the key issues,10.718205,9.907659,2020,"Affecting basic tenets of human existence such as health, economic as well as personal security and, of course, reproduction, the COVID-19 pandemic transcended medical specialties and professional disciplines. Yet, six months into the pandemic, there still exists no consensus on how to combat the virus in absence of a vaccine. Facing unprecedented circumstances, and in absence of real evidence on how to proceed, our organization early in the pandemic decided to act independently from often seemingly irrational guidance and, instead, to carefully follow a quickly evolving COVID-19 literature. Here described is the, likely, unique journey of a fertility center that maintained services during peaks of COVID-19 and political unrest that followed. Closely following publicly available data, we recognized relatively early that New York City and other East Coast regions, which during the initial COVID-19 wave between March and May represented the hardest-hit areas in the country, during the second wave, beginning in June and still in progress, remained almost completely unaffected. In contrast, south western regions, almost completely unaffected by the initial wave, were severely affected in the second wave. These two distinctively different infectious phenotypes suggested two likely explanations: The country was witnessing infections with two different SARS-CoV-2 viruses and NYC (along with the East Coast) acquired during the first wave much better immunity to the virus than south western regions. Both hypotheses since have been confirmed: East and West Coasts, indeed, were initially infected by two distinctively different lineages of the virus, with the East Coast lineage being 10-times more infectious. In addition, immunologists discovered an up to this point unknown long-term anti-viral innate (cellular) immune response which offers additional and much broader anti-viral immunity than the classical adaptive immunity via immobilizing antibodies that has been known for decades. Consequently, we predict that in the U.S., even in absence of an available vaccine, COVID-19, by September-October, will be at similarly low levels as are currently seen in NYC and other East Coast regions (generally < 1% test-positivity). We, furthermore, predict that, if current mitigation measures are maintained and no newly aggressive mutation of the virus enters the country, a significant fall-wave of COVID-19, in combination with the usual fall wave of influenza, appears unlikely. To continue serving patients uninterrupted throughout the pandemic, turned for all of our center's staff into a highly rewarding experience, garnered respect and appreciation from patients, and turned into an absolutely unique learning experience.","Gleicher, Norbert",Reprod Biol Endocrinol,243,20

As many in-person mental health support services have been suspended or transitioned online to facilitate physical distancing, there have been numerous calls for the rapid expansion of asynchronous virtual mental health (AVMH) resources. These AVMH resources have great potential to provide support for people coping with negative mental health impacts associated with the pandemic; however, literature examining use prior to COVID-19 illustrates that the uptake of these resources is consistently low. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to examine the use of AVMH resources in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population and among a participant subgroup classified as experiencing an adverse mental health impact related to the pandemic. METHODS: Data from this study were drawn from the first wave of a large multiwave cross-sectional monitoring survey, distributed from May 14 to 29, 2020. Participants (N=3000) were adults living in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and bivariate cross-tabulations were used to examine the relationships between the use of AVMH resources and self-reported indicators of mental health that included a range of emotional and coping-related responses to the pandemic. Univariate and fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and use of AVMH resources in the subgroup of participants who reported experiencing one or more adverse mental health impacts identified in the set of self-reported mental health indicators. RESULTS: Among the total sample, 2.0% (n=59) of participants reported accessing AVMH resources in the prior 2 weeks to cope with stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest rates of use among individuals who reported self-harm (n=5, 10.4%) and those who reported coping ""not well"" with COVID-19-related stress (n=22, 5.5%). Within the subgroup of 1954 participants (65.1% of the total sample) who reported an adverse mental health impact related to COVID-19, 54 (2.8%) reported use of AVMH resources. Individuals were more likely to have used AVMH resources if they had reported receiving in-person mental health supports, were connecting virtually with a mental health worker or counselor, or belonged to a visible minority group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial government investment into AVMH resources, uptake is low among both the general population and individuals who may benefit from the use of these resources as a means of coping with the adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the barriers to use.","Richardson, Chris G; Slemon, Allie; Gadermann, Anne; McAuliffe, Corey; Thomson, Kimberly; Daly, Zachary; Salway, Travis; Currie, Leanne M; David, Anita; Jenkins, Emily",J Med Internet Res,243,32

Our aim was to determine the sensitivity of saliva versus swabs collected by healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients themselves to assess whether saliva detection can be offered as a cost-effective, risk-free method of SARS-CoV-2 detection. METHODS: This study was conducted in a hospital involving outpatients and hospitalized patients. A total of 3018 outpatients were tested. Of these, 200 qRT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited for further study. In addition, 101 SARS-CoV-2-positive hospitalized patients with symptoms were also enrolled in the study. From outpatients, HCWs collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), saliva were obtained. From inpatients, HCWs collected swabs, patient-collected swabs, and saliva were obtained. qRT-PCR was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 by TAQPATH assay to determine the sensitivity of saliva detection. Sensitivity, specificity and positive/negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of detecting SARS-CoV-2 were calculated using MedCalc. RESULTS: Of 3018 outpatients (asymptomatic: 2683, symptomatic: 335) tested by qRT-PCR, 200 were positive (males: 140, females: 60; aged 37.9 ± 12.8 years; (81 asymptomatic, 119 symptomatic). Of these, saliva was positive in 128 (64%); 39 of 81 asymptomatic (47%),89 of 119 symptomatic patients (74.8%). Sensitivity of detection was 60.9% (55.4-66.3%, CI 95%), with a negative predictive value of 36%(32.9-39.2%, CI 95%).Among 101 hospitalized patients (males:65, females: 36; aged 53.48 ± 15.6 years), with HCW collected NPS as comparator, sensitivity of saliva was 56.1% (47.5-64.5, CI 95%), specificity 63.5%(50.4-75.3, CI95%) with PPV of 77.2% and NPV of 39.6% and that of self-swab was 52.3%(44-60.5%, CI95%), specificity 56.6% (42.3-70.2%, CI95%) with PPV 77.2% and NPV29.7%. Comparison of positivity with the onset of symptoms revealed highest detection in saliva on day 3 after onset of symptoms. Additionally, only saliva was positive in 13 (12.8%) hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION: Saliva which is easier to collect than nasopharyngeal swab is a viable alternate to detect SARS-COV-2 in symptomatic patients in the early stage of onset of symptoms. Although saliva is currently not recommended for screening asymptomatic patients, optimization of collection and uniform timing of sampling might improve the sensitivity enabling its use as a screening tool at community level.","Sasikala, Mitnala; Sadhana, Yelamanchili; Vijayasarathy, Ketavarapu; Gupta, Anand; Daram, Sarala Kumari; Podduturi, Naveen Chander Reddy; Reddy, Duvvur Nageshwar",BMC Infect Dis,243,15

Viral load by real-time RT-PCR has been suggested as a biomarker of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the association of viral load and severity of the disease is not yet resolved. Nasopharyngeal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Relative quantitation was made by the comparative threshold cycle (&#916;&#916;Ct ) formula between ORF1ab viral and RNase P housekeeping genes. Absolute viral load was calculate using a reference positive control. Most prevalent clinical signs were cough (75.8%), myalgia (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). Hypertension (18.2%), neurological diseases (15.1%), and asthma and hypothyroidism (12.1%) were most frequent comorbidities. Fever, either as an exclusive symptom or combined with others, was associated with high viral loads ( 2 - &#8710; &#8710; C t range, 35.65-155.16; 4.25-4.89 log10 RNA copies/test]). During the first week after onset of symptoms in mild patients up to 60 years-old was detected the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load (313.84; 2.50) in the first 2 days postinfection with a sharp decline thereafter. Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days postinfection (range, 0.03 to 17.24; -1.50 to 1.24). Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the onset of symptoms (range, 25.32-155.42; 1.40-2.19), indicating the longer presence of the virus in them. These findings suggest the viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs would help to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases.","Bustos, Patricia; Tambley, Carolina; Acevedo, Alejandra; Andrade, Winston; Leal, Gabriel; Vidal, Deyanira; Roldán, Francisco; Fasce, Rodrigo; Ramírez, Eugenio",J Med Virol,243,30

Infection control precautions for hospital visitors are needed to avoid cluster outbreaks, so this study investigated the visiting policies of all the hospitals in Taiwan in the time of COVID-19. METHODS: From March 15, 2020, to March 18, 2020, we searched the official websites of all 472 National Health Insurance-contracted hospitals to determine their visiting policies. For those hospitals that had posted new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, we recorded the relevant details shown on their websites, including the number of visitors allowed at one time, the number of visiting slots per day, the total visiting hours per day, and the rules provided to visitors before visiting. RESULTS: During the study period, 276 (58.5%) hospitals had posted new visiting policies on their websites, with higher proportions of academic medical centers (92.0%, 23/25) and metropolitan hospitals (91.5%, 75/82) than local community hospitals (48.8%, 178/365) doing so. Visits to ordinary wards were forbidden in 83 hospitals among those. Among the 193 hospitals that had new visiting policies and still allowed visits to ordinary wards, 73.1% (n = 141) restricted visitors to two at a time and 54.9% (n = 106) restricted visits to two visiting slots per day. Furthermore, history taking regarding travel, occupation, contacts, and cluster information was mentioned by 82.4% (n = 159) of these 193 hospitals, body temperature monitoring by 78.2% (n = 151), hand hygiene by 63.2% (n = 122), and identity checks by 51.8% (n = 100). CONCLUSION: In the time of COVID-19 covered by this study, about three-fifths of the hospitals in Taiwan had posted their visiting policies for ordinary wards on their websites. Furthermore, the thoroughness with which such visiting policies have been enforced also requires investigation.","Liu, Ya-An; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Lin, Ming-Hwai; Chang, Hsiao-Ting; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J Chin Med Assoc,243,23

METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 671 eligible hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 from 1 January to 23 February 2020, with a median age of 63 years. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and compared between patients who died and survivors. Risk factors of death and myocardial injury were analysed using multivariable regression models. A total of 62 patients (9.2%) died, who more often had myocardial injury (75.8% vs. 9.7%; P < 0.001) than survivors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of initial cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.87-0.96; sensitivity, 0.86; specificity, 0.86; P < 0.001]. The single cut-off point and high level of cTnI predicted risk of in-hospital death, hazard ratio (HR) was 4.56 (95% CI, 1.28-16.28; P = 0.019) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.07-1.46; P = 0.004), respectively. In multivariable logistic regression, senior age, comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and high level of C-reactive protein were predictors of myocardial injury. CONCLUSION: The risk of in-hospital death among patients with severe COVID-19 can be predicted by markers of myocardial injury, and was significantly associated with senior age, inflammatory response, and cardiovascular comorbidities.","Shi, Shaobo; Qin, Mu; Cai, Yuli; Liu, Tao; Shen, Bo; Yang, Fan; Cao, Sheng; Liu, Xu; Xiang, Yaozu; Zhao, Qinyan; Huang, He; Yang, Bo; Huang, Congxin",Eur Heart J,243,16
229094,229094,229094,Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions reply,10.9209175,10.001463,2020,"PurposeThe life insurance industry has been exposed to high levels of longevity risk born from the mismatch between realized mortality trends and anticipated forecast Annuity providers are exposed to extended periods of annuity payments There are no immediate instruments in the market to counter the risk directly This paper aims to develop appropriate instruments for hedging longevity risk and providing an insight on how existing products can be tailor-made to effectively immunize portfolios consisting of life insurance using a cointegration vector error correction model with regime-switching (RS-VECM), which enables both short-term fluctuations, through the autoregressive structure [AR(1)] and long-run equilibria using a cointegration relationship The authors also develop synthetic products that can be used to effectively hedge longevity risk faced by life insurance and annuity providers who actively hold portfolios of life insurance products Models are derived using South African data The authors also derive closed-form expressions for hedge ratios associated with synthetic products written on life insurance contracts as this will provide a natural way of immunizing the associated portfolios The authors further show how to address the current liquidity challenges in the longevity market by devising longevity swaps and develop pricing and hedging algorithms for longevity-linked securities The use of a cointergrating relationship improves the model fitting process, as all the VECMs and RS-VECMs yield greater criteria values than their vector autoregressive model (VAR) and regime-switching vector autoregressive model (RS-VAR) counterpart’s, even though there are accruing parameters involved Design/methodology/approachThe market model adopted from Ngai and Sherris (2011) is a cointegration RS-VECM for this enables both short-term fluctuations, through the AR(1) and long-run equilibria using a cointegration relationship (Johansen, 1988, 1995a, 1995b), with a heteroskedasticity through the use of regime-switching The RS-VECM is seen to have the best fit for Australian data under various model selection criteria by Sherris and Zhang (2009) Harris (1997) (Sajjad et al , 2008) also fits a regime-switching VAR model using Australian (UK and US) data to four key macroeconomic variables (market stock indices), showing that regime-switching is a significant improvement over autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) processes in the account for volatility, evidence similar to that of Sherris and Zhang (2009) in the case of Exponential Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ERCH) Ngai and Sherris (2011) and Sherris and Zhang (2009) also fit a VAR model to Australian data with simultaneous regime-switching across many economic and financial series FindingsThe authors develop a longevity swap using nighttime data instead of usual income measures as it yields statistically accurate results The authors also develop longevity derivatives and annuities including variable annuities with guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) and inflation-indexed annuities Improved market and mortality models are developed and estimated using South African data to model the underlying risks Macroeconomic variables dependence is modeled using a cointegrating VECM as used in Ngai and Sherris (2011), which enables both short-run dependence and long-run equilibrium Longevity swaps provide protection against longevity risk and benefit the most from hedging longevity risk Longevity bonds are also effective as a hedging instrument in life annuities The cost of hedging, as reflected in the price of longevity risk, has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of hedging options Research limitations/implicationsThis study relied on secondary data partly reported by independent institutions and the government, which may be biased because of smoothening, interpolation or extrapolation processes Practical implicationsAn examination of South Africa’s mortality based on industry experience in comparison to population mortality would demand confirmation of the analysis in this paper based on Belgian data as well as other less developed economies This study shows that to provide inflation-indexed life annuities, there is a need for an active market for hedging inflation in South Africa This would demand the South African Government through the help of Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA) to issue inflation-indexed securities which will help annuities and insurance providers immunize their portfolios from longevity risk Social implicationsIn South Africa, there is an infant market for inflation hedging and no market for longevity swaps The effect of not being able to hedge inflation is guaranteed, and longevity swaps in annuity products is revealed to be useful and significant, particularly using developing or emerging economies as a laboratory This study has shown that government issuance or allowing issuance, of longevity swaps, can enable insurers to manage longevity risk If the South African Government, through ASSA, is to develop a projected mortality reference index for South Africa, this would allow the development of mortality-linked securities and longevity swaps which ultimately maximize the social welfare of life assurance policy holders Originality/valueThe paper proposes longevity swaps and static hedging because they are simple, less costly and practical with feasible applications to the South African market, an economy of over 50 million people As the market for MLS develops further, dynamic hedging should become possible","Dzingirai, Canicio; Chekenya, Nixon S.",Journal of Risk Finance,243,22

However, precise hemostatic changes in the very early stage of the disease are not completely studied. The aim of the study was to study von Willebrand factor (vWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) plasma levels and activity in the first hours (up to 24 h) of PAF clinical manifestation. Material and methods: We selected consecutively 51 non-anticoagulated patients (26 men, 25 women, mean age: 59.84 ±1.60) with PAF and 52 controls (26 men, 26 women, mean age: 59.50 ±1.46 years) corresponding in gender, accompanying diseases and conducted treatment. The indicators were examined using enzyme-linked immunoassays and photometric tests. Results: All patients were hospitalized between the 2nd and 24th h after the onset of arrhythmia (mean: 8.14 ±0.74 h). Higher FVIII levels (107.52 ±3.48% vs. 93.85 ±2.93%, p < 0.05) and activity (200.03 ±11.11% vs. 109.73 ±4.90%, p < 0.001) were found in the PAF group. vWF levels (178.40 ±12.95% vs. 119.53 ±6.12%, p < 0.001) and activity (200.92 ±12.45% vs. 110.80 ±5.14%, p < 0.001) were also higher. These changes did not depend on age, sex, body mass index or CHA2DS2-VASc score in the PAF group (p > 0.05). PAF duration was a significant predictor of increased FVIII levels and activity. Increased PAF duration was followed by increased values of the factors (r = 0.85, p < 0.001; r = 0.83, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The results presented an activated coagulation cascade and endothelial injury, suggesting hypercoagulability still in the early hours of PAF. These changes in PAF did not correlate with CHA2DS2-VASc score risk factors, outlining PAF as a possible independent embolic risk factor.","Negreva, Mariya Negrinova; Prodanova, Krasimira; Vitlianova, Katerina; Madjova, Christiana",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,243,1

Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus. Human Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) have many similarities, but also have differences in their genomic and phenotypic structure that can influence their pathogenesis. COVID-19 is containing singlestranded (positive-sense) RNA associated with a nucleoprotein within a capsid comprised of matrix protein. A typical CoV contains at least six ORFs in its genome. All the structural and accessory proteins are translated from the sgRNAs of CoVs. Four main structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 10, 11 on the one-third of the genome near the 30-terminus. The genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important. This article highlights the most important of these features compared to other Betacoronaviruses.

BCG has long been known for its non-specific beneficial effects, most likely explained by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, termed trained immunity. In this issue of the JCI, Rivas et al. add to these arguments by showing that BCG-vaccinated healthcare providers from a Los Angeles healthcare organization had less COVID-19 diagnosis and serology, compared to unvaccinated individuals. Prospective clinical trials are thus warranted to explore BCG effects in COVID-19.

The interactions between hACE2 and the spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 hold the key to understanding the molecular mechanism to develop treatment and vaccines, yet the dynamic nature of these interactions in fluctuating surroundings is very challenging to probe by those structure determination techniques requiring the structures of samples to be fixed. Here we demonstrate, by a proof-of-concept simulation of infrared (IR) spectra of S protein and hACE2, that time-resolved spectroscopy may monitor the real-time structural information of the protein-protein complexes of interest, with the help of machine learning. Our machine learning protocol is able to identify fine changes in IR spectra associated with variation of the secondary structures of S protein of the coronavirus. Further, it is three to four orders of magnitude faster than conventional quantum chemistry calculations. We expect our machine learning protocol would accelerate the development of real-time spectroscopy study of protein dynamics.","Ye, Sheng; Zhang, Guozhen; Jiang, Jun",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Being eukaryotes, these cells have been used as a model for studying and understanding complex cellular processes in humans like cell motility, phagocytosis, and metabolism. The ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 that infects multiple organs has emerged as a challenge to unravel its mode of infection and the pathogenicity resulting in eukaryotic cell death. Working with these single-celled eukaryotic microbes provided us the opportunity to plan bioinformatic approaches to look into the likelihood of studying the known and alternative mode of infection of the SARS-CoV-2 in eukaryotic cells. Genome databases of N. fowleri, B. mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba spp. were used to explore the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), androgen-regulated serine protease precursor (TMPRSS2), CD4, CD147, and furin that are known to be cardinal for SARS-CoV-2 in recognition and binding to human cells. It was hypothesized that if a receptor-dependent or phagocytosis-assisted SARS-CoV-2 uptake does occur in free-living amoebae (FLA), this model can provide an alternative to human cells to study cellular recognition and binding of SARS-CoV-2 that can help design drugs and treatment modalities in COVID-19. We show that, of the FLA, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not expressed in Acanthamoeba spp. and B. mandrillaris, but primitive forms of these cell recognition proteins were seen to be encoded in N. fowleri. Acanthamoeba spp. and N. fowleri encode for human-like furin which is a known SARS-CoV-2 spike protein involved in host cell recognition and binding.","Baig, Abdul Mannan",ACS Chem Neurosci,243,30

The authors explore how close Sláintecare is to the UHC ideal. They also review the phased strategy of implementation in Sláintecare that utilises a systems-thinking approach with interlinkages between entitlements, funding, capacity and implementation. Finally the authors review the Sláintecare milestones against the reality of implementation since the publication of the report in 2017, cognisant of government policy and practice. Some of the initial assumptions around the context of Sláintecare were not realised and there has been limited progress made toward expanding entitlements, and certainly short of the original plan. Nevertheless there have been positive developments in that there is evidence that Government's Implementation Strategy and Action Plans are focussing on reforming a complex adaptive system rather than implementing a blueprint with such initiatives as integrated care pilots and citizen engagement. The authors find that this may help the system change but it risks losing some of the essential elements of entitlement expansion in favour of organisational change.","Thomas, Steve; Johnston, Bridget; Barry, Sarah; Siersbaek, Rikke; Burke, Sara",Health Policy,243,1

In the human lung, IL-11 upregulation has been associated with viral infections and a range of fibroinflammatory diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFß) and other disease factors can initiate an autocrine loop of IL-11 signaling in pulmonary fibroblasts, which, in a largely ERK-dependent manner, triggers the translation of profibrotic proteins. Lung epithelial cells also express the IL-11 receptor and transition into a mesenchymal-like state in response to IL-11 exposure. In mice, therapeutic targeting of IL-11 with antibodies can arrest and reverse bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation. Intriguingly, fibroblast-specific blockade of IL-11 signaling has anti-inflammatory effects, which suggests that lung inflammation is sustained, in part, through IL-11 activity in the stroma. Proinflammatory fibroblasts and their interaction with the damaged epithelium may represent an important but overlooked driver of lung disease. Initially thought of as a protective cytokine, IL-11 is now increasingly recognized as an important determinant of lung fibrosis, inflammation, and epithelial dysfunction.","Ng, Benjamin; Cook, Stuart A; Schafer, Sebastian",Exp. mol. med,243,24

OBJECTIVES: We examine outcomes in critically ill individuals with COVID-19 who develop atrial tachyarrhythmias. METHODS: We collected data from electrocardiograms and the electronic medical record of COVID-19 positive (COVID+ ) and negative (COVID- ) individuals admitted to our medical intensive care unit between February 29 and June 28, 2020. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics, new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia, hemodynamic compromise following atrial tachyarrhythmia, and in-hospital mortality in COVID+ versus COVID- . Hemodynamic compromise was defined as having a new or increased vasopressor requirement or the need for direct current cardioversion for hemodynamic instability within 1 hour of atrial tachyarrhythmia onset. RESULTS: Of 300 individuals included, 200 were COVID+ and 100 were COVID- . Mean age was 60 ± 16 years, 180 (60%) were males, and 170 (57%) were African American. New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia occurred in 16% of COVID+ and 19% of COVID- individuals (P = .51). When compared to COVID- participants without atrial tachyarrhythmia, COVID+ individuals with new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia had higher mortality after multivariable adjustment (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.9-13.5). New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia was followed by hemodynamic compromise in 18 COVID+ but no COVID- participants (P = .0001). COVID+ individuals with hemodynamic compromise after atrial tachyarrhythmia required increased ventilatory support at the time of atrial tachyarrhythmia onset. CONCLUSIONS: Atrial tachyarrhythmia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill individuals with COVID-19, especially those mechanically ventilated. Recognition of this could assist with clinical care for individuals with COVID-19.","Colon, Chad M; Barrios, James G; Chiles, Joe W; Brown, Todd M; Pogwizd, Steven M; McElwee, Samuel K; Gandotra, Sheetal; Russell, Derek W; McElderry, H Tom; Maddox, William R",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,243,21

The decrease in medical and surgical visits ranged from 40 percent to 52 percent across acuity levels, with no statistically significant differences between higher- and lower-acuity visits after correction for multiple comparisons. Mental health visits saw a smaller decrease (-32 percent), and there was no decrease for visits due to substance use. Medicare patients had the smallest decrease in visits (-31 percent) of the insurance groups; privately insured (-46 percent) and Medicaid (-44 percent) patients saw larger drops.

They used a modified Delphi process to build a reporting scheme and expressed a level of agreement for each section of the report. To measure the internal consistency of the panelist ratings for each section of the report, a quality analysis based on the average inter-item correlation was performed with Cronbach’s alpha (Cα) correlation coefficient. Results: The overall mean score of the experts and the sum of score were 3.1 (std.dev. ± 0.11) and 122 in the second round, and improved to 3.75 (std.dev. ± 0.40) and 154 in the third round.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need to innovate and accelerate the development of effective vaccination strategies against EIDs. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a central role in the immune system by determining the peptide repertoire displayed to the T-cell compartment. Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA system thus confer a strong variability in vaccine-induced immune responses and may complicate the selection of vaccine candidates, because the distribution and frequencies of HLA alleles are highly variable among different ethnic groups. Herein, we build on the emerging paradigm of rational epitope-based vaccine design, by describing an immunoinformatics tool (Predivac-3.0) for proteome-wide T-cell epitope discovery that accounts for ethnic-level variations in immune responsiveness. Predivac-3.0 implements both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitope predictions based on HLA allele frequencies retrieved from the Allele Frequency Net Database. The tool was thoroughly assessed, proving comparable performances (AUC ~0.9) against four state-of-the-art pan-specific immunoinformatics methods capable of population-level analysis (NetMHCPan-4.0, Pickpocket, PSSMHCPan and SMM), as well as a strong accuracy on proteome-wide T-cell epitope predictions for HIV-specific immune responses in the Japanese population. The utility of the method was investigated for the COVID-19 pandemic, by performing in silico T-cell epitope mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein according to the ethnic context of the countries where the ChAdOx1 vaccine is currently initiating phase III clinical trials. Potentially immunodominant CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and population coverages were predicted for each population (the Epitope Discovery mode), along with optimized sets of broadly recognized (promiscuous) T-cell epitopes maximizing coverage in the target populations (the Epitope Optimization mode). Population-specific epitope-rich regions (T-cell epitope clusters) were further predicted in protein antigens based on combined criteria of epitope density and population coverage. Overall, we conclude that Predivac-3.0 holds potential to contribute in the understanding of ethnic-level variations of vaccine-induced immune responsiveness and to guide the development of epitope-based next-generation vaccines against emerging pathogens, whose geographic distributions and populations in need of vaccinations are often well-defined for regional epidemics.","Oyarzun, Patricio; Kashyap, Manju; Fica, Victor; Salas-Burgos, Alexis; Gonzalez-Galarza, Faviel F; McCabe, Antony; Jones, Andrew R; Middleton, Derek; Kobe, Bostjan",Front Immunol,243,26

We use exogenous climate shocks as instruments for social distancing since people are more likely to stay home in wetter and colder periods. Our findings suggest that the health benefits of social distancing differ by levels of municipal development and may have vanished if the COVID-19 spread was not controlled in neighboring municipalities. In turn, we did not find evidence that municipalities with tougher social distancing performed worse economically.

We also aimed to investigate whether CT findings may be predictive of patients' outcome. METHODS: From March 6 to March 22, 2020, 130 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients were enrolled for this single-center analysis and chest CT examinations were retrospectively evaluated. A semi-quantitative CT score was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement (0:0%; 1, < 5%; 2:5-25%; 3:26-50%; 4:51-75%; 5, > 75%; range 0-5; global score 0-25). Data were matched with clinical stages and laboratory findings. Survival curves and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the role of CT score as a predictor of patients' outcome. RESULTS: Ground glass opacities were predominant in early-phase (&#8804; 7 days since symptoms' onset), while crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis characterized late-phase disease (> 7 days). CT score was significantly higher in critical and severe than in mild stage (p < 0.0001), and among late-phase than early-phase patients (p < 0.0001). CT score was significantly correlated with CRP (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6204) and D-dimer (p < 0.0001, r = 0.6625) levels. A CT score of &#8805; 18 was associated with an increased mortality risk and was found to be predictive of death both in univariate (HR, 8.33; 95% CI, 3.19-21.73; p < 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.10-12.77; p = 0.0348). CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest the potential role of CT score for predicting the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 patients. CT score is highly correlated with laboratory findings and disease severity and might be beneficial to speed-up diagnostic workflow in symptomatic cases. KEY POINTS: â¢ CT score is positively correlated with age, inflammatory biomarkers, severity of clinical categories, and disease phases. â¢ A CT score &#8805; 18 has shown to be highly predictive of patient's mortality in short-term follow-up. â¢ Our multivariate analysis demonstrated that CT parenchymal assessment may more accurately reflect short-term outcome, providing a direct visualization of anatomic injury compared with non-specific inflammatory biomarkers.","Francone, Marco; Iafrate, Franco; Masci, Giorgio Maria; Coco, Simona; Cilia, Francesco; Manganaro, Lucia; Panebianco, Valeria; Andreoli, Chiara; Colaiacomo, Maria Chiara; Zingaropoli, Maria Antonella; Ciardi, Maria Rosa; Mastroianni, Claudio Maria; Pugliese, Francesco; Alessandri, Francesco; Turriziani, Ombretta; Ricci, Paolo; Catalano, Carlo",Eur Radiol,243,16

Yet, a formal analysis of how the medical literature has changed during the pandemic is lacking. In this analysis, we aimed to quantify how scientific publications changed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional bibliometric study of published studies in four high-impact medical journals to identify differences in the characteristics of COVID-19 related publications compared to non-pandemic studies. Original investigations related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 published in March and April 2020 were identified and compared to non-COVID-19 research publications over the same two-month period in 2019 and 2020. Extracted data included publication characteristics, study characteristics, author characteristics, and impact metrics. Our primary measure was principal component analysis (PCA) of publication characteristics and impact metrics across groups. RESULTS: We identified 402 publications that met inclusion criteria: 76 were related to COVID-19; 154 and 172 were non-COVID publications over the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively. PCA utilizing the collected bibliometric data revealed segregation of the COVID-19 literature subset from both groups of non-COVID literature (2019 and 2020). COVID-19 publications were more likely to describe prospective observational (31.6%) or case series (41.8%) studies without industry funding as compared with non-COVID articles, which were represented primarily by randomized controlled trials (32.5% and 36.6% in the non-COVID literature from 2020 and 2019, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of publications in four general medical journals, COVID-related articles were significantly different from non-COVID articles based on article characteristics and impact metrics. COVID-related studies were generally shorter articles reporting observational studies with less literature cited and fewer study sites, suggestive of more limited scientific support. They nevertheless had much higher dissemination.","Gai, Nan; Aoyama, Kazuyoshi; Faraoni, David; Goldenberg, Neil M; Levin, David N; Maynes, Jason T; McVey, Mark J; Munshey, Farrukh; Siddiqui, Asad; Switzer, Timothy; Steinberg, Benjamin E",PLoS One,243,16

This Health Policy identifies the necessary characteristics for a new global public health security convention designed to optimise prevention, preparedness, and response to pandemic infectious diseases. We propose ten recommendations to strengthen global public health governance and promote compliance with global health security regulations. Recommendations for a new global public health security convention include greater authority for a global governing body, an improved ability to respond to pandemics, an objective evaluation system for national core public health capacities, more effective enforcement mechanisms, independent and sustainable funding, representativeness, and investment from multiple sectors, among others. The next steps to achieve these recommendations include assembling an invested alliance, specifying the operational structures of a global public health security system, and overcoming barriers such as insufficient political will, scarcity of resources, and individual national interests.","Duff, Johnathan H; Liu, Anicca; Saavedra, Jorge; Batycki, Jacob N; Morancy, Kendra; Stocking, Barbara; Gostin, Lawrence O; Galea, Sandro; Bertozzi, Stefano; Zuniga, Jose M; Alberto-Banatin, Carmencita; Dansua, Akua Sena; Del Rio, Carlos; Kulzhanov, Maksut; Lee, Kelley; Scaglia, Gisela; Shahpar, Cyrus; Ullmann, Andrew J; Hoffman, Steven J; Weinstein, Michael; Szapocznik, José",Lancet Public Health,243,20

The aim of this study was to investigate whether this occurs 1) for COPD and respiratory tract infections (RTIs); 2) after school resumes in January and March; and 3) identify which viruses may be responsible. Methods: Emergency department (ED) visits and admissions for asthma, COPD and RTIs and the prevalence of viruses in Ontario, Canada were analysed daily between 2003 and 2013. ED visits and admissions were provided by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. Viral prevalence was obtained from the Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Infectious Diseases. Results: ED visits and admissions rates demonstrated a biphasic pattern. Lowest rates occurred in July and August and the highest rates in September for asthma, and after December for COPD and RTI. The increase in rates for 30â days before and after school return in September was greatest for children with asthma <15â years (2.4-2.6×). Event rates fell after school return in January for all three conditions ranging from 10-25%, and no change followed March break for asthma and COPD. Human rhinovirus was prevalent in summer with a modest relationship to asthma rates in September. The prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and coronavirus was associated with sustained event rates for COPD and RTIs. Conclusions: Asthma, COPD and RTIs increase in September but do not occur after return to school in January and March.

Previous research has suggested its potentially beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathies. However, its effects and protective mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of ASIV in reducing kidney damage in diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Studies were searched from nine databases until January 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate combined standardised mean difference estimates and 95 % confidence intervals. Risk of bias of studies was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool 10-item checklist. RevMan 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 562 animals were included in the meta-analysis. Studies quality scores ranged from 2 to 5. The ASIV group induced a marked decrease in serum creatinine (P < 0.00001), blood urea nitrogen (P < 0.00001), 24-h urine protein (P < 0.00001) and pathological score (P < 0.001) compared with the control group. The determined potential mechanisms of ASIV action were relieving oxidative stress, delaying renal fibrosis, anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory action. We conclude that ASIV exerts renal protective effects in animals with DM through multiple signalling pathways.","Zhou, Xiao-Tao; Zou, Jun-Ju; Ao, Chun; Gong, Dao-Yin; Chen, Xian; Ma, Yue-Rong",Pharmacol Res,243,2

Though social media provide platforms for expressing news and views, it is hard to control the quality of posts due to the sheer volumes of posts on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Misinformation and rumours have lasting effects on society, as they tend to influence people's opinions and also may motivate people to act irrationally. It is therefore very important to detect and remove rumours from these platforms. The only way to prevent the spread of rumours is through automatic detection and classification of social media posts. Our focus in this paper is the Twitter social medium, as it is relatively easy to collect data from Twitter. The majority of previous studies used supervised learning approaches to classify rumours on Twitter. These approaches rely on feature extraction to obtain both content and context features from the text of tweets to distinguish rumours and non-rumours. Manually extracting features however is time-consuming considering the volume of tweets. We propose a novel approach to deal with this problem by utilising sentence embedding using BERT to identify rumours on Twitter, rather than the usual feature extraction techniques. We use sentence embedding using BERT to represent each tweet's sentences into a vector according to the contextual meaning of the tweet. We classify those vectors into rumours or non-rumours by using various supervised learning techniques. Our BERT based models improved the accuracy by approximately 10% as compared to previous methods.","Anggrainingsih, Rini; Hassan, Ghulam Mubashar; Datta, Amitava",,243,19

In this study, we surveyed Canadian radiology residents to understand the impact of the pandemic on their residency training, strategies utilized by the residency programs in mitigating those impacts, and factors important to residents in the selection of educational resources on COVID-19. METHODS: A 10-item questionnaire was distributed to 460 resident members of the Canadian Association of Radiologists. The survey was open for 2 weeks, with a reminder sent at half-way mark. RESULTS: We received 96 responses (response rate: 20.9%). The 4 highest affected domains of training were daytime case volumes (92.4%), daytime schedules (87.4%), internal and external assessments (86.5%), and vacation/travel (83.3%). Virtual teaching rounds (91.7%), change in schedules to allow staying home (78.1%), and virtual/phone readouts (72.9%) were the most utilized strategies by the Canadian radiology residency programs. Overall stress of exposure to the disease was moderate to low (86.5%). A minority of the residents were redeployed (6.2%), although most (68.8%) were on standby for redeployment. Residents preferred published society guidelines (92.3%), review papers (79.3%), video lectures (79.3%), and web tools (76.9%) for learning about COVID-19 imaging manifestations. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on various domains of the Canadian radiology residency programs, which has been mitigated by several strategies employed by the training programs.","Odedra, Devang; Chahal, Baljot S; Patlas, Michael N",Can Assoc Radiol J,243,1

Moreover, smoking is associated with a poor tuberculosis treatment outcome. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we focus on the effects of cigarette smoke on an infected cell culture treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity on THP-1, J774A.1 and MH-S cell lines and growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposed to a reference or a commercial cigarette was evaluated. THP-1 cell line was exposed to cigarette smoke, infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs. Apoptosis and death cell were also tested on M. bovis BCG infected cells. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of anti-tuberculosis drugs were analyzed. RESULTS: All cells lines showed viability values higher than 80% when exposed to cigarette smoke extract. However, THP-1 cell line infected with M. bovis BCG and exposed to Marlboro cigarette smoke showed up to a 54% reduction of apoptotic cells than cells unexposed to smoke. M. tuberculosis exposed to Marlboro cigarette smoke for 11 days had an optical density 16% lower than unexposed bacteria. When cells were infected with M. tuberculosis, the intracellular recovery of CFUs showed up to a 0.66 log reduction in cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract because of a potential impairment in the phagocytosis. Macrophages treated with drugs showed up to a 2.55 log reduction in the intracellular load burden compared with non-treated ones. Despite poor treatment outcome on TB smoker patients, minimal inhibitory concentration of rifampicin increased only 2-fold in M. tuberculosis exposed to cigarette smoke.

Patients with mental illnesses may not be able to consistently follow up behavioral prescriptions to avoid contagion, and they are frequently found in settings with close contact and inadequate infection control, such as group homes, homeless shelters, residential rehabilitation centers, and correctional facilities. Furthermore, inpatient psychiatry settings are generally designed as communal spaces, with heavy emphasis on group and milieu therapies. As such, inpatient psychiatry services are vulnerable to rampant spread of contagion. OBJECTIVE: With this in mind, the authors outline the decision process and ultimate design and implementation of a regional inpatient psychiatry unit for patients infected with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and share key points for consideration in implementing future units elsewhere.

SARS-CoV-2 continues to be a serious threat to global public health, leaving a distinct footprint in human history. Our research visualizes and contextualizes the mechanism of remdesivir, an antiviral nucleotide analog prodrug. Remdesivir targets the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to inhibit replication of the virus. This process is facilitated by a subunit replication-and-transcription complex of three major nonstructural proteins (nsps): nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12. With our three-dimensional model (PDB ID 7BV2), we depict the mechanism of remdesivir inhibition of the copying of the viral RNA template through the central channel of RdRp by terminating chain elongation. Our protein model will guide other researchers and students through the mechanism of action of remdesivir and emphasizes the role of this adenosine nucleotide analogue as it binds to the RNA primer. Our model illustrates how remdesivir impacts viral replication by inhibiting the viral RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.","Eid, Asal Kalyanaraman Karshana Nguyen Binh Dale Sierra Rusch-Salazar Laura",The FASEB Journal,243,3

Objetivou-se comparar a influência dos fios de quitosana e Poliglecaprone na reparação tecidual após enterorrafia do ceco e laparorrafia mediana de coelhos (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Utilizou-se 42 animais alocados em dois grandes grupos, sendo um submetido a cecorrafia e laparorrafia mediana com fio de quitosana, e outro com fio poliglecaprone. As complicações pós-operatória foram avaliadas macroscopicamente e as reações teciduais microscopicamente nos tempos 5, 15 e 25 dias de pós-operatório; além do mais, foram avaliadas pelo auxílio de câmera termográfica, diariamente, até o 15° dia e, quando possível, ao 25º dia. Após avaliação termográfica, notaram-se diferença estatística obtendo-se p=0,0003 entre os grupos Quitosana e Poliglecaprone. Quanto à avaliação macroscópica, não observaram-se diferença estatística na incidência de complicações entre os grupos. Pelo método histológico, a cicatrização muscular diferiu entre os grupos, apenas na intensidade do tecido de granulação (p=0,041) e fibrose (p=0,030) no 15° dia do pós-operatório. Avaliádo a reparação intestinal, essas diferiram apenas quanto à intensidade da presença de polimorfonucleares no 15º dia pós-operatório (p=0,041). Conclui-se que os fios de quitosana e poliglecaprone foram semelhantemente eficazes em garantir a cicatrização do ceco e do músculo reto do abdômen após cecorrafia e laparorrafia mediana findado o período de 25 dias pós-operatório.","FILHO, SAULO HUMBERTO DE AVILA",,243,1

This illiberal trend was subsequently strengthened during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methodology/Approach – It considers that law also constitutes and not only orders political and social relationships. Law, including media law, has been in Hungary one of the main factors of change or rather of political-social construction. This chapter therefore moves from the study of positive law and analyzes Hungarian media laws within the theoretical framework of illiberal democracy, drawing from contributions to political science and socio-legal studies. Findings – This chapter demonstrated that media laws have outlined in Hungary a centralized regulatory system with broad powers, which lacks political independence, therefore encouraging self-censorship and limiting freedom of expression and pluralism. These laws contributed to shape the illiberal U-turn occurred in the country before the pandemic, but the coronavirus offered the occasion to reinforce government powers, giving the leeway to rule with no or minimum scrutiny for an indefinite period and further limiting dissent. The analysis enabled to argue that neither the media regulation established during the past decade nor the laws adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic are compatible with a modern democracy. Originality/Value – Based on existing literature, little research has been conducted on the appearance and endurance of non-democratic regimes, and supposedly even less within the context of the coronavirus pandemic which started only a few months ago, compared to the contributions available on democratization processes and democratic consolidation. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bellucci, L.",Sociology of Crime Law and Deviance,243,16

Local studies showed that hospital pharmacy is the most preferred sector, while community pharmacy is the least preferred. However, jobs in hospital pharmacy are limited compared to community pharmacy. Hence, to accommodate the increasing numbers of pharmacy graduates and to facilitate the implementation of Saudi Vision 2030, which promotes primary healthcare and the participation of both private and non-governmental organisations in healthcare delivery, community pharmacy ought to be Saudised. This study was conducted to assess the career choices made by Saudi pharmacy students and the enablers that influence their career choice, especially in community pharmacy. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional approach was used. A total of 437 final year pharmacy students were recruited from 15 pharmacy schools around the country. RESULTS: Salary and advancement opportunities as well as geographical location, benefits, and work environment were found to be ""very important"" enablers when making career decisions. Hospital pharmacy was selected as the most preferred sector by 242 (55.4%) of the participants, while community pharmacy was the least favoured pharmacy sector (17% or 6.2%). The enablers that might influence the consideration of a job in community pharmacy included career aspiration and social accountability. On the other hand, the barriers were personal beliefs about the sector and the nature of the work. CONCLUSIONS: The community pharmacy sector was found to be the least preferred sector to work in. The study revealed a list of enablers that the participants found to be relevant or of high relevance when choosing community pharmacy as a career pathway. Some of the enablers contribute to the role of the pharmacist towards the local community, social accountability, and towards the country's Vision, such as interaction with the general public and educating them. Other enablers are related to the pharmacists' career aspirations, such as owning a business. Some of the barriers that were found relevant include high workload, inflexible working hours, and limited opportunities for professional development. Localisation of community pharmacies would help to create more jobs for national pharmacists, increase the participation of female pharmacists in the workforce and support the achievement of Vision 2030. The barriers should be tackled on several levels: undergraduate curriculum, regulatory, and actual practice. Undergraduate education needs to include primary pharmaceutical care services in its curriculum. Regulatory changes include enforcing the renationalisation of the community pharmacy sector and permitting females to work in community pharmacies without location restrictions.","Almaghaslah, Dalia; Alsayari, Abdulrhman; Almanasef, Mona; Asiri, Amjad",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),243,16

From a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb - 1 , events containing one muon or electron and two or three jets are analysed. The cross section is measured as a function of the top quark transverse momentum ( p T ), rapidity, and polarisation angle, the charged lepton p T and rapidity, and the p T of the W boson from the top quark decay. In addition, the charge ratio is measured differentially as a function of the top quark, charged lepton, and W boson kinematic observables. The results are found to be in agreement with standard model predictions using various next-to-leading-order event generators and sets of parton distribution functions. Additionally, the spin asymmetry, sensitive to the top quark polarisation, is determined from the differential distribution of the polarisation angle at parton level to be 0.440 ± 0.070 , in agreement with the standard model prediction.","Sirunyan, A M; Tumasyan, A; Adam, W; Ambrogi, F; Bergauer, T; Brandstetter, J; Dragicevic, M; Erö, J; Del Valle, A Escalante; Flechl, M; Frühwirth, R; Jeitler, M; Krammer, N; Krätschmer, I; Liko, D; Madlener, T; Mikulec, I; Rad, N; Schieck, J; Schöfbeck, R; Spanring, M; Spitzbart, D; Waltenberger, W; Wulz, C-E; Zarucki, M; Drugakov, V; Mossolov, V; Gonzalez, J Suarez; Darwish, M R; De Wolf, E A; Di Croce, D; Janssen, X; Lauwers, J; Lelek, A; Pieters, M; Sfar, H Rejeb; Van Haevermaet, H; Van Mechelen, P; Van Putte, S; Van Remortel, N; Blekman, F; Bols, E S; Chhibra, S S; D039,; Hondt, J; De Clercq, J; Lontkovskyi, D; Lowette, S; Marchesini, I; Moortgat, S; Moreels, L",Eur Phys J C Part Fields,243,16

With the migration of people, the epidemic has rapidly spread within China and throughout the world. Due to the severity of the epidemic, undiscovered transmission of COVID-19 deserves further investigation. The aim of our study hypothesized possible modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and how the virus may have spread between two family clusters within a residential building in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we monitored and traced confirmed patients and their close contacts from January 11 to February 5, 2020 in Guangzhou, China, including 2 family cluster cases and 61 residents within one residential building. The environmental samples of the building and the throat swabs from the patients and from their related individuals were collected for SARS-CoV-2 and tested with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relevant information was collected and reported using big data tools. RESULTS: There were two notable family cluster cases in Guangzhou, which included 3 confirmed patients (family No.1: patient A, B, C) and 2 confirmed patients (family No.2: patient D, E), respectively. None of patients had contact with other confirmed patients before the onset of symptoms, and only patient A and patient B made a short stop in Wuhan by train. Home environment inspection results showed that the door handle of family No.1 was positive of SARS-CoV-2. The close contacts of the 5 patients all tested negative of SARS-CoV-2 and in good health, and therefore were released after the official medical observation period of 14-days. Finally, according to the traceability investigation through applying big data analysis, we found an epidemiological association between family No.1 and family No.2, in which patient D (family No.2) was infected through touching an elevator button contaminated by snot with virus from patient A (family No.1) on the same day. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminants with virus from confirmed patients can pollute the environment of public places, and the virus can survive on the surface of objects for a short period of time. Therefore, in addition to the conventional droplet transmission, there is also indirect contact transmission such as snot-oral transmission that plays a crucial role in community spread of the virus.","Xie, Chaojun; Zhao, Hongjun; Li, Kuibiao; Zhang, Zhoubin; Lu, Xiaoxiao; Peng, Huide; Wang, Dahu; Chen, Jin; Zhang, Xiao; Wu, Di; Gu, Yuzhou; Yuan, Jun; Zhang, Lin; Lu, Jiachun",BMC Public Health,243,16

However, the mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of lipid biosynthesis in breast cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we reported that seryl tRNA synthetase (SerRS), a key enzyme for protein biosynthesis, could translocate into the nucleus in a glucose-dependent manner to suppress key genes involved in the de novo lipid biosynthesis. In normal mammary gland epithelial cells glucose can promote the nuclear translocation of SerRS by increasing the acetylation of SerRS at lysine 323. In SerRS knock-in mice bearing acetylation-defective lysine to arginine mutation, we observed increased body weight and adipose tissue mass. In breast cancer cells the acetylation and nuclear translocation of SerRS are greatly inhibited. Overexpression of SerRS, in particularly the acetylation-mimetic lysine to glutamine mutant, dramatically inhibits the de novo lipid synthesis and hence greatly suppresses the proliferation of breast cancer cells and the growth of breast cancer xenografts in mice. We further identified that HDAC4 and HDAC5 regulated the acetylation and nuclear translocation of SerRS. Thus, we identified a SerRS-meditated inhibitory pathway in glucose-induced lipid biosynthesis, which is dysregulated in breast cancer.","Zhao, Jin; Bai, Hangming; Li, Xiaoyu; Yan, Jie; Zou, Gengyi; Wang, Longlong; Li, Xiru; Liu, Ze; Xiang, Rong; Yang, Xiang-Lei; Shi, Yi",Signal Transduct Target Ther,243,33

The question of how to give HCWs the best protection against infection is a priority. METHODS: We searched systematic reviews and original studies in Medline (via Ovid) and Chinese Wan Fang digital database from inception to May, 2020, using terms 'coronavirus', 'health personnel', and 'personal protective equipment' to find evidence about the use of full-body PPEs and other PPEs by HCW exposed highly infectious diseases. RESULTS: Covering more of the body could provide better protection for HCWs. Of importance, it is not just the provision of PPE but the skills in donning and doffing of PPE that are important, this being a key time for potential transmission of pathogen to the HCW and in due time from them to others. In relation to face masks, the evidence indicates that a higher-level specification of face masks and respirators (such as N95) seems to be essential to protect HCWs from coronavirus infection. In community setting, the use of masks in the case of well individuals could be beneficial. Evidence specifically around PPE and protection from the COVID-19 virus is limited. CONCLUSION: Covering more of the body, and a higher-level specification of masks and respirators could provide better protection for HCWs. Community mask usecould be beneficial. High quality studies still need to examine the protection of PPE against COVID-19.","Tian, Zixing; Stedman, Michael; Whyte, Martin; Anderson, Simon G; Thomson, George; Heald, Adrian",Int J Clin Pract,243,16

METHODS: All adult patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA found in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs between March 10 and April 21, 2020 were surveyed by the authors for new onset symptoms during disease course. Demographic features, general symptoms, and Otorhinolaryngological symptoms were evaluated and compared by disease severity. RESULTS: Of 223 included patients, 18.4% had mild, 61.4%; moderate, 14.3%; severe, and 5.8%; critical disease. Median age was 51 (range 20-93), 113 (50.7%) were male and 110 (49.3%) were female. The most common general symptoms were fatigue, cough, and fever with respective frequencies of 71.3%, 54.3%, and 50.7%. The most common Otorhinolaryngologic symptoms were taste loss, smell loss, and sore throat with respective frequencies of 34.5%, 31.8%, and 26%. Fatigue, fever, and dyspnea were more common in severe-critical patients compared to mild-moderate patients (p = 0.029, p = 0.016, and p < 0.001, respectively). Only smell loss was more common in mild-moderate group (p = 0.003). Prevalence of other symptoms did not differ between groups. Symptom durations and onset time to diagnosis varied. CONCLUSION: When compared to the previous studies, while general symptoms were less common, Otorhinolaryngologic symptoms were more common in our study population. Considering high infection risks, Otorhinolaryngologists should be aware of COVID-19 patients presenting with Otorhinolaryngologic complaints.","Salepci, Egehan; Turk, Bilge; Ozcan, Safiye Nur; Bektas, Merve Ekici; Aybal, Alperen; Dokmetas, Ilyas; Turgut, Suat",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,243,9

Although children and adolescents have been largely spared from the more severe symptoms associated with the disease, global health organizations such as the United Nations have suggested that COVID-19 may have the longest and most severe impact on children and adolescents due to the socioeconomic, physical, psychological impacts associated with the disease itself and the measures taken to stop transmission, such as physical distancing. This paper provides an overview of the evolutionary basis for community, and the ways that social and physical distancing measures to contain COVID-19 threaten the important social learning and support that community provides. It will then discuss, based on research from prior pandemics, recommendations from global health authorities, and emerging data on the impacts of COVID-19, how this pandemic is likely to impact the mental health of children and adolescents.

In the Middle East and North Africa, falling oil prices, disparities in wealth and public health infrastructure, and large refugee populations have significantly increased the COVID-19 disease burden. In light of these exacerbating factors, public health surveillance is particularly necessary to help leaders understand and implement effective disease control policies to reduce Sars-CoV-2 persistence and transmission. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics, in combination with traditional surveillance, for COVID-19 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, to better understand country risk for explosive growth and to better inform those who are managing the pandemic. Existing surveillance coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until an effective vaccine is developed. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 30 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We use an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the Middle East and North Africa as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: The regression Wald statistic is significant (&#967;^2 (5)=859.5, P<.001). The Sargan test is not significant, failing to reject the validity of over identifying restrictions (&#967;^2 (294)= 16 P=.99). Countries with the highest cumulative caseload of the novel coronavirus include Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Israel with 530,380, 426,634, 342,202, and 303,109 cases respectively. Many of the smaller countries in MENA have higher infection rates than those countries with the highest caseloads. Oman has 33.3 new infections per 100,000 population while Bahrain has 12.1, Libya has 14, and Lebanon has 14.6. In order of most to least number of cumulative deaths since January 2020, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia have 30,375, 10,254, 6,120, and 5,185 respectively. Israel, Bahrain, Lebanon, and Oman had the highest rates of COVID-19 persistence which are the number of new infections statistically related to new infections 7 days ago. Bahrain had positive speed, acceleration and jerk signaling the potential for explosive growth. CONCLUSIONS: Static and dynamic public health surveillance metrics provide a more complete picture of pandemic progression across countries in MENA. Static measures capture data at a given point in time such as infection rates and death rates. By including speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence, public health officials may design policy with an eye to the future. Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Israel all demonstrated the highest rate of infections, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence rates prompting public health leaders to increase prevention efforts.","Post, Lori; Marogi, Emily; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Ison, Michael G; Achenbach, Chad J; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren; White, Janine; Oehmke, James Francis",J. med. internet res,243,24

The virus, known as COVID-19, is recognized as a potentially life-threatening disease by causing severe respiratory disease. Since this virus has not previously been detected in humans, there is a paucity of information regarding its effects on humans. In addition, only limited or no information exists about its impact during pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present case study, we report the death of a neonate born to a 32-year-old mother with coronavirus disease 2019 in Ilam, Iran, with Kurdish ethnicity. We report the infection and death of a neonate in Iran with a chest X-ray (CXR) marked abnormality 2 hours after birth demonstrating coronavirus disease 2019 disease. The neonate was born by elective cesarean section, the fetal health was assessed using fetal heart rate and a non-stress test before the birth, and there was no evidence of fetal distress. All the above-mentioned facts and radiographic abnormalities suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 is involved. CONCLUSIONS: In this case study, we report the death of a neonate born to a mother with coronavirus disease 2019, 11 hours after birth. There is a paucity of data on the vertical transmission and the adverse maternal-fetal consequences of this disease, so vertical transmission from mother to child remains to be confirmed.","Rashidian, Tayebeh; Sharifi, Nasibeh; Fathnezhad-Kazemi, Azita; Mirzamrajani, Fatemeh; Nourollahi, Sajad; Ghaysouri, Abas",J Med Case Rep,243,3

We studied public perception of social distancing through organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we retrieved English-only tweets matching two trending social distancing hashtags, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We analyzed the tweets using natural language processing and machine-learning models, and we conducted a sentiment analysis to identify emotions and polarity. We evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and associated sentiments. RESULTS: We studied a sample of 574,903 tweets. For both hashtags, polarity was positive (mean, 0.148; SD, 0.290); only 15% of tweets had negative polarity. Tweets were more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0-0.6) with ~30% of tweets labeled as completely objective (labeled as 0 in range from 0 to 1). Approximately half of tweets (50.4%) primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise. Each correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure and community support (ie, joy), concerns about food insecurity and quarantine effects (ie, fear), and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications (ie, surprise). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the positive sentiment, preponderance of objective tweets, and topics supporting coping mechanisms, we concluded that Twitter users generally supported social distancing in the early stages of their implementation.","Saleh, Sameh N; Lehmann, Christoph U; McDonald, Samuel A; Basit, Mujeeb A; Medford, Richard J",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,243,20

Organic solvents such as alcohols and acetone remove lipids and dehydrate the cells, precipitating the proteins on the cellular architecture. Cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde form intermolecular bridges, normally through free amino groups, thus creating a network of linked antigens. Choosing between fixation in organic solvents or cross-linking agents is empirical. There are no general rules to decide between the two and both procedures are described here. Both methods may denature protein antigens, and for this reason, antibodies prepared against denatured proteins may be more useful for cell staining. In some instances, anti-denatured-protein antibodies are the only ones that can work. Fixation in protein cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde preserves cell structure better than organic solvents but may reduce the antigenicity of some cell components. Simple fixation with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde does not allow the antibody to access the specimen and therefore is followed by a permeabilization step using an organic solvent or nonionic detergent. Using the organic solvent is easy, but it can destroy certain elements of the cell architecture, although prior fixation with paraformaldehyde does help to preserve the cellular structure. If preservation of cell structure is important, the best first choice would be to use a nonionic detergent.","Rodig, Scott J",Cold Spring Harb Protoc,243,26

We describe the long-term patterns of paediatric disease associated with three of these viruses, HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E, in coastal Kenya. Methods: Continuous surveillance of pneumonia admissions was conducted at the Kilifi county hospital (KCH) located in the northern coastal region of Kenya. Children aged <5 years admitted to KCH with clinically defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited. Respiratory samples were taken and tested for 15 virus targets, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unadjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and HCoV positivity. Results: From 2007 to 2019, we observed 11,445 pneumonia admissions, of which 314 (3.9%) tested positive for at least one HCoV type. There were 129 (41.1%) OC43, 99 (31.5%) 229E, 74 (23.6%) NL63 positive cases and 12 (3.8%) cases of HCoV to HCoV coinfection. Among HCoV positive cases, 47% (n=147) were coinfected with other respiratory virus pathogens. The majority of HCoV cases were among children aged <1 year (66%, n=208), though there was no age-dependence in the proportion testing positive. HCoV-OC43 was predominant of the three HCoV types throughout the surveillance period. Evidence for seasonality was not identified. Conclusions: Overall, 4% of paediatric pneumonia admissions were associated with three endemic HCoVs, with a high proportion of cases co-occurring with another respiratory virus, with no clear seasonal pattern, and with the age-distribution of cases following that of pneumonia admissions (i.e. highest in infants). These observations suggest, at most, a small severe disease contribution of endemic HCoVs in this tropical setting and offer insight into the potential future burden and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.","Otieno, Grieven P; Murunga, Nickson; Agoti, Charles N; Gallagher, Katherine E; Awori, Juliet O; Nokes, D James",Wellcome Open Res,243,5

Adult opioid dependent patients prescribed OST and attending outreach were recruited. Participants received two appointments in randomized group. Telemedicine was delivered using Skype-for-business videoconferencing. Patients attended outreach, saw keyworker for drug testing first, and telemedicine conducted via keyworker's laptop. Addiction prescribers located remotely at Hub. Post-trial research interview conducted assessing patient and staff experience of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face consultations.

Patient participants reported similar levels of satisfaction between the Telemedicine and Face to Face groups. The themes generated in relation to Face-to-Face were no difference, easy, kind staff and liking being part of research. For Telemedicine, themes were less travel, good experience, easier to access, good communication, saves time and saves money. For instance, one patient stated ‘Clear, easy to access less travel’ and another patient stated ‘I struggle with travel. I found it easier’. Of 19 staff participant research interviews completed, Staff reported Good or Very Good experience with telemedicine which was equivalent for Face-to-Face consultations. Eleven staff had experience of telemedicine consultations during the trial. They reported similar themes to patients with telemedicine leading to less travel, beneficial to patient care, improves attendance and was innovative technology. One staff member reported satisfaction with telemedicine due to ‘Time, travel and money reduction’. When questioned on the downsides to telemedicine, technological issues were mainly related to connection issues and sound issues.ConclusionIn the first known RCT of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face consultations for patients with opioid dependence attending prescriber review, we found that both patients and staff were satisfied with telemedicine as compared to face-to-face consultations. Overall themes were reduced travel, saving time and more convenience.

T-cell immunity to COVID-19 is mediated through differentiated CD4+ T-cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, although their differentiation is often atypical and ambiguous in COVID-19 and single cell dynamics of key genes need to be characterized. Notably, T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients, although their molecular features are still yet to be fully revealed. Importantly, it is not clear which T-cell activities are beneficial and protective and which ones can contribute to the development of severe COVID-19. In this article, we examine the latest evidence and discuss the key features of T-cell responses in COVID-19, showing how T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients. Particularly, we highlight the impairment of FOXP3 induction in CD4+ T-cells and how the impaired FOXP3 expression can lead to the differentiation of abnormally activated (hyperactivated) T-cells and the dysregulated T-cell responses in severe patients. Furthermore, we characterise the feature of hyperactivated T-cells, showing their potential contribution to T-cell dysregulation and immune-mediated tissue destruction (immunopathology) in COVID-19.","Kalfaoglu, Bahire; Almeida-Santos, José; Tye, Chanidapa Adele; Satou, Yorifumi; Ono, Masahiro",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,243,1

We prospectively screened at-risk individuals for SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein antibodies in a POC setting to determine if it was a feasible method to identify antibody from prior infection. METHODS: Three EUA-approved lateral flow antibody assays were performed on POC finger-stick blood and compared with serum and a CLIA nucleocapsid antibody immunoassay. Variables including antibody class, time since PCR, and the assay antigen used were evaluated. RESULTS: 512 subjects enrolled, of which 104 had a COVID-19 history and positive PCR. Only three PCR-positive subjects required hospitalization, with one requiring mechanical ventilation. The POC results correlated well with the immunoassay (93-97% sensitivity) and using serum did not improve the sensitivity or specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Finger-stick, POC COVID-19 antibody testing was highly effective in identifying antibody resulting from prior infections in mildly symptomatic subjects. Using high-complexity serum immunoassays did not improve the screening outcome. Almost all individuals with COVID-19 infection produced detectable antibodies to the virus. POC antibody testing is useful as a screen for prior COVID-19 infection, and should be useful in assessing vaccine response.","Schuler, Charles F; Gherasim, Carmen; O039,; Shea, Kelly; Manthei, David M; Chen, Jesse; Giacherio, Don; Troost, Jonathan P; Baldwin, James L; Baker, James R",PLoS One,243,24

Therefore, there is a crucial need for safe and effective therapies. Ultraviolet-A (UVA) phototherapy is FDA-approved for several dermatological diseases but not for internal applications. We investigated UVA effects on human cells in vitro, mouse colonic tissue in vivo, and UVA efficacy against bacteria, yeast, coxsackievirus group B and coronavirus-229E. Several pathogens and virally transfected human cells were exposed to a series of specific UVA exposure regimens. HeLa, alveolar and primary human tracheal epithelial cell viability was assessed after UVA exposure, and 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine was measured as an oxidative DNA damage marker. Furthermore, wild-type mice were exposed to intracolonic UVA as an in vivo model to assess safety of internal UVA exposure. Controlled UVA exposure yielded significant reductions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridioides difficile, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans. UVA-treated coxsackievirus-transfected HeLa cells exhibited significantly increased cell survival compared to controls. UVA-treated coronavirus-229E-transfected tracheal cells exhibited significant coronavirus spike protein reduction, increased mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein and decreased coronavirus-229E-induced cell death. Specific controlled UVA exposure had no significant effect on growth or 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in three types of human cells. Single or repeated in vivo intraluminal UVA exposure produced no discernible endoscopic, histologic or dysplastic changes in mice. These findings suggest that, under specific conditions, UVA reduces various pathogens including coronavirus-229E, and may provide a safe and effective treatment for infectious diseases of internal viscera. Clinical studies are warranted to further elucidate the safety and efficacy of UVA in humans.","Rezaie, Ali; Leite, Gabriela G S; Melmed, Gil Y; Mathur, Ruchi; Villanueva-Millan, Maria Jesus; Parodi, Gonzalo; Sin, Jon; Germano, Juliana F; Morales, Walter; Weitsman, Stacy; Kim, Seung Young; Park, Jae Ho; Sakhaie, Siamak; Pimentel, Mark",PLoS One,243,29

Our training environment is robotless, as the end-effector is not attached to any specific robot. Trained policies can then be applied to different robotic arms without re-training. This approach can greatly reduce complexity to perform contact-rich robotic assembly in the real world, especially in unstructured settings such as in architectural construction.

In this study, we found that pterostilbene inhibited proliferation, induced intrinsic mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and caused S phase arrest, inhibited migration and excessive invasion in glioma cells. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the PTE-induced apoptosis of glioma cells. Moreover, PTE significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine not only rescued PTE-induced reduction of cellular viability but also prevented glioma cell apoptosis. We also discovered ERK 1/2 and JNK signaling pathways were activated by PTE and contributed to induce glioma cell apoptosis. In addition, specific inhibitors of ERK 1/2 and JNK attenuated PTE-induced apoptosis. Besides, PTE significantly reduced tumor volume and prolonged median survival of tumor-bearing rats in vivo. In summary, the results of this study indicate that the anti-tumor effect of PTE on glioma cells may provide a new treatment option for glioma patients.","Gao, Haijun; Liu, Ziqiang; Xu, Weidong; Wang, Qunhui; Zhang, Chaochao; Ding, Yaonan; Nie, Weiguang; Lai, Jiacheng; Chen, Yong; Huang, Haiyan",Sci Rep,243,16

METHODS: Twenty-four female 7-week old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: Con, administered with vehicle solutions; Cy, treated with Cy; Res + Cy, treated with Cy + Res combined; Res, treated with Res. After 21 d of treatments, the rats were euthanized and blood samples were collected to evaluate the levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). The Ovaries were processed for immunohistochemical and western blotting. RESULTS: Cy-treat caused the decrease of body weights and ovarian weight. AMH was lower in Cy group, whereas AMH levels were similar among other groups. Histomorphology showed a large number of primordial follicles were activated in Cy groups, whereas the primordial follicles were inhibited in the Res and Res + Cy groups.

Here, we investigated the protective effect and mechanism of hypoxia-induced renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs)-derived exosomes on acute tubular injury. We found that in vitro hypoxia-induced tubular exosomes (Hy-EXOs) were protective in acute tubular injury by promoting TECs proliferation and improving mitochondrial functions. By using exosome miRNA sequencing, we identified miR-20a-5p was abundant and was a key mechanism for the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury as up-regulation of miR-20a-5p enhanced but down-regulation of miR-20a-5p inhibited the protective effect of Hy-EXOs on tubular injury under hypoxia conditions. Further study in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion-induced acute kidney injury (IRI-AKI) also confirmed this notion as pre-treating mice with the miR-20a-5p agomir 48 h prior to AKI induction was capable of inhibiting IRI-AKI by lowering serum levels of creatinine and urea nitrogen, and attenuating the severity of tubular necrosis, F4/80(+) macrophages infiltration and vascular rarefaction. Mechanistically, the protective effect of miR-20a-5p on acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with inhibition of TECs mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, miR-20a-5p is enriched in hypoxia-derived tubular exosomes and protects against acute tubular injury. Results from the present study also reveal that miR-20a-5p may represent as a novel therapy for AKI.","Yu, Wenjuan; Zeng, Honghui; Chen, Junzhe; Fu, Sha; Huang, Qiuyan; Xu, Yanchun; Xu, Anping; Lan, Hui-Yao; Tang, Ying",Clin Sci (Lond),243,26

Here, we tested whether a specific psychological belief-identification with all humanity-predicts cooperation with public health guidelines as well as helpful behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that peoples' endorsement of this belief-their relative perception of a connection and moral commitment to other humans-would predict their tendencies to adopt World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and to help others. To assess this, we conducted a global online study (N = 2537 participants) of four WHO-recommended health behaviors and four pandemic-related moral dilemmas that we constructed to be relevant to helping others at a potential cost to oneself. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) that included 10 predictor variables (demographic, contextual, and psychological) for each of five outcome measures (a WHO cooperative health behavior score, plus responses to each of our four moral, helping dilemmas). Identification with all humanity was the most consistent and consequential predictor of individuals' cooperative health behavior and helpful responding. Analyses showed that the identification with all humanity significantly predicted each of the five outcomes while controlling for the other variables (Prange < 10-22 to < 0.009). The mean effect size of the identification with all humanity predictor on these outcomes was more than twice as large as the effect sizes of other predictors. Identification with all humanity is a psychological construct that, through targeted interventions, may help scientists and policymakers to better understand and promote cooperative health behavior and help-oriented concern for others during the current pandemic as well as in future humanitarian crises.","Barragan, Rodolfo C; Oliveira, Nigini; Khalvati, Koosha; Brooks, Rechele; Reinecke, Katharina; Rao, Rajesh P N; Meltzoff, Andrew N",PLoS One,243,24

The clinical data in other centers is limited. This study aims to explore the feasible parameters which could be used in clinical practice to predict the prognosis in hospitalized patients with severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Methods: In this case-control study, patients with severe COVID-19 in this newly established isolation center on admission between 27 January 2020 to 19 March 2020 were divided to discharge group and death event group. Clinical information was collected and analyzed for the following objectives: 1. Comparisons of basic characteristics between two groups; 2. Risk factors for death on admission using logistic regression; 3. Dynamic changes of radiographic and laboratory parameters between two groups in the course. Results: 124 patients with severe COVID-19 on admission were included and divided into discharge group (n=35) and death event group (n=89). Sex, SpO2, breath rate, diastolic pressure, neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer were significantly correlated with death events identified using bivariate logistic regression. Further multivariate logistic regression demonstrated a significant model fitting with C-index of 0.845 (p<0.001), in which SpO2&#8804;89%, lymphocyte&#8804;0.64×109/L, CRP>77.35mg/L, PCT>0.20µg/L, and LDH>481U/L were the independent risk factors with the ORs of 2.959, 4.015, 2.852, 3.554, and 3.185, respectively (p<0.04). In the course, persistently lower lymphocyte with higher levels of CRP, PCT, IL-6, neutrophil, LDH, D-dimer, cardiac troponin I (cTnI), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and increased CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocyte ratio and were observed in death events group, while these parameters stayed stable or improved in discharge group. Conclusions: On admission, the levels of SpO2, lymphocyte, CRP, PCT, and LDH could predict the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients. Systematic inflammation with induced cardiac dysfunction was likely a primary reason for death events in severe COVID-19 except for acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Pan, Feng; Yang, Lian; Li, Yuncheng; Liang, Bo; Li, Lin; Ye, Tianhe; Li, Lingli; Liu, Dehan; Gui, Shan; Hu, Yu; Zheng, Chuansheng",Int J Med Sci,243,20

While several studies evaluating the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs have been reported since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19), and several more are still underway. There is, therefore, an immediate need for an ongoing, rigorous systematic review that continuously assesses the risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection among front-line HCWs. OBJECTIVE: Here, we outline a protocol to serve as a guideline for conducting a living systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the burden of COVID-19 on front-line HCWs and identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs. METHODS: The protocol was developed and reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). The conduct of the proposed living systematic review and meta-analysis will primarily follow the principles recommended in the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) guidance for undertaking systematic reviews in healthcare, and the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. The systematic literature searches will be performed using the EBSCOhost platform by searching the following databases within the platform: Academic search complete, health source: nursing/academic edition, CINAHL with full text, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct databases, Google Scholar, and; also a search in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the World Health Organization library databases for relevant studies will be performed. The searches will include peer-reviewed articles, published in English and Mandarin language irrespective of publication year, evaluating the risk for testing positive for C0VID-19, the risk of developing symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, or both, among front-line HCWs. The initial review period will consider articles published since the onset of COVID-19 disease to the present and then updated monthly. Review Manager (RevMan 5.3) will be used to pool the odds ratios or mean differences for individual risk factors where possible. Results will be presented as relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences, or standardised mean differences along with 95% confidence intervals, for continuous outcomes. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale will be used to rate study quality, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). The results of the living systematic review and meta-analysis will be reported per the PRISMA guidelines. DISCUSSION: Though addressing the needs of front-line HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic is a high priority, data to inform such initiatives are inadequate, particularly data on the risk factor disparities between patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs. The proposed living systematic review and meta-analysis anticipate finding relevant studies reporting risk factors driving the SARS-CoV-2 infection rates among patient-facing and non-patient-facing front-line HCWs, thus providing subsidies for public health interventions and occupational health policies. The study results will be disseminated electronically, in print and through conference presentation, and key stakeholder meetings in the form of policy briefs.

With the advent of coronavirus disease 2019 as a major health event, radiation oncologists in some situations need to alter the manner in which they act with individual patients. The well-being of health care workers and society as a whole needs to be considered in management decisions. During the time of a pandemic, ethics principles may be based more on a utilitarian approach that emphasizes the common good. Thus, at times treatment decisions might result in delays in initiating therapy, modifying the radiation treatment course (such as to a short course rather than a long course of therapy), and the sequence of therapies, all to minimize viral exposure. It is important that altered therapy is based as much as possible on institutional or departmental decisions and, to the extent possible, not on a case-by-case basis.

Data from 67 patients considered for ICU admissions due to COVID-19 infection, treated between 10 March and 10 June 2020, were reviewed. Following exclusions, data on 32 patients admitted to the ICU and 21 patients ineligible for ICU admission were analyzed. RESULTS In 38% of analyzed patients, symptoms of COVID-19 infection occurred during a hospital stay for an unrelated medical issue. The mean age of ICU patients was 62.4 (10.4) years, and the majority of patients were male (69%), with at least one comorbidity (88%). The mean admission APACHE II and SAPS II scores were 20.1 (8.1) points and 51.2 (15.3) points, respectively. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and Clinical Frailty Scale were lower in ICU patients compared with those disqualified: 5.9 (4.3) vs. 9.1 (3.5) points, P=0.01, and 4.7 (1.7) vs. 6.9 (1.2) points, P<0.01, respectively. All ICU patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. ICU mortality was 67%. Hospital mortality among patients admitted to the ICU and those who were disqualified was 70% and 79%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission in our studied population were frail and had significant comorbidities. The outcomes in this group were poor and did not seem to be influenced by ICU admission.","Kokoszka-Bargiel, Izabela; Cyprys, Pawel; Rutkowska, Katarzyna; Madowicz, Jaroslaw; Knapik, Piotr",Med Sci Monit,243,1

Computed tomography (CT) is the prime imaging modality for diagnosis of lung infections in COVID-19 patients. Data-driven and Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for automatic processing of CT images predominantly rely on large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. Owing to privacy and data availability issues, open-access and publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are difficult to obtain, thus limiting the development of AI-enabled automatic diagnostic solutions. To tackle this problem, large CT image datasets encompassing diverse patterns of lung infections are in high demand. DATA DESCRIPTION: In the present study, we provide an open-source repository containing 1000+ CT images of COVID-19 lung infections established by a team of board-certified radiologists. CT images were acquired from two main general university hospitals in Mashhad, Iran from March 2020 until January 2021. COVID-19 infections were ratified with matching tests including Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and accompanying clinical symptoms. All data are 16-bit grayscale images composed of 512 × 512 pixels and are stored in DICOM standard. Patient privacy is preserved by removing all patient-specific information from image headers. Subsequently, all images corresponding to each patient are compressed and stored in RAR format.","Shakouri, Shokouh; Bakhshali, Mohammad Amin; Layegh, Parvaneh; Kiani, Behzad; Masoumi, Farid; Ataei Nakhaei, Saeedeh; Mostafavi, Sayyed Mostafa",BMC Res Notes,243,1

METHODS: Data of patients with rectal malignancies diagnosed in the Netherlands between 1989 and 2018 were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and grouped according to the RARECARE cancer list. Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated using the European Standard Rate. The Joinpoint Regression Program was used for analysing trends and joinpoints and for the estimation of annual percentage changes (APCs). Patient characteristics, treatment details and relative survival (RS) were reported for different histological types of rectal malignancies and compared between different time periods. RS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 88,299 cases of rectal malignancies were included of which 2125 (2.5%) were categorised as rare histological subtypes. The incidence of rectal neuro-endocrine tumours (NET) (APC: 6.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.4%; 7.1%), rectal sarcoma (APC: 5.8%, 95% CI: 2.9%; 8.7%) and rectal adenocarcinoma (APC 1.0%, 95% CI: 0.26%; 1.8%) increased. Prognosis was best in patients with rectal NET (5-year RS: 72.4%, 95% CI: 70.1%; 74.7%) and worst in patients with rectal melanoma (5-year RS: 8.9%, 95% CI: 5.1%; 15.7%). RS has improved in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, rectal sarcoma and rectal lymphoma in 2008-2018 (p-values p < 0.001, p = 0.023 and p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Significant increases in incidence were observed for different types of rectal malignancies.

Many of the roles that staff are being allocated to in the intensive care unit and emergency department pose additional risks to themselves, and new policies for staff reallocation are causing distress and uncertainty to the professionals concerned. In this paper, we analyse a range of ethical issues associated with changes to staff allocation processes in the face of COVID-19. In line with a dominant view in the medical ethics literature, we claim, first, that no individual health professional has a specific, positive obligation to treat a patient when doing so places that professional at risk of harm, and so there is a clear ethical tension in any reallocation process in this context. Next, we argue that the changing asymmetries of health needs in hospitals means that careful consideration needs to be given to a stepwise process for deallocating staff from their usual duties. We conclude by considering how a justifiable process of reallocating professionals to high-risk clinical roles should be configured once those who are 'fit for reallocation' have been identified. We claim that this process needs to attend to three questions that we consider in detail: (1) how the choice to make reallocation decisions is made, (2) what justifiable models for reallocation might look like and (3) what is owed to those who are reallocated.","Dunn, Michael; Sheehan, Mark; Hordern, Joshua; Turnham, Helen Lynne; Wilkinson, Dominic",J. med. ethics,243,1

A critical question is how mRNA-LNP vaccine immunogenicity compares to that of traditional adjuvanted protein vaccines in primates. Here, we show that mRNA-LNP immunization compared to protein immunization elicits either the same or superior magnitude and breadth of HIV-1 Env-specific polyfunctional antibodies. Immunization with mRNA-LNP encoding Zika premembrane and envelope or HIV-1 Env gp160 induces durable neutralizing antibodies for at least 41 weeks. Doses of mRNA-LNP as low as 5 µg are immunogenic in macaques. Thus, mRNA-LNP can be used to rapidly generate single or multi-component vaccines, such as sequential vaccines needed to protect against HIV-1 infection.

These individuals are also at the greatest risk for morbidity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 complications include cytokine storm and multiorgan failure mediated by the same factors as often produced by SnCs through their senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP can be amplified by infection-related pathogen-associated molecular profile factors. Senolytic agents, such as Fisetin, selectively eliminate SnCs and delay, prevent, or alleviate multiple disorders in aged experimental animals and animal models of human chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and respiratory diseases. Senolytics are now in clinical trials for multiple conditions linked to SnCs, including frailty; obesity/diabetes; osteoporosis; and cardiovascular, kidney, and lung diseases, which are also risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality. A clinical trial is underway to test if senolytics decrease SARS-CoV-2 progression and morbidity in hospitalized older adults.

This high mortality rate leads many providers to feel that the treatment of pTBI is futile. Contrary to this point of view, several studies have shown that victims of pTBI who present with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &#8805;6 have a reasonable chance of a meaningful outcome. This study sought to investigate outcomes of pTBI patients based on GCS score who underwent neurosurgical intervention (craniotomy or craniectomy) and compare them with patients who did not undergo surgical intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study represents a secondary analysis of the data that were collected from 2006 to 2016 from 17 institutions as part of a multi-center study, investigating clinical outcomes for adult patients sustaining pTBI and surviving >72 h. Patients were divided into those with GCS 3-5 and those with GCS &#8805;6. Within these groups, patients were stratified by whether they received surgical intervention, compared with standard non-surgical care. Patient level data (age and gender), clinical data (Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score), GCS on admission, post-op infection rates, and outcomes data (mortality, length of stay [LOS], intensive care unit LOS) were collected. Both groups were compared using independent sample t-test or chi-squared test. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty patients with pTBI were identified over 11 y, out of which 336 (46.7%) underwent surgery. The mean Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score on admission were higher in the surgical intervention group than their non-surgical counterpart in patients with a GCS &#8805;6 (P < 0.0001). Patients with GCS of 3-5 with surgical intervention demonstrated a higher survival rate than non-surgical patients (P < 0.0001). In the GCS &#8805;6 group, surgical intervention did not impact near-term mortality. Intensive care unit LOS was significantly longer in the surgical intervention group in patients with GCS &#8805; 6 (P < 0.0001) and GCS of 3-5 (P < 0.0001), as was total hospital LOS (P < 0.0001). Patients with a GCS 3-5 and &#8805;6 who underwent surgical intervention were more likely to develop a central nervous system infection (P = 0.016; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention in pTBI patients with GCS 3-5 results in improved mortality but comes at a cost of increased resource utilization in the form of longer LOS and higher infection rate. On the other hand, in patients with GCS &#8805;6, surgery does not provide significant benefits in patient survival. Future prospective studies providing insight as to the impact of surgery on the resource utilization and quality of survival would be beneficial in determining the need for surgical intervention in this population.","D039,; Agostino, Robyn; Kursinskis, Alexandra; Parikh, Priti; Letarte, Peter; Harmon, Laura; Semon, Gregory",J Surg Res,243,3

Spike (S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the nCoV2019 takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are being done and genome sequences are being deposited in various databases. From India, two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome has been deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the Spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates, one was found to harbor a mutation in its receptor-binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site, arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-ß branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor binding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.","Saha, Priyanka; Banerjee, Arup Kumar; Tripathi, Prem Prakash; Srivastava, Amit Kumar; Ray, Upasana",Biosci. rep,243,24

Using the open-access data and machine learning algorithms, this paper aims to cluster countries in groups with similar profiles with respect to the country level pre COVID-19 pandemic parameters. The purpose of performing the data analysis is to measure the extent to which these major risk factors determine the mortality rate due to the coronavirus disease 2019. An unsupervised machine learning model (k-means) was employed for two hundred and eight countries to define data-driven clusters based on thirteen country-level parameters. After performing the one-way ANOVA for comparing the clusters in terms of total cases, total deaths, total cases per population, total deaths per population, and death rate, the paradigm with four and seven clusters showed the best ability to stratify the countries according to total cases per population and death rate with p-values of less than 0.05 and 0.001, respectively.

However, as COVID-19 is highly contagious, its existence has made the tracheostomy a high-risk procedure. Tracheostomy procedures must, therefore, be adjusted for safety reasons. The aim is to present the adjustments that should be made to the surgical technique. METHODS: Both the medical charts and surgical reports of patients with COVID-19 who were subjected to elective open tracheostomies were reviewed. RESULTS: The retrospective study included 25 patients. Our adjustments include the timing of tracheostomies, ideally putting them at 21 days after the onset of COVID-19, the advancement of an endotracheal tube to 26-28 cm from the upper-alveolar ridge, surgery being carried out in the intensive care unit with appropriately modified positions of the patient and providers, tracheo-cutaneous sutures, and intentionally making the small tracheal flap and the tracheal window the same shape as a medieval shield.

The utility of chest radiography (CXR) remains an evolving topic of discussion. Current reports of CXR findings related to COVID-19 contain varied terminology as well as various assessments of its sensitivity and specificity. This can lead to a misunderstanding of CXR reports and makes comparison between examinations and research studies challenging. With this need for consistency, we propose language for standardized CXR reporting and severity assessment of persons under investigation for having COVID-19, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and patients who may have radiographic findings typical or suggestive of COVID-19 when the diagnosis is not suspected clinically. We recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection when typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia on CXR are present as an incidental finding. In addition, we summarize the currently available literature related to the use of CXR for COVID-19 and discuss the evolving techniques of obtaining CXR in COVID-19-positive patients. The recently published expert consensus statement on reporting chest computed tomography findings related to COVID-19, endorsed by the Radiological Society of North American (RSNA), the Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR), and American College of Radiology (ACR), serves as the framework for our proposal.","Litmanovich, Diana E; Chung, Michael; R Kirkbride, Rachael; Kicska, Gregory; P Kanne, Jeffrey",J. thorac imaging,243,20

The degree of development achieved by farms will largely depend on their ability to accumulate income and their way of spending. The aim of the article is to determine the savings-generating potential of small farms in Poland and the impact of savings on their sustainable development. In this article, firstly, the literature on savings in small farms and their role in sustainable development is synthesized. Secondly, presents empirical research that was conducted considering the economic and social characteristics of 1485 small farms to help understand saving behaviors in the chosen context. The research material consisted of data on entities participating in the Polish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) in 2017. The factors influencing the generation of savings were identified using the logit regression model. The results of the research indicate great diversity in the scale of savings generated by small farms in Poland. Moreover, the study showed that 4 out of 21 variables characterizing small farms were significant, with a good fit of the model as evidenced by the model quality assessment measures used (coefficient R2count and ROC curve). It was found that two variables, namely area of farmland and gross value added, each had a statistically significant positive influence on the probability of generating higher savings by small farms in Poland. On the other hand, the possession of liabilities and gross investment each had a statistically significant negative influence on the accumulation of higher savings. The research reveals some limitations that may hinder the mobilization of savings by small farms and thus affect their sustainable development. Therefore, as recommendations, we present measures that can increase savings by small farms in Poland.","Wieliczko, Barbara Kurdyś-Kujawska Agnieszka Sompolska-Rzechuła Agnieszka",Agriculture,243,1

India had implemented steps such as lockdown and advised social distancing, washing of hands, and wearing masks to reduce the burden of Covid-19. This review discusses the epidemiological features, the population at risk and control strategies of novel coronavirus disease in India. The data was collected from various sources on individual details of Covid-19 cases, population density and affluence percentage from the literature studied. The data was used to analyse the susceptibility of the population to this disease. It was found that Indian males, age group 20 to 40 (based on morbidity) and above 60 (based on mortality) were at high risk. The authors compiled epidemiology, management and control strategies of covid-19 in India. Therefore, because of various early implementations, India has managed the disease well earlier, but in the current scenario (30 Nov 2020) morbidity and mortality have been at peak. Immunization of frontline workers started on 16th January 2021. Initially, 7,017,411 doses of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines have been given by 10th February 2021.

Traditional U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture and its variants suffer from diminutions of contextual information in pooling/upsampling operations with increased semantic gaps among encoded and decoded feature maps as well as instigate vanishing gradient problems for its sequential gradient propagation that result in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, operating with 3D CT-volume poses further limitations due to the exponential increase of computational complexity making the optimization difficult. In this paper, an automated COVID-19 lesion segmentation scheme is proposed utilizing a highly efficient neural network architecture, namely CovSegNet, to overcome these limitations. Additionally, a two-phase training scheme is introduced where a deeper 2D-network is employed for generating ROI-enhanced CT-volume followed by a shallower 3D-network for further enhancement with more contextual information without increasing computational burden. Along with the traditional vertical expansion of Unet, we have introduced horizontal expansion with multi-stage encoder-decoder modules for achieving optimum performance. Additionally, multi-scale feature maps are integrated into the scale transition process to overcome the loss of contextual information. Moreover, a multi-scale fusion module is introduced with a pyramid fusion scheme to reduce the semantic gaps between subsequent encoder/decoder modules while facilitating the parallel optimization for efficient gradient propagation. Outstanding performances have been achieved in three publicly available datasets that largely outperform other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed scheme can be easily extended for achieving optimum segmentation performances in a wide variety of applications.","Mahmud, Tanvir; Rahman, Md Awsafur; Fattah, Shaikh Anowarul; Kung, Sun-Yuan",,243,4

To assess robustness of mRNA vaccine-induced immunity, we compared antibody durability and breadth after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. While vaccination delivered robust initial virus-specific antibodies with some cross-variant coverage, pre-variant SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced antibodies, while modest in magnitude, showed highly stable long-term antibody dynamics. Vaccination after infection induced maximal antibody magnitudes with enhanced longitudinal stability while infection-naive vaccinee antibodies fell with time to post-infection-alone levels. The composition of antibody neutralizing activity to variant relative to original virus also differed between groups, with infection-induced antibodies demonstrating greater relative breadth. Differential antibody durability trajectories favored COVID-19-recovered subjects with dual memory B cell features of greater early antibody somatic mutation and cross-coronavirus reactivity. By illuminating an infection-mediated antibody breadth advantage and an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody durability-enhancing function conferred by recalled immunity, these findings may serve as guides for ongoing vaccine strategy improvement.","Xiao, Tianshu; Cai, Yongfei; Chen, Bing",,243,24

Therefore, becoming ICT compliant is no more an option to stay relevant and alive during this COVID era. This data article presents the outcome of a survey carried out among Moroccan nursing students. This was done with a view to assess their readiness and willingness to accept and use ICT as well as social media for learning and discharging their duties during and after this COVID era. Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was adopted to structure the questionnaire items used in this survey. This was then administered to Moroccan nursing students via online Google forms. Seven hundred and two (702) respondents completed the questionnaire.

In addition to recession and high unemployment, agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that stressors associated with a pandemic can cause increased strains, including difficulty concentrating, anxiety, and decreased mental health (CDC, 2020). Two general frameworks that explain these stressor-strain relationships over time include stress-reaction and adaptation models. Stress-reaction models suggest that stressors, such as heightened job demands due to the pandemic, accumulate over time and thus prolonged exposure to these stressors results in both immediate and long-term strain; conversely, adaptation models suggest that people adapt to stressors over time, such that strains produced by ongoing stressors tend to dissipate. After controlling for county-level COVID-19 cases, we found that (a) workers in general exhibited decreasing cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms over time, providing support for the adaptation model; (b) on-site workers experienced increasing physical fatigue over time, supporting the stress-reaction model among those workers; and (c) engaging in recovery behaviors was associated with improvements in cognitive weariness and psychological symptoms for all workers. We also found that our Time 1 outcomes were significantly different than pre-pandemic norms, such that our participants displayed lower initial levels of job-related burnout and higher initial levels of psychological symptoms than pre-pandemic norms. Furthermore, supplemental qualitative data support our quantitative findings for recovery behaviors. These findings have important implications for understanding workers' responses to the pandemic and they can help inform organizational practice.","Michel, Jesse S; Rotch, Michael A; Carson, Jack E; Bowling, Nathan A; Shifrin, Nicole V",Occup Health Sci,243,17

However, that is not the only charge that propels contributions -- growing interest in open source has also been attributed to software developers deciding to use their technical skills to benefit a common societal good. To understand how developers identify these projects, their motivations for contributing, and challenges they face, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with OSS for Social Good (OSS4SG) contributors. From our interview analysis, we identified themes of contribution styles that we wanted to understand at scale by deploying a survey to over 5765 OSS and Open Source Software for Social Good contributors. From our quantitative analysis of 517 responses, we find that the majority of contributors demonstrate a distinction between OSS4SG and OSS. Likewise, contributors described definitions based on what societal issue the project was to mitigate and who the outcomes of the project were going to benefit. In addition, we find that OSS4SG contributors focus less on benefiting themselves by padding their resume with new technology skills and are more interested in leaving their mark on society at statistically significant levels. We also find that OSS4SG contributors evaluate the owners of the project significantly more than OSS contributors. These findings inform implications to help contributors identify high societal impact projects, help project maintainers reduce barriers to entry, and help organizations understand why contributors are drawn to these projects to sustain active participation.","Huang, Yu; Ford, Denae; Zimmermann, Thomas",,243,16

This study aimed to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) can assist identification of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 23 and November 12, 2020, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (oxygen demand &#8805;4 L/min) were included consecutively. Lung ultrasound was performed daily until invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV-group) or spontaneous recovery (non-IMV-group). Clinical parameters and lung ultrasound findings were compared between groups, at intubation (IMV-group) and highest oxygen demand (non-IMV-group). A reference group with oxygen demand <4 L/min was examined at hospital admission. RESULTS: Altogether 72 patients were included: 50 study patients (IMV-group, n = 23; non-IMV-group, n = 27) and 22 reference patients. LUS-score correlated to oxygen demand (SpO2 /FiO2 -ratio) (r = 0.728; p < 0.0001) and was higher in the IMV-group compared to the non-IMV-group (20.0 versus 18.0; p = 0.026). Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, a LUS-score of 19.5 was identified as cut-off for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (area under the curve 0.68; sensitivity 56%, specificity 74%). In 6 patients, LUS identified critical coexisting conditions. Respiratory rate and oxygenation index ((SpO2 /FiO2 )/respiratory rate) &#8805;4.88 identified no requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation with a positive predictive value of 87% and negative predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: LUS-score had only a moderate diagnostic value for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19.

Twelve healthy young male participants underwent four 90-min trials comprising 70 min walking and 20 min resting periods. Cooling strategies adopted in this work were CON (control), PCM-control (PCMs were removed at the end of exercise), Fan-control (fans were switched OFF during the initial 20 min) and PCM&Fan-control (fans were turned ON after 20 min exercising and PCMs were removed after the 70-min exercise). Results demonstrated that the control of electric fans could suppress the mean skin temperature rise to 34.0 °C by over 15 min and also cut down the energy consumption of the HPCS from 15.6 W h to 12.1 W h over the entire 90-min trials. Thus, it is recommended that fans should be turned off at the beginning of hot exposure and switched on once participants felt warm. Our findings also showed that the removal of fully melted PCM packs from the HPCS could enhance the evaporative cooling effect brought about by air circulation. The removal of melted PCMs significantly reduced the physical load by 37.3% and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were decreased by 3.5-4.2 RPE units. This could also help quickly restore the PCM energy for future usage. In summary, cooling strategies demonstrated in this work could improve HPCS's overall cooling performance on workers while working in the studied hot environment.","Wang, Faming; Ke, Ying; Yang, Bin; Xu, Pengjun; Noor, Nuruzzaman",J Therm Biol,243,16

Inflammatory changes are part of COVID-19 pathophysiology and this might generate a higher thromboembolic risk in patients using combined hormonal contraception and menopausal hormone therapy. We aimed to discuss the main aspects related to this issue and propose management strategies for women affected by COVID-19. METHODS: This narrative review collected information from several articles published since the beginning of the outbreak of the new coronavirus disease about the pathophysiology, stage of the disease, the occurrence of thrombotic events, and the risk of thromboembolism in users of contraception and hormonal therapy. RESULTS: This article consolidates clinical parameters about the risk of venous thromboembolism in users of contraception and menopausal hormone therapy emphasizing the probable increase of that risk in women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and bringing safer recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: In this scenario, apart from the fundamental orientations of preventive measures, like social isolation and hygiene, it is important that all female health professionals have knowledge of the new rules and adopt safety measures, especially on the prescription of hormonal therapy and contraception.","Pires, Andréa Larissa Ribeiro; Batista, José Gomes; Aldrighi, José Mendes; Massaia, Irineu Francisco Delfino Silva; Delgado, Diego Medeiros; Ferreira-Filho, Edson Santos; Soares-Junior, José Maria",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),243,27

We had previously postulated that acetaminophen exposure early in life, if combined with antioxidants that prevent accumulation of NAPQI, the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen, might be innocuous. In this study, we administered acetaminophen at or below the currently recommended therapeutic dose to male laboratory rat pups aged 4-10 days. The antioxidants cysteine and mannitol were included to prevent accumulation of NAPQI. In addition, animals were exposed to a cassette of common stress factors: an inflammatory diet, psychological stress, antibiotics, and mock infections using killed bacteria. At age 37-49 days, observation during introduction to a novel conspecific revealed increased rearing behavior, an asocial activity, in animals treated with acetaminophen plus antioxidants, regardless of their exposure to oxidative stress factors (2-way ANOVA; P < 0.0001). This observation would suggest that the initial hypothesis is incorrect, and that oxidative stress mediators do not entirely eliminate the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment. This study provides additional cause for caution when considering the use of acetaminophen in the pediatric population, and provides evidence that the effects of acetaminophen on neurodevelopment need to be considered both in the presence and in the absence of oxidative stress.","Suda, Navneet; Cendejas Hernandez, Jasmine; Poulton, John; Jones, John P; Konsoula, Zacharoula; Smith, Caroline; Parker, William",PLoS One,243,21

OBJECTIVES: Examine BMI and CRF change during school and summer for year-round and traditional calendar school children. METHODS: Three schools (N = 2279, 1 year-round) participated in this natural experiment. Children's BMI z-score (zBMI) and CRF (PACER laps) were measured from 2017 to 2019 each May/August. Mixed effects regression estimated monthly zBMI and CRF change during school/summer. Secondary analyses examined differences by weight status and race. Spline regression models estimated zBMI and CRF growth from kindergarten-sixth grade. RESULTS: Compared to traditional school, children attending a year-round school gained more zBMI (difference = 0.015; 95CI = 0.002, 0.028) during school, and less zBMI (difference = -0.029; 95CI = -0.041, -0.018), and more CRF (difference = 0.834; 95CI = 0.575, 1.093) monthly during summer. Differences by weight status and race were observed during summer and school. Growth models demonstrated that the magnitude of overall zBMI and CRF change from kindergarten-sixth grade was similar for year-round or traditional school children. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to traditional school children zBMI increased during the traditional 9-month school calendar and zBMI decreased during the traditional summer vacation for year-round school children. Structured summer programming may mitigate accelerated summer BMI gain and CRF loss especially for overweight or obese, and/or Black children.","Weaver, Robert Glenn; Hunt, Ethan; Armstrong, Bridget; Beets, Michael W; Brazendale, Keith; Turner-McGrievy, Gabrielle; Pate, Russell R; Maydeu-Olivares, Alberto; Saelens, Brian; Youngstedt, Shawn D; Dugger, Roddrick; Parker, Hannah; von Klinggraeff, Lauren; Jones, Alexis; Burkhart, Sarah; Ressor-Oyer, Layton",Pediatr Obes,243,20

The available evidence is uncertain, and knowledge on the subject is evolving. The aim of our cohort study was to evaluate the association between corticosteroid therapy and hospital mortality, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 after balancing for possible confounders. One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids. In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p < 0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had a reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p < 0.001). Treatment with corticosteroids did not affect hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 after balancing for confounders.

METHODS: CIF (250 single-room bungalows in a holiday camp) was opened on July 24, 2020 to receive step-down patients from hospitals, while CTF (500-bed of open-cubicle inside a conventional hall) was activated on August 1, 2020 to admit newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients from the community. Healthcare workers (HCWs) and cleaning staff received infection control training to reinforce donning and doffing of personal protective equipment and understand the practice of DOED, where the cleaning staff observed patients' and staff activities and then performed environmental disinfection immediately after their use. Supervisors also observed cleaning staff to ensure the quality of work. In CTF, air and environmental samples were collected on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, while patients' compliance of wearing mask was recorded.

Clinical variables and some laboratory parameters were studied. The Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices were calculated. The dependent variables were mortality and admission to the ICU. A descriptive and correlational analysis was performed. Logistic regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were established. RESULTS: Positive correlations were observed between age, creatinine, and D-dimer levels, as well as with the scores obtained with the Charlson and Elixhauser indices. Differences in the levels of these parameters were also observed when analyzing variables such as mortality, sex or admission to the ICU. Mortality was associated with high creatinine and D-dimer levels and advanced age. Survival curves indicated longer survival in patients not admitted to the ICU, admitted to the hospital during the week, and in those with lower creatinine and D-dimer levels.

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is recognized as a key mediator of hyperinflammation previously mentioned in cytokine release syndrome. This leads to implementing IL-6 pathway inhibition in severe COVID-19. This review aimed to explore the clinical evidences of using IL-6 antagonists in COVID-19 infection based on most recent available data. Relevant studies were searched through PubMed, scopus, and ISI databases focusing on interleukin-6 antagonists in cytokine release syndrome and prospective data on COVID-19 infection. Only papers in English were included in the search. There were several studies conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of IL-6 antagonists and mostly with tocilizumab. After the search, we found that studies recruited patients with severe COVID-19 and elevated inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, or ferritin to receive tocilizumab, situximab or sarilumab in combination with other medications. Result showed that these agents may provide a clinical advantage as patients were able to refrain from invasive ventilation support after initiating IL-6 antagonists. In summary, IL-6 pathway inhibition in severe COVID-19 may be an emerging candidate to subside pulmonary complication. These agents may carry benefits in COVID-19 infection as well as safety risks such as bone marrow suppression. Current pharmacists' role is to provide most recent update information as well as intensive monitoring plan in patients who receive IL-6 inhibitor.

A significant number of patients require admission to intensive care unit (ICU) services due to severe respiratory, thrombotic and septic complications and require long-term hospitalization. Neuromuscular weakness is a common complication in critically ill patients who are treated in ICUs and are mechanically ventilated. This complication is frequently caused by critical illness myopathy (CIM) or critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and leads to difficulty in weaning from the ventilator. It is thought to represent an important neurologic manifestation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). COVID-19 infection is known to trigger strong immune dysregulation, with an intense cytokine storm, as a result, the frequency of CIP is expected to be higher in this setting. The mainstay in the diagnosis of this entity beside the high level of clinical awareness is the electrophysiological examination that provides evidence of axonal motor and sensory polyneuropathy. The present article presents the case of a 54-year-old woman with severe COVID 19 infection who developed neuromuscular weakness, which turned out to be secondary to CIP and was treated successfully with a high dose of human intravenous immunoglobulins. Related to this case, we reviewed the relevant literature data regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology and clinical features of this important complication and discussed also the treatment options and prognosis.

Recent studies have highlighted the additional critical role of TCF1 in peripheral T cell responses to acute and chronic infections as well as cancer. Here, we review the regulatory functions of TCF1 in the differentiation of T follicular helper cells, memory T cells and recently described stem-like exhausted T cells, where TCF1 promotes less differentiated stem-like cell states by controlling common gene-regulatory networks. These studies also provide insights into the mechanisms of defective T cell responses in older individuals. We discuss alterations in TCF1 expression and related regulatory networks with age and their consequences for T cell responses to infections and vaccination. The increasing understanding of the pathways regulating TCF1 expression and function in aged T cells holds the promise of enabling the design of therapeutic interventions aiming at improving T cell responses in older individuals.","Kim, Chulwoo; Jin, Jun; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jörg J",Int. j. mol. sci.

In this piece of work, the authors consider the effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic event on the global equity market, commodities and FX market, measured in terms of the investors' fear index. Design/methodology/approach: In this empirical work, the authors employ time series-based regression models followed by augmented dummy regressions and growth of the COVID-19. Findings: COVID-19-induced investors' fear appears to be higher in the equity segment for the first time since the market crash of 1987 and the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. Furthermore, this disease outbreak shock has been more pronounced in terms of crude oil prices. Besides, a market participant in the commodity and FX market has paid a disproportionate premium to protect such pandemic development. Findings show that Options act as the best hedge against an uncertainty like COVID-19 and that option-based implied volatility is the best measure of investors' fear and market volatility. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for the financial markets, e.g. (1) Contagious disease outbreak news matters for the equity, commodity, and foreign exchange markets – empirical outcome validates the theory of market efficiency valid for the Options. (2) Option's implied volatility is the best indicator of investor fear measured for the unprecedented economic news. Further implication holds for the policymakers and society, e.g. (1) The unavailability of short-selling could be one plausible reason for increased uncertainty and volatility;hence, policymakers should look upon this issue at the exchange level. (2) Any market needs multiple lines of risk management, effective price discovery and attractive liquidity. Originality/value: The study is novel in terms of presenting market behavior amid COVID-19 across global equity markets and commodities and FX markets. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Shaikh, I.; Huynh, T.

The result showed that Quality of life is significantly decreased over time, meanwhile perceived stress level is raised significantly, and an increased level of difficulty in emotion regulation has happened. Almost everyone faced with increased perceived stress and current quarantine experience were significant predictors of perceived stress escalation. Younger people and individuals who had a worsening quality of life response tended to show more stress and emotion regulation problems.

A variety of non-pharmacological strategies to mitigate and suppress virus transmission have been investigated and introduced. Currently, emerging studies focus mostly on the management of hospital-treated patients in the acute phase of the disease, including the legitimacy of using physiotherapeutic procedures. However, current literature lacks guidelines for rehabilitation related to maintaining continuity and universality of the therapy after the end of the acute phase of the disease and discharge from hospital. The authors suggest implementing an immediate rehabilitation program in post-infection patients as data from previous epidemics of respiratory-related viral diseases shows that COVID-19 survivors should be expected to have impaired lung ventilation function, and reduced exercise tolerance and muscular weakness, and prolonged return to work and participation. It should be assumed that only the introduction of immediate recommendations for the implementation of rehabilitation procedures based on simple and well-known tests, as well as their obligatory regime, can contribute to the reduction of respiratory disability leading, in a short time, to infections recurrence and, in the long run, to a lower quality of life and socioeconomic burden on the population.

The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of quarantine on the self-perceived preparedness of dental graduates and to explore the efficacy of online education from students' perspectives. METHODS: The questionnaire distributed to dental students comprised of two main sections. The first part covered the online education experience, and the second part measured the level of self-perceived preparedness for a range of cognitive, communication and professional skills. RESULTS: The survey yielded a response rate of 72%. The majority of students (77%) agreed that they missed educational experiences as a result of the lockdown. More than half of them felt less motivated to follow-up with distant e-learning and believed that online assessment is not a good method for evaluation. A high percentage of the students (66%) thought that online group discussions had a positive value while 67% preferred online lectures compared to theatre lectures. Majority of students particularly 5th year (78.7%) (p < 0.001) stated that the quarantine increased their collaboration with their colleagues. According to 87% of students, the experience most negatively affected was their clinical training. In general, students showed satisfactory self-perceived preparedness related to a range of attributes and professional skills. CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that students partially appreciated the online system, whereas they did not consider it a substitute for face to face clinical practice. The overall self-perceived preparedness level was promising; however students had reservations regarding independent practice following graduation.","Hattar, Susan; AlHadidi, Abeer; Sawair, Faleh A; Alraheam, Islam Abd; El-Ma039,; aita, Ahmad; Wahab, Fouad Kadim",BMC Med Educ,243,26

OBJECTIVES: To measure changes in patients' utilization of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain and related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A pre-post study was conducted within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using data in the 3 months before and 3-6 months after the declaration of a national emergency related to COVID-19. Participants 21-79 years old with chronic low back pain were included in the study and provided self reported data at relevant quarterly encounters. Use of exercise therapy, yoga, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and opioids for low back pain was measured. The primary outcomes were low back pain intensity and back related functioning measured with a numerical rating scale and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life scales measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, including scales for physical function, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles and activities, and pain interference with activities. RESULTS: A total of 476 participants were included in this study. The mean age of participants at baseline was 54.0 years (standard deviation, ±13.2 years; range, 22-81 years). There were 349 (73.3%) female participants and 127 (26.7%) male participants in the study. Utilization of exercise therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.57), massage therapy (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83), and spinal manipulation (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93) decreased during the pandemic. A reduction in NSAID use was also observed (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99). Participants reported a significant, but not clinically relevant, improvement in low back pain intensity during the pandemic (mean improvement, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; Cohen's d, 0.11). However, White participants reported a significant improvement in low back pain intensity (mean improvement, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.46), whereas Black participants did not (mean improvement, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.19; p for interaction=0.03). Overall, there was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain interference with activities (mean improvement, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.20-2.02; Cohen's d, 0.20). The use of NSAIDs during the pandemic was associated with marginal increases in low back pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, decreased utilization of treatments for chronic low back pain did not adversely impact pain and functioning outcomes during the first 6 months of the pandemic. However, Black participants experienced significantly worse pain outcomes than their White counterparts.","Licciardone, John C",J Osteopath Med,243,5

In April 2020, at the Tor Vergata University in Rome, Italy, two patients on the waiting list for kidney transplantation (KT) declined a deceased donor's kidney offer. Therefore, between April 20 and 25, 2020, we conducted a telephone survey among our 247 KT waitlist patients. Our aim was to explore: (a) the COVID-19 diffusion among them and (b) their current willingness to be transplanted in case of a kidney offer from a deceased donor. Two hundred and forty-three patients participated in a phone interview. One patient had died from COVID-19. Eighty-five (35%) KT candidates would decline any kidney offer, in most cases until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Furthermore, through a scoping analysis of the literature on COVID-19, we identify the main safety-related dimensions that these studies have thus far addressed. Our findings show that across various research domains, and apart from the medical and clinical aspects such as the safety of vaccines and treatments, issues related to patient transport safety, occupational safety of healthcare professionals, biosafety of laboratories and facilities, social safety, food safety, and particularly mental/psychological health and domestic safety have thus far attracted most attention of the scientific community in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis also uncovers various potentially significant safety problems caused by this global health emergency which currently have attracted only limited scientific focus but may warrant more attention. These include matters such as cyber safety, economic safety, and supply-chain safety. These findings highlight why, from an academic research perspective, a holistic interdisciplinary approach and a collective scientific effort is required to help understand and mitigate the various safety impacts of this crisis whose implications reach far beyond the bio-medical risks.

Border and non-essential service closures may have placed PWUD at an increased risk of experiencing unintended consequences regarding drug consumption and supply patterns, as well as related outcomes. However, the extent of these effects upon this population is unknown. The current study examined how COVID-19 has impacted substance use supply and use characteristics among a national cohort of PWUD in Canada. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured one-on-one telephone-based interviews with 200 adult PWUD across Canada who were currently using a licit or illicit psychoactive substance at least weekly, and/or currently receiving opioid agonist treatment (OAT). Thematic analyses were conducted using qualitative software. RESULTS: PWUD attributed adverse changes to their substance use frequency, supply, use patterns, and risk behaviors and outcomes to COVID-19. Many participants noted supply disruptions with the majority indicating a decrease in potency and availability, and an increase in the price of substances since COVID-19. Nearly half of participants specified that they had increased their substance use, with some experiencing relapses. In terms of changes to risk level, many participants perceived they were at a greater risk for experiencing an overdose. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the impacts of COVID-19 on PWUD, including a significant disruption substance supply. For many, these changes led to increased use and substitution for toxic and adulterated substances, which ultimately amplified PWUD's risk for experiencing related harms, including overdoses. These findings warrant the need for improved supports and services, as well as accessibility of safe supply programs, take home naloxone kits, and novel approaches to ensure PWUD have the tools necessary to mitigate risk when using substances.","Ali, Farihah; Russell, Cayley; Nafeh, Frishta; Rehm, Jürgen; LeBlanc, Sean; Elton-Marshall, Tara",Int J Drug Policy,243,32

Once a model has been calibrated, it can be used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators of model parameters for such predictions. However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from them will vary widely, depending on the particular values employed within the range that gives a good fit. When data are poor or incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given an epidemiological model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemic curves, whose information is encapsulated in posterior predictive distributions. From these, one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this approach to the evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological curve has flattened.","Mena, Ramsés H; Velasco-Hernandez, Jorge X; Mantilla-Beniers, Natalia B; Carranco-Sapiéns, Gabriel A; Benet, Luis; Boyer, Denis; Castillo, Isaac Pérez",Phys Biol,243,16

Secondary objectives were to determine if there was a change in infection and complication profile with changes introduced in practice. METHODS: This UK-based multicentre retrospective national audit studied foot and ankle patients who underwent surgery between 13 January and 31 July 2020, examining time periods pre-UK national lockdown, during lockdown (23 March to 11 May 2020), and post-lockdown. All adult patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery in an operating theatre during the study period were included. A total of 43 centres in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland participated. Variables recorded included demographic data, surgical data, comorbidity data, COVID-19 and mortality rates, complications, and infection rates. RESULTS: A total of 6,644 patients were included. Of the operated patients, 0.52% (n = 35) contracted COVID-19. The overall all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 0.41%, however in patients who contracted COVID-19, the mortality rate was 25.71% (n = 9); this was significantly higher for patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery (75%, n = 3 deaths). Matching for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and comorbidities, the odds ratio of mortality with COVID-19 infection was 11.71 (95% confidence interval 1.55 to 88.74; p = 0.017). There were no differences in surgical complications or infection rates prior to or after lockdown, and among patients with and without COVID-19 infection. After lockdown the COVID-19 infection rate was 0.15% and no patient died of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection was rare in foot and ankle patients even at the peak of lockdown. However, there was a significant mortality rate in those who contracted COVID-19. Overall surgical complications and postoperative infection rates remained unchanged during the period of this audit.

In the present study we investigated in silico the basic mechanism of ACE2 in the lung and provided evidences for new potentially effective drugs for Covid-19. Specifically, we used the gene expression profiles from public datasets including The Cancer Genome Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Genotype-Tissue Expression, Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to investigate the main functions of ACE2-correlated genes.

Finally, we focused on the genes in the network that are already associated with known drugs and evaluated their role for a potential treatment of Covid-19. Our results demonstrate that the genes correlated with ACE2 are mainly enriched in the sterol biosynthetic process, Aryldialkylphosphatase activity, adenosylhomocysteinase activity, trialkylsulfonium hydrolase activity, acetate-CoA and CoA ligase activity.

We aim to review the current evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of head and neck cancer, with an emphasis on the role of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) during a pandemic. DATA SOURCES: COVID-19 resources from PubMed, Google Scholar, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and the American Head and Neck Society were examined. REVIEW METHODS: Studies and guidelines related to the multidisciplinary management of head and neck cancer in the COVID-19 setting were reviewed. A total of 54 studies were included. Given the continuously evolving body of literature, the sources cited include the latest statements from medical and dental societies. RESULTS: The unpredictable fluctuation of hospital resources and the risk of the nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 have direct effects on head and neck cancer management. Using an MDT approach to help define ""essential surgery"" for immediately life- or function-threatening disease processes in the context of available hospital resources will help to maximize outcomes. Early enrollment in an MDT is often critical for considering nonsurgical options to protect patients and health care workers. The role of the MDT continues after cancer treatment, if delivered, and the MDT plays an essential role in surveillance and survivorship programs in these challenging times. CONCLUSION: Head and neck cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique challenge for all specialists involved. Early MDT involvement is important to maximize patient outcomes and satisfaction in the context of public and community safety.","Han, Albert Y; Miller, Jessa E; Long, Jennifer L; St John, Maie A",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,243,1

However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has forced many courses to adopt online modes of delivery, and anatomy is no exception. The question now is whether anatomy education has successfully made the transition to the digital space, particularly with respect to the perception of learners. Objective The current study seeks to understand how students view an online, introductory anatomy and physiology course. Traditional methods of course evaluation include Likert scales and open-ended responses;however, such methods fail to consider both the diversity of learners and the need for course-specific feedback. Thus, we used the emerging area of Q methodology as a tool for course evaluation. Hypothesis We hypothesize that Q methodology will enable us to uncover student opinions which are specifically relevant to their online course experience. Methods Q methodology can be used to identify groups of learners with shared perceptions, allowing educators to better understand and respond to the needs of students. Studies consist of three phases: survey instrument development, data collection, and analysis/interpretation. First, a list of opinion-based statements regarding anatomy education are selected. Next, students rank statements based on their level of agreement. Finally, rankings undergo a by-person factor analysis to categorize students into distinct groups with shared perceptions. Results Data was collected from 106 students at McMaster University. Factor analysis revealed three distinct subgroups within the cohort. Group 1 (n = 45) felt they needed more time on their evaluations and lectures did not cover an appropriate amount of content. Group 2 (n = 30) did not enjoy synchronous tutorials or labs. Group 3 (n = 21) overall was satisfied with course delivery. Certain perceptions were also shared among all three groups. There was a consensus among students that they generally disliked online learning compared to in-person learning, with particular concern surrounding the use of virtual specimens and bellringer exams. Students, however, appreciated the availability of asynchronous lectures as a mode of online content delivery. Age, sex, program, education history, and anticipated grade were not associated with cohort subgroupings. Conclusion Interestingly, results of this study recognize similar course strengths/limitations noted in in-person classes (e.g., value of in-person laboratories and assessment concerns reported elsewhere), but also highlight key areas of strength (asynchronous lectures) and limitation (use of digital resources) specific to the online environment, which will be important considerations for future online offerings. Next steps for the current study include repeating the evaluation in the winter semester to see if opinions are stable across groups of learners and individual students.","Saini, Jessica Brewer-Deluce Danielle Akhtar-Danesh Noori Saraco Anthony Bayer Ilana Pitt Courtney Wainman Bruce",The FASEB Journal,243,20

In this paper, we evaluate the transformations that occurred in the daily nutritional choices and behaviors of a convenience sample (n = 2288) of Italian residents during the first nation-wide lockdown (March–May 2020) to assess the impact on the health and socio-environmental sustainability of their diets. Results portray a scenario of wide-spread change, especially in relation to the quantity of daily food consumed, the composition of diets and the time and commitment devoted to home-cooking, with young individuals emerging as the most impacted generational cohort. Through the construction of an indicator for healthy–sustainable transition (HST index), we demonstrate that such changes unfold on a gradient, revealing that while for many respondents lockdown nutrition implied overeating and weight gain, a substantial segment of the population conversely improved the healthiness and sustainability of their daily nutritional patterns. In this sense, improvements are associated with young age, socio-economic status, frequency and enjoyment of cooking-from-scratch and, more generally, an attentive attitude towards the quality, provenance and materiality of food that, in turn, the COVID-19 crisis appears to have re-kindled. We conclude by highlighting five areas of institutional intervention (i.e., young people, time, tools, food supply at work, and local food chains) on which to focus in order to ensure the current crisis does not represent a missed opportunity for creating the necessary conditions for sustainable food production and consumption to take hold as the ‘new’ normal in the post-pandemic era.","Matacena, Raffaele Zenga Mariangela D’Addario Marco Mari Silvia Labra Massimo",Sustainability,243,21

The objective was to assess the depressive and anxiety symptoms during lockdown in hemodialysis patients and their caregivers. METHODS: We sent, during lockdown period, between April and May 2020, self-questionnaires to voluntary subjects (patients and caregivers), treated by hemodialysis or who worked in hemodialysis in one of the 14 participating centers in France. We analyzed their perception of dialysis sessions (beneficial or worrying), their stress level (VAS rated from 0 to 10), their anxiety and depressive symptoms (Hospital anxiety and depression scale). Factors associated with stress, anxiety and depression were analyzed with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: 669 patients and 325 caregivers agreed to participate. 70 % of participants found it beneficial to come to dialysis during confinement. The proportions of subjects with a stress level &#8805; 6 linked to the epidemic, confinement, fear of contracting COVID-19 and fear of infecting a loved one were respectively 23.9%, 26.2%, 33.4% and 42%. 39.2% presented with certain (13.7%) or doubtful (19.2%) anxious symptoms. 21.2% presented a certain (7.9%) or doubtful (13.3%) depressive symptomatology. Age, gender, history of psychological disorders and perception of dialysis sessions were associated with levels of stress, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: During the lockdown period, in France, the majority of hemodialysis patients and caregivers found it beneficial to come to dialysis. One in three subjects had anxiety symptoms and one in five subjects had depressive symptoms.","Guerraoui, Abdallah; Idier, Laetitia; Hallonet, Patrick; Dolley-Hitze, Thibault; Gosselin, Morgane; Duneau, Gabrielle; Vendrely, Benoît; Hirigoyen, Marie-Dorothée; Azzouz, Lynda; Bouillier, Marc; Pelletier, Solenne; Fouque, Denis; Fessi, Hafedh; De-Precigout, Valérie; Vigneau, Cécile; Kolko, Anne; Pinçon, Émilie; Duquennoy, Simon; Delezire, Arnaud; Chantrel, François; Combe, Christian; Chauveau, Philippe; Caillette-Beaudoin, Agnès; Lasseur, Catherine; Prézelin-Reydit, Mathilde",Nephrol. ther,243,20

While COVID-19 patients consistently generate a T lymphocyte response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, evidence of significant immune dysregulation in these patients continues to accumulate. In this study, next generation sequencing of the T cell receptor beta chain (TRB) repertoire was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients to determine if immunogenetic differences of the TRB repertoire contribute to disease course severity. Clustering of highly similar TRB CDR3 amino acid sequences across COVID-19 patients yielded 781 shared TRB sequences. The TRB sequences were then filtered for known associations with common diseases such as EBV and CMV. The remaining sequences were cross-referenced to a publicly accessible dataset that mapped COVID-19 specific TCRs to the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We identified 158 SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences belonging to 134 clusters in our COVID-19 patients. Next, we investigated 113 SARS-CoV-2 specific clusters binding only one peptide target in relation to disease course. Distinct skewing of SARS-CoV-2 specific TRB sequences toward the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) encoded within ORF1a/b of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was observed in clusters associated with critical disease course when compared to COVID-19 clusters associated with a severe disease course. These data imply that T-lymphocyte reactivity towards peptides from NSPs of SARS-CoV-2 may not constitute an effective adaptive immune response and thus may negatively affect disease severity.","Assmann, Jorn L J C; Kolijn, P Martijn; Schrijver, Benjamin; van Gammeren, Adriaan J; Loth, Daan W; Ermens, Ton A A M; Dik, Willem A; van der Velden, Vincent H J; Langerak, Anton W",J. leukoc. biol,243,16

During this time, a perceived decrease in hospital presentations nationwide was noted. This was also the experience of the Department of General Surgery, Bay of Plenty District Health Board (BOPDHB). We sought to quantify this reduction by analysing the frequency and severity of three common acute general surgical presentations; appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis. METHODS: Data on presentations of patients with appendicitis, cholecystitis and diverticulitis were retrospectively collected for the national lockdown period (25 March 2020-27 April 2020) and the immediate pre-lockdown period (21 February 2020-25 March 2020). Data collected included patient demographics, duration of symptoms, method of diagnosis, treatment, severity of disease, length of stay and complications. RESULTS: A reduction of 62.2% was noted in the frequency of appendicitis during the lockdown period compared to the pre-lockdown period. Patients presented later during lockdown and had a higher complication rate (5.4% versus 42.8%). Similarly, a 39.2% reduction in presentations of cholecystitis during lockdown was found. The lockdown group of patients had a longer length of stay (6.9 versus 4 days) and only one patient (9.1%, 1/11) was managed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the lockdown period, compared to 52.9% of patients (9/17) over the pre-lockdown period. No difference in frequency or severity of acute diverticulitis presentations between the two periods was found. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown led to fewer presentations, but these were often delayed, with more complications and a longer length of stay. This could be partly explained by patient fear around exposure to the virus and reluctance to attend hospital. More research is needed to study the flow-on effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on surgical presentations.","Boyle, Leah Imogen; Boyle, Alexander; Jay, Sharon; Marnewick, Jacques",N Z Med J,243,20

a blessing in disguise, in so far as it offers humanity the opportunity to reflect on its place in relation to nature, as well as on its future This question is answered affirmatively, in light of scientific evidence that human economic practices are responsible for the emergence of the coronavirus Specifically, the destruction of natural habitats by humans, who destroy rain forests to make way for soya and palm tree plantations, as well as for cattle farming, places tremendous stress on animals like bats, that tend to shed the viruses they carry when they get into contact with humans in spaces such as so-called ""wet markets"" This constitutes what Jean Baudrillard calls ""blowback"", that is, the manner in which nature exacts a kind of revenge for human technical interference in natural processes, and which one may anticipate in the wake of the medical-technological development of a vaccine against the virus, in so far as it is likely to generate the evolution of other, possibly more lethal viruses An interpretive analysis of a science fiction film (The Day the Earth Stood Still;Derrickson 2008), demonstrates the effects of short-sighted human economic behaviour as far as species-extinction is concerned, which, in the film, is thematised fictionally as something that could adumbrate the extinction of humanity itself It is argued that this film, which is a timely reminder of humans' responsibility towards nature, can be related to the present pandemic as far as the destruction of natural habitats is concerned, which demonstrably leads to the shedding of viruses The novel coronavirus is further placed in the context of what Castells calls the ""network society"", by showing that, similar to computer viruses, its rapid spread has been facilitated by the global network character of contemporary society Decisive in this regard has been the global web of air travel routes that spans the globe, along which the virus was transported from China to other countries in the world The economic aspect of the pandemic is explored in relation to the social stratification of the network society according to Castells, who depicts the world's elites as constructing their own exclusive spaces by means of various functions of networking It appears that the pandemic has exacerbated the exclusionary drive, as well as the further self-enrichment on the part of the elites, and a parallel is drawn between this state of affairs and Michel Houellebecq's novel, The Possibility of an Island, which traces the incremental exclusion of ordinary human beings from the exclusive spaces occupied by the wealthy This leads to a discussion of Naomi Klein's fears, that the current pandemic has given the world's technocrats an ideal opportunity to inveigle public authorities into investing taxpayers' funds in communications technology that would putatively safeguard people from infection by the coronavirus while, at the same time, allowing economic and educational activities (among others) to continue She exposes the hidden truth, that this would be available to the rich, but at the cost of the safety of thousands of workers behind the scenes providing much of the safeguarding services to the wealthy, as well as the fact that technocrats like Eric Schmidt want these private projects to be funded by the public Klein also points to alternative ways to adapt education safely without sacrificing the advantages of face-to-face teaching, even if she grants that communications technology has an important role to play The philosophical implications of the pandemic are pursued along the lines of the question, whether the ""network society"", which has undoubtedly facilitated its speedy unfolding, is really as new as it seems, leading to a discussion of both the affirmative and the negative answers to this question While it is indeed new in terms of the actions (such as quasi-instantaneous global investments) made possible by communications technology based on the internet, the e is a sense in which the structure of the network society is as old as the proverbial hills This is clarified with recourse to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's ontology of becoming, multiplicity, rhizomatic connections and assemblages, which contrasts with traditional thinking in terms of hierarchical, arboreal structures In Deleuzo-Guattarian terms, it is pointed out, reality has always been one of interconnectedness-in-becoming, so that, startlingly, society has always been a ""pandemic society"" in a virtual sense, and as actualised from time to time The argument further focuses on the potential for what Slavoj Žižek terms ""barbarism with a human face"", which is reminiscent of Achille Mbembe's ""necropolitics"" and ""necropower"" (""death power""), itself a response to Michel Foucault's notions of ""biopolitical power"" and ""biopower"" While the latter were employed by Foucault to characterise and analyse the modern state's mode of governance in so far as it exercised power in relation to the modalities pertaining to human bodies that are born, become economically active, get ill and die, Mbembe argues that this conceptualisation is no longer adequate in an age where the state (for example in contemporary Palestine) has, by and large, reduced bodies to the ""living dead"", and constructed ""death worlds"" where military technology is employed to control and, if necessary, terminate, human beings Žižek highlights the ideological potential of the state's actions and expectations under pandemic conditions in so far as people are induced into so-called ""personal responsibility"", while the state's complicity with regard to the inception of the pandemic is occluded As Žižek points out, nothing less than a fundamental change regarding society's mode of life is required, namely a replacement of the extractive, destructive economic system of neoliberal capitalism by an economic system that factors nature into the economic equation In conclusion, this is developed further by foregrounding the irony of ""socialism for the rich"" in the context of the pandemic, which is compared, via David Harvey's work, with the massive transfer of wealth from public funds to the wealthy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis It is argued that, in light of the unavoidable destruction of nature by the current, hegemonic economic system, which is bound to give rise to further health hazards in the shape of viruses passed from stressed animals to humans, nothing less than a rejection of capitalism is needed, in the place of which a system has to be adopted which considers human beings to be part of an encompassing nature In this regard reference is made to the work of critical

In-stent restenosis is an inflammatory response of the immune system to endovascular stent implantation in atherosclerotic patients. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are of great interest in this field in order to limit the side effects of stent treatments. Poly([R,S]-3,3-dimethylmalic acid) (PDMMLA) is a new biodegradable statistical polyester which presents promising properties as a stent coating. In this work, we studied by dynamic tensiometry, the adhesion of extracellular matrix proteins (bovine serum albumin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin) and plasma membrane proteoglycan (syndecan-4) on three PDMMLA derivatives with different hydrophilicity levels. The results show that proteins have different adhesion profiles and affinity on these surfaces. They show similar behavior on the most hydrophilic surface, making hydrophilic, ionic and hydrogen type bonds. Then we compared each protein's individual profile to that of a mixture of all studied proteins. The comparison shows that vitronectin and syndecan-4 are the quantitatively dominating proteins adsorbed by specific interactions. Based on the results from previous studies, this work allowed us to identify the most important PDMMLA surface as a promising biomaterial for bioactive stent-coating.","Gholizadeh, Elnaz; Belibel, Rima; Mora, Laurence; Letourneur, Didier; Barbaud, Christel",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,243,29

In this report, we focus on the urgent measures taken to reduce risk for both our staff and patients by reducing the number of patients receiving treatment. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the fractionation schemes for all patients in our department, including those receiving treatment and those soon to start treatment. Our goals were to (1) decrease the number of patients coming daily to the hospital for RT, (2) adapt our human resources to continue patients’ care in the department, and (3) help to cover understaffed COVID-19 sectors of the hospital. Results: We identified 50 patients who were receiving treatment (n = 6), were going to start radiation after CT scan simulation (n = 41), or for whom the CT scan was pending (n = 3). The majority were women (64%) treated for breast cancer (54%). RT was delayed for 22 (44%) patients. The majority were offered hormone therapy as “waiting therapy.” Hypofractionation was considered in 21 (42%) patients mainly with breast cancer (18 of 21, 86%). The number of courses initially planned and replanned as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak during the period of March 15 to May 31, 2020, were 1383 and 683, respectively, which represented a reduction of 50% (including delayed sessions) that allowed our reorganization process. Conclusions: To conserve resources during the pandemic, we successfully reduced the number of patients receiving treatment in a proactive fashion and adapted our organization to minimize the risk of COVID-19 contamination. Departments across the world may benefit from this same approach.","Belkacemi, Yazid; Loaganadane, Gokoulakrichenane; Grellier, Noémie; Fonteneau, Gloria; Zaoui, Gaël; Coraggio, Gabriele; Hadhri, Asma; Adou, Marie; Bendavid, Jerôme; Boros, Angela; Ghith, Sahar; Debbi, Kamel; Cadot, Pauline; Bak, Adeline; Le Bret, Cindy; Hassani, Wissal; Mahé, Mathilde; Hervé, Marie-Laure; Colson-Durand, Laurianne; Hanh TO, Nhu; Luo, Deng Feng; Cherif, Aziz",Adv.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed mechanically ventilated (MV) COVID positive patients admitted to the ICU from March 10, 2020 to May 21, 2020. Using an EHR-based performance measure for SAT, we excluded patients whom daily SAT was contra-indicated by admission primary ICD-10 codes: status epilepticus, increased intra-cranial pressure, alcoholic withdrawal. Eligibility for SAT for each day on MV was defined as absence of acidosis with pH &lt; 7.30, or receipt of neuromuscular blocking agents on that day. SAT was defined as done when the patient had documented RASS &gt;=0 or had a time period in which no continuous sedating medication were administered. A performance measure for SAT was defined as the percentage of eligible MV days in which SAT was done. Multivariate linear regression was used, adjusting for age, gender, race, and APACHE score and transforming length of stay to satisfy normality assumption. Results: 626 COVID positive patients including 552 on MV were admitted to the ICU during the target time period. Of these, 487 (88%) had at least one ICU day where they met eligibility for SAT. The in-hospital mortality of this cohort was 60.4% (n= 294, Table 1). SAT was performed on 66.7% (IQR 42.9%,100%) of eligible MV days with 5.1% of patients having no SATs done and 34.3% of patients receiving SAT on all eligible days, meaning they reached 100% SAT performance. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that while 100% SAT performance was not significantly associated with mortality (OR 1.06 95% CI (0.71,1.62)), it was associated with shorter hospital LOS and ICU LOS (Hospital LOS coefficient-0.37, 95% CI (-0.51,-0.24) and ICU LOS coefficient-0.74, 95% CI (-0.87,-0.61)) and greater number of ventilator-free days (coefficient 5.36, 95% CI (2.01,8.71)). Conclusion: Improving compliance with SAT on intubated COVID patients may decrease ICU length of stay which has implications for post-COVID recovery as well as resource optimization. We were limited by incomplete documentation during overwhelming COVID surge and likely underpowered to detect significant associations for the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality.","Ruan, E.; Gong, M.

Until then, pregnant persons and their obstetricians will need to use available data to weigh the benefits and risks of COVID-19 vaccines. Issues to be considered when counseling pregnant persons include data from animal studies and inadvertently exposed pregnancies during vaccine clinical trials when available, potential risks to pregnancy of vaccine reactogenicity, timing of vaccination during pregnancy, evidence for safety of other vaccines during pregnancy, risk of COVID-19 complications due to pregnancy and the pregnant person's underlying conditions, and risk of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and potential for risk mitigation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have each issued guidance supportive of offering COVID-19 vaccine to pregnant persons. As additional information from clinical trials and from data collected on vaccinated pregnant persons becomes available, it will be critical for obstetricians to keep up to date with this information.","Rasmussen, Sonja A; Kelley, Colleen F; Horton, John P; Jamieson, Denise J",Obstet Gynecol,243,29

The clinical treatment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV-2 is currently based on the experimental administration of HIV antiviral drugs, such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and remdesivir (a nucleotide analogue used for Ebola infection). This work proposes a repurposing process using a database containing approximately 8000 known drugs in synergy structure- and ligand-based studies by means of the molecular docking and descriptor-based protocol. The proposed in silico findings identified new potential SARS CoV-2 main protease (MPRO) inhibitors that fit in the catalytic binding site of SARS CoV-2 MPRO. Several selected structures are NAD-like derivatives, suggesting a relevant role of these molecules in the modulation of SARS CoV-2 infection in conditions of cell chronic oxidative stress. Increased catabolism of NAD(H) during protein ribosylation in the DNA damage repair process may explain the greater susceptibility of the elderly population to the acute respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. The molecular modelling studies proposed herein agree with this hypothesis.","Martorana, Annamaria; Gentile, Carla; Lauria, Antonino",Viruses,243,0

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. SEARCH METHODS: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding preprocedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies, and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. We assessed heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years. Eight studies had high risk of bias; eight had unclear risk of bias. No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). Two studies measured contamination per volume of air sampled at different distances from the patient's mouth, and 14 studies sampled particles on agar plates at specific distances from the patient's mouth. The results presented below should be interpreted with caution as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the 'minimal clinically important difference' in CFU. High-volume evacuator Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot (~ 30 cm) from a patient's mouth (MD -47.41, 95% CI -92.76 to -2.06; 3 RCTs, 122 participants (two studies had split-mouth design); very high heterogeneity I² = 95%), but not at longer distances (MD -1.00, -2.56 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 80 participants). One split-mouth RCT (six participants) found that HVE may not be more effective than conventional dental suction (saliva ejector or low-volume evacuator) at 40 cm (MD CFU -2.30, 95% CI -5.32 to 0.72) or 150 cm (MD -2.20, 95% CI -14.01 to 9.61). Dental isolation combination system One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector (low-volume evacuator) during AGPs (MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.20) or after AGPs (MD -0.35, -0.99 to 0.29). However, an 'n of 1' design study showed that the combination system may reduce CFU compared with rubber dam plus HVE (MD -125.20, 95% CI -174.02 to -76.38) or HVE (MD -109.30, 95% CI -153.01 to -65.59). Rubber dam One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) receiving dental treatment, found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one-metre (MD -16.20, 95% CI -19.36 to -13.04) and two-metre distance (MD -11.70, 95% CI -15.82 to -7.58). One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead (MD 0.98, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.70) and occipital region of the operator (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.46 to 2.00). One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest (MD -251.00, 95% CI -267.95 to -234.05) and dental unit light (MD -12.70, 95% CI -12.85 to -12.55). Air cleaning systems One split-mouth CCT (two participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation (MD -66.70 CFU, 95% CI -120.15 to -13.25 per cubic metre) or ultrasonic scaling (MD -32.40, 95% CI - 51.55 to -13.25). Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor (MD -483.56 CFU, 95% CI -550.02 to -417.10 per cubic feet per minute per patient) and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth (MD -319.14 CFU, 95% CI - 385.60 to -252.68). Disinfectants â antimicrobial coolants Two RCTs evaluated use of antimicrobial coolants during ultrasonic scaling. Compared with distilled water, coolant containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU: CHX (MD -124.00, 95% CI -135.78 to -112.22; 20 participants), povidone iodine (MD -656.45, 95% CI -672.74 to -640.16; 40 participants), cinnamon (MD -644.55, 95% CI -668.70 to -620.40; 40 participants). CHX coolant may reduce CFU more than povidone iodine (MD -59.30, 95% CI -64.16 to -54.44; 20 participants), but not more than cinnamon extract (MD -11.90, 95% CI -35.88 to 12.08; 40 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using colony-forming units. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions evaluated but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions. We did not find any studies on methods such as ventilation, ionization, ozonisation, UV light and fogging. Studies are needed that measure contamination in aerosols, size distribution of aerosols and infection transmission risk for respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 in dental patients and staff.","Kumbargere Nagraj, Sumanth; Eachempati, Prashanti; Paisi, Martha; Nasser, Mona; Sivaramakrishnan, Gowri; Verbeek, Jos H",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,243,17

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were used to contain the source in Xinfadi (XFD) market. To rapidly control the outbreak, both traditional and newly introduced NPIs including large-scale management of high-risk populations and expanded severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR-based screening in the general population were conducted in Beijing. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing's XFD market and inform future response efforts of resurgence across regions. METHODS: A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was developed and applied to evaluate a range of different scenarios from the public health perspective. Two outcomes were measured: magnitude of transmission (i.e., number of cases in the outbreak) and endpoint of transmission (i.e., date of containment). The outcomes of scenario evaluations were presented relative to the reality case (i.e., 368 cases in 34 days) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). RESULTS: Our results indicated that a 3 to 14 day delay in the identification of XFD as the infection source and initiation of NPIs would have caused a 3 to 28-fold increase in total case number (31-77 day delay in containment). A failure to implement the quarantine scheme employed in the XFD outbreak for defined key population would have caused a fivefold greater number of cases (73 day delay in containment). Similarly, failure to implement the quarantine plan executed in the XFD outbreak for close contacts would have caused twofold greater transmission (44 day delay in containment). Finally, failure to implement expanded nucleic acid screening in the general population would have yielded 1.6-fold greater transmission and a 32 day delay to containment. CONCLUSIONS: This study informs new evidence that in form the selection of NPI to use as countermeasures in response to a COVID-19 outbreak and optimal timing of their implementation. The evidence provided by this study should inform responses to future outbreaks of COVID-19 and future infectious disease outbreak preparedness efforts in China and elsewhere.","Wang, Xiao-Li; Lin, Xin; Yang, Peng; Wu, Zun-You; Li, Gang; McGoogan, Jennifer M; Jiao, Zeng-Tao; He, Xin-Jun; Li, Si-Qi; Shi, Hong-Hao; Wang, Jing-Yuan; Lai, Sheng-Jie; Huang, Chun; Wang, Quan-Yi",Infect Dis Poverty,243,16

Preparedness of individual nations and the hospitals is important to effectively deal with the surge of cases. We aimed to obtain nation wide data from Nepal, about hospital preparedness for COVID-19. METHODS: Online questionnaire was prepared in accordance with the Center for Disease Control recommendations to assess preparedness of hospitals for COVID-19. The questionnaire was circulated to the over 800 doctors across the nation, who are the life members of six medical societies. RESULTS: We obtained 131 completed responses from all seven provinces. Majority of respondents had anaesthesiology as the primary specialty. Only 52 (39.7%) participants mentioned that their hospital had policy to receive suspected or proven cases with COVID-19. Presence of isolation ward was mentioned by 83 (63.4%) respondents, with only 9 (6.9%)mentioning the presence of airborne isolation. Supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) was inadequate as per 124 (94.7%) respondents. Critical care services for COVID-19 patients were possible only in hospitals of 42 (32.1%)respondents. RT-polymerase chain reaction could be performed only in the hospital of 6 (4.6%) respondents. CONCLUSIONS: It is apparent that most of the hospitals are not well prepared for management of patients with COVID-19.

In this article we present the consumption of systemic antibiotics in Norway during the period of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Total sales of systemic antibiotics in defined daily doses (DDD) were retrieved from the wholesaler-based medicinal product statistics for 2019 and 2020, and sales of antibiotics for use outside of healthcare institutions were retrieved from the Norwegian prescription database. Information was retrieved on the proportion of users (prevalence), doses (measured in DDD) and prescriptions. RESULTS: Total sales of systemic antibiotics increased in March 2020, but sales to persons outside of healthcare institutions did not. Compared to previous years, both total consumption and use of antibiotics outside of institutions fell steeply in the months that followed. The reduction was greatest for antibiotics against respiratory infections and in the youngest age groups. INTERPRETATION: The significant reduction in the use of systemic antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic is attributed to infection control measures and reduced contact with the health service. In 2016, the Norwegian government set a goal for a 30 % reduction in antibiotic use by the end of 2020. The pandemic has contributed to the achievement of that goal.","Blix, Hege Salvesen; Høye, Sigurd",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen,243,16

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling possibly partakes in the pathophysiology of this devastating complication. METHODS: In the current project, we have appraised expression levels of VDR, CYP27B1 and a number of associated lncRNAs in the circulation of COVID-19 patients versus healthy subjects using real-time PCR method. RESULTS: Expression of SNHG6 was considerably lower in COVID-19 patients compared with control subjects (Ratio of mean expression (RME) = 0.22, P value = 7.04E-05) and in both female and male COVID-19 patients compared with sex-matched unaffected individuals (RME = 0.32, P value = 0.04 and RME = 0.16, P value = 0.000679683, respectively). However, its expression was similar among ICU-hospitalized and non-ICU patients. Similarly, expression of SNHG16 was lower in in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (RME = 0.20, P value = 5.94E-05) and in both female and male patients compared with sex-matched controls (RME = 0.32, P value = 0.04 and RME = 0.14, P value = 0.000496435, respectively) with no significant difference among ICU-hospitalized and non-ICU hospitalized patients. Expression of VDR was lower in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (RME = 0.42, P value = 0.04) and in male patients compared with male controls (RME = 0.27, P value = 0.02). Yet, expression of VDR was statistically similar between female subgroups and between ICU-hospitalized and non-ICU hospitalized patients. Expression levels CYP27B, Linc00511 and Linc00346 were similar among COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects or between their subgroups. Significant correlations have been detected between expression levels of VDR, CYP27B and SNHG6, SNHG16, Linc00511 and Linc00346 lncRNAs both among COVID-19 patients and among healthy controls with the most significant ones being SNHG6 and SNHG16 (r = 0.74, P value = 3.26e-17 and r = 0.81, P = 1.54e-22, respectively). CONCLUSION: Combination of transcript levels of VDR, CYP27B and SNHG6, SNHG16, Linc00511 and Linc00346 could differentiate patients from controls with AUC = 0.76, sensitivity = 0.62 and specificity = 0.81.

These nodes may be separated by a few microns or on planetary scale distances, but transmission losses due to absorption and/or scattering in the channel are the major source of error for most distributed quantum information tasks. Of course, quantum error correction (QEC) and detection techniques can be used to mitigate such effects, but error detection approaches have severe performance limitations due to the signaling constraints between nodes, and so error correction approaches are preferable-assuming one has sufficient high quality local operations. Typically, performance comparisons between loss-mitigating codes assume one encoded qubit per photon. However, single photons can carry more than one qubit of information and so our focus in this Letter is to explore whether loss-based QEC codes utilizing quantum multiplexed photons are viable and advantageous, especially as photon loss results in more than one qubit of information being lost. We show that quantum multiplexing enables significant resource reduction, in terms of the number of single-photon sources, while at the same time maintaining (or even lowering) the number of 2-qubit gates required. Further, our multiplexing approach requires only conventional optical gates already necessary for the implementation of these codes.","Lo Piparo, Nicolò; Hanks, Michael; Gravel, Claude; Nemoto, Kae; Munro, William J",Phys Rev Lett,243,20

Among the gaps in research on the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of sufficient infoveillance data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to increase understanding of public awareness of COVID-19 pandemic trends and uncover meaningful themes of concern posted by Twitter users in the English language during the pandemic. METHODS: Data mining was conducted on Twitter to collect a total of 107,990 tweets related to COVID-19 between December 13 and March 9, 2020. The analyses included frequency of keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. A natural language processing approach and the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm were used to identify the most common tweet topics as well as to categorize clusters and identify themes based on the keyword analysis. RESULTS: The results indicate three main aspects of public awareness and concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the trend of the spread and symptoms of COVID-19 can be divided into three stages. Second, the results of the sentiment analysis showed that people have a negative outlook toward COVID-19. Third, based on topic modeling, the themes relating to COVID-19 and the outbreak were divided into three categories: the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, how to control COVID-19, and reports on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Sentiment analysis and topic modeling can produce useful information about the trends in the discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media as well as alternative perspectives to investigate the COVID-19 crisis, which has created considerable public awareness. This study shows that Twitter is a good communication channel for understanding both public concern and public awareness about COVID-19. These findings can help health departments communicate information to alleviate specific public concerns about the disease.","Boon-Itt, Sakun; Skunkan, Yukolpat",JMIR Public Health Surveill,243,17

In the present study, we aimed to provide a statistical characterization of COVID-19 transmissions that led to this small outbreak. We collated the individual data of the first 28 confirmed cases reported from 20 January to 10 February 2020. We estimated key epidemiological parameters such as reporting delay (i.e., time from symptom onset to confirmation), incubation period, and serial interval by fitting probability distributions to the data based on the maximum likelihood estimation. We also estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using the renewal equation, which allows for the transmissibility to differ between imported and locally transmitted cases. There were 16 imported and 12 locally transmitted cases, and secondary transmissions per case were higher for the imported cases than the locally transmitted cases (nine vs. three cases). The mean reporting delays were estimated to be 6.76 days (95% CI: 4.53, 9.28) and 2.57 days (95% CI: 1.57, 4.23) for imported and locally transmitted cases, respectively. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 5.53 days (95% CI: 3.98, 8.09) and was shorter than the mean serial interval of 6.45 days (95% CI: 4.32, 9.65). The R0 was estimated to be 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.99), accounting for the local and imported cases. The fewer secondary cases and shorter reporting delays for the locally transmitted cases suggest that contact tracing of imported cases was effective at reducing further transmissions, which helped to keep R0 below one and the overall transmissions small.","Won, Yong Sul; Kim, Jong-Hoon; Ahn, Chi Young; Lee, Hyojung",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),243,13

Observing the trend and estimating the future prevalence of an epidemic is crucial for governments in allocating healthcare resources in public and regulating the economic activities in the country. To observe the trend and forecast the future prevalence of the COVID-19 epidemic in the world, researchers are currently using different statistical and mathematical-based models. In this study, we analyzed the trend pattern of COVID-19 and its future prevalence in Afghanistan. We employed time series models (ARIMA model) to existed COVID-19 epidemic data of Afghan patients collected from 22 March to 24 June 2020. Three ARIMA models with the lowest AIC values were developed and selected to forecast the cumulative number of registered, recovered, and death cases of COVID-19 for the next two months in Afghanistan. Predicted results from our models reveal that the number of registered, recovered, and death cases of COVID-19 may have an exponential growth until the end of August. According to our models' predictions, the cumulative number of registered, recovered, and death cases of COVID-19 can reach up to 61086, 45228, and 2302 at the end of August, respectively. We believe that this study's results can potentially help the government of Afghanistan make effective strategies for controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the country. © 2020 IEEE.","Jalil Niazai, A.; Zahirzada, A.; Akbar Shahpoor, M.; Rahman Safi, A.","Proc.

In the current study, we sought to provide, in a representative sample of UK residents during the third COVID-19 lockdown in February 2021, further evidence for the validation of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome construct. We did this by evaluating the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome against measures of personality, health anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety in predicting levels of generalized anxiety and depression and by examining whether increased health anxiety and COVID-19 psychological distress (COVID-19 anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety syndrome) scores were associated with increased attentional bias to COVID-19-related stimuli. A series of correlation analyses revealed that neuroticism, health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety syndrome scores were positively and significantly correlated with generalized anxiety and depression scores and that the perseveration component of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome predicted generalized anxiety and depression scores independently of age, gender, conscientiousness, openness, health anxiety and COVID-19 anxiety. Furthermore, results indicated that only the total COVID-19 anxiety syndrome score and the scores on the avoidance and perseveration components were positively and significantly correlated with attentional bias indices. More specifically, the general attentional bias index was only shown to be positively and significantly correlated with the total COVID-19 anxiety syndrome score and its perseveration component, while slowed disengagement was only shown to be negatively and significantly correlated with the total COVID-19 anxiety syndrome score and its avoidance component. The implications of these findings are discussed.","Albery, Ian P; Spada, Marcantonio M; Nikcevic, Ana V",Clin. psychol. psychother,243,33

However, there are few tools to detect microstructural changes after AKI. Here, cationic ferritin-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CFE-MRI) was applied to examine the heterogeneity of kidney pathology in the transition from AKI to CKD. Adult male mice received folic acid followed by cationic ferritin and were euthanized at four days (AKI), four weeks (CKD-4) or 12 weeks (CKD-12). Kidneys were examined by histologic methods and CFE-MRI. In the CKD-4 and CKD-12 groups, glomerular number was reduced and atubular cortical lesions were observed. Apparent glomerular volume was larger in the AKI, CKD-4 and CKD-12 groups compared to controls. Glomerular hypertrophy occurred with ageing. Interglomerular distance and glomerular density were combined with other MRI metrics to distinguish the AKI and CKD groups from controls. Despite significant heterogeneity, the noninvasive (MRI-based) metrics were as accurate as invasive (histological) metrics at distinguishing AKI and CKD from controls. To assess the toxicity of cationic ferritin in a CKD model, CKD-4 mice received cationic ferritin and were examined one week later. The CKD-4 groups with and without cationic ferritin were similar, except the iron content of the kidney, liver, and spleen was greater in the CKD-4 plus cationic ferritin group. Thus, our study demonstrates the accuracy and safety of CFE-MRI to detect whole kidney pathology allowing for the development of novel biomarkers of kidney disease and providing a foundation for future in vivo longitudinal studies in mouse models of AKI and CKD to track nephron fate.","Charlton, Jennifer R; Xu, Yanzhe; Wu, Teresa; deRonde, Kim A; Hughes, Jillian L; Dutta, Shourik; Oxley, Gavin T; Cwiek, Aleksandra; Cathro, Helen P; Charlton, Nathan P; Conaway, Mark R; Baldelomar, Edwin J; Parvin, Neda; Bennett, Kevin M",Kidney int,243,16

Abnormal liver chemistry tests of varying severities occur in a majority of patients. However, there is a dearth of accompanying liver histologic studies in these patients. METHODS: The current report details the clinical courses of 2 patients having severe COVID-19 hepatitis. Liver biopsies were analyzed under light microscopy, portions of liver tissue were hybridized with a target probe to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 S gene, and small sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded liver tissue were processed for electron microscopy. RESULTS: The liver histology of both cases showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with prominent bile duct damage, endotheliitis, and many apoptotic bodies. In situ hybridization and electron microscopy suggest the intrahepatic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, the findings of which may indicate the possibility of direct cell injury. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the abundant apoptosis and severe cholangiocyte injury, these histopathologic changes suggest a direct cytopathic injury. Furthermore, some of the histopathologic changes may resemble acute cellular rejection occurring after liver transplantation. These 2 cases demonstrate that severe COVID-19 hepatitis can occur even in the absence of significant involvement of other organs.","Fiel, M Isabel; El Jamal, Siraj M; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Gordon, Ronald E; Reidy, Jason; Bandovic, Jela; Advani, Rashmi; Kilaru, Saikiran; Pourmand, Kamron; Ward, Stephen; Thung, Swan N; Schiano, Thomas",Cell Mol.

Therefore, we investigated how potassium phosphite can be integrated into late blight control programs with reduced fungicides in field trials. Phosphite was somewhat less effective than the conventional fungicides at suppressing late blight in the foliage, and the tubers contained less starch. However, when we reduced the amount of phosphite and combined it with reduced amounts of conventional fungicides, we observed no differences in disease suppression, total yields, and tuber starch contents compared with the full treatments with conventional fungicides. The amount of phosphite detected in the harvested tubers was linearly associated with the amount of phosphite applied to the foliage. Our analyses indicate that phosphite could replace some fungicides without exceeding the current European Union standards for the maximum residue levels in potato tubers. No phosphite was detected in the starch from the tubers. In 1 of 2 years, early blight (caused by Alternaria solani) was less severe in the phosphite treatments than in the treatments without phosphite.

Especially, the spike of case numbers in South Korea sparks pandemic worries. This virus is reported to spread mainly through personto- person contact via respiratory droplets generated by coughing and sneezing, or possibly through surface contaminated by people coughing or sneezing on them. More critically, there have been reports about the possibility of this virus to transmit even before a virus-carrying person to show symptoms. Therefore, a low-cost, easy-access protocol for early detection of this virus is desperately needed. Here, we have established a real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rtPCR)-based assay protocol composed of easy specimen self-collection from a subject via pharyngeal swab, Trizolbased RNA purification, and SYBR Green-based rtPCR. This protocol shows an accuracy and sensitivity limit of 1-10 virus particles as we tested with a known lentivirus. The cost for each sample is estimated to be less than 15 US dollars. Overall time it takes for an entire protocol is estimated to be less than 4 hours.

The objective was to determine incidence and risk factors of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in COVID-19 inpatients receiving thromboprophylaxis. In this retrospective French cohort study, patients hospitalized in medical wards non-ICU with confirmed COVID-19 and adequate thromboprophylaxis were included. A systematic low limb venous duplex ultrasonography was performed at hospital discharge or earlier if deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was clinically suspected. Chest angio-CT scan was performed when pulmonary embolism (PE) was suspected. Of 71 patients, 16 developed VTE (22.5%) and 7 PE (10%) despite adequate thromboprophylaxis. D-dimers at baseline were significantly higher in patients with DVT (p < 0.001). Demographics, comorbidities, disease manifestations, severity score, and other biological parameters, including inflammatory markers, were similar in patients with and without VTE. The negative predictive value of a baseline D-dimer level < 1.0 µg/ml was 90% for VTE and 98% for PE. The positive predictive value for VTE was 44% and 67% for D-dimer level &#8805; 1.0 µg/ml and &#8805; 3 µg/ml, respectively. The association between D-dimer level and VTE risk increased by taking into account the latest available D-dimer level prior to venous duplex ultrasonography for the patients with monitoring of D-dimer. Despite thromboprophylaxis, the risk of VTE is high in COVID-19 non-ICU inpatients. Increased D-dimer concentrations of more than 1.0 µg/ml predict the risk of venous thromboembolism. D-dimer level-guided aggressive thromboprophylaxis regimens using higher doses of heparin should be evaluated in prospective studies.","Artifoni, Mathieu; Danic, Gwenvael; Gautier, Giovanni; Gicquel, Pascal; Boutoille, David; Raffi, François; Néel, Antoine; Lecomte, Raphaël",J Thromb Thrombolysis,243,3

Minimally invasive methods and upgraded surgical instruments maximize the benefits of surgery also in complex cardiac revision cases with substantial perioperative risk. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68 y.o. patient, 10 years after previous sternotomy for OPCAB was referred to cardiac surgery on the 10th postoperative day after neurosurgical intervention for intracerebral bleeding with suspected mitral valve endocarditis. Mitral valve vegetation, tricuspid valve insufficiency and coronary stenosis were diagnosed and treated by minimally invasive revision cardiac surgery on the 14th postoperative day after neurosurgery. CONCLUSION: The present clinical case demonstrates for the first time that the minimally invasive approach via right anterior mini-thoracotomy can be safely used for concomitant complex mitral valve reconstruction, tricuspid valve repair and aorto-coronary bypass surgery, even as a revision procedure in the presence of florid endocarditis after recent neurosurgical intervention. The Covid-19 pandemic and prophylactic patient isolation slow down the efficacy of pulmonary weaning and mobilisation and prolong the need for ICU treatment, without adversely affecting long-term outcome.","Andrási, Terézia B; Abudureheman, Nunijiati; Glück, Alannah; Vondran, Maximilian; Dinges, Gerhard; Talipov, Ildar; Rastan, Ardawan J",J Cardiothorac Surg,243,1

We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community. As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae. We call upon additional epidemiology cohorts to join this collective effort to strengthen our impact on the current health crisis and generate a new model for a collaborative and nimble research infrastructure that will lead to more rapid translation of our work for the betterment of public health.","Chan, Andrew T; Drew, David A; Nguyen, Long H; Joshi, Amit D; Ma, Wenjie; Guo, Chuan-Guo; Lo, Chun-Han; Mehta, Raaj S; Kwon, Sohee; Sikavi, Daniel R; Magicheva-Gupta, Marina V; Fatehi, Zahra S; Flynn, Jacqueline J; Leonardo, Brianna M; Albert, Christine M; Andreotti, Gabriella; Beane-Freeman, Laura E; Balasubramanian, Bijal A; Brownstein, John S; Bruinsma, Fiona; Cowan, Annie N; Deka, Anusila; Ernst, Michael E; Figueiredo, Jane C; Franks, Paul W; Gardner, Christopher D; Ghobrial, Irene M; Haiman, Christopher A; Hall, Janet E; Deming-Halverson, Sandra L; Kirpach, Brenda; Lacey, James V; Marchand, Loic Le; Marinac, Catherine R; Martinez, Maria Elena; Milne, Roger L; Murray, Anne M; Nash, Denis; Palmer, Julie R; Patel, Alpa V; Rosenberg, Lynn; Sandler, Dale P; Sharma, Shreela V; Schurman, Shepherd H; Wilkens, Lynne R; Chavarro, Jorge E; Eliassen, A Heather; Hart, Jaime E; Kang, Jae Hee; Koenen, Karestan C",Cancer epidemiol. biomark. prev,243,1

However, as the pandemic persists, these data may not reflect current circumstances and may have been confounded by exam stress. METHODS: This study used an online survey to assess the changes in, and associations between, mental health and movement behaviours in 255 UK university students from before the COVID-19 pandemic (October 2019) to 9 months following the UK's first confirmed case (October 2020). Changes in and associations between mental wellbeing, perceived stress, physical activity, and sedentary behaviour were assessed using a mixed model ANOVA; a multiple linear regression model determined the predictive value of variables associated with &#916; mental wellbeing. RESULTS: Mental wellbeing and physical activity decreased (45.2 to 42.3 (p < 0.001); 223 to 173 min/week (p < 0.001)), whereas perceived stress and time spent sedentary increased (19.8 to 22.8 (p < 0.001); 66.0 to 71.2 h/week (p = 0.036)). &#916; perceived stress, &#916; sedentary behaviour and university year accounted for 64.7%, 12.9%, and 10.1% of the variance in &#916; mental wellbeing (p < 0.001; p = 0.006; p = 0.035).

MethodsWe recruited households of 70 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 146 household contacts from May 2020 to May 2021. Participants donated biological samples 8 times over 6 weeks and answered questionnaires. Whole genome sequencing and droplet digital PCR were used to establish the SARS-CoV-2 variant and viral load. ResultsSARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in 60% of the households, and the overall SAR for household contacts was 50%. The SAR was significantly higher for the Alpha variant (78%) compared with non-VOC viruses (43%) and was associated with a higher viral load. SAR was higher in household contacts aged [≥]40 years (69%) than in younger contacts (40-47%), and for contacts of cases with loss of taste/smell. Children had lower viral loads and were more often asymptomatic than adults. Sleeping separately from the primary case reduced the risk of transmission. ConclusionsWe found substantial household transmission, particularly for the Alpha variant.

SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: People of any age who had provided blood for testing at selected diagnostic pathology services (general pathology); pregnant women aged 20-39 years who had received routine antenatal screening; and Australian Red Cross Lifeblood plasmapheresis donors aged 20-69 years. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; testing of de-identified residual blood specimens collected during 20 April - 2 June 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimated proportions of people seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG, adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Thirty-eight of 5339 specimens were IgG-positive (general pathology, 19 of 3231; antenatal screening, 7 of 560; plasmapheresis donors, 12 of 1548); there were no clear patterns by age group, sex, or location of residence. Adjusted estimated seroprevalence among people who had had general pathology blood tests (all ages) was 0.15% (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.04-0.41%), and 0.29% (95% CrI, 0.04-0.75%) for plasmapheresis donors (20-69 years). Among 20-39-year-old people, the age group common to all three collection groups, adjusted estimated seroprevalence was 0.24% (95% CrI, 0.04-0.80%) for the general pathology group, 0.79% (95% CrI, 0.04-1.88%) for the antenatal screening group, and 0.69% (95% CrI, 0.04-1.59%) for plasmapheresis donors. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was below 1%, indicating that community transmission was low during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave in Sydney.

However, the existing treatment effects literature primarily considers treatments that could be assigned directly at the level of the outcome units, potentially with spillover effects. I approach the spatial treatment setting from a similar experimental perspective: What ideal experiment would we design to estimate the causal effects of spatial treatments? This perspective motivates a comparison between individuals near realized treatment locations and individuals near unrealized candidate locations, which is distinct from current empirical practice. Furthermore, I show how to find such candidate locations and apply the proposed methods with observational data.

The vibration frequencies simulated were thoroughly analysed employing DFT/B3LYP using 6-311++G(d,p) basis set and compared with experimental FT- Raman and FT- IR data which showed good agreement vice-versa. Optimised molecular equilibrium geometry of the title compound was carried out. Vibrational assignments of wave numbers with PED (potential energy distribution) was done using VEDA software and the quantum chemical calculations of the molecular geometry were scaled using quantum mechanics. The title molecule showcased excellent results on HOMO - LUMO energies, NMR chemical shifts, 3.73â¯eV band gap, electronegativity (&#967;), chemical potential (µ), softness (S), global hardness (Î·). The low softness value (0.261) and thehigh value of electrophilicity index (4.0323) explains the biological activity of the title molecule. The reactive sites of APBPP were thoroughly investigated by Mulliken charges, MEP (Molecular electrostatic Potential) and Fukui functions. Thermo dynamical environment of the title compound for different temperatures were studied which reveals the correlations between entropy (S), heat capacity (C) and enthalpy changes (H) with temperatures. The title compound was docked into the reactive sites of antiviral (SARS-CoV-1,2) and anticancer protein using molecular docking tool and it showed excellent results compared to the ongoing clinical trials.

Regarding the differences in the infection rate observed in each region, additionally to studies investigating the causes of differences in population density as a proxy for social distancing, an increasing trend of studies investigating the causes of differences in social capital has also been seen (ie, value sharing, acceptance of norms, unity, and trust through reciprocity). However, studies investigating whether social capital that controls the effects of population density also influences the infection rate are limited. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital using statistical data of Japan's every prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that social capital not only negatively correlates with infection rates and population densities, but also negatively correlates with infection rates controlling for the effects of population density. Additionally, controlling the relationship between the variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social capital mediates the relationship between population density and infection rates, indicating that social distancing alone is not enough to deter coronavirus disease; social capital needs to be recharged.","Kokubun, Keisuke; Yamakawa, Yoshinori",Inquiry,243,1

This interest has grown rapidly during the current COVID-19 pandemic, where CRISPR-diagnostics have been frontline contenders for rapid testing solutions. This surge in CRISPR-diagnostic research prompts the following question: what exactly are the achievable limits of detection and associated assay times enabled by the kinetics of enzymes such as Cas12 and Cas13? To explore this question, we here present a model based on Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics theory applied to CRISPR enzymes. We use the model to develop analytical solutions for reaction kinetics and develop back-of-the-envelope criteria to validate and check for consistency in reported enzyme kinetic parameters. We applied our analyses to all studies known to us, which report Michaelis-Menten-type kinetic data for CRISPR-associated enzymes. These studies include all subtypes of Cas12 and Cas13 and orthologs. We found all but one study clearly violate at least two of our three rules and therefore present data that violate basic physical limits. We performed an experimental study of reaction kinetics of LbCas12a with both ssDNA and dsDNA activators and use these data to validate our model and its predicted scaling. The validated model is used to explore CRISPR reaction time scales and the degree of reaction completion for practically relevant target concentrations applicable to CRISPR-diagnostic assays. The results have broad implications for achievable limits of detection and assay times of emerging, amplification-free CRISPR-detection methods.","Ramachandran, Ashwin; Santiago, Juan G",Anal Chem,243,16

Just before the first verified patient, we ran a survey of the general population that included questions concerning both components of SWB, self-rated health, income satisfaction, and other socio-demographic aspects. The same survey among different respondents from the same population during the lockdown period when no exit strategy had been conveyed, and for the third time when the exit strategy was publicized and began to be implemented. The findings show that the cognitive component of SWB, as measured by Cantril's Ladder, remained stable over the long term. The average respondent reported unchanged life evaluation even when the individual's negative feelings rose by 52%, and positive feelings fell by 16%. We show evidence for a structural change in the weighting of feelings and self-rated health in life satisfaction function.","Shavit, Tal; Sherman, Arie; Aisenberg, Daniela",Curr Psychol,243,20

A deeper knowledge about the shift in cellular metabolism of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected cells could provide new insights about its pathogenic and host response and help to diagnose pulmonary involvement. We explored the association between metabolic and structural changes of lung parenchyma in asymptomatic cancer patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, as a potential added diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scans in this subpopulation. Methods: Within the period of February 19 and May 29, 2020 18F-FDG PET/CT studies were reviewed to identify those cancer patients with suggestive incidental findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. PET studies were interpreted through qualitative (visual) and semiquantitative analysis (measurement of maximum standardized uptake value, SUVmax) evaluating lung findings. Several characteristic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) were described as COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) categories (1-6). After comparing SUVmax values of pulmonary infiltrates among different CO-RADS categories, we explored the best potential cut-off values of pulmonary SUVmax against CO-RADS categories as ""gold standard"" result to discard the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: CT signs classified as CO-RADS category 5 or 6 were found in 16/41 (39%) oncological patients derived to multimodal PET/CT imaging. SUVmax was higher in patients with CO-RADS 5 and 6 vs. 4 (6.17±0.82 vs. 3.78±0.50, P = 0.04) and vs. 2 and 3 categories (3.59±0.41, P = 0.01). A specificity of 93.8% (IC 95%: 71.7-99.7%) and an accuracy of 92.9% were obtained when combining a CO-RADS score 5-6 with a SUVmax of 2.45 in pulmonary infiltrates. Conclusion: In asymptomatic cancer patients, the metabolic activity in lung infiltrates is closely associated with several combined tomographic changes characteristic of COVID-19 pneumonia. Multimodal 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging could provide additional information during early diagnosis in selected predisposed patients during pandemic. The prognostic implications of simultaneous radiological and molecular findings in cancer and other high-risk subpopulations for COVID-19 pneumonia deserve further evaluation in prospective researches.","Wakfie-Corieh, Cristina Gamila; Ferrando-Castagnetto, Federico; Blanes Garcia, Alba Maria; Garcia-Esquinas, Marta Garcia; Ortega Candil, Aida; Rodriguez Rey, Cristina; Cabrera Martin, Maria Nieves; Delgado Cano, Ana; Carreras Delgado, Jose Luis",J. nucl. med,243,1

The observed decrease in emergency department (ED) visits is unsurprising during this major crisis, as patients are likely to prioritize avoiding exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over addressing what they may perceive as mild symptoms of headache, lethargy, difficulty speaking, and numbness. In the central and south Texas regions where we practice, we suspect that patient admission, treatment, and discharge volumes for acute stroke treatment have decreased significantly since COVID-19-related shelter-at-home orders were issued. Symptoms of stroke are frequently noticed by a family member, friend, or community member before they are recognized by the patients themselves, and these symptoms may be going unnoticed due to limited face-to-face encounters. This possibility emphasizes the importance of patient education regarding stroke warning signs and symptoms during the current period of isolation and social-distancing. The south Texas population, already saddled with above-average rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, has a higher stroke mortality rate compared to Texas and U.S. averages; however, the number of patients presenting to EDs with acute ischemic stroke diagnoses is lower than average.

Although these therapies may have direct antithrombotic effects, other mechanisms of action, including anti-inflammatory or antiviral effects, have been postulated. Based on survey results from this group of authors, we suggest research priorities for specific agents and subgroups of patients with COVID-19. Further, we review other agents, including immunomodulators, that may have antithrombotic properties.

Ongoing urbanization and urban densification are transforming the urban climate and complicating the pedestrian-level wind environment. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to evaluate the potential wind-cooling effect on human outdoor thermal conditions. Accordingly, the current research attempts determine the best wind directions for thermal comfort at the studied stations and how these factors will be changed under the effects of global warming. Outdoor thermal conditions were modeled based on the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) thermal index using RayMan software for the decades of the 2000s and the 2040s in different climate types of Iran (Csb, BWh, Csa, and BSh) To estimate the potential cooling effect of wind, the PET was calculated (1) under actual wind conditions, and (2) under calm wind (0.05 m/s) conditions. Then, the &#916;PET for these two conditions, which indicates the cooling potential effect (CPE) of the wind, was calculated for four representative stations (Ardebil, Bandar Abbas, Gorgan, and Shiraz). In comparison with the 2000s, the results indicated that by the 2040s, the predicted wind cooling potential will have increased in Ardebil, Shiraz, Bandar Abbas and Gorgan (CPE of 13.2 °C, 13.1 °C, 11.2 °C, and 11 °C, respectively). Based on the overall average of two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1) used in this study, the occurrence of ""comfortable"" conditions by the 2040s will have increased in Bandar Abbas, Shiraz, and Ardebil by 1.1%, 0.4%, and 0.3%, respectively, while it will have decreased in Gorgan by 1.5%. Accounting for the cooling effect of wind, the comfort cooling potential of wind is predicted to rise by an average of 1.6 °C in the 2040s compared with the 2000s in all the studied stations.

There is no trusted drug against the virus; hence, efforts are on discovering novel inhibitors for the virus. The entry of a SARS-CoV-2 virus particle into a host cell is initiated by its spike glycoprotein and host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor interaction. Spike glycoprotein domains, namely, the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Heptad Repeat (HR) domains, are essential for this activity. We have studied the impact of mutations such as A348T, N354D, D364Y, G476S, V483A, S494D in the RBD (319-591), and S939F, S940T, T941A, S943P (912-984) in the HR1 domains of spike glycoprotein. Summarily, we utilized the computational screening algorithms to rank the deleterious, damaging and disease-associated spike glycoprotein mutations. Subsequently, to understand the changes in conformation, flexibility and function of the spike glycoprotein mutants, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. The computational predictions and analysis of the MD trajectories suggest that the RBD and HR1 mutations induce significant phenotypic effects on the pre-binding spike glycoprotein structure, which are presumably consequential to its binding to the receptor and provides lead to design inhibitors against the binding.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

By revealing major topics, this study proposes a text-mining approach as an alternative to navigating large volumes of COVID-19 literature. Materials and methods We obtained 85,268 references from the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio as of November 21. After the exclusion based on inadequate abstracts, 65,262 articles remained in the final corpus. We utilized natural language processing to curate and generate the term list. We applied topic modeling analyses and multiple correspondence analyses to reveal the major topics and the associations among topics, journal countries, and publication sources. Results In our text mining analyses of NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio, we discovered two sets of eleven major research topics by analyzing abstracts and titles of the articles separately. The eleven major areas of COVID-19 research based on abstracts included the following topics: 1) Public Health, 2) Patient Care & Outcomes, 3) Epidemiologic Modeling, 4) Diagnosis and Complications, 5) Mechanism of Disease, 6) Health System Response, 7) Pandemic Control, 8) Protection/Prevention, 9) Mental/Behavioral Health, 10) Detection/Testing, 11) Treatment Options. Further analyses revealed that five (2,3,4,5, and 9) of the eleven abstract-based topics showed a significant correlation (ranked from moderate to weak) with title-based topics. Conclusion By offering up the more dynamic, scalable, and responsive categorization of published literature, our study provides valuable insights to the stakeholders of COVID-19 research, particularly clinicians.","Zengul, Ferhat D.; Zengul, Ayse G.; Mugavero, Michael Oner Nurettin Ozaydin Bunyamin Delen Dursun Willig James H.; Kennedy, Kierstin C.; Cimino, James",Intelligence-Based Medicine,243,32

While conventional therapeutics often involve administering small molecules to fight viral infections, small non-coding RNA sequences, known as microRNAs (miRNAs/miR-), may present a novel antiviral strategy. We can take advantage of their ability to modulate host-virus interactions through mediating RNA degradation or translational inhibition. Investigations into miRNA and SARS-CoV-2 interactions can reveal novel therapeutic approaches against this virus. The viral genomes of SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were searched using the Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) for highly similar sequences, to identify potential binding sites for miRNAs hypothesized to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. miRNAs that target angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV for host cell entry, were also predicted. Several relevant miRNAs were identified, and their potential roles in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infections were further assessed. Current treatment options for SARS-CoV-2 are limited and have not generated sufficient evidence on safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19. Therefore, by investigating the interactions between miRNAs and SARS-CoV-2, miRNA-based antiviral therapies, including miRNA mimics and inhibitors, may be developed as an alternative strategy to fight COVID-19.","Hum, Christine; Loiselle, Julia; Ahmed, Nadine; Shaw, Tyler A; Toudic, Caroline; Pezacki, John Paul",Drugs,243,22

However, there have been striking differences in the number of infected individuals and deaths in different countries. Particularly, within Central Europe in countries that are similar in ethnicity, age, and medical standards and have performed similar steps of containment, such differences in mortality rates remain inexplicable. We suggest to consider and explore environmental factors to explain these intriguing variations. Countries like Northern Italy, France, Spain, and UK have suffered from 5 times more deaths from the corona virus infection than neighboring countries like Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and Denmark related to the size of their respective populations. There is a striking correlation between the level of environmental pollutants including pesticides, dioxins, and air pollution such as NO2 known to affect immune function and healthy metabolism with the rate of mortality in COVID-19 pandemic in these European countries. There is also a correlation with the use of chlorination of drinking water in these regions. In addition to the improvement of environmental protective programs, there are possibilities to lower the blood levels of these pollutants by therapeutic apheresis. Furthermore, therapeutic apheresis might be an effective method to improve metabolic inflammation, altered vascular perfusion, and neurodegeneration observed as long-term complications of COVID-19 disease.","Bornstein, Stefan R; Voit-Bak, Karin; Schmidt, Dieter; Morawietz, Henning; Bornstein, Alexander Benjamin; Balanzew, Waldimir; Julius, Ulrich; Rodionov, Roman N; Biener, Anne Maria; Wang, Jun; Schulte, Klaus-Martin; Krebs, Peter; Vollmer, Günter; Straube, R",Horm Metab Res,243,24

However, bacterial coinfection is considered relatively infrequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the co-prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae is low. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients subsequently admitted to AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020, with documented SARS-CoV-2 and S. pneumoniae coinfection. RESULTS We identified 11 patients with S. pneumoniae coinfection. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 74-82 years), 45.5% (5/11) were males, 54.5% (6/11) were white, and 90.9% (10/11) were long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. The median length of stay was 7 days (IQR, 6-8 days). Among 11 patients, 4 were discharged in stable condition and 7 had died, resulting in an inpatient mortality rate of 64%. CONCLUSIONS At our center, 11 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection while in hospital. All patients had pneumonia confirmed on imaging and a nonspecific increase in markers of inflammation. The in-hospital mortality rate of 64% (7 patients) was higher in this group than in previous reports.

Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in people’s way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to people’s basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia. Significant social effort is needed to overcome such ill-defined anxiety and fear and maintain a healthy civil society.","Kang, Myounggu; Choi, Yeol; Kim, Jeongseob; Lee, Kwan Ok; Lee, Sugie; Park, In Kwon; Park, Jiyoung; Seo, Ilwon",Int.

The newly discovered coronavirus, entitled SARS-CoV-2, is the seventh member of the human coronaviruses. The main pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, accompanied by glass turbidity, and acute cardiac injury. It possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which is 60-140 nm in diameter, and has a size of 26-32 kbp. Viral pathogenesis is accomplished with spike glycoprotein through the employment of a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, called the ACE2, as its primary cell receptor. It has been confirmed that various factors such as different national rules for quarantine and various races or genetic backgrounds might influence the mortality and infection rate of COVID-19 in the geographic areas. In addition to various known and unknown factors and host genetic susceptibility, mutations and genetic variabilities of the virus itself have a critical impact on variable clinical features of COVID-19. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more stable than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, it has a relatively high dynamic mutation rate with respect to other RNA viruses. It's noteworthy that, some mutations can be founder mutations and show specific geographic patterns. Undoubtedly, these mutations can drive viral genetic variability, and because of genotype-phenotype correlation, resulting in a virus with more/lower/no decrease in natural pathogenic fitness or on the other scenario, facilitating their rapid antigenic shifting to escape the host immunity and also inventing a drug resistance virus, so converting it to a more infectious or deadly virus. Overall, the detection of all mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their relations with pathological changes is nearly impossible, mostly due to asymptomatic subjects. In this review paper, the reported mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and related variations in virus structure and pathogenicity in different geographic areas and genotypes are widely investigated. Many studies need to be repeated in other regions/locations for other people to confirm the findings. Such studies could benefit patient-specific therapy, according to genotyping patterns of SARS-CoV-2 distribution.","Bakhshandeh, Behnaz; Jahanafrooz, Zohreh; Abbasi, Ardeshir; Goli, Matin Babaee; Sadeghi, Mahya; Mottaqi, Mohammad Sadeq; Zamani, Maryam",Microb Pathog,243,20

The Apple Watch can detect falls and alert caregivers and clinicians that help is needed; the device could also be used to objectively collect data on gait, fitness, and falls as part of clinical trials. However, little is known about the ease of use of this technology among older adult ED patients, a population at high risk of recurrent falls. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study-the Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II-is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch Series 4 paired with the iPhone and our research app Rhode Island FitTest (RIFitTest) among older adult ED patients seeking care for falls. METHODS: We will conduct field-testing with older adult ED patients (n=25) who sustained a fall and their caregivers (n=5) to determine whether they can use the Apple Watch, iPhone, and app either (1) continuously or (2) periodically, with or without telephone assistance from the research staff, to assess gait, fitness, and/or falls over time. During the initial encounter, participants will receive training in the Apple Watch, iPhone, and our research app. They will receive an illustrated training manual and a number to call if they have questions about the research protocol or device usage. Participants will complete surveys and cognitive and motor assessments on the app during the study period.

RESULTS: Recruitment began in December 2019 and was on pause from April 2020 until September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Study recruitment will continue until 30 participants are enrolled. This study has been approved by the Rhode Island Hospital Institutional Review Board (approval 1400781-16). CONCLUSIONS: GAPcare II will provide insights into the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch, iPhone, and the RIFitTest app in the population most likely to benefit from the technology: older adults at high risk of recurrent falls. In the future, wearables could be used as part of fall prevention interventions to prevent injury before it occurs.

We aimed to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence system using chest x-rays and clinical data to predict disease severity and progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a retrospective study in multiple hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia, PA, USA, and Brown University affiliated hospitals in Providence, RI, USA. Patients who presented to a hospital in the University of Pennsylvania Health System via the emergency department, with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and with an available chest x-ray from their initial presentation or admission, were retrospectively identified and randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets (7:1:2). Using the chest x-rays as input to an EfficientNet deep neural network and clinical data, models were trained to predict the binary outcome of disease severity (ie, critical or non-critical). The deep-learning features extracted from the model and clinical data were used to build time-to-event models to predict the risk of disease progression. The models were externally tested on patients who presented to an independent multicentre institution, Brown University affiliated hospitals, and compared with severity scores provided by radiologists. FINDINGS: 1834 patients who presented via the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 9 and July 20, 2020, were identified and assigned to the model training (n=1285), validation (n=183), or testing (n=366) sets. 475 patients who presented via the Brown University affiliated hospitals between March 1 and July 18, 2020, were identified for external testing of the models. When chest x-rays were added to clinical data for severity prediction, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) increased from 0·821 (95% CI 0·796-0·828) to 0·846 (0·815-0·852; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·731 (0·712-0·738) to 0·792 (0·780-0 ·803; p<0·0001) on external testing. When deep-learning features were added to clinical data for progression prediction, the concordance index (C-index) increased from 0·769 (0·755-0·786) to 0·805 (0·800-0·820; p<0·0001) on internal testing and 0·707 (0·695-0·729) to 0·752 (0·739-0·764; p<0·0001) on external testing. The image and clinical data combined model had significantly better prognostic performance than combined severity scores and clinical data on internal testing (C-index 0·805 vs 0·781; p=0·0002) and external testing (C-index 0·752 vs 0·715; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19, artificial intelligence based on chest x-rays had better prognostic performance than clinical data or radiologist-derived severity scores. Using artificial intelligence, chest x-rays can augment clinical data in predicting the risk of progression to critical illness in patients with COVID-19.

We designed and administered a global survey to examine the effects of COVID-19 on vascular surgeons and explore the COVID-19-related stressors faced, coping strategies used, and support structures available. METHODS: The Pandemic Practice, Anxiety, Coping, and Support Survey for Vascular Surgeons was an anonymous cross-sectional survey sponsored by the Society for Vascular Surgery Wellness Task Force. The survey analysis evaluated the effects of COVID-19-related stressors on vascular surgeons measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale. The 28-item Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory was used to assess the active and avoidant coping strategies. Survey data were collected using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) from April 14, 2020 to April 24, 2020 inclusive. Additional qualitative data were collected using open-ended questions. Univariable and multivariable analyses of the factors associated with the anxiety levels and qualitative analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1609 survey responses (70.5% male; 82.5% vascular surgeons in practice) from 58 countries (43.4% from United States; 43.4% from Brazil) were eligible for analysis. Some degree of anxiety was reported by 54.5% of the respondents, and 23.3% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Most respondents (â¼60%) reported using active coping strategies and the avoidant coping strategy of ""self-distraction,"" and 20% used other avoidant coping strategies. Multivariable analysis identified the following factors as significantly associated with increased self-reported anxiety levels: staying in a separate room at home or staying at the hospital or a hotel after work (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.79), donning and doffing personal protective equipment (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.41-2.33), worry about potential adverse patient outcomes due to care delay (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16-1.87), and financial concerns (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.49-2.42). The factors significantly associated with decreased self-reported anxiety levels were hospital support (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.91) and the use of positive reframing as an active coping strategy (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgeons globally have been experiencing multiple COVID-19-related stressors during this devastating crisis. These findings have highlighted the continued need for hospital systems to support their vascular surgeons and the importance of national societies to continue to invest in peer-support programs as paramount to promoting the well-being of vascular surgeons during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shalhub, Sherene; Mouawad, Nicolas J; Malgor, Rafael D; Johnson, Adam P; Wohlauer, Max V; Coogan, Sheila M; Loveland, Katherine A; Cuff, Robert F; Leonardi, Claudia; Coleman, Dawn M; Sheahan, Malachi G; Woo, Karen",J. vasc. surg,243,11

Many pathogens, viral and non-viral, can elicit these pathologies, which justifies reconsidering whether the target of therapeutic approaches to fight pathogen infections should be (a) the pathogen itself, (b) the pathologies elicited by the pathogen interaction with the human host, or (c) a combination of both. While little is known about the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2, it is well-established that the above-mentioned pathologies are associated with hyper-inflammation, tissue damage, and the perturbation of target organ metabolism. Mounting evidence has shown that these processes are regulated by endoproteinases (particularly, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)). Here, we review what is known about the roles played by MMPs in the development of COVID-19 and postulate a mechanism by which MMPs could influence energy metabolism in target organs, such as the lung. Finally, we discuss the suitability of MMPs as therapeutic targets to increase the metabolic tolerance of the host to damage inflicted by the pathogen infection, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2.","Hardy, Eugenio; Fernandez-Patron, Carlos",Biomolecules,243,0

However, the role of surface transmission is still debated. The present systematic review aims to summarize all the evidence on surface survival of coronaviruses infecting humans. The analysis of 18 studies showed the longest coronavirus survival time is 28 days at room temperature (RT) on different surfaces: polymer banknotes, vinyl, steel, glass, and paper banknotes. Concerning SARS-CoV-2 human infection from contaminated surfaces, dangerous viral load on surfaces for up to 21 days was determined on polymer banknotes, steel, glass and paper banknotes. For viruses other than SARS-CoV-2, the longest period of survival was 14 days, recorded on glass. Environmental conditions can affect virus survival, and indeed, low temperatures and low humidity support prolonged survival of viruses on contaminated surfaces independently of surface type. Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure to sunlight significantly reduces the risk of surface transmission. Although studies are increasingly investigating the topic of coronavirus survival, it is difficult to compare them, given the methodology differences. For this reason, it is advisable to define a reference working protocol for virus survival trials, but, as an immediate measure, there is also a need for further investigations of coronavirus survival on surfaces.","Marzoli, Filippo; Bortolami, Alessio; Pezzuto, Alessandra; Mazzetto, Eva; Piro, Roberto; Terregino, Calogero; Bonfante, Francesco; Belluco, Simone",Sci Total Environ,243,29

In this study, we investigated the risk factors for the anxiety in the otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province under the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: The otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei Province were surveyed using an online questionnaire in which anxiety was measured against the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the risk factors of anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 449 otolaryngology healthcare workers participated in the study. Of all the participants, 131 (29.18%) had anxiety symptoms. Compared with doctors, nurses were at a higher risk for anxiety (OR = 2.162, 95% CI 1.311-3.566). Participants who often suspected self-infection (OR = 4.239, 95% CI 1.647-10.909) or family member infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (OR = 4.485, 95% CI 1.511-13.313) were more likely to develop anxiety than those who never. The subjects who had colleagues diagnosed with COVID-19 were more vulnerable to anxiety (OR = 2.014, 95% CI 1.205-3.366). Respondents working in infectious isolation wards had a 3.522-fold increased risk of anxiety compared to those on leave (OR = 3.522, 95% CI 1.634-7.593). CONCLUSION: Some otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province experienced anxiety during the epidemic, but most of them did not receive treatment. The healthcare providers themselves should be informed about and aware of their own mental health, and should be given support as appropriate.

Social capital and a sense of social cohesion are known to have roles in buffering against the effects of adverse life circumstances. Our study sought to investigate the association of a range of social attitudes and activities - as proxies for social capital - with loneliness while taking into account socio-demographic factors. We undertook a national survey on a stratified random sample of the New Zealand (NZ) adult population aged 18+ in 2017 (n = 1,358), data from which included the requisite variables. The prevalence of loneliness was highest in young adults (18-30), falling with age until a slight rise in older people (76+). Loneliness was associated with socio-demographic factors, being more prevalent in the more disadvantaged groups: the deprived, Maori (the indigenous people of NZ), the non-partnered, and the less educated. Controlling for these socio-demographic factors, pro-social attitudes (that is towards political efficacy, trust in others, not feeling exploited, or being committed to family) and participation in social activities (that is being employed or being involved in recreation groups) - were protective against loneliness. Our study supports asset-based approaches to tackling loneliness - with implications for health and social care - that emphasise mobilising existing social resources, building social capital, and raising social cohesion in our communities. Such intervention on loneliness would help to prevent and ameliorate its detrimental consequences for public health.","Lay-Yee, Roy; Campbell, David; Milne, Barry",Heal. soc. care community,243,1

This retrospective cohort study included 258 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward at Montichiari Hospital, Brescia, Italy from February 28th to April 30rd, 2020. Patients had SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia with respiratory failure, and were treated with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir plus ritonavir. In some patients, additional treatment with tocilizumab, dexamethasone and enoxaparin was adopted. Outcomes (death or recovery) were assessed at the end of the discharge period or at the end of the follow-up (August 2020). During hospitalization, 59 patients died, while 6 died after discharge. The following variables were demonstrated to be associated with a worse prognosis: Radiologic Brixia score higher than 8, presence at baseline of hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, cancer, previous treatment with ACE-inhibitors or anti-platelet drugs. Anticoagulant treatment during hospital admission with enoxaparin at a dose higher than 4000 U once daily was associated with a better prognosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that some co-morbidities and cardiovascular risk factors may affect prognosis. The radiologic Brixia score may be a useful tool to stratify the risk of death at baseline. Anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin might be associated to a clinical benefit in terms of survival in patients with COVID-19.","Boari, Gianluca E M; Chiarini, Giulia; Bonetti, Silvia; Malerba, Paolo; Bianco, Gianluca; Faustini, Cristina; Braglia-Orlandini, Federico; Turini, Daniele; Guarinoni, Vittoria; Saottini, Michele; Viola, Sara; Ferrari-Toninelli, Giulia; Pasini, Giancarlo; Mascadri, Cristina; Bonzi, Bianca; Desenzani, Paolo; Tusi, Claudia; Zanotti, Eros; Nardin, Matteo; Rizzoni, Damiano",Biosci. rep,243,29

E-visits are now reimbursable through Medicare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The state of evidence regarding e-visits, such as the impact on clinical outcomes and health care delivery, is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, we examine how e-visits have impacted clinical outcomes and health care quality, access, utilization, and costs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review; MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from January 2000 through October 2020 for peer-reviewed studies that assessed e-visits' impacts on clinical and health care delivery outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 1859 papers, 19 met the inclusion criteria. E-visit usage was associated with improved or comparable clinical outcomes, especially for chronic disease management (eg, diabetes care, blood pressure management). The impact on quality of care varied across conditions. Quality of care was equivalent or better for chronic conditions, but variable quality was observed in infection management (eg, appropriate antibiotic prescribing). Similarly, the impact on health care utilization varied across conditions (eg, lower utilization for dermatology but mixed impact in primary care). Health care costs were lower for e-visits than those for in-person visits for a wide range of conditions (eg, dermatology and acute visits). No studies examined the impact of e-visits on health care access. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions about effectiveness or impact on care delivery from the studies that were included because many used observational designs. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the evidence suggests e-visits may provide clinical outcomes that are comparable to those provided by in-person care and reduce health care costs for certain health care conditions.

The application of X-ray diffraction crystallography made available the three-dimensional structure of this protein target in complex with ligands, which paved the way for docking studies. OBJECTIVE: Our goal here is to review recent efforts in the application of docking simulations to identify inhibitors of the Mpro using the program AutoDock4. METHOD: We searched PubMed to identify studies that applied AutoDock4 for docking against this protein target. We used the structures available for Mpro to analyze intermolecular interactions and reviewed the methods used to search for inhibitors. RESULTS: The application of docking against the structures available for the Mpro found ligands with an estimated inhibition in the nanomolar range. Such computational approaches focused on the crystal structures revealed potential inhibitors of Mpro that might exhibit pharmacological activity against SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, most of these studies lack the proper validation of the docking protocol. Also, they all ignored the potential use of machine learning to predict affinity. CONCLUSION: The combination of structural data with computational approaches opened the possibility to accelerate the search for drugs to treat COVID-19. Several studies used AutoDock4 to search for inhibitors of Mpro. Most of them did not employ a validated docking protocol, which lends support to critics of their computational methodology. Furthermore, one of these studies reported the binding of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to Mpro. This study ignores the scientific evidence against the use of these antimalarial drugs to treat COVID-19.","de Azevedo Junior, Walter Filgueira; Bitencourt-Ferreira, Gabriela; Godoy, Joana Retzke; Adriano, Hilda Mayela Aran; Dos Santos Bezerra, Wallyson André; Dos Santos Soares, Alexandra Martins",Curr. med. chem,243,1

Specifically, construction needs to be constantly aware of safety and risk balanced with timely project delivery. Guidance for COVID-19 must therefore be implemented in a way that reflects working practice and pressures. There is, however, a potential knowledge gap regarding the practical feasibility and impact of applying COVID-19 measures within construction, made more difficult by factors such as the temporary nature of projects and complex working arrangements. This article presents a commentary on safe construction during, and beyond, COVID-19, covering the human factors challenges and practicalities of implementing COVID-19 measures. We observe that while guidance is strong on risk management, understanding of how best to implement this guidance is not yet stable. Also, care must be taken that implementing guidance does not detract from general safety, which is also challenged by increased pressures on delivery arising from COVID-19. There may, however, be opportunities for safer working practice arising from new awareness of health, hygiene, and safety risk. The role of safety leadership is overlooked in guidance yet is vital to ensure safe application of COVID-19 working practices. The key message is that COVID-19 needs to be integrated and promoted within a general risk management approach, in part because this takes account of differing priorities regarding safety risks, rather than overly focussing on COVID-19, and also because the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigations can be amplified by integration with pre-existing safety processes.","Stiles, Shelly; Golightly, David; Ryan, Brendan",,243,1

METHODS: Retrospective review of DS + MMC and trabeculectomy + MMC at a single centre between February 2015 and March 2018. Patients with a minimum of 12-month follow-up were included. Post-operative follow-up: day 1, week 1, months 1/3/6/12/18/24. Primary outcomes: changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and changes in LogMAR visual acuity (BCVA) pre- and post-procedure. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: changes in number of eye drops, number of follow-up clinic visits, post-operative complications and further surgical interventions. Complete success: IOP &#8804; 21 mmHg off all IOP-lowering medications. Qualified success: IOP &#8804; 21 mmHg on medication. Failure: IOP > 21 mmHg at 24 months or &#8804; 5 mmHg on 2 consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months +/- additional incisional glaucoma surgery +/- loss of light perception. Statistical analysis performed using Microsoft Excel + SPSS. RESULTS: 90 eyes: DS + MMC = 46 eyes, Trab + MMC = 44 eyes. DS + MMC v Trab + MMC: mean pre-op IOP = 19.57 mmHg v 18.89 mmHg, significantly reduced at all post-operative time-points for both groups (p < 0.001). Mean IOP reduction from baseline = 33.94% v 38.39%; > 30% IOP reduction = 54.35% v 68.18%.

Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: The research team used social media, relevant organizations, and neighborhood groups to distribute the survey link in May and June of 2020. Subjects: A convenience sample of parents of children aged 5-12. Measures: Survey to assess parental perceptions of changes in children's physical activity before and during stay-at-home orders, and environmental and social barriers to physical activity. Analysis: Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, and multinomial-logistic regression models with covariates of environmental factors, social factors, and frequency of factors as barriers on association with perceived physical activity change. Results: Data from 245 parents were analyzed. A majority (63.7%) of parents reported a decrease in children's physical activity during stay-at-home orders. More parents indicated social barriers (e.g., lack of access to playmates) than environmental barriers (e.g., lack of access to neighborhood play spaces) to children's physical activity. In multivariate analyses, the odds of parents reporting decreased physical activity was greater for those reporting lack of playmates (OR = 4.72; 95% CI: 1.99-11.17) and lack of adult supervision (OR = 11.82; 95% CI: 2.48-56.28) as barriers. No environmental barriers were significantly associated with decreased children's physical activity. Conclusion: The unique aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic provide a natural experiment for developing social and environmental strategies to improve children's overall physical activity. Assessing parental perceptions is a way to inform these future efforts.","Eyler, Amy A; Schmidt, Laurel; Kepper, Maura; Mazzucca, Stephanie; Gilbert, Amanda; Beck, Alan",Front Public Health,243,16

Medical practitioners working in hospitals at the epicenters of COVID-19 pandemic have emphasized on the need to manage mildly ill and convalescent COVID-19 patients at home or community facilities rather than at hospitals during a pandemic. In this article, we highlight that a standardized home- and community-based (HCBC) approach for management of COVID-19 patients will be a key component for preparing hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for a potential surge in COVID-19 cases. So far, based on the trajectory of infection, we think that SSA seems to have a window of opportunity, albeit narrowing, for implementing HCBC. However, there are challenges that will need to be addressed in order to implement and maintain HCBC. Successful implementation and maintenance of HCBC in SSA will require international agencies and key donors to work closely with the national governments; providing them with policy, technical, and financial assistance. Home- and community-based care (HCBC) is also important because it can play a role in advocacy, education, training, and health promotion during COVID-19 pandemic. We further underscore the need for a delicate balance between HCBC and hospital-based care (HBC) approach as well as with COVID-19 mitigation and suppression measures in order to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission and allow optimal continuity of the HBC. We conclude by emphasizing once again that, for countries in SSA to adequately prepare for the worst-case scenario of COVID-19 pandemic in the absence of a cure, policy makers of member states need to act collectively and fast.","Onywera, Harris; Mwapagha, Lamech Malagho; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan",Pan Afr Med J,243,1

Selenium, as one of the important micronutrients implicated in viral infections, was suggested to play roles. METHODS: An ecological study was performed to assess the association between the COVID-19 related fatality and the selenium content both from crops and topsoil, in China. RESULTS: Totally, 14,045 COVID-19 cases were reported from 147 cities during 8 December 2019-13 December 2020 were included. Based on selenium content in crops, the case fatality rates (CFRs) gradually increased from 1.17% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.28% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 3.16% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P = 0.002). Based on selenium content in topsoil, the CFRs gradually increased from 0.76% in non-selenium-deficient areas, to 1.70% in moderate-selenium-deficient areas, and further to 1.85% in severe-selenium-deficient areas (P < 0.001). The zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed a significantly higher fatality risk in cities with severe-selenium-deficient selenium content in crops than non-selenium-deficient cities, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 3.88 (95% CIs: 1.21-12.52), which was further confirmed by regression fitting the association between CFR of COVID-19 and selenium content in topsoil, with the IRR of 2.38 (95% CIs: 1.14-4.98) for moderate-selenium-deficient cities and 3.06 (1.49-6.27) for severe-selenium-deficient cities. CONCLUSIONS: Regional selenium deficiency might be related to an increased CFR of COVID-19.

Living in rural areas may be associated with poor KAP towards COVID-19. This study compares the KAP regarding COVID-19 of people living in rural and urban areas in Cameroon. Methods: this was a comparative cross-sectional study, using data obtained through an online survey of 1,345 Cameroonians amongst which were 828 urban and 517 rural dwellers. The survey questionnaire consisted of; demographic characteristics, 10 questions on Knowledge, 4 on attitudes and 3 on practices. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. Results: overall, about two-thirds of participants had correct knowledge of COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for urban dwellers was about twice that of rural dwellers (15.77 ± 5.25 vs 8.86 ± 7.24 respectively, p < 0.001). Furthermore, when compared to people who live in urban areas, rural inhabitants are less optimistic about COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon (OR = 3.43, P<0.001), less likely to accept a trial vaccine for COVID-19 (OR = 1.14, P<0.05), less likely to avoid going to crowded places (OR = 7.42, P<0.01), less likely to wear face mask outdoor (OR = 11.84, P<0,001), and less likely to practice hand hygiene (OR = 1.13, P<0.05). Conclusion: our findings suggest a big gap in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and practices between rural and urban inhabitants in Cameroon. This highlights the need for increase sensitization of Cameroonians, especially rural dwellers on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes and appropriate practices.","Njingu, Atabong Emmanuel; Jabbossung, Fombo Enjeh; Ndip-Agbor, Tambe Emilia; Dedino, Ankwatia Guisilla",Pan Afr Med J,243,13

However, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been examined among minorities in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, explores stress among the Arab minority in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its association with the population's perceived COVID-19 threat, trust in the healthcare system, adherence to preventative guidelines, and perceived discrimination.The study analyzed a cross-sectional online survey of 626 Israeli Arabs. Most participants (65%) reported moderate levels of stress, and 10% reported severe levels. The Bedouin population reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other minority groups. The participants also reported a high degree of perceived threat, a moderate-to-high level of discrimination, a moderate level of trust in the healthcare system, and very high adherence to guidelines.Hierarchical regression analysis showed that age, religion, trust in the healthcare system, perceived threat, and adherence to guidelines were all significant predictors of stress [F(11,600), p < .001]. The model explained 24% of the variance in stress. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the participants' perceived threat and trust mediated the association between their perceived discrimination and stress [indirect effect = 0.13, SE = 0.03 CI = (0.08, 0.18)], whereby discrimination was negatively associated with trust (ß = -0.52), which, in turn, was negatively associated with stress (ß = -0.10). Furthermore, discrimination was positively associated with perceived threat (ß = 0.21), which, in turn, was positively associated with stress (ß = 0.35). Discrimination is an important social determinant of health - especially during health emergencies when trust in healthcare systems and perceived threats are crucial. As such, our findings could assist policymakers in developing fair policies that are tailored to various population groups and that may reduce stress levels among minorities, thereby improving both their mental and physical health.","Satran, Carmit; Ali-Saleh, Ola; Mashiach-Eizenberg, Michal; Bord, Shiran",Ethn Health,243,20

OBJECTIVE: To assess the methodological quality and variability in implementation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for treating COVID-19, and to analyze the support that should be provided to improve data collected during an urgent pandemic situation. SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP, and the preprint repositories including Social Science Research Network and MedRxiv were systematically searched, up to September 30, 2020, using the keywords ""coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"" ""2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"" ""severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2),"" ""novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP),"" ""randomized controlled trial (RCT)"" and ""random."" INCLUSION CRITERIA: RCTs studying the treatment of COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of published RCTs for inclusion and data extraction were each conducted by two researchers. Analysis of general information on COVID-19 RCTs was done using descriptive statistics. Methodological quality was assessed using the risk-of-bias tools in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Version 5.1.0). Variability in implementation was assessed by comparing consistency between RCT reports and registration information. RESULTS: A total of 5886 COVID-19 RCTs were identified. Eighty-one RCTs were finally included, of which, 45 had registration information. Methodological quality of the RTCs was not optimal due to deficiencies in five main domains: allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting. Comparisons of consistency between published protocols and registration information showed that the 45 RCTs with registration information had common deviations in seven items: inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, outcomes, research sites of recruitment, interventions, and blinding. CONCLUSION: The methodological quality of COVID-19 RCTs conducted in early to mid 2020 was consistently low and variability in implementation was common. More support for implementing high-quality methodology is needed to obtain the quality of therapeutic evidence needed to provide positive guidance for clinical care. We make an urgent appeal for accelerating the construction of a collaborative sharing platform and preparing multidisciplinary talent and professional teams to conduct excellent clinical research when faced with epidemic diseases of the future. Further, variability in RCT implementation should be clearly reported and interpreted to improve the utility of data resulting from those trials.","Zhao, Meng-Zhu; Zhao, Chen; Tu, Shuang-Shuang; Wei, Xu-Xu; Shang, Hong-Cai",J Integr Med,243,8

OBJECTIVES: To describe the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on respiratory mechanics in C-ARDS patients in supine and prone position, and as compared to NC-ARDS. The primary endpoint was the best PEEP defined as the smallest sum of hyperdistension and collapse. METHODS: Seventeen patients with moderate-to-severe C-ARDS were monitored by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and evaluated during PEEP titration in supine (n = 17) and prone (n = 14) position and compared with 13 NC-ARDS patients investigated by EIT in our department before the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: As compared with NC-ARDS, C-ARDS exhibited a higher median best PEEP (defined using EIT as the smallest sum of hyperdistension and collapse, 12 [9, 12] vs. 9 [6, 9] cmH2O, p < 0.01), more collapse at low PEEP, and less hyperdistension at high PEEP. The median value of the best PEEP was similar in C-ARDS in supine and prone position: 12 [9, 12] vs. 12 [10, 15] cmH2O, p = 0.59. The response to PEEP was also similar in C-ARDS patients with higher vs. lower respiratory system compliance. CONCLUSION: An intermediate PEEP level seems appropriate in half of our C-ARDS patients. There is no solid evidence that compliance at low PEEP could predict the response to PEEP.","Perier, François; Tuffet, Samuel; Maraffi, Tommaso; Alcala, Glasiele; Victor, Marcus; Haudebourg, Anne-Fleur; Razazi, Keyvan; De Prost, Nicolas; Amato, Marcelo; Carteaux, Guillaume; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",Crit Care,243,16

Under such circumstance pregnant women are also affected significantly. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to observe the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women who have been confirmed with COVID-19. METHODS: The research objects were 55 cases of suspected COVID-19 pregnant women who gave a birth from Jan 20th 2020 to Mar 5th 2020 in our hospital-a big birth center delivering about 30,000 babies in the last 3 years. These cases were subjected to pulmonary CT scan and routine blood test, manifested symptoms of fever, cough, chest tightness or gastrointestinal symptoms. They were admitted to an isolated suite, with clinical features and newborn babies being carefully observed. Among the 55 cases, 13 patients were assigned into the confirmed COVID-19 group for being tested positive sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) via maternal throat swab test, and the other 42 patients were assigned into the control group for being ruled out COVID-19 pneumonia based on new coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control program(the 7th edition). RESULTS: There were 2 fever patients during the prenatal period and 8 fever patients during the postpartum period in the confirmed COVID-19 group. In contrast, there were 11 prenatal fever patients and 20 postpartum fever patients in the control group (p>0.05). Among 55 cases, only 2 case had cough in the confirmed group. The imaging of pulmonary CT scan showed ground- glass opacity (46.2%, 6/13), patch-like shadows(38.5%, 5/13), fiber shadow(23.1%, 3/13), pleural effusion (38.5%, 5/13)and pleural thickening(7.7%, 1/13), and there was no statistical difference between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group (p>0.05). During the prenatal and postpartum period, there was no difference in the count of WBC, Neutrophils and Lymphocyte, the radio of Neutrophils and Lymphocyte and the level of CRP between the confirmed COVID-19 group and the control group(p<0.05). 20 babies (from confirmed mother and from normal mother) were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 examination by throat swab samples in 24 h after birth and no case was tested positive. CONCLUSION: The clinical symptoms and laboratory indicators are not obvious for asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 pregnant women. Pulmonary CT scan plus blood routine examination are more suitable for finding pregnancy women with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 infection, and can be used screening COVID-19 pregnant women in the outbreak area of COVID-19 infection.","Yang, Hui; Sun, Guoqiang; Tang, Fei; Peng, Min; Gao, Ying; Peng, Jing; Xie, Hui; Zhao, Yun; Jin, Zhichun",J Infect,243,10

METHODS: As part of a larger, chronic disease-focused, and ongoing longitudinal study designed to explore Ontario adults' health and wellness-related behaviors during the pandemic, participants completed an online survey that included demographic information and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI consists of 19 items, one of which is open-ended, designed to assess an individual's quantity, quality, and patterns of sleep on seven domains (ie, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month). Summative content analysis was used to analyze responses to the open-ended question regarding participants' sleep disturbances. RESULTS: This study included 2192 individuals, 85% of whom slept 6+ hours/night. The mean global PSQI score was 7.57, out of a possible 21 (SD = 4.09). The self-reported sleep disturbances of largest concern were: (1) general fear/anxiety/worry (n = 203); (2) children (n = 167); (3) mind wandering/overthinking (n = 118); (4) pain/injury (n = 78); (5) partner (n = 78); and (6) fear/anxiety/stress related to COVID-19 (n = 74). CONCLUSION: The global PSQI score was indicative of poor sleep quality, and Ontario adults experienced a number of sleep disturbances during early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are noteworthy as sleep is a crucial component in positive health and wellbeing.","Shillington, Katie J; Vanderloo, Leigh M; Burke, Shauna M; Ng, Victor; Tucker, Patricia; Irwin, Jennifer D",Sleep medicine,243,13

The interaction between COVID-19 and the drop in economic activity will lead to increased food insecurity within and across countries. Higher food insecurity may act as a multiplier for the epidemic due to its negative health effects and increased migration. Research has shown that food insecurity affects within-country and cross-border migration. Besides the mean prevalence rate, the distribution of food insecurity affects the migration decision. The impacts of COVID-19 are particularly strong for people in the lower tail of the food-insecurity distribution. In the current context, the effect of food insecurity therefore could be increased migration, including both rural-urban migration and international migration. Importantly, the crisis might lead to a structural break in migration patterns. People might avoid heavily affected COVID-19 destination countries (e.g., United States, Italy, or Spain) and move to other countries. Due to the persistent nature of migration flows, this could have long-lasting effects.","Smith, Michael D; Wesselbaum, Dennis",J Nutr,243,20

Due to the rampant rise in the number of cases in China and globally, WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. The disease is transmitted via respiratory droplets of infected patients during coughing or sneezing and affects primarily the lung parenchyma. The spectrum of clinical manifestations can be seen in COVID-19 patients ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease resulting in mortality. Although respiratory involvement is most common in COVID-19 patients, the virus can affect other organ systems as well. The systemic inflammation induced by the disease along with multisystem expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor which allows viral entry into cells, explains the manifestation of extra-pulmonary symptoms affecting the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, renal, musculoskeletal, and endocrine system. Here, we have reviewed the extensive literature available on COVID-19 about various clinical presentations based on the organ system involved as well as clinical presentation in specific population including children, pregnant women, and immunocompromised patients. We have also briefly discussed about the Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome occurring in children and adults with COVID-19. Understanding the various clinical presentations can help clinicians diagnose COVID-19 in an early stage and ensure appropriate measures to be undertaken in order to prevent further spread of the disease.","Mehta, Om Prakash; Bhandari, Parshal; Raut, Akshay; Kacimi, Salah Eddine Oussama; Huy, Nguyen Tien",Front Public Health,243,24

METHODS: Patients with post-operative neuroimaging and follow-up of at least one year were included. In EEG-fMRI responses, we defined as ""primary"" the cluster with the highest absolute t-value located in the cortex, and evaluated three levels of confidence for the results. The threshold for low confidence was t &#8805; 3.1 (pâ¯<â¯0.005); the one for medium confidence corresponded to correction for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of 0.05; and a result reached high confidence when the primary cluster was much more significant than the next highest cluster. Concordance with the resection was determined by comparison to post-operative neuroimaging. RESULTS: We evaluated 106 epilepsy surgeries in 84 patients. An increasing association between concordance and surgical outcome with higher levels of confidence was demonstrated. If the peak response was not resected, the surgical outcome was likely to be poor: for the high confidence level, no patient had a good outcome; for the medium and low levels, only 18% and 28% had a good outcome. The positive predictive value remained low for all confidence levels, indicating that removing the maximum cluster did not ensure seizure freedom. CONCLUSION: Resection of the primary EEG-fMRI cluster, especially in high confidence cases, is necessary to obtain a good outcome, but not sufficient. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provided Class II evidence that failure to resect the primary EEG-fMRI cluster is associated with poorer epilepsy surgery outcomes.","Koupparis, Andreas; von Ellenrieder, Nicolás; Khoo, Hui Ming; Zazubovits, Natalja; Nguyen, Dang Khoa; Hall, Jeffery A; Dudley, Roy W R; Dubeau, Francois; Gotman, Jean",Neurology,243,1

In light of this, using a large online sample in the United States, we examined 1) the early impact of COVID-19 on pain severity, pain interference, and chronic pain management; and 2) variables associated with perceived changes in pain severity and pain interference. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Online survey data for 1,453 adults with chronic pain were collected via Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. RESULTS: Although a large proportion of participants reported no perceived changes in their pain severity and pain interference since the outbreak, approximately 25-30% of individuals reported exacerbation in these domains. Individuals identifying as Black and of non-Hispanic origin, who experienced greater disruptions in their mood and sleep quality, were more likely to report worsened pain interference. The majority of participants reported engaging in self-management strategies as usual. However, most appointments for chronic pain treatment were either postponed or canceled, with no future session scheduled. Furthermore, a notable proportion of participants had concerns about or difficulty accessing prescription opioids due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We may expect to see a long-term exacerbation of chronic pain and related interference in functioning and chronic pain management among individuals most impacted by the pandemic. These individuals may benefit from remotely delivered intervention to effectively mitigate COVID-19-related exacerbations in chronic pain and interruptions in face-to-face treatment.","Mun, Chung Jung; Campbell, Claudia M; McGill, Lakeya S; Aaron, Rachel V",Pain Med,243,24

DESIGN: A hospital-based clinical study of plasma glucose of COVID-19 patients conducted from May 15th to June 30th, 2020 after ethical approval. MEASUREMENTS: Random blood samples at admission were collected for plasma glucose, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) after written informed consent. Plasma glucose was analyzed by automated analyzer, IL-6 by chemiluminescent immunoassay and hsCRP by immune-turbidimetric assay. RESULTS: A total of 386 patients studied (female 39.6%); 11.1% had severe disease and 4.1% expired. There were 67 (17.4%) patients with known diabetes mellitus (DM). Patients with history of DM had three times higher mortality (6/66, 9%) than those without DM (10/319, 3.1%). Patients with moderate and severe disease according to ICMR and WHO grading had higher plasma glucose than those with asymptomatic or mild disease (p<0.0001).

Mortality was lower in patients treated with tocilizumab than in controls: 16.8% versus 31.5%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.514 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.355-0.744], p < 0.001; weighted HR 0.741 (95% CI 0.619-0.887), p = 0.001. Tocilizumab treatment reduced mortality by 14.7% relative to no tocilizumab treatment [relative risk reduction (RRR) 46.7%]. We calculated a number necessary to treat of 7. Among patients treated with steroids, mortality was lower in those treated with tocilizumab than in those treated with steroids alone [10.9% versus 40.2%, HR 0.511 (95% CI 0.352-0.741), p = 0.036; weighted HR 0.6 (95% CI 0.449-0.804), p < 0.001] (interaction p = 0.094). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that survival of patients with severe COVID-19 is higher in those treated with tocilizumab than in those not treated and that tocilizumab's effect adds to that of steroids administered to non-intubated patients with COVID-19 during the first 48 h of presenting with respiratory failure despite oxygen therapy. Randomised controlled studies are needed to confirm these results.

METHODS: Rapid review of studies that reported home-based or remote administration of an exercise test in people with chronic lung disease, and studies reporting their clinimetric (measurement) properties. RESULTS: 84 studies were included. Tests used at home were the 6-minute walk test (6MWT, two studies), sit-to-stand tests (STS, five studies), Timed Up and Go (TUG, 4 studies) and step tests (two studies). Exercise tests administered remotely were the 6MWT (two studies) and step test (one study). Compared to centre-based testing the 6MWT distance was similar when performed outdoors but shorter when performed at home (two studies). The STS, TUG and step tests were feasible, reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients >0.80), valid (concurrent and known groups validity) and moderately responsive to pulmonary rehabilitation (medium effect sizes). These tests elicited less desaturation than the 6MWT, and validated methods to prescribe exercise were not reported. DISCUSSION: The STS, step and TUG tests can be performed at home, but do not accurately document desaturation with walking or allow exercise prescription. Patients at risk of desaturation should be prioritised for centre-based exercise testing when this is available.","Holland, Anne E; Malaguti, Carla; Hoffman, Mariana; Lahham, Aroub; Burge, Angela T; Dowman, Leona; May, Anthony K; Bondarenko, Janet; Graco, Marnie; Tikellis, Gabriella; Lee, Joanna Yt; Cox, Narelle S",Chron Respir Dis,243,16

The objective is to estimate the economic viability for residential customers when participating in a renewable energy community (REC), focused on PV electricity sharing. The developed simulation model considers the omission of certain electricity levies as well as the obligatory proximity constraint being linked to grid levels, thus introducing a stepwise reduction of per-unit grid charges as an incentive to keep the inner-community electricity transfer as local as possible. Results show that cost savings in residential RECs cover a broad range from 9 EUR/yr to 172 EUR/yr. The lowest savings are gained by customers without in-house PV systems, while owners of a private PV system make the most profits due to the possibility of selling as well as buying electricity within the borders of the REC. Generally, cost savings increase when the source is closer to the sink, as well as when more renewable electricity is available for inner-community electricity transfer. The presence of a commercial customer impacts savings for households insignificantly, but increases local self-consumption approximately by 10%. Despite the margin for residential participants to break even being narrow, energy community operators will have to raise a certain participation fee. Such participation fee would need to be as low as 2.5 EUR/month for customers without in-house PV systems in a purely residential REC, while other customers could still achieve a break-even when paying 5 EUR/month to 6.7 EUR/month in addition. Those results should alert policy makers to find additional support mechanisms to enhance customers’ motivations to participate if RECs are meant as a concept that should be adopted on a large scale.","Fina, Bernadette Auer Hans",Energies,243,16

However, although there is plenty of support for collaboration, we still lack clear guidelines to direct transdisciplinary stakeholder networks of academics and practitioners through collaboration processes in the living lab ecosystem. In other words, we lack answers to the question of “how to collaborate?” In the present paper we propose a conceptual framework defining relevant stages to initiate and facilitate transdisciplinary collaboration processes. We base our framework on collaboration challenges described in the literature, specifically the need for stakeholder alignment, as well as challenges experienced in practice, which we report through exploratory case studies. In the proposed conceptual framework, we advocate the application of co-creation methods, both at the level of the living lab (macro) and in projects (meso) within the living lab, in order to define, with all involved parties and stakeholders, the scope and strategy of the living lab and to facilitate stakeholder alignment. Additionally, we integrate an iterative approach and a feedback loop in order to account for the dynamic nature of the collaboration process and to enable reflection and evaluation.","Kalinauskaite, Indre Brankaert Rens Lu Yuan Bekker Tilde Brombacher Aarnout Vos Steven",Sustainability,243,20

METHODOLOGY: Forty-one patients were enrolled in this study from two COVID-19 designated hospitals in Wuhan. Patients underwent chest CT scans for screening and were divided into two groups based on pneumonia-related syndromes. The clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were reviewed and compared. RESULTS: Among the sample of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester, there was no mortality or severe complications in the mothers nor newborns. Nearly 40% of the patients in the study were asymptomatic. The most common pneumonia-related symptom in symptomatic pregnant patients was cough. Asymptomatic patients had a significantly shorter duration of hospitalisation and a lower rate of positive RT-PCR testing compared with symptomatic patients. There was no statistically significant difference in antibody test results between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients during hospitalisation, while the positive rate of IgM antibody testing was significantly lower in asymptomatic patients during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical manifestation of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were atypical and concealed. Screening of possible COVID-19 patients should be strengthened, through serial or combined testing of laboratory testing or radiological testing, before pregnant women are admitted to hospital.","Luo, Qingqing; Yao, Dujuan; Xia, Lin; Cheng, Yanxiang; Chen, Hui",J Infect Dev Ctries,243,1

The 380 kDa virus has been a perfect storm, especially for those national health systems used to working with limited resources and high intensity rhythms, such as Italy. For the first time in the new century, a virtually unknown fast-spreading disease has caused a public health emergency thus forcing most countries to deal with an insurmountable logistic gap. Hence, every branch of Medicine, even though not directly involved in the treatment, has been called upon to provide its contribution to resolve the crisis. It is now becoming more apparent that Covid-19 is not solely a lung disease, but a complex systemic disease involving several organs and systems. This is due to an abnormal inflammatory response which eventually leads to multisystemic coagulopathy which mainly, but not uniquely, targets the lungs. Although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still not fully understood, macrophages and their immune complex system seem to play a key role. It is not yet clear why some patients develop the violent immune response which results in pneumonitis while others do not. There are clues indicating that the systemic hyper-inflammation defined as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), or cytokine storm, requires an increase in choline consumption to synthesize phosphatidylcholine and stimulate phagocytosis, organelle biogenesis, secretory functions, and endocytosis. 18F-Fluorocholine is a synthetic analog of the naturally occurring choline normally used for PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer patients. 18F-Fluorocholine could image and quantify the macrophage activity in pulmonary interstitial infiltrates of Covid-19 pneumonia. If the hypothesis is confirmed experimentally, 18F-Fluorocholine PET/CT could be used to in vivo image and quantify the degree of lung inflammation and potentially stratify the gravity of this disease.","Savelli, G; Bonacina, M; Rizzo, A; Zaniboni, A",Med Hypotheses,243,29

All 41 Italian transplant centers were invited to express their opinion in the Delphi rounds along with a group of seven experts. The survey revealed that, starting from March 2020, there was a decline in kidney transplantation activity in Italy, especially for living-related transplants. Overall, 60 recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV2 infection, 57 required hospitalization, 17 were admitted to the ICU, and 11 died. The online consensus had high response rates at each round (95.8%, 95.8%, and 89.5%, respectively). Eventually, 27 of 31 proposed statements were approved (87.1%), 12 at the first or second round (38.7%), and 3 at the third (9.7%).

Here, we study a semi-analytical model and identify two tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spread: (1) the behavior-driven reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the hidden chains becomes too large to be compensated by the TTI capabilities, and (2) the number of new infections exceeds the tracing capacity. Both trigger a self-accelerating spread. We investigate how these tipping points depend on challenges like limited cooperation, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation. Our results suggest that TTI alone is insufficient to contain an otherwise unhindered spread of SARS-CoV-2, implying that complementary measures like social distancing and improved hygiene remain necessary.","Contreras, Sebastian; Dehning, Jonas; Loidolt, Matthias; Zierenberg, Johannes; Spitzner, F Paul; Urrea-Quintero, Jorge H; Mohr, Sebastian B; Wilczek, Michael; Wibral, Michael; Priesemann, Viola",Nat Commun,243,1

We therefore sought to identify novel mechanisms of interaction by identifying genes with altered expression in SARS-CoV-$2$ infection that are relevant to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Some recent research shows the SARS-CoV-$2$ uses the angiotensin converting enzyme-$2$ (ACE-$2$) as a receptor to infect human susceptible cells. The ACE2 gene is expressed in many human tissues, including intestine, testis, kidneys, heart and lungs. ACE2 usually converts Angiotensin I in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to Angiotensin II, which affects blood pressure levels. ACE inhibitors prescribed for cardiovascular disease and hypertension may increase the levels of ACE-$2$, although there are claims that such medications actually reduce lung injury caused by COVID-$19$. We employed bioinformatics and systematic approaches to identify such genetic links, using messenger RNA data peripheral blood cells from COVID-$19$ patients and compared them with blood samples from patients with either chronic heart failure disease or hypertensive diseases. We have also considered the immune response genes with elevated expression in COVID-$19$ to those active in cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to COVID-$19$ and chronic heart failure, and common to COVID-$19$ and hypertension, were identified; the involvement of these common genes in the signalling pathways and ontologies studied. COVID-$19$ does not share a large number of differentially expressed genes with the conditions under consideration. However, those that were identified included genes playing roles in T cell functions, toll-like receptor pathways, cytokines, chemokines, cell stress, type 2 diabetes and gastric cancer. We also identified protein-protein interactions, gene regulatory networks and suggested drug and chemical compound interactions using the differentially expressed genes. The result of this study may help in identifying significant targets of treatment that can combat the ongoing pandemic due to SARS-CoV-$2$ infection.","Nashiry, Asif; Sarmin Sumi, Shauli; Islam, Salequl; Quinn, Julian M W; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Brief. bioinform,243,23

PPE must be available, safe, and effective. There is increasing evidence that the use of PPE can cause physical health problems. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to further examine PPE-related physical problems experienced by nurses as well as the role of wear time on these problems. METHODS: Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, a survey was conducted among nurses working for state or university hospitals across Turkey who actively cared for patients with COVID-19. Survey questions included demographic variables, type of PPE used, physical problems experienced, and length of time PPE was worn (4 hours or less, or more than 4 hours). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Three hundred and seven (307) nurses completed the survey. The most commonly reported problems were sweating when wearing a surgical (50.9%) or N95 (64.2%) mask, dry hands from wearing gloves (73.9%), perspiration when wearing overalls/gowns (84.1%), and vision problems when wearing goggles/face shields (47.9%). Logistic regression analysis indicated a signifcant relationship between > 4 hours length of use and the occurrence of the following: redness of the cheeks, dry mouth, redness of the nose bridge, and redness of the ears for N95 masks; dryness of the mouth when wearing surgical masks; skin dryness, sweating, and redness from wearing gloves; headaches from wearing goggles/face shields; and sweating when wearing overalls or a gown (P < .05 for all variables). CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that physical problems related to the use of PPE are common and increase when PPE is worn for more than 4 hours. The availability, safety, and effectiveness of PPE are crucial to help protect nurses. Studies to examine PPE quality, characteristics, efficacy, and optimal use are necessary to maintain the healthy workforce needed to care for patients during this pandemic.","Atay, Selma; Cura, Sengül Üzen",Wound Manag Prev,243,16

These flies have undergone a variety of specializations during their evolution including an exclusive diet consisting solely of vertebrate blood for both sexes as well as an obligate viviparous reproductive biology. Alongside these adaptations, Glossina species have developed intricate relationships with specific microbes ranging from mutualistic to parasitic. These relationships provide fundamental support required to sustain the specializations associated with tsetse's biology. This chapter provides an overview on the knowledge to date regarding the biology behind these relationships and focuses primarily on four bacterial species that are consistently associated with Glossina species. Here their interactions with the host are reviewed at the morphological, biochemical and genetic levels. This includes: the obligate symbiont Wigglesworthia, which is found in all tsetse species and is essential for nutritional supplementation to the blood-specific diet, immune system maturation and facilitation of viviparous reproduction; the commensal symbiont Sodalis, which is a frequently associated symbiont optimized for survival within the fly via nutritional adaptation, vertical transmission through mating and may alter vectorial capacity of Glossina for trypanosomes; the parasitic symbiont Wolbachia, which can manipulate Glossina via cytoplasmic incompatibility and shows unique interactions at the genetic level via horizontal transmission of its genetic material into the genome in two Glossina species; finally, knowledge on recently observed relations between Spiroplasma and Glossina is explored and potential interactions are discussed based on knowledge of interactions between this bacterial Genera and other insect species. These flies have a simple microbiome relative to that of other insects. However, these relationships are deep, well-studied and provide a window into the complexity and function of host/symbiont interactions in an important disease vector.","Attardo, Geoffrey M; Scolari, Francesca; Malacrida, Anna",Results Probl Cell Differ,243,24

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is the diagnostic criterion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, RNA detection has many limitations, such as being time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and it must be performed in specialized laboratories. Virus antibody detection is a routine method for screening for multiple viruses, but data about SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection are limited. METHOD: Throat swabs and blood were collected from 67 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection patients at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and Zunyi Fourth People's Hospital isolated observation departments. Throat swab samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by real-time PCR. Blood was used subjected to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gold immunochromatography assay (GICA). Blood underwent C-reactive protein detection by immunoturbidimetry, and white blood cells, neutrophil percentages and lymphocyte percentages were counted and calculated, respectively. Clinical symptoms, age and lifestyle habits (smoking and drinking) in all patients were recorded. Data were analysed using SPSS version 19. The results were confirmed by T and &#967;2 tests; correlations with detection results were analysed by kappa coefficients. Odds ratio (OR) and corrected OR values were analysed by logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients included in this study, 26 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. GICA IgM sensitivity was 50.9% (13/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgM sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgG sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 95.1% (39/41). The kappa coefficients between RNA detection and ELISA IgG, ELISA IgM, and GICA IgM results were 0.741 (P < 0.01), 0.681 (P < 0.01) and 0.430 (P < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Among the candidate blood indicators, serum IgG and IgM detected by ELISA had the best consistency and validity when compared with standard RNA detection; these indicators can be used as potential preliminary screening tools to identify those who should undergo nucleic acid detection in laboratories without RNA detection abilities or as a supplement to RNA detection.","Xiang, Jialin; Chen, Zuyi; Zhou, Jie; Tian, Di; Ran, Xiusheng; Zhang, Zhimin; Shi, Shi; Xiao, Daimin; Zhou, Yuanzhong",BMC Infect Dis,243,20

Cryoprecipitate, a multidonor product, is widely used for the treatment of acquired hypofibrinogenemia following massive bleeding, but it has been associated with adverse events. We aimed to review the latest evidence on cryoprecipitate for treatment of bleeding. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of current literature on cryoprecipitate therapy, describing its history, formulations and preparation, and recommended dosing. We also reviewed guideline recommendations on the use of cryoprecipitate in bleeding situations and recent studies on its efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Cryoprecipitate has a relatively high fibrinogen content; however, as it is produced by pooling fresh frozen donor plasma, the fibrinogen content per unit can vary considerably. Current guidelines suggest that cryoprecipitate use should be limited to treating hypofibrinogenemia in patients with clinical bleeding. Until recently, cryoprecipitate was deemed unsuitable for pathogen reduction, and potential safety concerns and lack of standardized fibrinogen content have led to some professional bodies recommending that cryoprecipitate is only indicated for the treatment of bleeding and hypofibrinogenemia in perioperative settings where fibrinogen concentrate is not available. While cryoprecipitate is effective in increasing plasma fibrinogen levels, data on its clinical efficacy are limited. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of robust evidence to support the use of cryoprecipitate in bleeding patients, with few prospective, randomized clinical trials performed to date. Clinical trials in bleeding settings are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of cryoprecipitate and to determine its optimal use and administration.","Nascimento, Barto; Levy, Jerrold H; Tien, Homer; Da Luz, Luis Teodoro",CJEM,243,5

However, most of the previous face super-resolution solutions can not handle both tasks in one model. In this work, we treat the mask occlusion as image noise and construct a joint and collaborative learning network, called JDSR-GAN, for the masked face super-resolution task. Given a low-quality face image with the mask as input, the role of the generator composed of a denoising module and super-resolution module is to acquire a high-quality high-resolution face image. The discriminator utilizes some carefully designed loss functions to ensure the quality of the recovered face images. Moreover, we incorporate the identity information and attention mechanism into our network for feasible correlated feature expression and informative feature learning. By jointly performing denoising and face super-resolution, the two tasks can complement each other and attain promising performance. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show the superiority of our proposed JDSR-GAN over some comparable methods which perform the previous two tasks separately.","Gao, Guangwei; Tang, Lei; Yu, Yi; Wu, Fei; Lu, Huimin; Yang, Jian",,243,1

In March, the disease was declared a ”global pandemic” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Until now, there is no known vaccine or drug, since the unknown things related to the disease are more important than our theoretical and empirical knowledge. However, mathematical modeling and the estimation of the basic number of reproductions can provide clarifications in order to determine the potential and severity of this epidemic and therefore provide essential information to identify the type of measures and interventions to be taken to control the intensity of the spread of the disease. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new deterministic compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, the epidemiological state of the individuals and the intervention for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, there recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution to the considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresponding stability. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease if the number of reproduction R0was less than one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemic's differential equations. It should be mentioned that, the error between the considered model and the official data curve is quite small.","Fredj, Haifa Ben; Chérif, Farouk",Chaos Solitons Fractals,243,4

In spite of its simple composition and highly conserved and stereotypical production, spider silks show a wide range of variability in their mechanical properties which, for long, have defied their classification and standardization. Here we propose to launch the Spider Silk Standardization Initiative (S3I), a methodology based on the definition of the &#945;* parameter, in an attempt to define a systematic procedure to classify the tensile properties exhibited by major ampullate gland silk (MAS) spun by Entelegynae spiders. The &#945;* parameter is calculated from the comparison of the true stress-true strain curve of any MAS fiber after being subjected to maximum supercontraction, with the true stress-true strain curve of the species Argiope aurantia, which is set as a reference curve. This work presents the details of the S3I methodology and, as an example, shows its application to an assemblage of Entelegynae spiders from different families collected at the Pantanos de Villa wetlands (Lima, Peru). The systematic and objective classification of the tensile properties of MAS fibers allowed by the S3I will offer insights into key aspects of the biological evolution of the material, and address questions such as how history and adaptation contributed to shape those properties. In addition, it will surely have far reaching consequences in fields such as Materials Science, and Molecular and Evolutionary Biology, by organizing the range of tensile properties exhibited by spider silk fibers.","Garrote, Javier; Ruiz, Víctor; Troncoso, Omar P; Torres, Fernando G; Arnedo, Miquel; Elices, Manuel; Guinea, Gustavo V; Pérez-Rigueiro, José",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,243,2

In this study, we carried out a systematic analysis of clinical characteristics in COVID-19 patients to determine potential risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 virus infection. METHODS: We systematically searched relevant literature published in Pubmed, Embase, Europe PMC, CNKI and other databases. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 16.0. RESULTS: We analysed 5726 confirmed cases from 17 studies. The results indicated that compared with non-cardiac-injured patients, patients with cardiac injury are older, with a greater proportion of male patients, with higher possibilities of existing comorbidities, with higher risks of clinical complications, need for mechanical ventilation, ICU transfer and mortality. Moreover, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, NT-proBNP and blood creatinine in patients with cardiac injury are also higher while lymphocyte counts and platelet counts decreased. However, we fortuitously found that patients with cardiac injury did not present higher clinical specificity for chest distress (P = 0.304), chest pain (P = 0.334), palpitations (P = 0.793) and smoking (P = 0.234). Similarly, the risk of concomitant arrhythmia (P = 0.103) did not increase observably either. CONCLUSION: Age, male gender and comorbidities are risk factors for cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection. Such patients are susceptible to complications and usually have abnormal results of laboratory tests, leading to poor outcomes. Contrary to common cardiac diseases, cardiac injury complicated COVID-19 infection did not significantly induce chest distress, chest pain, palpitations or arrhythmias. Our study indicates that early prevention should be applied to COVID-19 patients with cardiac injury to reduce adverse outcomes.","Zeng, Linwen; Wang, Shihui; Cai, Jianing; Sun, Shaoqing; Wang, Suhuai; Li, Jingjie; Sun, Lin",Epidemiol Infect,243,24

Yet the exact link between climate and COVID-19 is still not well-explored. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hot geographical region weather [like United Arab Emirates (UAE)] on COVID-19 clinical profile and outcomes. Temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, precipitation, and other weather-related variables were studied concerning COVID-19 patients outcomes and laboratory results. Methodology: A total of 434 COVID-19 positive patients admitted between January and June 2020, were recruited from Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE. Temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, and precipitation rate were retrieved from history+ for the day when COVID-19 patients presented to the hospital. These weather parameters were correlated with COVID-19 clinical and laboratory parameters. Results: Our results showed that patients needed admission in days with higher temperatures, higher solar radiation, and less humidity were associated with higher deaths. This association can be linked to the association of these weather parameters with age at diagnosis; higher C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil count, white cell count (WCC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and lower lymphocyte count, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin (Hb), Na, and albumin, all of which are considered poor prognostic factors for COVID-19. Conclusion: Our study highlighted the importance of weather-related variables on the dynamics of mortality and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. The hot weather might makes some people, especially those with comorbidities or older ages, develop aggressive inflammation that ends up with complications and mortality.","Hachim, Mahmood Yaseen; Hachim, Ibrahim Y; Naeem, Kashif; Hannawi, Haifa; Al Salmi, Issa; Hannawi, Suad",Front Public Health,243,32

Therefore, treatment of hypoxemia is a clinical priority in the treatment of such patients. In this regard, new strategies such as High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) and Non-Rebreather Masks and Nasal Cannula (NRMs+NC) that can provide non-invasive high fraction of inspired oxygen are gaining clinical significance. Our objective was to compare oxygen supply by HFNO with NRMs + NC in terms of treatment costs and mortality in a group of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit admission. Material and methods: This was a retrospective and single-center study involving 54 patients who were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between July 2020 and August 2020. Results: HFNO was compared with NMRs + NC in terms of mortality and duration of hospital stay. The two groups were comparable in age (p=0.45), gender (p=0.33), and mortality (p=0.43). Also, there was no significant difference in oxygen saturation at admission (p=0.63), duration of intensive care (p=0.35), total length of hospital stay (p=0.057), and need for invasive mechanical ventilator (p=0.39) between the study groups. The levels of WBC (p=0.36), platelets (p=0.12), lymphocytes (p=0.98), CRP (p=0.11), pro-calcitonin (p=0.20), D-dimer (p=0.74), ferritin (p=0.14), urea (p=0.74), and creatinine (p=0.35) were also similar between the two groups. Conclusion: Oxygen support by NRMs + NC was comparable to HFNO in terms of mortality, need for invasive mechanic ventilation, length of intensive care, and length of hospital stay. We believe that NRMs + NC may represent an inexpensive and easily accessible therapeutic substitute for HFNO, particularly when the risk of transmission and costs related with HFNO use are considered. © 2021 A.

This technique may provide new opportunities in diagnosis and research of COVID-19. Signal amplification by reversible exchange-based hyperpolarization studies on large-sized drug candidates were carried out. We observed hyperpolarized proton signals from whole structures, due to the unprecedented long-distance polarization transfer by para-hydrogen. We also found that the optimal magnetic field for the maximum polarization transfer yield was dependent on the molecular structure. We can expect further research on the hyperpolarization of other important large molecules, isotope labeling, as well as polarization transfer on nuclei with a long spin relaxation time. A clinical perspective of these features on drug molecules can broaden the application of hyperpolarization techniques for therapeutic studies.","Jeong, Hye Jin; Min, Sein; Chae, Heelim; Kim, Sarah; Lee, Gunwoo; Namgoong, Sung Keon; Jeong, Keunhong",Sci Rep,243,10

RESULTS: A total of 1228 patients from 10 studies were included. Compared with non-severe group, severe group had strikingly lower average eosinophil counts (SMD 0.65, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.29-1.01; Pâ<â.001).

In this work, predictive factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality in cancer patients were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this large nationwide retro-prospective cohort study, we collected data on patients with solid tumours and COVID-19 diagnosed between March 1 and 11th June 2020. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality and COVID-19 severity, defined as admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation and/or death, was one of the secondary end-points. RESULTS: From April 4 to 11th June 2020, 1289 patients were analysed. The most frequent cancers were digestive and thoracic. Altogether, 424 (33%) patients had a severe form of COVID-19 and 370 (29%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with death were male sex (odds ratio 1.73, 95%CI: 1.18-2.52), The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale (ECOG PS) &#8805; 2 (OR 3.23, 95%CI: 2.27-4.61), updated Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.08, 95%CI: 1.01-1.16) and admission to ICU (OR 3.62, 95%CI 2.14-6.11). The same factors, age along with corticosteroids before COVID-19 diagnosis, and thoracic primary tumour site were independently associated with COVID-19 severity. None of the anticancer treatments administered within the previous 3 months had any effect on mortality or COVID-19 severity, except for cytotoxic chemotherapy in the subgroup of patients with detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which was associated with a slight increase of the risk of death (OR 1.53; 95%CI: 1.00-2.34; p = 0.05). A total of 431 (39%) patients had their systemic anticancer treatment (such as chemotherapy, targeted or immune therapy) interrupted or stopped following diagnosis of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and COVID-19 severity in cancer patients are high and are associated with general characteristics of patients. We found no deleterious effects of recent anticancer treatments, except for cytotoxic chemotherapy in the RT-PCR-confirmed subgroup of patients.

Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentration in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. METHODS: We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020. RESULTS: Several non-infectious, as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases, are characterised by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalised patients. CONCLUSIONS: Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasised, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.","Kappert, Kai; Jahic, Amir; Tauber, Rudolf",Biomarkers,243,24

Hence there is potential for models providing mid-term forecasts of the epidemic trajectory using such information. The effectiveness of lockdown interventions can also be assessed by modelling later epidemic stages, possibly using a multiphase epidemic model. Commonly applied methods to analyze epidemic trajectories include phenomenological growth models (e.g. the Richards), and variants of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartment model. Here we focus on a practical forecasting approach, applied to interim UK COVID data, using a bivariate Reynolds model (cases and deaths). We show the utility of informative priors in developing and estimating the model, and compare error densities (Poisson-gamma, Poisson-lognormal, Poisson-logStudent) for overdispersed data on new cases and deaths. We use cross-validation to assess medium term forecasts. We also consider the longer term post-lockdown epidemic profile to assess epidemic containment, using a two phase model. Fit to mid-epidemic data shows better fit to training data and better cross validation performance for a Poisson-logStudent model. Estimation of longer term epidemic data after lockdown relaxation, characterised by protracted slow downturn and then upturn in cases, casts doubt on effective containment. Many applications of phenomenological models have been to complete epidemics. However, evaluation of such models based simply on their fit to observed data may give only a partial picture, and cross-validation against actual trends is also useful. Similarly, it may be preferable to model incidence rather than cumulative data, though this raises questions about suitable error densities for modelling often erratic fluctuations. Hence there may be utility in evaluating alternative error assumptions.","Congdon, Peter",,243,24

However, due to a shortage of ICU ventilators, hospitals worldwide needed to deploy anesthesia machines for ICU ventilation (which is off-label use). A joint guidance was written to apply anesthesia machines for long-term ventilation. The goal of this research is to retrospectively evaluate the differences in measurable ventilation parameters between the ICU ventilator and the anesthesia machine as used for COVID-19 patients. In this study, we included 32 patients treated in March and April 2020, who had more than 3 days of mechanical ventilation, either in the regular ICU with ICU ventilators (Hamilton S1), or in the temporary emergency ICU with anesthetic ventilators (Aisys, GE). The data acquired during regular clinical treatment was collected from the Patient Data Management Systems. Available ventilation parameters (pressures and volumes: PEEP, Ppeak, Pinsp, Vtidal), monitored parameters EtCO2, SpO2, derived compliance C, and resistance R were processed and analyzed. A sub-analysis was performed to compare closed-loop ventilation (INTELLiVENT-ASV) to other ventilation modes. The results showed no major differences in the compared parameters, except for Pinsp. PEEP was reduced over time in the with Hamilton treated patients. This is most likely attributed to changing clinical protocol as more clinical experience and literature became available. A comparison of compliance between the 2 ventilators could not be made due to variances in the measurement of compliance. Closed loop ventilation could be used in 79% of the time, resulting in more stable EtCO2. From the analysis it can be concluded that the off-label usage of the anesthetic ventilator in our hospital did not result in differences in ventilation parameters compared to the ICU treatment in the first 4 days of ventilation.","Dijkman, Wouter M; van Acht, Niels M C; van Akkeren, Jesse P; Bhagwanbali, Rhasna C D; van Pul, Carola",J Intensive Care Med,243,16

METHODS: Total number of reported cases were plotted against total number of tests for COVID-19 performed over time, with and without smoothing, for Canada and some Canadian provinces individually. Changes in curvature profile were identified as either convex or concave as indicators of pandemic acceleration or deceleration, respectively. Rt estimates were calculated on an exponential growth rate. RESULTS: For Canada as a whole, the testing graphs had a slightly concave profile and a coincident decrease in Rt estimates. Saskatchewan more recently had a convex profile with a gradual shift to a concave profile and also demonstrated a gradual decline in Rt estimates. Curves and Rt estimates for Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec displayed a gradual shift towards concavity over time and an overall decrease in Rt estimates, which is suggestive of a positive impact of public health interventions implemented federally and provincially. CONCLUSION: The present analyses compared a mathematical tool to Rt estimates to ascertain the status of the pandemic in Canada. Caution should be taken when interpreting results due to factors such as varying testing protocols, available testing data unique to each province and limitations inherent to each method, which may generate different results using the two approaches. Analysis of testing data may complement metrics obtained from surveillance data to allow for a weight-of-evidence approach to assess the status of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Edjoc, Rojiemiahd; Atchessi, Nicole; Lien, Amanda; Smith, Ben A; Gabrani-Juma, Imran; Abalos, Christine; Heisz, Marianne",Can J Public Health,243,16

One potential means to provide care while avoiding unnecessary person-to-person contact is to offer remote services (telemedicine). This study aimed to (1) gather real-time information on the use and perception of telemedicine in people living with type 1 diabetes and (2) assess the challenges, such as restricted access to health care and/or medical supplies. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was widely distributed between 24 March and 5 May 2020 using an open-access web-based platform. Data were analysed descriptively, and results were stratified according to age, sex and HbA 1c. Results: There were 7477 survey responses from individuals in 89 countries. Globally, 30% reported that the pandemic had affected their healthcare access due to cancelled physical appointments with their healthcare providers. Thirty-two per cent reported no fundamental change in their medical follow-up during this period, with 9% stating that no personal contact was established with their doctors over the duration of the study. Twenty-eight per cent received remote care through telephone (72%) or video-calls (28%). Of these, 86% found remote appointments useful and 75% plan to have remote appointments in the future. Glucose control, indicated by HbA 1c, was positively associated with positive perception of telemedicine. In males, 45% of respondents with an HbA 1c &gt; 9% rated telemedicine not useful compared to those with lower HbA 1c,while 20% of females with an HbA 1c &gt; 9% rated it not useful (χ 2 = 14.2, P =.0016). Conclusion: Remote appointments have largely been perceived as positive in people with type 1 diabetes with the majority (75%) stating that they would consider remote appointments beyond the pandemic. Age and level of education do not appear to influence perception of telemedicine, whereas poor glucose control, particularly in males, seems to negatively affect perception.","Scott, Sam N.; Fontana, Federico Y.; Züger, Thomas; Laimer, Markus; Stettler, Christoph",Endocrinol.

A case report,10.841794,10.223701,2020,"During the first nine months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Uruguay successfully kept it under control, even when our previous studies support a recurrent viral flux across the Uruguayan-Brazilian border that sourced several local outbreaks in Uruguay. However, towards the end of 2020, a remarkable exponential growth was observed and the TETRIS strategy was lost. Here, we aimed to understand the factors that fueled SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics during the first epidemic wave in the country. We recovered 84 whole viral genomes from patients diagnosed between November, 2020 and February, 2021 in Rocha, a sentinel eastern Uruguayan department bordering Brazil. The lineage B.1.1.28 was the most prevalent in Rocha during November-December 2020, P.2 became the dominant one during January-February 2021, while the first P.1 sequences corresponds to February, 2021. The lineage replacement process agrees with that observed in several Brazilian states, including Rio Grande do Sul (RS). We observed a one to three month delay between the appearance of P.2 and P.1 in RS and their subsequent detection in Rocha. The phylogenetic analysis detected two B.1.1.28 and one P.2 main Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2 clades, introduced from the southern and southeastern Brazilian regions into Rocha between early November and mid December, 2020. One synonymous mutation distinguishes the sequences of the main B.1.1.28 clade in Rocha from those widely distributed in RS. The minor B.1.1.28 cluster, distinguished by several mutations, harbours non-synonymous changes in the Spike protein: Q675H and Q677H, so far not concurrently reported. The convergent appearance of S:Q677H in different viral lineages and its proximity to the S1/S2 cleavage site raise concerns about its functional relevance. The observed S:E484K-VOI P.2 partial replacement of previously circulating lineages in Rocha might have increased transmissibility as suggested by the significant decrease in Ct values. Our study emphasizes the impact of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Uruguay and the need of reinforcing real-time genomic surveillance on specific Uruguayan border locations, as one of the key elements for achieving long-term COVID-19 epidemic control.","Rego, Natalia; Fernandez-Calero, Tamara; Arantes, Ighor; Noya, Veronica; mir, daiana; Brandes, Mariana; Zanetti, Juan; Arleo, Mailen; Pereira, Emiliano; Possi, Tania; Chappos, Odhille; Bilbao, Lucia; Reyes, Natalia; Duquia, Melissa; Victoria, Matias; Techera, Pia; Benitez-Galeano, Maria Jose; Griffero, Luciana; Mendez, Mauricio; Gonzalez, Belen; Smircich, Pablo; Colina, Rodney; Alonso, Cecilia; Bello, Gonzalo; Spangenberg, Lucia",,243,17

Given the critical role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) in embryonic development, we generated a mouse model that overexpresses Fgf8 specifically in the epidermis. Interestingly, these mutant mice exhibited stunted, smaller bodies and severe hypotrichosis. Histological analysis showed that the hair follicles in the mutants were arrested at stage 2 of hair development. The density of hair follicles in the mutant mice was also lower compared to that in the control mice. Overexpression of Fgf8 inhibited the proliferation of epidermal cells and simultaneously promoted apoptosis, leading to the arrest of hair follicle development. Further analysis showed that sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) were downregulated and upregulated, respectively. To summarize, our study demonstrates that FGF signalling plays an important role in the regulation of hair follicle development.","Wang, Zhengsen; Chen, Yixuan; Chen, Meiyang; Zhang, Yanding",Exp. dermatol,243,15

A large body of evidence suggests that dreams are affected by both waking experiences and sleep pattern. In this view, the lockdown should have induced intense modifications in dreaming activity. The aim of the study was to assess dream features during the lockdown in Italy. METHODS: We used an online survey to collect self-reported demographic, clinical, sleep and dream data. Our sample included 1091 participants. RESULTS: Results point to an increased dream frequency, emotional load, vividness, bizarreness and length during the lockdown, compared to a pre-lockdown period. Higher dream frequency and specific qualitative features were found in females and subjects with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours and depressive symptoms. Most of the dream features assessed during the lockdown were predicted by age, gender, depressive symptoms, presence/absence of other people at home, and territorial area. A specific focus on sleep features revealed that sleep duration and several sleep quality indexes were the best predictors of dream variables. During the lockdown, dreams were also characterized by increased negative emotions, which were particularly frequent in females, younger adults, and participants with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviours, anxiety and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the hypothesis of a strong influence of the pandemic on dreaming, supporting both the hypothesis of continuity between wake and sleep mental processes and the view of a crucial influence of sleep quality and duration on dreaming activity.","Gorgoni, Maurizio; Scarpelli, Serena; Alfonsi, Valentina; Annarumma, Ludovica; Cordone, Susanna; Stravolo, Serena; De Gennaro, Luigi",Sleep Med,243,10

None of the published studies demonstrated an ideally reliable and safe way to induce rapid unconsciousness in large groups of pigs. Development of rapid mass depopulation methods applicable to large groups of pigs is necessary to provide industry partners with suitable and low-cost emergency preparedness procedures while adhering to personnel safety and animal welfare standards. Lastly, there is an urgent need to standardize comprehensive reporting guidelines for depopulation studies.","Arruda, Andréia G; Beyene, Tariku J; Kieffer, Justin; Lorbach, Joshua N; Moeller, Steven; Bowman, Andrew S",,243,24

Indocyanine green near-infrared video angiography (ICG-NIR-VA) has been adopted for objective assessment of free flap tissue perfusion but is thus far not used on a routine basis. Therefore, we investigated its intraoperative impact on decision-making and postoperative outcome. METHODS: From January 2017 to June 2019, 88 consecutive adipo- or fasciocutaneus free flaps were performed in conjunction with intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA. Free flap tissue perfusion was first assessed clinically and then compared with ICG-NIR-VA findings. Based on the results, the decision for intraoperative trimming of critically perfused flap zones was made. The way of decision-making, flap success, and failure rates as well as intra- and postoperative complication rates were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall free flap success rate was 92.0%. Partial flap necrosis occurred in five cases (5.7%) and total flap necrosis in two cases (2.3%). ICG-NIR-VA aided decision-making and flap design in 34 cases (38.6%) and led to complication-free postoperative courses. When ICG-NIR-VA was relied on (82 out of 88 flaps; 93.2%), there was no unpredicted postoperative tissue necrosis (overestimation). When ICG-NIR-VA was not relied on (6 out of 88 flaps; 6.8%), there were five cases of postoperative partial flap necrosis and one case of uneventful healing (underestimation). The sensitivity of ICG-NIR-VA was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64.6-100) and the specificity was 98.8% (95% CI: 93.3-100) with a positive predictive value of 87.5% (95% CI: 52.9-99.4) and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 95.4-100). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative ICG-NIR-VA objectified free flap perfusion and thus refined surgical decision-making on flap design in all cases. It could always predict tissue necrosis and subjectively improved outcomes in free flap surgery at our institution. Furthermore, it could be easily implemented in intraoperative routine, only adding minimal additional operative time.","Bigdeli, Amir Khosrow; Thomas, Benjamin; Falkner, Florian; Gazyakan, Emre; Hirche, Christoph; Kneser, Ulrich",J. reconstr. microsurg,243,20

Although some exposed individuals have no symptoms and most symptomatic infections are not severe, COVID-19 cases span a wide spectrum, ranging from mild to critical and sometimes resulting in life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia, severe respiratory distress and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no curative drug for COVID-19 and vaccines are still under development. We are presenting here a strategy for the fast development of natural live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our proposed approach is based on screening for, identifying, analyzing and selecting naturally attenuated yet highly immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 strains, which may lead to a shorter cycle of vaccine development, as well as higher vaccine effectiveness.","Todorov, German; Uversky, Vladimir N",Biomolecules,243,22

It will cause a very high impact on world's economy and global health sector. Earlier the structure of main protease (Mpro) protein was deposited in the RCSB protein repository. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and remdesivir were found to effective in treatment of COVID-19 patients. Here we have performed docking and molecule dynamic (MD) simulation study of HCQ and remdesivir with Mpro protein which gave promising results to inhibit Mpro protein in SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of results obtained we designed structurally modified 18 novel derivatives of HCQ, remdesivir and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and carried out docking studies of all the derivatives. From the docking studies six molecules DK4, DK7, DK10, DK16, DK17 and DK19 gave promising results and can be use as inhibitor for Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 to control COVID-19 very effectively. Further, molecular dynamics simulation of one derivative of HCQ and one derivative of tetrahydrocannabinol showing excellent docking score was performed along with the respective parent molecules. The two derivatives gave excellent docking score and higher stability than the parent molecule as validated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the binding affinities towards Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 thus represented as strong inhibitors at very low concentration.","Mishra, Deepak; Raman Maurya, Radha; Kumar, Kamlesh; Munjal, Nupur S; Bahadur, Vijay; Sharma, Sandeep; Singh, Prashant; Bahadur, Indra",J Mol Liq,243,24

We aimed to explore the potential benefit and safety of selectively blocking the anaphylatoxin and complement protein C5a with the monoclonal antibody IFX-1 (vilobelimab), in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: We did an exploratory, open-label, randomised phase 2 trial (part of the adaptive phase 2/3 PANAMO trial) of intravenous IFX-1 in adults with severe COVID-19 at three academic hospitals in the Netherlands. Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; severe pneumonia with pulmonary infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, a clinical history of severe shortness of breath within the past 14 days, or a need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation; severe disease defined as a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PaO2/FiO2) between 100 mm Hg and 250 mm Hg in the supine position; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive IFX-1 (up to seven doses of 800 mg intravenously) plus best supportive care (IFX-1 group) or best supportive care only (control group). The primary outcome was the percentage change in PaO2/FiO2 in the supine position between baseline and day 5. Mortality at 28 days and treatment-emergent and serious adverse events were key secondary outcomes. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in all patients according to treatment received. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04333420). Findings: Between March 31 and April 24, 2020, 30 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the IFX-1 group (n=15) or the control group (n=15). During the study it became clear that several patients could not be assessed regularly in the supine position because of severe hypoxaemia. It was therefore decided to focus on all PaO2/FiO2 assessments (irrespective of position). At day 5 after randomisation, the mean PaO2/FiO2 (irrespective of position) was 158 mm Hg (SD 63; range 84-265) in the IFX-1 group and 189 mm Hg (89; 71-329) in the control group. Analyses of the least squares mean relative change in PaO2/FiO2 at day 5 showed no differences between treatment groups (17% change in the IFX-1 group vs 41% in the control group; difference -24% [95% CI -58 to 9], p=0·15. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality by 28 days were 13% (95% CI 0-31) for the IFX-1 group and 27% (4-49) for the control group (adjusted hazard ratio for death 0·65 [95% CI 0·10-4·14]). The frequency of serious adverse events were similar between groups (nine [60%] in the IFX-1 group vs seven [47%] in the control group) and no deaths were considered related to treatment assignment. However, a smaller proportion of patients had pulmonary embolisms classed as serious in the IFX-1 group (two [13%]) than in the control group (six [40%]). Infections classed as serious were reported in three (20%) patients in the IFX-1 group versus five (33%) patients in the control group. Interpretation: In this small exploratory phase 2 part of the PANAMO trial, C5a inhibition with IFX-1 appears to be safe in patients with severe COVID-19. The secondary outcome results in favour of IFX-1 are preliminary because the study was not powered on these endpoints, but they support the investigation of C5a inhibition with IFX-1 in a phase 3 trial using 28-day mortality as the primary endpoint.

Varieties of diagnostic protocols are being developed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Many of these diagnostic protocols however, have limitations such as for example unacceptable no of false-positive and false-negative cases, particularly during the early stages of infection. At present, the real-time (quantitative) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, RT-PCR based tests are complex, expensive, time consuming and involve pre-processing of samples. A swift, sensitive, inexpensive protocol for mass screening is urgently needed to contain this pandemic. There is urgent need to harness new powerful technologies for accurate detection not only of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) but also combating the emergence of pandemics of new viruses as well. To overcome the current challenges, the authors propose a diagnostic protocol based on Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with microfluidic devices containing integrated microchannels functionalized either with vertically aligned Au/Ag coated carbon nanotubes or with disposable electrospun micro/nano-filter membranes. These devices have the potential to successfully trap viruses from diverse biological fluids/secretions including saliva, nasopharyngeal, tear etc. These can thus enrich the viral titre and enable accurate identification of the viruses from their respective Raman signatures. If the device is successfully developed and proven to detect target viruses, it would facilitate rapid screening of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals of COVID-19. This would be a valuable diagnostic tool not only for mass screening of current COVID-19 pandemic but also in viral pandemic outbreaks of future.","Jadhav, Siddhita A; Biji, Pullithadathil; Panthalingal, Manoj Kumar; Murali Krishna, C; Rajkumar, S; Joshi, Dattatraya S; Sundaram, Natarajan",Med Hypotheses,243,20

In this international, multi-center study conducted by the World Alliance Societies of Echocardiography (WASE), we aim to determine the clinical and echocardiographic phenotype of acute cardiac disease in COVID-19 patients, to explore phenotypic differences in different geographic regions across the world, and to identify parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We studied 870 patients with acute COVID-19 infection from 13 medical centers in four world regions (Asia, Europe, United States, Latin America) who had undergone transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs). Clinical and laboratory data were collected, including patient outcomes. Anonymized echocardiograms were analyzed with automated, machine learning-derived algorithms to calculate left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), and LV longitudinal strain (LS). Right-sided echocardiographic parameters that were measured included right ventricular (RV) LS, RV free wall strain (FWS), and RV basal diameter (RVBD). Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and echocardiographic parameters associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Significant regional differences were noted in terms of patient co-morbidities, severity of illness, clinical biomarkers, and LV and RV echocardiographic metrics. Overall in-hospital mortality was 21.6%. Parameters associated with mortality in a multivariate analysis were age (OR 1.12 [1.05, 1.22], p = 0.003), previous lung disease (OR 7.32 [1.56, 42.2], p = 0.015), LVLS (OR 1.18 [1.05, 1.36], p = 0.012), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 6.17 [1.74, 28.7], p = 0.009), and RVFWS (OR 1.14 [1.04, 1.26], p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: LV dysfunction is noted in approximately 20% and RV dysfunction in approximately 30% of patients with acute COVID-19 illness and portend a poor prognosis. Age at presentation, previous lung disease, LDH, LVLS, and RVFWS were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Regional differences in cardiac phenotype highlight the significant differences in patient acuity as well as echocardiographic utilization in different parts of the world.","Karagodin, Ilya; Singulane, Cristiane Carvalho; Woodward, Gary M; Xie, Mingxing; Tucay, Edwin S; Tude Rodrigues, Ana C; Vasquez-Ortiz, Zuilma Y; Alizadehasl, Azin; Monaghan, Mark J; Ordonez Salazar, Bayardo A; Soulat-Dufour, Laurie; Mostafavi, Atoosa; Moreo, Antonella; Citro, Rodolfo; Narang, Akhil; Wu, Chun; Descamps, Tine; Addetia, Karima; Lang, Roberto M; Asch, Federico M",J.

However, many available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests demonstrated a moderate sensitivity, 70%-80% is probably a reasonable estimate. Consequently, having useful tools for differential diagnosis becomes essential. In this scenario, lung ultrasound (LUS) may have an important role in the evaluation of lung involvement in hemodialysis patients during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We present two cases of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom LUS had a central role in the diagnostic process. Ultrasound images of COVID-19 pneumonia show a typical bilateral pattern characterized by multiple or confluent B-lines with spared areas, thickened and irregular pleural line, and rare subpleural consolidations. LUS showed high accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia. FINDINGS: Despite both patients appeared clinically euvolemic and afebrile, they presented with acute diarrhea and oxygen saturation level of 92%-93%. Although clinical manifestations were mild and not specific in both patients, LUS raised suspicion on the possible COVID-19 diagnosis which was confirmed by a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. DISCUSSION: There are many reasons for a patient on dialysis to present shortness of breath, fever, and multiple B-lines at LUS assessment (such as heart failure, fluid overload, vascular access infection, interstitial pneumonia) but the recognition of typical ultrasound patterns of the COVID-19 pneumonia is helpful for differential diagnosis. LUS may have an important role in the screening process of hemodialysis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in oligosymptomatic patients before the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, and in those with suspected symptoms and/or known exposure with unexpected negative SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests.","Allinovi, Marco; Laudicina, Selene; Dallari, Lorenzo; Gianassi, Iacopo; Dervishi, Egrina; Biagini, Maria; Cirami, Lino",Hemodial. int,243,17

The outbreak of COVID-19 has been accompanied by what the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a “massive infodemic.” Fake news covering all aspects of the pandemic spread rapidly through social media, creating confusion and disinformation. This paper reports on an empirical study carried out during the lockdown in Spain (March–May 2020) with a group of secondary students (N = 20) engaged in diverse online activities that required them to practice critical thinking and argumentation for dealing with coronavirus information and disinformation. The main goal is to examine students’ competence at engaging in argumentation as critical assessment in this context. Discourse analysis allows for the exploration of the arguments and criteria applied by students to assess COVID-19 news headlines. The results show that participants were capable of identifying true and false headlines and assessing the credibility of headlines by appealing to different criteria, although most arguments were coded as needing only a basic epistemic level of assessment, and only a few appealed to the criterion of scientific procedure when assessing the headlines. © Copyright © 2021 Puig, Blanco-Anaya and Pérez-Maceira.","Puig, B.; Blanco-Anaya, P.; Pérez-Maceira, J.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate socioeconomic factors related to imaging utilization during the pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective review of consecutive imaging examinations was performed from January 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020, across all service locations (inpatient, emergency, outpatient). Patient level data were provided for socioeconomic factors (age, sex, race, insurance status, residential zip code). Residential zip code was used to assign median income level. The weekly total imaging volumes in 2020 and 2019 were plotted from January 1 to May 31 stratified by socioeconomic factors to demonstrate the trends during the pre-COVID-19 (January 1 to February 28) and post-COVID-19 (March 1 to May 31) periods. Independent-samples t tests were used to statistically compare the 2020 and 2019 socioeconomic groups. RESULTS: Compared with 2019, the 2020 total imaging volume in the post-COVID-19 period revealed statistically significant increased imaging utilization in patients who are aged 60 to 79 years (P = .0025), are male (P < .0001), are non-White (Black, Asian, other, unknown; P < .05), are covered by Medicaid or uninsured (P < .05), and have income below $80,000 (P < .05). However, there was a significant decrease in imaging utilization among patients who are younger (<18 years old; P < .0001), are female (P < .0001), are White (P = .0003), are commercially insured (P < .0001), and have income &#8805;$80,000 (P < .05). DISCUSSION: During the pandemic, there was a significant change in imaging utilization varying by socioeconomic factors, consistent with the known health disparities observed in the prevalence of COVID-19. These findings could have significant implications in directing utilization of resources during the pandemic and subsequent recovery.","Naidich, Jason J; Boltyenkov, Artem; Wang, Jason J; Chusid, Jesse; Rula, Elizabeth; Hughes, Danny; Sanelli, Pina C",J.

The aim of the study is to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics in suspected COVID-19 patients in our institution. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we investigated suspected COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a request for an interleukin-6 send-out test, from March 28 to June 27, 2020. Patients' demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were collected by chart review. RESULTS: Fifty patients suspected with COVID-19 were included in our study, of whom 24 patients were positive with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection and 26 were negative. During the observation period, 30 patients were discharged, 17 died during hospitalization, and three remained in hospital. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients had older age, more comorbidities, and elevated levels of inflammation markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). However, there was no significant difference in laboratory data between survivors and nonsurvivors in COVID-19 patients in our study. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that potential risk factors of older age, multiple comorbidities, and high levels of ESR, CRP, serum ferritin, and LDH could help the clinician to identify potential COVID-19 patients. However, this data needs to be further validated in a larger population.","Fei, Fei; Smith, John A; Cao, Liyun",J. med. virol,243,1

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in adults aged 60 years and older. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy adults aged 60 years and older in Renqiu (Hebei, China). Vaccine or placebo was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (days 0 and 28). Phase 1 comprised a dose-escalation study, in which participants were allocated to two blocks: block 1 (3 μg inactivated virus in 0·5 mL of aluminium hydroxide solution per injection) and block 2 (6 μg per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (2:1) using block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or placebo (aluminium hydroxide solution only). In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:2:1) using block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1·5 μg, 3 μg, or 6 μg per dose, or placebo. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to treatment allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint was seroconversion rate at 28 days after the second injection (which was assessed in all participants who had received the two doses of vaccine according to their random assignment, had antibody results available, and did not violate the trial protocol). Seroconversion was defined as a change from seronegative at baseline to seropositive for neutralising antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 (positive cutoff titre 1/8), or a four-fold titre increase if the participant was seropositive at baseline. This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04383574). FINDINGS: Between May 22 and June 1, 2020, 72 participants (24 in each intervention group and 24 in the placebo group; mean age 65·8 years [SD 4·8]) were enrolled in phase 1, and between June 12 and June 15, 2020, 350 participants were enrolled in phase 2 (100 in each intervention group and 50 in the placebo group; mean age 66·6 years [SD 4·7] in 349 participants). In the safety populations from both phases, any adverse reaction within 28 days after injection occurred in 20 (20%) of 100 participants in the 1·5 μg group, 25 (20%) of 125 in the 3 μg group, 27 (22%) of 123 in the 6 μg group, and 15 (21%) of 73 in the placebo group. All adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity and injection site pain (39 [9%] of 421 participants) was the most frequently reported event. As of Aug 28, 2020, eight serious adverse events, considered unrelated to vaccination, have been reported by seven (2%) participants. In phase 1, seroconversion after the second dose was observed in 24 of 24 participants (100·0% [95% CI 85·8–100·0]) in the 3 μg group and 22 of 23 (95·7% [78·1–99·9]) in the 6 μg group. In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 88 of 97 participants in the 1·5 μg group (90·7% [83·1–95·7]), 96 of 98 in the 3 μg group (98·0% [92·8–99·8]), and 97 of 98 (99·0% [94·5–100·0]) in the 6 μg group. There were no detectable antibody responses in the placebo groups. INTERPRETATION: CoronaVac is safe and well tolerated in older adults. Neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3 μg dose were similar to those of the 6 μg dose, and higher than those of the 1·5 μg dose, supporting the use of the 3 μg dose CoronaVac in phase 3 trials to assess protection against COVID-19.

This long-standing question facing governments around the world is acute in the context of pandemics like HIV and COVID-19. The Global AIDS Strategy of the last 5 years sought to prevent mortality and HIV transmission in part through ensuring people living with HIV (PLHIV) knew their HIV status and could suppress the HIV virus through antiretroviral treatment. This article presents a cross-national ecological analysis of the relative success of national AIDS responses under this strategy, where laws were characterised by more or less criminalisation and with varying rights protections. In countries where same-sex sexual acts were criminalised, the portion of PLHIV who knew their HIV status was 11% lower and viral suppression levels 8% lower. Sex work criminalisation was associated with 10% lower knowledge of status and 6% lower viral suppression. Drug use criminalisation was associated with 14% lower levels of both. Criminalising all three of these areas was associated with approximately 18%–24% worse outcomes. Meanwhile, national laws on non-discrimination, independent human rights institutions and gender-based violence were associated with significantly higher knowledge of HIV status and higher viral suppression among PLHIV. Since most countries did not achieve 2020 HIV goals, this ecological evidence suggests that law reform may be an important tool in speeding momentum to halt the pandemic.","Kavanagh, Matthew M; Agbla, Schadrac C; Joy, Marissa; Aneja, Kashish; Pillinger, Mara; Case, Alaina; Erondu, Ngozi A; Erkkola, Taavi; Graeden, Ellie",BMJ Glob Health,243,16

We assess the prevalence of long term radiological and functional pulmonary sequelae in survivors from COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in published literature. Methods: We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of all original studies in adults admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or Influenza pneumonia and followed within 12 months from discharge. Searches were run on MEDLINE and Embase, with the last update on 1st March 2021. Primary outcomes were presence of 1) radiologic sequelae at CT scans; 2) restrictive impairment; 3) reduced diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). This review is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42020183139. Results: Sixty studies were included for qualitative synthesis, of which 41 were suitable for meta-analysis. On follow up CT scans, the overall estimated proportion was 0.56 (95%CI 0.44 to 0.66, I2= 94.44%) for inflammatory changes, and 0.40 (95%CI 0.29 to 0.52, I2=95.19%) for fibrotic findings. In SARS-CoV-2 specifically, proportions were estimated at 0.43 (95%CI 0.32 to 0.56, I2=94.60%) and 0.30 (95%CI 0.19 to 0.43, I2=94.89%) for inflammatory and fibrotic findings, respectively. Overall proportion for restrictive impairment was 0.19 (95%CI 0.12 to 0.27, I2=94.46%), DLCO reduction was estimated at 0.45 (95%CI 0.38 to 0.52, I2=90.10). Elevated radiological and functional estimates persisted across follow-up times. Confidence in the estimates was deemed very low as studies were largely observational without control groups, heterogeneity in estimates was high but was not clearly attributable to between-study differences of severity or design. Conclusion: Although estimates of prevalence are likely limited by differences in case mix and initial severity, a substantial proportion of radiological and functional sequelae are observed following viral pneumonitis, including COVID-19. This highlights the importance of vigilant radiological and functional follow up.","Fabbri, L.; Moss, S.; Khan, F.; Chi, W.; Xia, J.; Robinson, K.; Smyth, A.; Jenkins, G.; Stewart, I.",,243,24

In this paper, we review the current status of the main technologies used to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the B cells of antigen-sensitized animals. While companies are adopting advanced high-throughput methods, the major technologies used by veterinary and medical research laboratories are classical hybridoma fusion and recombinant library selection techniques. These methods have inherent advantages and limitations but have many common aspects when using immunized rodents. Laboratories with expertise in both methods of antibody development have a distinct advantage in their ability to advance mAb technology. New and re-emerging infectious threats in today’s world emphasize the need for quality immunoreagents and the need to maintain expertise in mAb development. We provide examples of some common applications for mAb reagents used to identify pathogens such as the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bacillus anthracis, and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus. We also outline a framework for investigators to make rational decisions concerning which method to use to develop mAbs based upon characteristics of the pathogen under study and the intended downstream application.

Methods We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study by telephone with 1159 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM)and 96 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)who were discharged from the endocrinology department of a hospital from January 1, 2019, to January 24, 2020. According to their fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 2-h postprandial BG (2hPBG) values, the patients were divided into the well-controlled BG group and the poorly controlled BG group. The main evaluation indicators included sociodemographic variables, health risk variables and adherence to self-management behaviors. Results In total, 74.46% of the T2DM patients and 64.89% of the T1DM patients had poor glycemic control. T2DM patients with poor glycemic control were more likely to be older (odds ratio (OR): 1.017 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.030]; P=0.013), have fewer than 12 years of education (OR: 1.646 [95% CI 1.202-2.255]; P=0.002), lack a BG meter at home (OR: 2.728 [95% CI 1.205-6.179]; P=0.016), have a lower degree of medicationcompliance (OR: 1.627 [95% CI 1.076-2.460]; P=0.021), and engage in less self-monitoring of BG (SMBG) per week (OR: 10.884 [95% CI 5.883-20.139]; P<0.001). Fewer than 12 years of education (OR: 3.031 [95% CI 1.112-8.263]; P=0.030) was a risk factor for glycemic control in T1DM. Conclusions Glycemic control among patients with T1DM and T2DM during home quarantine amid the COVID-19 pandemic is poor. Our results showed that more eduction, a higher frequency of SMBG, and improved medication compliance may contribute to glycemic control. Therefore, diabetic patients should be advised to increase the frequency of blood glucose measurements during home quarantine and be re-educated regarding the importance of medication compliance.","Tao, Jing; Gao, Lianlian; Liu, Qinghua; Dong, Kun; Huang, Jiaojiao; Peng, Xuemin; Yang, Yan; Wang, Hui; Yu, Xuefeng",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,243,16

Anesthesia machines have been used as alternatives to traditional ICU mechanical ventilators. However, the outcomes for patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure cared for with Anesthesia Machines is currently unknow. We hypothesized that COVID-19 patients receiving care with Anesthesia Machines would have worse outcomes compared to standard practice. METHODS: We designed a retrospective study of patients admitted with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis at a large tertiary urban hospital in northern Italy. Two care units were included: a 27-bed standard ICU and a 15-bed temporary unit emergently opened in an operating room setting. Intubated patients assigned to Anesthesia Machines (AM group) were compared to a control cohort treated with standard mechanical ventilators (ICU-VENT group). Outcomes were assessed at 60-day follow-up. A multivariable Cox regression analysis of risk factors between survivors and non-survivors was conducted to determine the adjusted risk of death for patients assigned to AM group. RESULTS: Complete daily data from 89 mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted to the two units were analyzed. Seventeen patients were included in the AM group, whereas 72 were in the ICU-VENT group. Disease severity and intensity of treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 60-day mortality was significantly higher in the AM group compared to the ICU-vent group (12/17 vs. 27/72, 70.6% vs. 37.5%, respectively, p = 0.016). Allocation to AM group was associated with a significantly increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (HR 4.05, 95% CI: 1.75–9.33, p = 0.001). Several incidents and complications were reported with Anesthesia Machine care, raising safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that care associated with the use of Anesthesia Machines is inadequate to provide long-term critical care to patients with COVID-19. Added safety risks must be considered if no other option is available to treat severely ill patients during the ongoing pandemic. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.

The requirement for relatively long periods of ventilation in those who survive means that many are considered for tracheostomy to free patients from ventilatory support and maximise scarce resources. COVID-19 provides unique challenges for tracheostomy care: health-care workers need to safely undertake tracheostomy procedures and manage patients afterwards, minimising risks of nosocomial transmission and compromises in the quality of care. Conflicting recommendations exist about case selection, the timing and performance of tracheostomy, and the subsequent management of patients. In response, we convened an international working group of individuals with relevant expertise in tracheostomy. We did a literature and internet search for reports of research pertaining to tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supplemented by sources comprising statements and guidance on tracheostomy care. By synthesising early experiences from countries that have managed a surge in patient numbers, emerging virological data, and international, multidisciplinary expert opinion, we aim to provide consensus guidelines and recommendations on the conduct and management of tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic.","McGrath, Brendan A; Brenner, Michael J; Warrillow, Stephen J; Pandian, Vinciya; Arora, Asit; Cameron, Tanis S; Añon, José Manuel; Hernández Martínez, Gonzalo; Truog, Robert D; Block, Susan D; Lui, Grace C Y; McDonald, Christine; Rassekh, Christopher H; Atkins, Joshua; Qiang, Li; Vergez, Sébastien; Dulguerov, Pavel; Zenk, Johannes; Antonelli, Massimo; Pelosi, Paolo; Walsh, Brian K; Ward, Erin; Shang, You; Gasparini, Stefano; Donati, Abele; Singer, Mervyn; Openshaw, Peter J M; Tolley, Neil; Markel, Howard; Feller-Kopman, David J",Lancet Respir Med,243,28

As a result, individuals lost their social relationships, leading to social isolation and loneliness. Both social isolation and loneliness are major risk factors for poor physical and mental health status through enhanced chronic inflammation; however, there might be an interplay between social isolation and loneliness and the association with chronic inflammation. We aimed to clarify the link between social relationship and inflammation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by distinguishing whether social isolation only, loneliness only, or both were associated with chronic inflammation markers among community-dwelling adults. The data of 624 people (aged 18-92 years, mean 51.4) from the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) study, which targeted randomly sampled households in Utsunomiya city, Japan, were analyzed. Social isolation was assessed as a structural social network by asking the number of social roles they have on a daily basis. Loneliness was measured with the UCLA loneliness scale. As chronic inflammation biomarkers, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Generalized estimating equations method was employed to take into account the correlations within households. Isolated-Lonely condition (i.e., being both socially isolated and feeling lonely) was associated with higher NLR among men (B = 0.141, 95%CI = -0.01 to 0.29). Interestingly, Nonisolated-Lonely condition (i.e., not socially isolated but feeling lonely) was associated with lower CRP among women (B = -0.462, 95%CI = -0.82 to -0.10) and among the working-age population (B = -0.495, 95%CI = -0.76 to -0.23). In conclusion, being both social isolated and feeling lonely was associated with chronic inflammation. Assessing both social isolation and loneliness is critical for proper interventions to mitigate the impact of social relationship on health, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Koyama, Yuna; Nawa, Nobutoshi; Yamaoka, Yui; Nishimura, Hisaaki; Sonoda, Shiro; Kuramochi, Jin; Miyazaki, Yasunari; Fujiwara, Takeo",Brain Behav Immun,243,16

Combined ventilation, in which two patients are connected to a single ventilator has been proposed as a bridge while waiting for new ventilators availability. DuplicAR is a new device that allows individualization of ventilatory parameters in combined ventilation models. Materials and Methods: With an electronic circuit simulator applet, an electrical model of combined ventilation was created using resistor-capacitor circuits. The DuplicAR system electrical analog was added to the model. Through computational simulation, the model is tested in different scenarios with the aim of achieving adequate ventilation of two subjects under different circumstances: 1) two identical subjects; 2) two subjects with the same size but different lung compliance; and 3) two subjects with different size and compliance. The goal is to achieve the established load per unit of size on each capacitor under different levels of end-expiratory voltage (analog of end-expiratory pressure). Data collected included capacitor load and voltage, and load normalized to the weight of the simulated patient. Results: In the three simulated stages, it is possible to provide the proper load to each capacitor under different circumstances. If the pair of connected capacitors have different capacitances, adjustments must be made to the source voltage and/or the resistance of the DuplicAR system to provide the appropriate load for each capacitor under initial conditions. In pressure control simulation, increasing the end-expiratory voltage on one capacitor requires increasing the source voltage and the resistance on the other capacitor. On the other hand, in the volume control simulation, it is only required to intervene in the resistance. Conclusions: Under simulated conditions, the electrical model of the DuplicAR system allows individualization of combined mechanical ventilation.","Ramos, M.; Orofino, R.; Riva, D.; Biancolini, M.

With this complex public health problem, North Carolinians relied on data from state, federal, and global health organizations to increase their understanding of the pandemic and guide decision-making. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the role that stakeholders involved in COVID-19–related data played in managing the pandemic in North Carolina. The study investigated the processes used by organizations throughout the state in using, collecting, and reporting COVID-19 data. METHODS: We used an exploratory qualitative study design to investigate North Carolina’s COVID-19 data collection efforts. To better understand these processes, key informant interviews were conducted with employees from organizations that collected COVID-19 data across the state. We developed an interview guide, and open-ended semistructured interviews were conducted during the period from June through November 2020. Interviews lasted between 30 and 45 minutes and were conducted by data scientists by videoconference. Data were subsequently analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. RESULTS: Results indicated that electronic health records were primary sources of COVID-19 data. Often, data were also used to create dashboards to inform the public or other health professionals, to aid in decision-making, or for reporting purposes. Cross-sector collaboration was cited as a major success. Consistency among metrics and data definitions, data collection processes, and contact tracing were cited as challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that, during future outbreaks, organizations across regions could benefit from data centralization and data governance. Data should be publicly accessible and in a user-friendly format. Additionally, established cross-sector collaboration networks are demonstrably beneficial for public health professionals across the state as these established relationships facilitate a rapid response to evolving public health challenges.","Patterson, Jenny Rees; Shaw, Donna; Thomas, Sharita R; Hayes, Julie A; Daley, Christopher R; Knight, Stefania; Aikat, Jay; Mieczkowska, Joanna O; Ahalt, Stanley C; Krishnamurthy, Ashok K",JMIR Public Health Surveill,243,16

A significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related deaths has been reported for the United States of America and other high-income countries in Europe and Asia, regardless of advanced medical facilities in those countries. In contrast, much lower COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality rates have been documented in many low-income countries, despite having comparatively higher socioeconomic burdens and suboptimal medical facilities.

On the same day, the cumulative total of COVID-19 related morbidity for Africa was 35,954 with 3.5% of the global COVID-19 related deaths. We present arguments for the relatively low COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates in many low-income countries and discuss the critical importance of WASH for preventing the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. We observe that the key recommendations put forward by the World Health Organization to effectively control the pandemic have been difficult to implement in low-income countries.

Serological assays may improve disease management when appropriately used, for better understanding the antibody responses mounted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and for assessing its real prevalence. Although testing the whole population is impratical, well-designed serosurveys in selected subpopulations in specific risk groups may provide valuable information. Aim: we evaluated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers who underwent molecular testing with reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in the main hospitals of the Veneto Region by measuring specific antibodies (Abs). Methods: both IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 S-antigen and N-protein were measured using a validated chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) called Maglumi 2000 Plus (New Industries Biomedical EngineeringCo., Ltd [Snibe], Shenzhen, China) Results: A total of 8285 health care workers were tested. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (IgM, IgG or both) were detectable in 378 cases (4.6%, 95% CI 4.1-5.0%). Seroconversion was observed in 4.4% women and 5% men, but the difference was not significant. Although detectable antibodies were found in all severe COVID-19 patients (100%), lower seropositivity was found in mild disease (83%) and the lowest prevalence (58%) was observed in asymptomatic subjects. Conclusion: Seroprevalence surveys are of utmost importance for understanding the rate of population that has already developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The present study has the statistical power to define precisely the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of health workers in our region, with its prevalence (4.6%) reflecting a relatively low circulation. Symptomatic individuals or those hospitalized for medical care were 100% antibody positive, whilst Abs were only detectable in 58% of asymptomatic carriers.","Plebani, M.; Padoan, A.; Fedeli, U.; Schievano, E.; Vecchiato, E.; Lippi, G.; Lo Cascio, G.; Porru, S.; Palu, G.",,243,23

The real incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) as a form of COVID presentation remains to be defined. Research question Do the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of SP in COVID-19 patients attending emergency departments (ED) differ compared to COVID patients without SP and non-COVID patients with SP? Study design and methods: This case-control study retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with SP(case group) in 61 Spanish EDs(20% of Spanish EDs) and compared them with two control groups: COVID patients without SP and non-COVID patients with SP. Relative frequencies of SP were estimated in COVID and non-COVID patients in the ED and annual standardized incidences were estimated for both populations. Comparisons between cases and controls included 52 clinical, analytical and radiological characteristics and 4 outcomes. Results We identified 40 SP in 71,904 patients with COVID-19 attending EDs(0.56‰, 95%CI=0.40-0.76‰).

Compared to non-COVID patients with SP, cases differed in 19 clinical variables, the most prominent being a higher frequency of dysgeusia/anosmia, headache, diarrhea, fever and lymphopenia (all with OR>10). All the outcomes measured, including in-hospital death, were worse in cases than in both control groups. Interpretation SP as a form of COVID presentation at the ED is unusual (<1‰ cases) but is more frequent than in the non-COVID population and could be associated with worse outcomes than SP in non-COVID patients and COVID patients without SP.","Miró, Òscar; Llorens, Pere; Jiménez, Sònia; Piñera, Pascual; Burillo-Putze, Guillermo; Martín, Alfonso; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; García-Lamberetchs, Eric Jorge; Jacob, Javier; Alquézar-Arbé, Aitor; Mòdol, Josep Maria; López-Díez, María Pilar; Guardiola, Josep Maria; Cardozo, Carlos; Lucas Imbernón, Francisco Javier; Tejedo, Alfons Aguirre; García, Ángel García; Grinspan, Martín Ruiz; Roca, Ferran Llopis; González del Castillo, Juan",Chest,243,16

In particular, the asymptomatic patients have been found to induce weak and transient SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown; meanwhile, the protective immunity that guide the recovery of these asymptomatic patients is elusive. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and T-cell responses in 10 asymptomatic patients and 64 patients with other disease severity (mild, n = 10, moderate, n = 32, severe, n = 12) and found that asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients failed to mount virus-specific germinal center (GC) B cell responses that result in robust and prolonged humoral immunity, assessed by GC response indicators including follicular helper T (T(FH)) cell and memory B cell responses as well as serum CXCL13 levels. Alternatively, these patients mounted potent virus-specific T(H)1 and CD8(+) T cell responses. In sharp contrast, patients of moderate or severe disease induced vigorous virus-specific GC B cell responses and associated T(FH) responses; however, the virus-specific T(H)1 and CD8(+) T cells were minimally induced in these patients. These results, therefore, uncovered the protective immunity in asymptomatic patients and also revealed the strikingly dichotomous and incomplete humoral and cellular immune responses in COVID-19 patients with different disease severity, providing important insights into rational design of effective COVID-19 vaccines.","Gao, Leiqiong; Zhou, Jing; Yang, Sen; Wang, Lisha; Chen, Xiangyu; Yang, Yang; Li, Ren; Pan, Zhiwei; Zhao, Jing; Li, Zhirong; Huang, Qizhao; Tang, Jianfang; Hu, Li; Liu, Pinghuang; Zhang, Guozhong; Chen, Yaokai; Ye, Lilin",Signal Transduct Target Ther,243,24

The recent spread of this virus has caused a global pandemic. Currently, the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 are being established, especially the role of environmental transmission. Here we review the environmental transmission routes and persistence of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies have established that the transmission of this virus can occur, amongst others, in the air, water, soil, cold-chain, biota, and surface contact. It has also been found that the survival potential of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is dependent on different environmental conditions and pollution. Potentially important pathways include aerosol and fecal matter. Particulate matter may also be a carrier for SARS-CoV-2. Since microscopic particles can be easily absorbed by humans, more attention must be focused on the dissemination of these particles.

These cells are responsible for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns, thereby initiating a signaling cascade that results in the production of cytokines such as interferons to mitigate infections. The aim of this review is to outline recent advances in our knowledge of the roles that neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes play in initiating and coordinating host responses against viral infections. A focus is placed on myeloid cell development, trafficking and antiviral mechanisms. Although known for promoting inflammation, there is a growing body of literature which demonstrates that myeloid cells can also play critical regulatory or immunosuppressive roles, especially following the elimination of viruses. Additionally, the ability of myeloid cells to control other innate and adaptive leukocytes during viral infections situates these cells as key, yet under-appreciated mediators of pathogenic inflammation that can sometimes trigger cytokine storms. The information presented here should assist researchers in integrating myeloid cell biology into the design of novel and more effective virus-targeted therapies.","Stegelmeier, Ashley A.; van Vloten, Jacob P.; Mould, Robert C.; Klafuric, Elaine M.; Minott, Jessica A.; Wootton, Sarah K.; Bridle, Byram W.; Karimi, Khalil",Viruses,243,24

Vero cells were dually infected with ca-PEDV and one of the three chlamydial strains Chlamydia trachomatis S45, Chlamydophila abortus S26/3 or Chlamydophila pecorum 1710S. Three experimental protocols were designed varying the inoculation sequence. Cell layers were first inoculated with Chlamydiaceae and 20 h later with ca-PEDV in protocol one. In protocol two, both agents were administered concurrently, whereas in protocol three, ca-PEDV was applied 20 h in advance of the Chlamydiaceae. Immunofluorescence techniques, immunohistochemical (IH) staining and electron microscopy were subsequently employed to investigate the cell layers. Using indirect immunofluorescence (IF) labeling, all mixed infections revealed dually infected cells, however, only incidentally and in low numbers. Characteristically, ca-PEDV syncytia with one or more chlamydial inclusions were detected but dually infected single cells were absent. Some syncytial cells contained enlarged C. abortus or C. pecorum inclusions with abnormally large developmental forms. In comparison with simultaneously conducted monoinfections, larger chlamydial inclusions were observed in dually infected cell layers. Experiments with C. trachomatis showed significantly increased numbers of chlamydial inclusions in dually infected cell layers compared to monoinfected ones. These findings indicate an influence of ca-PEDV on the chlamydial developmental cycle and in the case of C. trachomatis, a positive effect on chlamydial colonization in mixed infections.","Stuedli, Angela; Grest, Paula; Schiller, Irene; Pospischil, Andreas",Vet Microbiol,243,10

Thus, the overall performance of emergency response is influenced not only by the efficiency of each department alternative but also by the coordination effect among different department alternatives. This paper proposes a collaborative emergency decision making (CEDM) approach considering the synergy among different department alternatives based on the best–worst method (BWM) and TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multiple attribute decision making) method within an interval 2-tuple linguistic environment. First, the evaluation information provided by decision makers (DMs) is represented by interval 2-tuple linguistic variables to reflect and model the underlying diversity and uncertainty. On the basis of the DMs’ evaluations, the individual and collaborative performance evaluations of multi-alternative combinations composed of different department alternatives are constructed. Then, the BWM is extended into interval 2-tuple linguistic environment to obtain the weights of evaluation criteria, where the group decision making is taken into account in an interval fuzzy mathematical programming model. Furthermore, to derive more practical and accurate decision results, an interval 2-tuple linguistic TODIM (ITL-TODIM) method is proposed by considering the DMs’ psychological behaviours. In the developed ITL-TODIM method, both the gain and loss degrees of one alternative relative to another are simultaneously computed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. Sensitivity and comparative analyses are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.","Qi, Kaixuan; Chai, Hua; Duan, Qiangling; Du, Yongjian; Wang, Qingsong; Sun, Jinhua; Liew, K.

With the unfortunate arrival of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), PACT CPS were duty‐bound to expand telehealth services at an accelerated rate. The purpose of this quality improvement analysis is to compare CPS efficiency as well as some objective patient metrics to assess for a change in the quality of care. This is the first study to compare the efficiency and quality of care by CPS in the VA pre‐COVID19 and during the COVID19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of PACT CPS comprehensive medication management from 3/10/19 to 11/30/19 and 3/10/20 to 11/30/20. Data points focused on clinic encounters, patient accountability to appointments, disease state expansion, and markers of disease‐state management. Given diabetes and hypertension are the main disease states managed by most PACT CPS', the study evaluated changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood pressure (BP) between the two cohorts as well. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Software or Microsoft Excel. A student T‐test was used for continuous data and Chi‐squared or Fishers Exact for nominal data. RESULTS: The total number of PACT CPS encounters increased 32% in 2020, and the number of unique patients increased by 12%. There were a statistically significant increase in telephone and direct‐to‐consumer (DCT) video visits. The rates of no shows and cancellations significantly decreased between 2019 and 2020. There was no difference in the average change in HbA1c or average blood pressure between the two study groups.

Such a scenario recapitulates the ideas of J. B. S. Haldane sketched in his classic 1928 essay. However, unlike in Haldane's day, considerable support for this scenario exits today: lack of homology between core DNA replication system components in archaea and bacteria, distinct membrane chemistries and enzymes of lipid biosynthesis in archaea and bacteria, spread of several viral hallmark genes among diverse groups of viruses, and the extant archaeal and bacterial chromosomes appear to be shaped by accretion of diverse, smaller replicons. Under the viral model of precellular evolution, the key components of cells originated as components of virus‐like entities.

The objective of this paper is to study whether the novel coronavirus has also been associated with an increase in deaths in England and Wales for those who have not contracted the disease. Reasons behind this may include avoiding visits to hospitals or GPs, and the effects of the lockdown. Methods: I used weekly ONS data on the number of deaths that did not involve covid-19 over the period 2015-2020. Simply observing trends is not sufficient as spikes in deaths may occasionally occur. I thus followed a differences-in-differences econometric approach to study whether there was a relative increase in non-covid-19 deaths during the pandemic, compared to a control. As an additional approach, an interrupted time series model was also used. Results: Results suggest that there were an additional 531 non-covid-19 deaths in England and Wales since the outbreak of the pandemic, compared to what would have otherwise been expected [diff-in-diff interaction coeff: 531.11; 95%CI: 125.65 to 936.57]. This is confirmed by the interrupted time series model. Discussion: The health effects of covid-19 do not seem to be limited only to patients suffering from the disease, as the number of deaths for those who did not contract covid-19 has also demonstrated an absolute and relative increase. Analysing the cause of death for non-covid-19 deaths will shed light upon the reasons for the increase in such deaths and will help design appropriate policy responses to save lives.","Vandoros, Sotiris",,243,16

The present cross-sectional study aims to investigate the perceived risk and protective behaviors regarding COVID-19 among pregnant women, in Hamadan, Iran. Using a two-stage cluster sampling method, 225 pregnant women referring to the health centers completed the questionnaires. Data were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman correlation tests as well as a stepwise linear regression model at 95% confidence level. RESULTS: 93.8% of pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, 97.3% had a high performance in protective behaviors, and 72.9% had a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19. The highest mean score of knowledge was observed in women who had a history of influenza in their previous pregnancies (90.97 ± 5.94). The mean score of protective behaviors was significantly higher in women with a high economic level (97.78 ± 5.11), and the highest level of risk perception was observed in nulliparous women (59.97 ± 9.80). Risk perception was an independent predictor of protective behaviors related to COVID-19 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, high performance in protective behaviors, and a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19. History of influenza in previous pregnancies, high economic level, and nulliparity were associated with higher levels of knowledge, protective behaviors, and risk perception, respectively. Risk perception of pregnant women regarding COVID-19 can predict their protective behaviors.","Aghababaei, Soodabeh; Bashirian, Saeed; Soltanian, Alireza; Refaei, Mansoureh; Omidi, Tahereh; Ghelichkhani, Samereh; Soltani, Farzaneh",Middle East Fertil Soc J,243,16

The clinical symptoms include contractures of the joints of limbs, especially camptodactyly of the hands and/or feet, unilateral ptosis, a round-shaped face, arched eyebrows, and micrognathia, without ophthalmoplegia. ECEL1 is a DA5D causative gene that encodes a membrane-bound metalloprotease. ECEL1 plays important roles in the final axonal arborization of motor nerves in limb skeletal muscles and neuromuscular junction formation during prenatal development. METHODS: A DA5D family with webbing of the elbows and fingers was recruited. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and filtered mutations by disease-causing genes of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC). Mutational analysis and cosegregation confirmation were then performed. RESULTS: We identified novel compound heterozygous mutations of ECEL1 (NM_004826: c.69C>A, p.C23∗ and c.1810G>A, p.G604R) in the proband. CONCLUSIONS: We detected causative mutations in a DA5D family, expanding the spectrum of known ECEL1 mutations and contributing to the clinical diagnosis of DA5D.","Jin, Jie-Yuan; Liu, Dan-Yu; Jiao, Zi-Jun; Dong, Yi; Li, Jie; Xiang, Rong",Biomed Res Int,243,24

This study aims to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 to provide reference for clinical work. Methods The clinical features and outcomes of 10 pregnant women confirmed with COVID-19 at Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, a tertiary- care teaching hospital in Hubei province, Wuhan, China from January 23 to February 23, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results All the 10 observed pregnant women including 9 singletons and 1 twin were native people in Wuhan. All of them were diagnosed mild COVID-19, and none one of the patients developed severe COVID-19 or died. Among the 10 patients, two patients underwent vaginal delivery, two patients underwent intrapartum cesarean section, and the remaining six patients underwent elective cesarean section. All of 10 patients showed lung abnormalities by pulmonary CT images after delivery. Their eleven newborns were recorded and no neonatal asphyxia was observed. Conclusions Pulmonary CT screening on admission may be necessary to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 during the outbreak period.

The aim of this study was to recover the epidemiological history of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Brazil. A descriptive study was conducted in 2009-2010. The Brazilian Information System for reportable diseases (SINAN) was the data source. A total of 105,054 suspected cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were reported to SINAN. Of these, 53,797 (51.2%) were classified as the new influenza virus subtype. Among the confirmed cases, 56.7% were female, the mean age was 26.31 (SD ± 18.1) years. Fever was the most common sign among the confirmed cases (99.7%) and the presence of comorbidities was reported in 32.5% of cases. In 2009 there were confirmed cases in all 26 Brazilian States and the Federal District. The incidence (per 100,000 inhabitants) of severe influenza in the population was 28.0 in 2009 and 0.5 in 2010. The states of Paraná (301.3), Santa Catarina (36.0) and Rio Grande do Sul (27.4) presented the highest incidence; 46.4% of the confirmed cases were hospitalized and 47,643 were cured (93.8%). The case-fatality rate was 3.9% in 2009. The pandemic virus A(H1N1)pdm09 hit Brazil between April/2009 and December/2010 with an important difference in the geographic pattern distribution of the cases from the northeast to the south of the country.

During this time, there has been a rapid expansion of telemedicine and its implementation in various clinical specialties and settings. In this observational study we aim to examine the utility of telemedicine in a pediatric rheumatology clinic, for 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A review of outpatient pediatric rheumatology telemedicine encounters were conducted from April–June 2020. Telemedicine visits (n = 75) were compared to patients seen in practice over the prior year in office-based visits (March 2019–March 2020) (n = 415). Patient characteristics, information on no-show visits, completed visits, new patient or follow-up status, and if new patients had received a visit within 2 weeks of calling to schedule an appointment were analyzed by chart review. An independent sample t-test and Chi Square statistic was used to determine statical significance between the two groups. A two-proportion z-test was used to compare visit metrics. RESULTS: The percentage of new patients utilizing telemedicine (60%) was lower and statistically significant compared to the percentage of new patient office visits (84%) the previous year (p < 0.0001). There was no change in no-show rate between groups and patient characteristics were similar. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a statistically significant decrease in new patient visits during the pandemic with telemedicine-only appointments compared to in-office visits over the previous year. This suggests a possible hesitation to seek care during this time. However, there was no significant difference among patient characteristics between telemedicine visits during the pandemic and during in-office visits in the previous year. In our experience, patient visits were able to be conducted via telemedicine with a limited physical exam using caregiver’s help during the pandemic. However, further studies will need to ascertain patient satisfaction and preference for telemedicine in the future.","Perdue, Ashley; Mullett, Charles; Umer, Amna; Rosen, Paul",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,243,30

Imaging results served as the reference standard for pleural effusion. All patients underwent a comprehensive lung physical examination and a bedside US examination by two researchers blinded to the imaging results. RESULTS: Physical examination was less accurate than US (sensitivity of 44.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.0–58.8%], specificity 88.9% (95% CI 65.3–98.6%), positive likelihood (LR) 3.96 (95% CI 1.03–15.18), negative LR 0.63 (95% CI 0.47–0.85) for physical examination; sensitivity 98% (95% CI 89.4–100%), specificity 94.4% (95% CI 72.7–99.9%), positive LR 17.6 (95% CI 2.6–118.6), negative LR 0.02 (95% CI 0.00–0.15) for US).

Rotavirus A (RVA) is the main pathogen associated with neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD), a syndrome that leads to significant economic losses to the livestock industry. The aims of this study are to determine the frequency of RVA infections, and to analyze the genetic diversity of RVA strains in calves in Uruguay. A total of 833 samples from dairy and beef calves were analyzed through RT-qPCR and sequencing. RVA was detected in 57.0% of the samples. The frequency of detection was significantly higher in dairy (59.5%) than beef (28.4%) calves (p < 0.001), while it did not differ significantly among calves born in herds that were vaccinated (64.0%) or not vaccinated (66.7%) against NCD.

To co-design a prototype intervention informed by the programme theory. DESIGN: Realist synthesis combining evidence from a wide range of rich and relevant literature with stakeholder views. Resulting context, mechanism and outcome statements informed co-design and knowledge mobilisation workshops with stakeholders to develop a primary care service innovation. RESULTS: A taxonomy was produced, including 13 categories of physical activity interventions for people with long-term conditions. ABRIDGED REALIST PROGRAMME THEORY: Routinely addressing physical activity within consultations is dependent on a reinforcing practice culture, and targeted resources, with better coordination, will generate more opportunities to address low physical activity. The adaptation of physical activity promotion to individual needs and preferences of people with long-term conditions helps affect positive patient behaviour change. Training can improve knowledge, confidence and capability of practice staff to better promote physical activity. Engagement in any physical activity promotion programme will depend on the degree to which it makes sense to patients and professions, and is seen as trustworthy. CO-DESIGN: The programme theory informed the co-design of a prototype intervention to: improve physical literacy among practice staff; describe/develop the role of a physical activity advisor who can encourage the use of local opportunities to be more active; and provide materials to support behaviour change. CONCLUSIONS: Previous physical activity interventions in primary care have had limited effect. This may be because they have only partially addressed factors emerging in our programme theory. The co-designed prototype intervention aims to address all elements of this emergent theory, but needs further development and consideration alongside current schemes and contexts (including implications relevant to COVID-19), and testing in a future study.

R3.6.2 was used for data cleaning, SPSS 26.0 was used to conduct corresponding statistical analysis, and a two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. (3) Results: According to our study, the proportion of participants who wore face masks was higher than 90.0% in both surveys. Single factor analysis showed that the proportion of people wearing face masks raised with the increase of people’s education, age, and monthly income (Yuan) in both surveys. People who lived in rural areas were less likely to wear masks. Mask-wearing rate was lower in the isolated individuals than in the non-isolated ones. (4) Conclusions: Masks-wearing is one of the effective measures for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control. After the Chinese government made wearing face masks mandatory in public places, most residents in China had developed the habit of wearing masks, contributing to the high rate of masks-wearing in China. However, people in rural areas need to raise their awareness of wearing masks. Meanwhile, the mask-wearing of the isolated individuals needs to be enhanced.","Zhang, Ling; Zhu, Sirong; Yao, Hui; Li, Mengying; Si, Guanglin; Tan, Xiaodong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,243,18

Here we conceptualized the temporospatial evolutionary and expansion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 by taking a series of cross-sectional view of viral genomes from early outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan to early phase of global ignition in early April, and finally to the subsequent global expansion by late December 2020. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the early patients in Wuhan, Wuhan/WH04/2020 is supposed to be a more appropriate reference genome of SARS-CoV-2, instead of the first sequenced genome Wuhan-Hu-1. By scrutinizing the cases from the very early outbreak, we found a viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations (i.e. M type) had become the overwhelmingly dominant genotype (95.3%) of the pandemic one year later. By analyzing 4,013 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different continents by early April, we were able to interrogate the viral genomic composition dynamics of initial phase of global ignition over a timespan of 14-week. 11 major viral genotypes with unique geographic distributions were also identified. WE1 type, a descendant of M and predominantly witnessed in western Europe, consisted a half of all the cases (50.2%) at the time. The mutations of major genotypes at the same hierarchical level were mutually exclusive, which implying that various genotypes bearing the specific mutations were propagated during human-to-human transmission, not by accumulating hot-spot mutations during the replication of individual viral genomes. As the pandemic was unfolding, we also used the same approach to analyze 261,323 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world since the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e. including all the publicly available viral genomes) in order to recapitulate our findings over one-year timespan. By 25 December 2020, 95.3% of global cases were M type and 93.0% of M-type cases were WE1. In fact, at present all the four variants of concern (VOC) are the descendants of WE1 type. This study demonstrates the viral genotypes can be utilized as molecular barcodes in combination with epidemiologic data to monitor the spreading routes of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. Moreover, the dynamics of viral mutational spectrum in the study may help the early identification of new strains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, guide the development of molecular diagnosis and vaccines against COVID-19, and help assess their accuracy and efficacy in real world at real time.","Chen, Yan; Li, Shiyong; Wu, Wei; Geng, Shuaipeng; Mao, Mao",bioRxiv,243,28

The infection curve could be flattened by the rapid implementation of simple distance and hygiene measures. In order to ensure current and future patient care in conjunction with protection of medical personnel working in the healthcare system during this pandemic, adequate protective equipment is essential. Routine care can only be resumed if there is sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). If recommended hygiene protective measures including the necessary PPE are seriously taken into account both elective interventions and emergency care can be carried out without an increased risk of infection. This is very important in vascular surgery with a high proportion of urgent and emergency disease management.","Bresler, A.-M.; Bischoff, M. S.; Böckler, D.",Gefasschirurgie,243,2

Apart from the bibliographical study regarding the works of numerous authors, we state our results concerning the study of the experimental reproduction of the disease. From all the cat infectious diseases, Feline Infectious Peritonitis is the clinical entity the most recently evidenced. In this paper we shall state the elements now clearly established on this disease but numerous points are still to be made clear. Contagious disease of viral origin, it affects domestic and wild Felidae. Clinically, in its most typical form, it is characterised by the progressive development of an exudative sero-fibrinous peritonitis and a febrile and gradual weakness of the general condition. It slowly and regularly develops into death.","Chappuis, G; Duret, C","Comparative Immunology, Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",243,24

DESIGN: Thematic analysis of free-text responses to an open-ended online survey. SETTING: Between March and November 2019, we recruited 88 patients (82% women) and 14 carers aged ≥18 years from 16 English mental health trusts, community organisations, and via social media. RESULTS: Psychosocial assessments were experienced as helpful on some occasions but harmful on others. Participants felt better, less suicidal and less likely to repeat self-harm after good-quality compassionate and supportive assessments. However, negative experiences during the assessment pathway were common and, in some cases, contributed to greater distress, less engagement and further self-harm. Participants reported receiving negative and stigmatising comments about their injuries. Others reported that they were refused medical care or an anaesthetic. Stigmatising attitudes among some mental health staff centred on preconceived ideas over self-harm as a ‘behavioural issue’, inappropriate use of services and psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight important patient experiences that can inform service provision and they demonstrate the value of involving patients/carers throughout the research process. Psychosocial assessments can be beneficial when empathetic and collaborative but less helpful when overly standardised, lacking in compassion and waiting times are unduly long. Patient views are essential to inform practice, particularly given the rapidly changing service context during and after the COVID-19 emergency.","Quinlivan, Leah M; Gorman, Louise; Littlewood, Donna L; Monaghan, Elizabeth; Barlow, Steven J; Campbell, Stephen M; Webb, Roger T; Kapur, Navneet",BMJ Open,243,1

These glycoproteins undergo large-scale irreversible refolding during membrane fusion. The paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) mediates membrane merger through its fusion protein (F). The transmembrane (TM) domains of viral fusion proteins are typically required for fusion. The TM domain of F is particularly interesting in that it is potentially unusually long; multiple calculations suggest a TM helix length between 25 and 48 residues. Oxidative cross-linking of single cysteine substitutions indicates the F TM trimer forms a helical bundle within the membrane. To assess the functional role of the PIV5 F protein TM domain, alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed. Two residues located in the outer leaflet of the bilayer are critical for fusion. Multiple amino acid substitutions at these positions indicate the physical properties of the side chain play a critical role in supporting or blocking fusion. Analysis of intermediate steps in F protein refolding indicated that the mutants were not trapped at the open stalk intermediate or the prehairpin intermediate. Incorporation of a known F protein destabilizing mutation that causes a hyperfusogenic phenotype restored fusion activity to the mutants. Further, altering the curvature of the lipid bilayer by addition of oleic acid promoted fusion of the F protein mutants. In aggregate, these data indicate that the TM domain plays a functional role in fusion beyond merely anchoring the protein in the viral envelope and that it can affect the structures and steady-state concentrations of the various conformational intermediates en route to the final postfusion state. We suggest that the unusual length of this TM helix might allow it to serve as a template for formation of or specifically stabilize the lipid stalk intermediate in fusion.","Bissonnette, Mei Lin Z.; Donald, Jason E.; DeGrado, William F.; Jardetzky, Theodore S.; Lamb, Robert A.",Journal of Molecular Biology,243,1

Methods: Hospital Episode Statistics national data was extracted between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2019, and followed up until 31 March 2020. All those within England with a diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension were included. Those with secondary causes of raised intracranial pressure such as tumors, hydrocephalus and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis were excluded. Results: 28,794 new IIH cases were diagnosed between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2019. Incidence rose between 2002 to 2019 from 1.8 to 5.2 per 100,000 in the general population. Peak incidence occurred in females aged 25–29 years. Neurosurgical shunt was the commonest procedure performed (6.4%), followed by neovascular venous sinus stenting (1%), bariatric surgery (0.8%) and optic nerve sheath fenestration (0.5%). The portion of the total IIH population requiring a shunt fell from 10.8% in 2002/2003 to 2.46% in 2018/2019. The portion of the total IIH population requiring shunt revision also reduced over time from 4.84% in 2002/2003 to 0.44% in 2018/2019. The mean 30 days emergency readmissions for primary shunt, revision of shunt, bariatric surgery, neurovascular stent, and optic nerve sheath fenestration was 23.1%, 23.7%, 10.6%, 10.0% and 9.74%, respectively. There was a peak 30 days readmission rate following primary shunt in 2018/2019 of 41%. Recording of severe visual impairment fell to an all-time low of 1.38% in 2018/19. Conclusions: Increased awareness of the condition, specialist surgery and expert guidance may be changing admissions and surgical trends in IIH. The high 30 readmission following primary shunt surgery for IIH requires further investigation.","Mollan, Susan P.; Mytton, Jemma; Tsermoulas, Georgios; Sinclair, Alex J.",Life (Basel),243,1

Seventy-three consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients (median age, 65 years) were recruited. Serial plasma (n = 340) specimens were collected. A lateral flow immunochromatography assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used for SARS-CoV-2 N protein detection and RNA quantitation and in plasma, respectively. Serum levels of inflammatory and tissue-damage biomarkers in paired specimens were measured. SARS-CoV-RNA N-antigenemia and viral RNAemia were documented in 40.1% and 35.6% of patients, respectively at a median of 9 days since symptoms onset. The level of agreement between the qualitative results returned by the N-antigenemia assay and plasma RT-PCR was moderate (k = 0.57; p < 0.0001). A trend towards higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads was seen in plasma specimens testing positive for N-antigenemia assay than in those yielding negative results (p = 0.083). SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in tracheal aspirates was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the presence of concomitant N-antigenemia than in its absence. Significantly higher serum levels of ferritin, lactose dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer were quantified in paired plasma SARS-CoV-2 N-positive specimens than in those testing negative. Occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 N-antigenemia was not associated with increased mortality in univariate logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-3.34; p = 0.59). In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 N-antigenemia detection is relatively common in ICU patients and appears to associate with increased serum levels of inflammation and tissue-damage markers. Whether this virological parameter may behave as a biomarker of poor clinical outcome awaits further investigations.","Olea, Beatriz; Albert, Eliseo; Torres, Ignacio; Gozalbo-Rovira, Roberto; Carbonell, Nieves; Ferreres, José; Poujois, Sandrine; Costa, Rosa; Colomina, Javier; Rodríguez-Díaz, Jesús; Blasco, María L; Navarro, David",J. med. virol,243,26

The factors influencing NPPV failure are still elusive. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between semiquantitative chest computed tomography (CT) scoring and NPPV failure and mortality in patients with COVID-19 Design Observational study Setting Non-intensive setting of care Participants N=112 patients consecutively admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia. Interventions Usual care including various degrees of respiratory support Measurements and Main Results The semi-quantitative CT-score was calculated at hospital admission. Subgroups were identified according to the ventilation strategy used (oxygen delivered by Venturi mask n=53; NPPV-responder n=38; NPPV-failure n=21). The study's primary endpoint was the use of NPPV. The secondary endpoints were NPPV failure and in-hospital death, respectively. CT-score progressively increased among groups (6 vs 9 vs 14, p<0.05 between all). CT-score was an independent predictor of all study endpoints (primary endpoint: 1.25 [95% CI 1.1-1.4], p=0.001; NPPV failure: 1.41 [95% CI 1.18-1.69], p<0.001; in-hospital mortality: 1.21 [95% CI 1.07-1.38], p=0.003).

Fewer than half of adults get a flu shot in the United States in a typical year, and a large minority of Americans say they will not get vaccinated against COVID-19. This resistance to vaccines creates challenges for both public health and the economy. The academic literature needs to consider potential policy solutions that might increase vaccination rates. In this study, we use experimental auctions to estimate how much university students need to be paid in exchange for agreeing to get a flu shot. These were real auctions where winners received compensation to get the flu shot. As found in prior research, the perceived stakes of such auctions incentivize participants to estimate the price at which they would engage in the auctioned behavior – in this instance, receiving a flu shot. We find that 50% require less than $1, and an additional 30% would get vaccinated for a payment of $20 or less. We also use a tobit regression to estimate bids as a function of participants’ demographic characteristics. If low levels of compensation increase vaccination rates, this has significant public health implications. The government may be able to achieve higher vaccination rates at a relatively low cost, particularly in comparison with the economic harms caused by illness. This study demonstrates that experimental auctions may be useful for estimating how much a larger, more representative sample would need to be paid in exchange for agreeing to receive flu or COVID-19 vaccinations.","Clark, Nick; Corrigan, Jay R.; Rousu, Matthew C.",Prev Med Rep,243,2

At the end of 2020, a variant named 20I/501Y.V1 (lineage B.1.1.7) emerged and replaced other circulating strains in several regions. This phenomenon has been poorly associated to biological evidence that this variant and original strain exhibit different phenotypic characteristics. Here, we analyse the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain (lineage B1). Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However, when both viruses were put in competition in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that this new variant replicates more efficiently and could contribute to better understand the progressive replacement of circulating strains by the SARS-CoV-2 20I/501Y.V1 variant. Importance The emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants raised numerous questions concerning the future course of the pandemic. We are currently observing a replacement of the circulating viruses by the variant from the United Kingdom known as 20I/501Y.V1 from B.1.1.7 lineage but there is little biological evidence that this new variant exhibit a different phenotype. In the present study, we used different cellular models to assess the replication ability of the 20I/501Y.V1 variant. Our results showed that this variant replicate more efficiently in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, which may explain why it spreads so rapidly in human populations.","Touret, Franck; Luciani, Léa; Baronti, Cécile; Cochin, Maxime; Driouich, Jean-Sélim; Gilles, Magali; Thirion, Laurence; Nougairède, Antoine; de Lamballerie, Xavier",bioRxiv,243,33

Due to its high economic toll and its impact on personal freedom, we need to ease social distancing and deploy alternative measures, while preventing further waves of infections. While reliable mass testing (for virus RNA) would require too many resources to be effective, CT, which focuses on isolating symptomatic cases and their contacts, has been implemented in many countries. However, the latter approach has reduced efficiency when high numbers of positive patients are burdening the tracing centers. Moreover, CT misses transmissions by asymptomatic cases. Therefore, its effect in reducing the reproduction number has a theoretical limit. To improve effectiveness of contact tracing, we propose to complement it with a strategy relying on identifying and testing symptom free subgroups with a significantly higher than average virus prevalence. We call this smart testing (ST). By testing everybody in these subgroups, in addition to symptomatic cases, also large fractions of pre- and asymptomatic persons can be identified, which enhances the effectiveness of contact tracing. High prevalence subgroups can be found in different ways, which are discussed in this paper. A particularly efficient way is via preselection using cheap and fast virus antigen tests, as proposed recently. Mathematical modeling quantifies the potential reduction of the reproduction number by such a two-stage ST strategy. In addition to global scenarios, also more realistic local applications of two-stage ST have been investigated, that is, within counties, institutions, schools, companies, etc., where members have internal as well as external contacts. All involved model parameters have been varied within realistic ranges and results are presented with probabilities. Even with the most pessimistic parameter set, these results suggest that the effect of two-stage ST on the reproduction number would clearly outweigh its economic cost. Two-stage ST is technically and logistically feasible. Further, it is locally effective also when only applied within small local subpopulations. Thereby, two-stage ST efficiently complements the portfolio of mitigation strategies, which allow easing social distancing without compromising public health.","Gorji, H.; Arnoldini, M.; Jenny, D.

We conducted this study on 3194 patients (46% male with mean age 56.7 (±16.8), 56% African American, 7% Hispanic) flagged as COVID-19 positive cases in 12 centers under Emory Healthcare network from February 2020 to September 2020, to assess whether a COVID-19 positive patient’s need for hospitalization can be predicted at the time of RT-PCR test using the EMR data prior to the test. Five main modalities of EMR, i.e., demographics, medication, past medical procedures, comorbidities, and laboratory results, were used as features for predictive modeling, both individually and fused together using late, middle, and early fusion. Models were evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F1-score (within 95% confidence interval). The early fusion model is the most effective predictor with 84% overall F1-score [CI 82.1–86.1]. The predictive performance of the model drops by 6 % when using recent clinical data while omitting the long-term medical history. Feature importance analysis indicates that history of cardiovascular disease, emergency room visits in the past year prior to testing, and demographic factors are predictive of the disease trajectory. We conclude that fusion modeling using medical history and current treatment data can forecast the need for hospitalization for patients infected with COVID-19 at the time of the RT-PCR test.","Tariq, Amara; Celi, Leo Anthony; Newsome, Janice M.; Purkayastha, Saptarshi; Bhatia, Neal Kumar; Trivedi, Hari; Gichoya, Judy Wawira; Banerjee, Imon",NPJ Digit Med,243,6

OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy and the vaccination rate and examines the association between factors of the health belief model (HBM) and vaccination. METHODS: A convenience sample of 2531 valid participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions of mainland China were enrolled in this online survey study from January 1 to 24, 2021. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the associations of the vaccination rate and HBM factors with the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy after other covariates were controlled. RESULTS: The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 44.3% (95% CI 42.3%-46.2%), and the vaccination rate was 10.4% (9.2%-11.6%). The factors that directly promoted vaccination behavior were a lack of vaccine hesitancy (odds ratio [OR] 7.75, 95% CI 5.03-11.93), agreement with recommendations from friends or family for vaccination (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.75-5.52), and absence of perceived barriers to COVID-19 vaccination (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.35-0.75). The factors that were directly associated with a higher vaccine hesitancy rate were a high level of perceived barriers (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.36-1.95) and perceived benefits (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.79). A mediating effect of self-efficacy, influenced by perceived barriers (standardized structure coefficient [SSC]=−0.71, P<.001), perceived benefits (SSC=0.58, P<.001), agreement with recommendations from authorities (SSC=0.27, P<.001), and agreement with recommendations from friends or family (SSC=0.31, P<.001), was negatively associated with vaccination (SSC=−0.45, P<.001) via vaccine hesitancy (SSC=−0.32, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to increase the vaccination rate by reducing vaccine hesitancy and perceived barriers to vaccination and by encouraging volunteers to advocate for vaccination to their friends and family members. It is also important to reduce vaccine hesitancy by enhancing self-efficacy for vaccination, due to its crucial mediating function.","Chen, Hao; Li, Xiaomei; Gao, Junling; Liu, Xiaoxi; Mao, Yimeng; Wang, Ruru; Zheng, Pinpin; Xiao, Qianyi; Jia, Yingnan; Fu, Hua; Dai, Junming",J Med Internet Res,243,20

The aim of this study was to develop a model to simulate the effect of undocumented infections, seasonal infectivity, immunity, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in New York State (NYS) based on data collected between March 4 and April 28, 2020. Simulations predict that undocumented infections significantly contribute to infectivity, NPIs are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality, and relaxation >50% of NPIs from initial lock-down levels may result in tens-of-thousands more deaths. Endemic infection is likely to occur in the absence of sustained immunity. As a result, until an effective vaccine or other effective pharmaceutical intervention is developed, the risks of significantly reducing NPIs should be carefully considered.

The newly evolved strains and scarcity of vaccines has worsened the situation. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 can act as a potential target due to its role in viral replication and conservation level. METHODS: In this study, we have enlisted more than 1100 phytochemicals from Asian plants based on deep literature mining. The compounds library was screened against the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The selected three ligands, Flemichin, Delta-Oleanolic acid, and Emodin 1-O-beta-D-glucoside had a binding energy of -8.9, -8.9, -8.7 KJ/mol respectively. The compounds bind to the active groove of the main protease at; Cys145, Glu166, His41, Met49, Pro168, Met165, Gln189.

It has not been determined whether porcine IFITMs (pIFITMs) inhibit infection by pseudorabies virus (PRV), an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus, which is the etiological agent of Aujeszky’s disease in pigs. Here, we report that PRV infection elicited pIFITM1 expression in PK15 porcine kidney epithelial cells and 3D4/21 alveolar macrophages. pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 expression was only elevated in PK15 cells during PRV infection. Depletion of pIFITM1 using RNA interference, either in PK15 or in 3D4/21 cells, enhanced PRV infection while overexpression of pIFITM1 had the opposite effect. Knockdown of pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 did not influence PRV infection, suggesting that pIFITM2 and pIFITM3 are independent of PRV infection. PRV-induced pIFITM1 expression was dependent on the cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3 innate immune pathway and interferon-alpha receptor-1, suggesting that pIFITM1 is up-regulated by the type I interferon signaling pathway. The anti-PRV role of pIFITM1 was inhibited upon PRV entry. Our data demonstrate that pIFITM1 is a host restriction factor that inhibits PRV entry that may shed light on a strategy for prevention of PRV infection.","Wang, Jiang; Wang, Chun-Feng; Ming, Sheng-Li; Li, Guo-Li; Zeng, Lei; Wang, Meng-Di; Su, Bing-Qian; Wang, Qi; Yang, Guo-Yu; Chu, Bei-Bei",Int J Biol Macromol,243,1

We combined the use of WBE of two wastewater treatment plants with epidemiological surveillance of the corresponding populations. We applied two viral concentration methods (polyethylene glycol precipitation and aluminum-based adsorption-flocculation) and RNA isolation methods in each wastewater sample to increase the possibility of detection and quantification of nucleocapsid markers (N1 and N2) of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Overall, our results allowed us to trace the rise, exponential growth, plateau, and fall of SARS-CoV-2 infections for 26 weeks. Individual analysis for each wastewater treatment plant showed a positive correlation between the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers and COVID-19 cases that were diagnosed per week.

Tele–mental health was rapidly implemented to deliver health care services. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to present state-of-the-art tele–mental health research, (2) to survey mental health providers about care delivery during the pandemic, and (3) to assess patient satisfaction with tele–mental health. METHODS: Document clustering was applied to map research topics within tele–mental health research. A survey was circulated among mental health providers. Patient satisfaction was investigated through a meta-analysis of studies that compared satisfaction scores between tele–mental health and face-to-face interventions for mental health disorders, retrieved from Web of Knowledge and Scopus. Hedges g was used as the effect size measure, and effect sizes were pooled using a random-effect model. Sources of heterogeneity and bias were examined. RESULTS: Evidence on tele–mental health has been accumulating since 2000, especially regarding service implementation, depressive or anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and special populations. Research was concentrated in a few countries. The survey (n=174 respondents from Italy, n=120 international) confirmed that, after the onset of COVID-19 outbreak, there was a massive shift from face-to-face to tele–mental health delivery of care. However, respondents held skeptical views about tele–mental health and did not feel sufficiently trained and satisfied. Meta-analysis of 29 studies (n=2143) showed that patients would be equally satisfied with tele–mental health as they are with face-to-face interventions (Hedges g=−0.001, 95% CI −0.116 to 0.114, P=.98, Q=43.83, I(2)=36%, P=.03) if technology-related issues were minimized.

In this report, recombinant PPV (plum pox virus) NIa protease was employed to process fusion proteins with artificial cleavage site in vitro. Characteristics such as catalytic ability and affecting factors (salt, temperature, protease inhibitors, detergents, and denaturing reagents) were investigated. Recombinant PPV NIa protease expressed and purified from Escherichia coli demonstrated efficient and specific processing of recombinant GFP and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein, with site F (N V V V H Q▾A) for PPV NIa protease artificially inserted between the fusion tags and the target proteins. Its catalytic capability is similar to those of TVMV and TEV NIa protease. Recombinant PPV NIa protease reached its maximal proteolytic activity at approximately 30 °C.

Molecular tests that detect viral RNAs or antigens will be unable to rise to this challenge unless testing capacity increases by at least an order of magnitude while decreasing turnaround times. Here, we evaluate an alternative strategy based on the monitoring of olfactory dysfunction, a symptom identified in 76–83% of SARS-CoV-2 infections—including those with no other symptoms—when a standardized olfaction test is used. We model how screening for olfactory dysfunction, with reflexive molecular tests, could be beneficial in reducing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 by varying testing frequency and the prevalence, duration, and onset time of olfactory dysfunction. We find that monitoring olfactory dysfunction could reduce spread via regular screening, and could reduce risk when used at point-of-entry for single-day events. In light of these estimated impacts, and because olfactory tests can be mass produced at low cost and self-administered, we suggest that screening for olfactory dysfunction could be a high impact and cost-effective method for broad COVID-19 screening and surveillance.","Larremore, Daniel B.; Toomre, Derek; Parker, Roy",Nat Commun,243,24

During the emergency state declared in Portugal in the months of March and April 2020, there was a severe reduction in medical activity in order to reduce the pressure on health systems. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology departments across Portugal and the strategies developed to overcome this challenge. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study based on an online survey. A detailed questionnaire concerning different aspects of gastroenterology department activity was sent via e-mail to the heads of gastroenterology departments of Portuguese District Hospitals (Núcleo de Gastroenterologia dos Hospitais Distritais). Two periods were assessed, i.e., the emergency state and the recovery period between May and September. The responses were collected between September and October 2020. RESULTS: A total of 21 hospitals were enrolled (80.8% response rate). Twenty-eight percent of the responders reported healthcare professionals from their unit infected with COVID-19. At least 1 member (mostly fellows) of the department was deployed to another workplace in 66.7% of the hospitals. During the emergency state, 47.6% of the hospitals only performed urgent/emergent endoscopic procedures. In 38.5% of the hospitals the need to ration personal protective equipment led to the suspension of endoscopic training. Regarding the recovery period, nonurgent procedures were restarted in almost all of the centers. The same was reported for the colorectal cancer screening program. Remarkably, 81% of the responders confirmed that they had postponed procedures at patients' request for “fear of getting infected.” Remote consultation was maintained in 81% of the hospitals. Globally, the fellows had resumed their training. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This study provides a snapshot of the impact and consequences of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic across Portuguese hospitals. It is important to understand how the gastroenterology world dealt with the first impact of COVID-19 and what strategies were implemented in order to better prepare for what might follow.","Leal, Tiago; Gonçalves, Margarida; Mocanu, Irina; Carvalho, Rita; Glória, Luísa",GE Port J Gastroenterol,243,21

Associated surveillance of S. aureus transmission quantifies the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. We evaluated appropriate sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. We used historical cohort data from multiple hospitals. There was absence of serial correlation among observed counts of transmitted isolates within each of several periods (all P ≥.18). Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had observed transmission (all P ≥.23). Most pairs of cases had no detected transmitted isolates. Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site infection (P =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (P =.25). Therefore, we recommend analyzing the presence/absence of transmission. The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare the proportion of pairs of cases with S. aureus transmission to an acceptable threshold. An appropriate sample size for this screening is N =25 pairs. If significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to reduce transmission and infections. Subsequent sampling is done to evaluate effectiveness. The two independent binomial proportions are compared using Boschloo's exact test. The total sample size for the 1(st) and 2(nd) stage is N =100 pairs. Because S. aureus transmission is invisible without testing, when choosing what population(s) to screen for surveillance, another endpoint needs to be used (e.g., infections). Only 10/298 combinations of specialty and operating room were relatively common (≥1.0% of cases) and had expected incidence ≥0.20 infections per 8 hours of sampled cases. The 10 combinations encompassed ≅17% of cases, showing the value of targeting surveillance of transmission to a few combinations of specialties and rooms. In conclusion, we created a sampling protocol and appropriate sample sizes for using S. aureus transmission within and between pairs of successive cases in the same operating room, the purpose being to monitor the quality of prevention of intraoperative spread of pathogenic bacteria and viruses.","Dexter, Franklin; Ledolter, Johannes; Wall, Russell T.; Datta, Subhradeep; Loftus, Randy W.",Perioper Care Oper Room Manag,243,1

We demonstrate that in our own cohort of 990 individuals without infection, this proteomic risk score is positively associated with proinflammatory cytokines mainly among older, but not younger, individuals. We further discovered that a core set of gut microbiota could accurately predict the above proteomic biomarkers among 301 individuals using a machine learning model, and that these gut microbiota features are highly correlated with proinflammatory cytokines in another set of 366 individuals.

Through an online questionnaire, this survey explores teachers' experience of online teaching, the level of risk factors (e.g., stress) and protective factors (e.g., locus of control) and their impact on satisfaction levels during the social distancing. One hundred seven high school teachers from Lombardy, an Italian region very affected by the COVID‐19 outbreak, participated. Results show that depression and stress are the main predictors of satisfaction levels for online teaching. In addition, coping, locus of control and self‐efficacy emerge as important protective factors. Finally, although there is great satisfaction with the online teaching experience, critical elements emerged. This study is relevant because it describes the critical elements of the online teaching experience, and identifies some protective factors and the main risk factors in teachers operating in an area strongly marked by social restrictions imposed by the pandemic. High school teachers emerge as a sub‐group of the general population with specific psychological reactions.

We tested whether a math training (XtraMath®) versus an active control condition (Cogmed®; working memory) improved school performance. Training feasibility was also evaluated. METHODS: Preterm born first graders, N = 65 (28–35 + 6 weeks gestation) were recruited into a prospective randomized controlled multicenter trial and received one of two computerized trainings at home for 5 weeks. Teachers rated academic performance in math, reading/writing, and attention compared to classmates before (baseline), directly after (post), and 12 months after the intervention (follow-up). Total academic performance growth was calculated as change from baseline (hierarchically ordered—post test first, follow-up second). RESULTS: Bootstrapped linear regressions showed that academic growth to post test was significantly higher in the math intervention group (B = 0.25 [95% confidence interval: 0.04–0.50], p = 0.039), but this difference was not sustained at the 12-month follow-up (B = 0.00 [−0.31 to 0.34], p = 0.996).

Methods: The levels of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs were determined by flow cytometry in 27 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: The frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs was elevated in COVID-19 patients, particularly severe patients. A follow-up comparison revealed a decline of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs percentages in most patients 1 day after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, but the levels of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs were still greater than 50.0% in 3 ICU patients 4-10 days after negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Elevated frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs was positively correlated with oropharyngeal viral loads and length of hospital stay, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte counts and serum albumin. Moreover, strong correlations were observed between the frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs and T cell subsets, NK cell counts, and B cell percentages. The frequency of CD14(+)HLA-DR(lo/neg) MDSCs could be used as a predictor of COVID-19 severity.

The RAS is a complicated network of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (i.e., AT1R, AT2R, MASR, and MRGD) orchestrating the effects of several hormones (i.e., angiotensin II, angiotensin (1–7), and alamandine) produced by protease-based transmembrane receptors (ACE1 and ACE2). Two signaling axes have been identified in the RAS endocrine system that mediate the proliferative actions of angiotensin II (i.e., the AT1R-based pathway) or the anti-proliferative effects of RAS hormones (i.e., the AT2R-, MAS-, and MRGD-based pathways). Disruption of the balance between these two axes can cause different diseases (e.g., cardiovascular pathologies and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2- (SARS-CoV-2)-based COVID-19 disease). It is now accepted that all the components of the RAS endocrine system are expressed in cancer, including cancer of the breast. Breast cancer (BC) is a multifactorial pathology for which there is a continuous need to identify novel drugs. Here, I reviewed the possible roles of both axes of the RAS endocrine network as potential druggable pathways in BC. Remarkably, the analysis of the current knowledge of the different GPCRs of the RAS molecular system not only confirms that AT1R could be considered a drug target and that its inhibition by losartan and candesartan could be useful in the treatment of BC, but also identifies Mas-related GPCR member D (MRGD) as a druggable protein. Overall, the RAS of GPCRs offers multifaceted opportunities for the development of additional compounds for the treatment of BC.","Acconcia, Filippo",Cells,243,16

A total of 25 healthy participants (HP) and 21 patients with foot impairments secondary to psoriatic arthritis (PsA) performed treadmill walking at three different speeds and overground walking at a comfortable speed. HP performed the assessment over two sessions. The proposed system's estimations of cadence (CAD), gait cycle duration (GCD), gait speed (GS), and stride length (SL) obtained for treadmill walking were validated versus those estimated with a motion capture system. The system was also compared with a well-established multi-IMU-based system for treadmill and overground walking. The results showed a good agreement between the motion capture system and the IMU-instrumented sock in estimating the spatio-temporal parameters during the treadmill walking at normal and fast speeds for both HP and PsA participants. The accuracy of GS and SL obtained from the IMU-instrumented sock was better compared to the established multi-IMU-based system in both groups. The precision (inter-session reliability) of the gait parameter estimations obtained from the IMU-instrumented sock was good to excellent for overground walking and treadmill walking at fast speeds, but moderate-to-good for slow and normal treadmill walking. The proposed IMU-instrumented sock offers a novel form factor addressing the wearability issues of IMUs and could potentially be used to measure spatio-temporal parameters under clinical conditions and free-living conditions.","Walha, Roua; Lebel, Karina; Gaudreault, Nathaly; Dagenais, Pierre; Cereatti, Andrea; Della Croce, Ugo; Boissy, Patrick",Sensors (Basel),243,5

Here, we have applied serine-scanning mutagenesis to the C-terminal-most heptad-repeat region in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein to investigate the functional role of this region in membrane fusion. We show that hydrophobic sidechains at a and d positions only within the short helical segment of the C-terminal heptad-repeat region (I1161, I1165, L1168, A1172, and L1175) are critical for cell–cell fusion. Serine mutations at outlying heptad-repeat residues that form an extended chain in the core structure (V1158, L1179, and L1182) do not affect fusogenicity. Our study provides genetic evidence for the important role of α-helical packing in promoting S glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion.","Follis, Kathryn E.; York, Joanne; Nunberg, Jack H.",Virology,243,1

Effective drugs are urgently needed to decrease the high mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, effective antiviral drugs or vaccines are currently unavailable. Herein, we systematically evaluated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of both lung tissue and blood from COVID-19 patients using transcriptome profiling. Differential gene expression analysis revealed potential core mechanism of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in which IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF and IL6 triggered cytokine storm mediated by neutrophil, macrophage, B and DC cells. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified two gene modules that are highly correlated with clinical traits of COVID-19 patients, and confirmed that over-activation of immune system-mediated cytokine release syndrome is the underlying pathogenic mechanism for acute phase of COVID-19 infection. It suggested that anti-inflammatory therapies may be promising regimens for COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, drug repurposing analysis of thousands of drugs revealed that TNFα inhibitor etanercept and γ-aminobutyric acid-B receptor (GABABR) agonist baclofen showed most significant reversal power to COVID-19 gene signature, so we are highly optimistic about their clinical use for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, our results suggested that adalimumab, tocilizumab, rituximab and glucocorticoids may also have beneficial effects in restoring normal transcriptome, but not chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine or interferons. Controlled clinical trials of these candidate drugs are needed in search of effective COVID-19 treatment in current crisis.","Li, Guobing; Zhao, Xiaolu; Liu, Qi; Ruan, Shasha; Dou, Yali; Mao, Fengbiao",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,243,16

METHODS: Descriptive clinical follow-up (days 7, 30 [D30] and 60 [D60]) of 150 patients with non-critical COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR at Tours University Hospital from March 17 to June 3, 2020, including demographic, clinical and laboratory data collected from the electronic medical records and by phone call. Persisting symptoms were defined by the presence at D30 or D60 of at least one of the following: weight loss ≥ 5%, severe dyspnea or asthenia, chest pain, palpitations, anosmia/ageusia, headache, cutaneous signs, arthralgia, myalgia, digestive disorders, fever or sick leave. RESULTS: At D30, 68% (n=103/150) of patients presented at least one symptom and 66% (n=86/130) at D60, mainly anosmia/ageusia: (59% (n=89/150) at symptom onset, 28% (n=40/150) at D30 and 23% (n=29/130) at D60). Dyspnea concerned 36.7% (n=55/150) patients at D30 and 30% (n=39/130) at D60. Half of the patients (n=74/150) at D30 and 40% (n=52/130) at D60 reported asthenia. Persistent symptoms at D60 were significantly associated with age 40 to 60 years old, hospital admission and abnormal auscultation at symptom onset. At D30, severe COVID-19 and/or dyspnea at symptom onset were additional factors associated with persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 2 months after symptom onset, two thirds of adults with non-critical COVID-19 had complaints, mainly anosmia/ageusia, dyspnea or asthenia. A prolonged medical follow-up of patients with COVID-19 seems essential, whatever the initial clinical presentation.","Carvalho-Schneider, Claudia; Laurent, Emeline; Lemaignen, Adrien; Beaufils, Emilie; Bourbao-Tournois, Céline; Laribi, Saïd; Flament, Thomas; Ferreira-Maldent, Nicole; Bruyère, Franck; Stefic, Karl; Gaudy-Graffin, Catherine; Grammatico-Guillon, Leslie; Bernard, Louis",Clin Microbiol Infect,243,20

To improve the pig’s robustness and resilience against pathogens through selection, a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors in the immune response is required. This review highlights results from the most recent transcriptome research, and the meta-analyses performed, in the context of pig immunity. A technological overview is given including wholegenome microarrays, immune-specific arrays, small-scale high-throughput expression methods, high-density tiling arrays, and next generation sequencing (NGS). Although whole genome microarray techniques will remain complementary to NGS for some time in domestic species, research will transition to sequencing-based methods due to cost-effectiveness and the extra information that such methods provide. Furthermore, upcoming high-throughput epigenomic studies, which will add greatly to our knowledge concerning the impact of epigenetic modifications on pig immune response, are listed in this review. With emphasis on the insights obtained from transcriptomic analyses for porcine immunity, we also discuss the experimental design in pig immunity research and the value of the newly published porcine genome assembly in using the pig as a model for human immune response. We conclude by discussing the importance of establishing community standards to maximize the possibility of integrative computational analyses, such as was clearly beneficial for the human ENCODE project.

We aimed to assess risk stratification among patients with positive two-sample FIT to prioritise colonoscopy. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: A single-centre, representative endoscopy clinic in Japan. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients who underwent colonoscopy were enrolled. Indications for colonoscopy included two-positive results on the two-sample FIT (FIT (+/+)), one-positive results on the two-sample FIT (FIT (+/−)), and other reasons (non-FIT group, including presence of symptoms, screening or surveillance). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were detection rates of colorectal cancers, including in situ (all cancers) and invasive cancers, based on the indications for colonoscopy. Secondary outcomes were cancer features, such as location, size, T stage and histological subtype. RESULTS: Of the 8724 patients, 264 underwent colonoscopy following FIT (+/+), 1018 following FIT (+/−) and 7442 for reasons other than positive FIT. Detection rates of all (and invasive) cancers in the FIT (+/+), FIT (+/−) and non-FIT groups were 12.1% (8.3%), 1.9% (0.3%) and 0.4% (0.2%), respectively. The cancer detection rates were much higher in the FIT (+/+) group than in the FIT (+/−) group, which in turn had higher rates than the non-FIT group. Moreover, the FIT (+/+) group showed more advanced T stages on tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classification (Tis/T1/T2/T3/T4: 10/7/4/10/1) than the FIT (+/−) group (16/1/2/0/0, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Two-positive results for two-sample FIT showed a much higher yield for more advanced colorectal cancers than the one-positive result. High priority for diagnostic colonoscopy should be assigned to patients with two-positive-FIT results.","Toyoshima, Osamu; Yamaji, Yutaka; Nishizawa, Toshihiro; Yoshida, Shuntaro; Yamada, Tomoharu; Kurokawa, Ken; Obata, Miho; Kondo, Ryo; Toba, Masahito; Koike, Kazuhiko",BMJ Open,243,18

COVID-19 has highlighted a need for novel diagnostic approaches to indicate likelihood of viral infection in a pandemic setting. We aimed to derive and validate a blood transcriptional signature to detect viral infections, including COVID-19, among adults with suspected infection who presented to the emergency department. METHODS: Individuals (aged ≥18 years) presenting with suspected infection to an emergency department at a major teaching hospital in the UK were prospectively recruited as part of the Bioresource in Adult Infectious Diseases (BioAID) discovery cohort. Whole-blood RNA sequencing was done on samples from participants with subsequently confirmed viral, bacterial, or no infection diagnoses. Differentially expressed host genes that met additional filtering criteria were subjected to feature selection to derive the most parsimonious discriminating signature. We validated the signature via RT-qPCR in a prospective validation cohort of participants who presented to an emergency department with undifferentiated fever, and a second case-control validation cohort of emergency department participants with PCR-positive COVID-19 or bacterial infection. We assessed signature performance by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs), sensitivities, and specificities. FINDINGS: A three-gene transcript signature, comprising HERC6, IGF1R, and NAGK, was derived from the discovery cohort of 56 participants with bacterial infections and 27 with viral infections. In the validation cohort of 200 participants, the signature differentiated bacterial from viral infections with an AUROC of 0·976 (95% CI 0·919−1·000), sensitivity of 97·3% (85·8−99·9), and specificity of 100% (63·1−100). The AUROC for C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0·833 (0·694−0·944) and for leukocyte count was 0·938 (0·840−0·986). The signature achieved higher net benefit in decision curve analysis than either CRP or leukocyte count for discriminating viral infections from all other infections. In the second validation analysis, which included SARS-CoV-2-positive participants, the signature discriminated 35 bacterial infections from 34 SARS-CoV-2-positive COVID-19 infections with AUROC of 0·953 (0·893−0·992), sensitivity 88·6%, and specificity of 94·1%. INTERPRETATION: This novel three-gene signature discriminates viral infections, including COVID-19, from other emergency infection presentations in adults, outperforming both leukocyte count and CRP, thus potentially providing substantial clinical utility in managing acute presentations with infection.

We aimed to review and characterize SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies conducted using blood donors to investigate methodology and provide guidance for future research. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed and preprint publications between January 2020 to January 2021. Two reviewers used standardized forms to extract seroprevalence estimates and data on methodology pertaining to population sampling, periodicity, assay characteristics and antibody kinetics. National data on cumulative incidence and social distancing policies were extracted from publicly available sources and summarized. Results: Thirty-three studies representing 1,323,307 blood donations from 20 countries worldwide were included (sample size per study ranged from 22 to 953,926 donations). Seroprevalence rates ranged from 0% to 76% (after adjusting for waning antibodies). Overall, less than 1 in 5 studies reported standardized seroprevalence rates to reflect the demographics of the general population. Stratification by age and sex were most common (64% of studies), followed by region (48%). 52% of studies reported seroprevalence at a single time point. Overall, 27 unique assay combinations were identified, 55% of studies used a single assay and only 39% adjusted seroprevalence rates for imperfect test characteristics. Among the eight nationally representative studies case detection was most underrepresented in Kenya (1:1264). Conclusion: As of December 11, 2020, 79% of studies reported seroprevalence rates <10%; thresholds far from reaching herd immunity.

Difficulty in access to healthcare during these months has been especially relevant for persons with HIV infection (PWH). This study therefore sought to ascertain the clinical outcomes and effectiveness of the measures implemented among PWH in a region with one of the highest incidence rates in Europe. Methods: Retrospective, observational, pre-post intervention study to compare the outcomes of PWH attended at a high-complexity healthcare hospital from March to October 2020 and during the same months across the period 2016-2019. The intervention consisted of home drug deliveries and preferential use of non face-to-face consultations. The effectiveness of the measures implemented was determined by reference to the number of emergency visits, hospitalisations, mortality rate, and percentage of PWH with viral load >50 copies, before and after the two pandemic waves. Results: A total of 2,760 PWH were attended from January 2016 to October 2020. During the pandemic, there was a monthly mean of 106.87 telephone consultations and 2,075 home deliveries of medical drugs dispensed to ambulatory patients. No statistically significant differences were found between the rate of admission of patients with COVID-HIV co-infection and that of the remaining patients (1,172.76 admissions/100,000 population vs. 1,424.29, p = 0.401) or in mortality (11.54% vs. 12.96%, p = 0.939). The percentage of PWH with viral load >50 copies was similar before and after the pandemic (1.20% pre-pandemic vs. 0.51% in 2020, p = 0.078). Conclusion: Our results show that the strategies implemented during the first 8 months of the pandemic prevented any deterioration in the control and follow-up parameters routinely used on PWH.

They must be effective tools for fast detection and diagnose of the virus using a large number of tests; besides, they should be low-cost developments. While a chest x-ray scan is a powerful candidate tool, if several tests are carried out, the images produced by the devices must be interpreted accurately and rapidly. COVID-19 induces longitudinal pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidates pulmonary opacity, in some cases with rounded morphology and peripheral lung distribution, which is very difficult to predict in an early stage. Aim In this paper, we aim to develop a robust model to extract high-level features of COVID-19 from chest x-ray (CXR) images to help in rapid diagnosis. In specific, this paper proposes an optimization model for COVID-19 diagnosis based on adaptive Fuzzy C-means (AFCM) and improved Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) based on Lévy distribution, namely AFCM-LSMA. Methods The SMA optimizer is proposed to adapt weights in oscillation mode and to mimic the process of generating positive and negative feedback from the propagation wave to shape the optimum path for food connectivity. Lévy motion is used as a permutation to perform a local search and to adapt SMA optimizer (LSMA) by generating several solutions that are apart from current candidates. Furthermore, it permits the optimizer to escape from local minima, examine large search areas and reach optimal solutions in fewer iterations with high convergence speed. The FCM algorithm is used to segment pulmonary regions from CXR images and is adapted to reduce time and amount of computations using histogram of the image intensities during the clustering process. Results The performance of the proposed AFCM-LSMA has been validated on CXR images and compared with different conventional machine learning and deep learning techniques, meta-heuristics methods, and different chaotic maps. The accuracies achieved by the proposed model are around (ACC=0.96, RMSE=0.23, Prec.=0.98, F1_score=0.98, MCC=0.79, and Kappa=0.79). Conclusion The experimental findings indicate that the proposed new method outperforms all other methods, which will be beneficial to the clinical practitioner for the early identification of infected COVID-19 patients.","Anter, Ahmed M.; Oliva, Diego; Thakare, Anuradha; Zhang, Zhiguo",,243,1

In Germany, more than 3.4 million cases are confirmed so far, including 83,000 deaths. Increased fatality rates among patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent this group at particular risk. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in health perception among patients with aortic diseases during the first (w1) and second wave (w2) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Material and Methods: Patients (n = 262) diagnosed with aortic disease participated in telephone interviews during w1 and w2. The perception of COVID-19 as a threat was examined using relevant items of the Brief Illness Perception (BIP) questionnaire. Results: The BIP score increased from 9.18 (SD = 7.132) to 14.58 (SD = 6.956) between w1 and w2 (p < 0.001). Although this population is at high risk their overall perception of COVID-19 as a threat was low in the beginning, but surged during w2. Main reasons were increased effects on personal life and elevated concerns about the pandemic, but did not include the educational aspect of COVID-19. Conclusions: Tailored risk communication strengthens the mental health of people in a public health crisis and ensures the success of governmental guidelines.","Parys, Alan; Klinge, Sarah; Dönmez, Alina; Rammos, Christos; Rassaf, Tienush; Jánosi, Rolf Alexander; Lortz, Julia",Medicina (Kaunas),243,30

This online cross-sectional survey was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Rabigh, King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (SA). Participants were approached via social media (SM), and 2006 participants (953 [47.5%] females and 1053 [52.5%] males) were included in this study. SM was the leading source of information for 43.9% of the study participants. Most of the participants had various misconceptions such as “females are more vulnerable to develop this infection, rinsing the nose with saline and sipping water every 15 minutes protects against Coronavirus, flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against this virus.” About one-third of participants (31.7%) had self-reported disturbed social, mental, and psychological wellbeing due to the pandemic. Many participants became more religious during this pandemic. Two-thirds of the study participants (68.1%) had good knowledge scores. Attitudes were highly positive in 93.1%, and practice scores were adequate in 97.7% of the participants. Participants’ educational status was a predictor of high knowledge scores. Male gender and divorced status were predictors of low practice scores, and aged 51–61 years, private-sector jobs, and student status were predictors of high practice scores. Being Saudi was a predictor of a positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced status were predictors of a negative attitude. Higher education was a predictor of good concepts, while the older age and businessmen were predictors of misconceptions. Overall, our study participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices, but several myths were also prevalent. Being a PhD and a Saudi national predicted high knowledge scores and positive attitudes, respectively.

By using Feller’s test and stochastic comparison principle, we establish the stochastic basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , which completely determines whether the disease is persistent or not in the population. If [Formula: see text] , the disease will go to extinction; if [Formula: see text] , the disease will also go to extinction in probability, which has not been reported in the known literatures; and if [Formula: see text] , the disease will be stochastically persistent. In addition, the existence of the stationary distribution of the model and its ergodicity are obtained. Numerical simulations based on real examples support the theoretical results. The interesting findings are that (i) the environmental fluctuation may significantly affect the threshold dynamical behavior of the disease and the fluctuations in different size scale population, and (ii) the media coverage plays an important role in affecting the stationary distribution of disease under a low intensity noise environment.","Zhao, Yu; Zhang, Liping; Yuan, Sanling",Physica A,243,16

However, conflicting data exist regarding their effectiveness. Prior systematic reviews examined contact precautions as part of a larger bundled approach, limiting ability to understand their effectiveness. The aim of this review was to characterize the effectiveness of contact precautions alone against transmission of any MDRO among adult acute care patients. Directed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, comprehensive searches of four electronic scientific literature databases were conducted for studies published in English from January 2004 to June 2014. Studies were included if interventional, original research, evaluating contact isolation precautions against MDRO transmission among inpatients. Searches returned 284 studies, six of which were included in the review. These studies measured four different MDROs with one study showing a reduction in transmission. Whereas studies were of high quality regarding outcome operationalization and statistical analyses, overall quality was moderate to low due to poor intervention description, population characterization and potential biases. Where compliance was measured (N = 4), it presented a threat to validity because it included select parts of the intervention, ranged from 21% to 87%, and was significantly different across study phases (N = 2). The poor quality of evidence on this topic continues to limit interpretation of these data. Hence, this conflicting body of literature does not constitute evidence for or against contact precautions. We recommend that researchers consider power calculation, compliance monitoring, non-equivalent concurrent controls when designing future studies on this topic.","Cohen, C.C.; Cohen, B.; Shang, J.",Journal of Hospital Infection,243,18

In this process, they made efforts not only to disrupt the medical needs of their patients, but also to protect them from COVID-19 mortality with actively or telemedicine integrated. This study aims to determine both the perspective of medical oncologists on the pandemic process and their profession, and their burnout during the pandemic process within the scope of implicit questions. Methods: This research was conducted between April and August 2021, when the pandemic caused obscurity and devastating consequences around the world. The study was initiated after the ethics committee and administrative permissions were completed. 760 medical oncologists registered with the Turkish Medical Oncology Association were asked to participate in the survey by reminding them via e-mail or telephone. Results: The number of attendees was 397. The average age was 47± 11 years, and the average duration of work in oncology was 9± 7 years. Most of the participants were women (59%), with academic titles (61%), married (79%), who had at least 2 oncologists in the institution was 67%, and have a multidisciplinary council were 72%. The average number of patients per day was 40±11. 85% of the participants had sufficient knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate of those who were worried about spreading disease to their patients, colleagues and families during the pandemic process was 85%. Disease anxiety for themselves was 35%. The proportion of those who stated that the pandemic process consumed them was 75%, 67% worried that scientific productivity would decrease, and 76% worried that oncology-related occupational productivity would decrease. The rate of those who had a hobby and had to leave it was 92%. When compared with the pre-pandemic, the rate of those who considered themselves exhausted was 86%. Conclusions: It was determined that in the pandemic, the level of burnout of medical oncologists increased and they were more concerned about their loved ones and their patients. It can be concluded that it would be appropriate to develop methods of coping with burnout in the continuation of the pandemic process or in similar conditions.

Current efforts to monitor the drug supply are limited in population reach and comparability. This restricts capacity to identify and develop measures that safeguard the health of PWUD. This study describes the development of a low-barrier system for monitoring the contents of drugs in the unregulated street supply. Early results for pilot sites are presented and compared across regions. METHODS: The drug content monitoring system integrates a low-barrier survey and broad spectrum urine toxicology screening to compare substances expected to be consumed and those actually in the drug supply. The system prototype was developed by harm reduction pilot projects in British Columbia (BC) and Montreal with participation of PWUD. Data were collected from harm reduction supply distribution site clients in BC, Edmonton and Montreal between May 2018–March 2019. Survey and urine toxicology data were linked via anonymous codes and analyzed descriptively by region for trends in self-reported and detected use. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 878 participants from 40 sites across 3 regions. Reported use of substances, their detection, and concordance between the two varied across regions. Methamphetamine use was reported and detected most frequently in BC (reported: 62.8%; detected: 72.2%) and Edmonton (58.3%; 68.8%). In Montreal, high concordance was also observed between reported (74.5%) and detected (86.5%) cocaine/crack use. Among those with fentanyl detected, the percentage of participants who used fentanyl unintentionally ranged from 36.1% in BC, 78.6% in Edmonton and 90.9% in Montreal. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to describe a feasible, scalable monitoring system for the unregulated drug supply that can contrast expected and actual drug use and compare trends across regions. The system used principles of flexibility, capacity-building and community participation in its design. Results are well-suited to meet the needs of PWUD and inform the local harm reduction services they rely on. Further standardization of the survey tool and knowledge mobilization is needed to expand the system to new jurisdictions.","Biggar, Emily; Papamihali, Kristi; Leclerc, Pascale; Hyshka, Elaine; Graham, Brittany; Taylor, Marliss; Payer, Doris; Maloney-Hall, Bridget; Buxton, Jane A.",BMC Public Health,243,24

Asthma is a complex genetic disorder with strong environmental influence. It imposes a growing burden on our society in terms of morbidity, quality of life, and healthcare costs. Despite large‐scale efforts, only a few asthma genes have been confirmed, suggesting that the genetic underpinning of asthma is highly complex. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed regarding atopic and nonatopic asthma risk factors, including environmental risk factors and genetic studies in adults and children. RESULTS: Several environmental risk factors have been identified to increase the risk of developing asthma such as exposure to air pollution and tobaccos smoke as well as occupational risk factors. In addition atopy, stress, and obesity all can increases the risk for asthma in genetically susceptible persons. CONCLUSION: Asthma represents a dysfunctional interaction with our genes and the environment to which they are exposed, especially in fetal and early infant life. The increasing prevalence of asthma in all age groups indicate that our living environment and immunity are in imbalance with each other reacting with airway inflammation to the environmental exposures and often non‐harmful proteins, such as allergens causing the current “asthma and allergy epidemic.” Because of the close relationship between asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis, it is important that otolaryngologists have a good understanding of asthma, the etiologic factors associated with disease, and its evaluation and management.","Toskala, Elina; Kennedy, David W.",Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,243,24

We postulate that OSA is associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity and with adverse COVID-19 outcomes in children. METHODS: A retrospective review of 120 consecutive patients (<18 years) with prior polysomnogram (PSG) and COVID-19 testing from the Cleveland Clinic COVID-19 registry was conducted. Using a case control design of SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative pediatric patients, we examined COVID-19 and pre-existing OSA (dichotomized AHI≥1) using logistic (OR,95%CI) regression and as continuous measures: AHI, oxygen(SpO2) nadir, %time SpO2<90%) using linear regression(beta+/-SE). In those positive for SARS-CoV-2(cases only), we assessed the association of OSA and World Health Organization(WHO) COVID-19 clinical outcome composite score (hospitalization, requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation/high-flow oxygen, invasive ventilation/ECMO or death) using Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal data. RESULTS: Cases (n=36) were 11.8±4.4 years, 61% male, 27.8% black and 88.9% with OSA, while 85.7% of controls (n=84) had OSA. OSA was not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity: OR=1.33(0.40, 4.45,p=0.64). No significant difference between cases and controls for mean AHI 3.7(1.5,6.0) vs 3.5(1.5,7.1),p=0.91,SpO2 nadir 88.6±5.4 vs 89.1±4.4,p=0.58,%time SpO2<90% 0.05[0.00,1.00) vs 0.10 (0.00,1.00, p=0.65) respectively was noted. WHO-7 COVID-19 clinical outcome did not meet statistical significance in relation to OSA due to the low event frequency (p=0.49). Of note, those with OSA vs without OSA had a higher WHO-7 outcome score of 2 vs 0 and prevalence of hospitalization: 12.5 vs 0% respectively. Of hospitalized patients, the following was observed: 23% had moderate/severe OSA vs 4.3% mild OSA, 50% required supplemental oxygen and 25% required intubation/invasive ventilation. No deaths or readmissions were reported. High risk conditions included: 75% obesity, 50% asthma, 25% sickle cell disease and 25% hypoplastic left heart. CONCLUSION: In this first report of which we are aware focused on COVID-19 in pediatric OSA, we use a case control design leveraging COVID-19 and sleep laboratory registries. Albeit not statistically significant, pediatric patients with OSA had a higher percentage of worse clinical outcomes. Larger network studies are needed to clarify whether poorer COVID-19 outcomes may be attributable to OSA or modulated via high risk health conditions.

Comparison of expression profiles of lung cell lines A549 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 (with ACE2 expression)) or Influenza A virus (IAV)) and Calu3 (infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV) revealed upregulation of the antiviral interferon signaling in all three viral infections. However, perturbations in inflammatory, mitochondrial, and autophagy processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Validation of findings from cell line data revealed perturbations in autophagy and mitochondrial processes in the infected human nasopharyngeal samples. Specifically, downregulation of mTOR expression, mitochondrial ribosomal, mitochondrial complex I, and lysosome acidification genes were concurrently observed in both infected cell lines and human datasets. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection impedes autophagic flux by upregulating GSK3B in lung cell lines, or by downregulating autophagy genes, SNAP29 and lysosome acidification genes in human samples, contributing to increased viral replication. Therefore, drugs targeting lysosome acidification or autophagic flux could be tested as intervention strategies. Additionally, downregulation of MTFP1 (in cell lines) or SOCS6 (in human samples) results in hyperfused mitochondria and impede proper interferon response. Coexpression networks analysis identifies correlated clusters of genes annotated to inflammation and mitochondrial processes that are misregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Finally, comparison of age stratified human gene expression data revealed impaired upregulation of chemokines, interferon stimulated and tripartite motif genes that are critical for antiviral signaling. Together, this analysis has revealed specific aspects of autophagic and mitochondrial function that are uniquely perturbed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Singh, Komudi; Chen, Yun-Ching; Judy, Jennifer T; Seifuddin, Fayaz; Tunc, Ilker; Pirooznia, Mehdi",bioRxiv,243,1

During viral infections, the host innate immune response is mounted quickly to produce some endogenous functional molecules to limit virus replication and spread. Exosomes contain molecules from their cell of origin following virus infection and can enter recipient cells for intercellular communication. Here, we aim to clarify whether ZIKV-induced exosomes can regulate viral pathogenicity by transferring specific RNAs. MAIN METHODS: In this study, exosomes were isolated from the supernatants of A549 cells with or without ZIKV infection. Human transcriptome array (HTA) was performed to analyze the profiling of RNAs wrapped in exosomes. Then qPCR, western blotting and ELISA were used to determine ZIKV replication. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were used to test the cell proliferation and cell cycles. Co-culture assay was used to analyze the effect of exosomes on the cell cycles of recipient cells. KEY FINDINGS: Through human transcriptome array (HTA) we found the defensin alpha 1B (DEFA1B) expression was significantly increased within exosomes isolated from ZIKV infected A549 cells. Additionally, we found that the extracellular DEFA1B exerts significant anti-ZIKV activity, mainly before ZIKV entering host cells. Interestingly, up-regulated DEFA1B retards the cell cycle of host cells. Further studies demonstrated that DEFA1B interacted with the origin recognition complex 1 (ORC1) which is required to initiate DNA replication during the cell cycle and increased DEFA1B expression decreased the ORC1 level in the cell nuclei. Accordingly, DEFA1B-containing exosomes can be internalized by the recipient cells to retard their cell cycles. SIGNIFICANCE: Together, our results demonstrated that the anti-ZIKV activity of DEFA1B can be mediated by exosomes, and DEFA1B interacts with ORC1 to retard cell cycles. Our study provides a novel concept that DEFA1B not only acts as an antiviral molecule during ZIKV infection but also may correlate with cell proliferation by retarding the progression of cell cycles.","Li, Shuang; Zhu, Anjing; Ren, Kai; Li, Shilin; Chen, Limin",Life Sci,243,20

Methods Spatial lag models were employed to model the cumulative COVID-19 per capita infection rate in New York City ZIP codes (N=177) as of April 1 and May 25, 2020, accounting for the spatial relationships among observations. Both direct and total effects (through spatial relationships) were reported. Results This study distinguished between density and crowding. Crowding (and not density) was associated with the higher infection rate on April 1. Average household size was another significant crowding-related variable in both models. There was no evidence that subway ridership was related to the COVID-19 infection rate. Racial and socioeconomic compositions were among the most significant predictors of spatial variation in COVID-19 per capita infection rates in New York City, even more so than variables such as point of interest rates, density, and nursing home bed rates. Conclusions Point of interest destinations not only could facilitate the spread of virus to other parts of the city (through indirect effects) but also were significantly associated with the higher infection rate in their immediate neighborhoods during the early stages of the pandemic.

Because SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via aerosols and surface contaminations of the environment, appropriate use of anesthesia machines and appropriate behavior in the operation room (OR) are required specifically in relation to this disease. The use of high-performance hydrophobic filters with a high rate of virus rejection is recommended as the type of viral filter, and surgical team behaviors that result in aerosol splashes should be avoided. Appropriate hand hygiene by the anesthesiologist is crucial to prevent unexpected environmental contamination. When the anesthesia machine is used instead of an intensive care unit ventilator, it is important to keep the fresh gas flow at least equal to the minute ventilation to prevent excessive humidity in the circuit and to monitor condensation in the circuit and inspiratory carbon dioxide pressure. In addition, both the surgical smoke inherent in thermal tissue destruction and the surgical team’s shoe soles may be factors for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the operating room. Ensuring social distancing—even with a mask in the OR—may be beneficial because healthcare providers may be asymptomatic carriers. After the acute crisis period of COVID-19, the number of cases of essential but nonurgent surgeries for waiting patients is likely to increase; therefore, optimization of OR scheduling will be an important topic.

Recently, smokers have been found to be at higher risk of developing severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). E-cigarette aerosol inhalation (vaping) has been associated with several inflammatory lung disorders, including the recent e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) epidemic, and recent studies have suggested that vaping alters host susceptibility to pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To assess the impact of vaping on lung inflammatory pathways, including the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor known to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, mice were exposed to e-cigarette aerosols for 60 min daily for 1–6 months and underwent gene expression analysis. Hierarchical clustering revealed extensive gene expression changes occurred in the lungs of both inbred C57BL/6 mice and outbred CD1 mice, with 2,933 gene expression changes in C57BL/6 mice, and 2,818 gene expression changes in CD1 mice (>abs 1.25-fold change). Particularly, large reductions in IgA and CD4 were identified, indicating impairment of host responses to pathogens via reductions in immunoglobulins and CD4 T cells. CD177, facmr, tlr9, fcgr1, and ccr2 were also reduced, consistent with diminished host defenses via decreased neutrophils and/or monocytes in the lungs. Gene set enrichment (GSE) plots demonstrated upregulation of gene expression related to cell activation specifically in neutrophils. As neutrophils are a potential driver of acute lung injury in COVID-19, increased neutrophil activation in the lungs suggests that vapers are at higher risk of developing more severe forms of COVID-19. The receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, ACE2, was found to have moderate upregulation in mice exposed to unflavored vape pens, and further upregulation (six-fold) with JUUL mint aerosol exposure. No changes were found in mice exposed to unflavored Mod device-generated aerosols. These findings suggest that specific vaping devices and components of e-liquids have an effect on ACE2 expression, thus potentially increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, exposure to e-cigarette aerosols both with and without nicotine led to alterations in eicosanoid lipid profiles within the BAL. These data demonstrate that chronic, daily inhalation of e-cigarette aerosols fundamentally alters the inflammatory and immune state of the lungs.

In 2015, the Nepalese government introduced a new federal political structure. It is unclear how this has affected the health system, and particularly, maternal and child health care. Hence, this study aims to describe and analyse health facility preparedness in the light of the federalization process with regards to providing appropriate and timely maternal and neonatal health services. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Jumla district, Nepal in 2019 covering all 31 state health facilities (HF) to assess the availability of maternal and neonatal health services including appropriate workforce and access to essential medicines. Tests of association between demographic factors and the probability of a facility experiencing a shortage of essential medicine within the last 3 months were also conducted as exploratory procedures. RESULTS: Out ot 31 HFs, more than 90% of them had all their staff positions filled. Most facilities (n = 21) had experienced shortages of essential medicines within the past 3 months. The most common out of stock medicine were: Amoxicillin (n = 10); paracetamol (n = 10); Vitamin A (n = 7); and Metronidazole (n = 5). Twenty-two HFs had referred maternal and newborn cases to a higher centre within the past 12 months. However, more worryingly, twenty HFs or their catchment communities did not have emergency ambulance transport for women and newborns. CONCLUSION: HFs reported better staffing levels than levels of available drugs. HFs should be supported to meet required minimal standards such as availability of essential medicines and the provision of emergency ambulance transport for women and newborns.","Tamang, Pasang; Simkhada, Padam; Bissell, Paul; van Teijlingen, Edwin; Khatri, Rose; Stephenson, John",BMC Health Serv Res,243,2

METHODS: Preoperative and postoperative serum ACE2 levels in 320 NSCLC patients who underwent major pulmonary resection were measured. The serum ACE2 levels on postoperative day 1 were divided into quartile categories. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, current smoking status, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and tumour clinical stages, the risk of developing postoperative morbidities was significantly higher in the lowest serum ACE2 level quartile than in the highest quartile (hazard ratio, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.57-6.23; p=0.008). NSCLC patients with a serum ACE2 level ≤3.21 ng/mL had significantly higher rates of pneumonia, pleural effusion, atrial fibrillation as well as higher in-hospital mortality after major pulmonary resection, compared with those with a serum ACE2 level >3.21ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The serum ACE2 level one day post surgery is an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients. Thus, it could be used as a prognostic factor for postoperative morbidities after major pulmonary resection in NSCLC patients.","Li, Xiaobing; Zhou, Changwei; Hu, Wen",Heart Lung Circ,243,18

Our results from a sample of N = 570 German participants already indicate obvious changes in relevant variables in the four-week investigation period during the pandemic’s initial phase (25 March to 22 April 2020). Above all, the willingness to take preventive measures decreased, as did the assessment of the pandemic’s severity. The perceived own vulnerability also turned out to be clearly age-dependent and, overall, our sample showed a negative affectivity deviating distinctively from a reference sample.

Therefore, a simple and effective method is urgently required to monitor and treat wastewater. As bacterial viruses, bacteriophages (phages) are the most widely distributed and abundant organisms in the biosphere. Owing to their capacity to specifically infect bacterial hosts, they have recently been used as novel tools in water pollution control. The purpose of this review is to summarize and evaluate the roles of phages in monitoring pathogens, tracking pollution sources, treating pathogenic bacteria, infecting bloom-forming cyanobacteria, and controlling bulking sludge and biofilm pollution in wastewater treatment systems. We also discuss the limitations of phage usage in water pollution control, including phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer, the evolution of bacterial resistance, and phage concentration decrease. This review provides an integrated outlook on the use of phages in water pollution control.

In this study we address the cell entry mechanisms of nonenveloped adenoviruses (Ads). We show that protein VI, an internal capsid protein, is rapidly exposed after cell surface attachment and internalization and remains partially associated with the capsid during intracellular transport. We found that a PPxY motif within protein VI recruits Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases to bind and ubiquitylate protein VI. We further show that this PPxY motif is involved in rapid, microtubule-dependent intracellular movement of protein VI. Ads with a mutated PPxY motif can efficiently escape endosomes but are defective in microtubule-dependent trafficking toward the nucleus. Likewise, depletion of Nedd4 ligases attenuates nuclear accumulation of incoming Ad particles and infection. Our data provide the first evidence that virus-encoded PPxY motifs are required during virus entry, which may be of significance for several other pathogens.","Wodrich, Harald; Henaff, Daniel; Jammart, Baptist; Segura-Morales, Carolina; Seelmeir, Sigrid; Coux, Olivier; Ruzsics, Zsolt; Wiethoff, Christopher M.; Kremer, Eric J.",PLoS Pathog,243,1

While the role of fomite transmission is not yet fully understood, precise data on the environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2 is required to determine the risks of fomite transmission from contaminated surfaces. METHODS: This study measured the survival rates of infectious SARS-CoV-2, suspended in a standard ASTM E2197 matrix, on several common surface types. All experiments were carried out in the dark, to negate any effects of UV light. Inoculated surfaces were incubated at 20 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C and sampled at various time points. RESULTS: Survival rates of SARS-CoV-2 were determined at different temperatures and D-values, Z-values and half-life were calculated. We obtained half lives of between 1.7 and 2.7 days at 20 °C, reducing to a few hours when temperature was elevated to 40 °C. With initial viral loads broadly equivalent to the highest titres excreted by infectious patients, viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20 °C from common surfaces such as glass, stainless steel and both paper and polymer banknotes. Conversely, infectious virus survived less than 24 h at 40 °C on some surfaces. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for significantly longer time periods than generally considered possible.

METHODS A cohort of adult patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure underwent LUS during initial assessment. A simplified LUS protocol consisting in scanning six areas, three for each side, was adopted. A score from 0 to 3 was assigned to each area. Comprehensive LUS score (LUSsc) was calculated as the sum of the score in all areas. LUSsc, the amount of involved sonographic lung areas (LUSq), the number of lung quadrants radiographically infiltrated and the degree of oxygenation impairment at admission (SpO2/FiO2 ratio) were compared to NIMV Outcome, MV needs and ICU admission. RESULTS Among 85 patients prospectively included in the analysis, 49 of 61 needed MV. LUSsc and LUSq were higher in patients who required MV (median 12 [IQR 8-14] and median 6 [IQR 4-6], respectively) than in those who did not (6 [IQR 2-9] and 3 [IQR 1-5], respectively), both p < 0.001.

In response, the country designed and created intermediate treatment centers, known as fangcang hospitals, which are prepared quickly at low cost and with high capacity. The aim of this study is to provide health managers with an effective post-hospital discharge strategy for COVID-19 patients. METHOD: The study was conducted from April 2020 to June 2020, with a narrative case study design. Setting up a fangcang hospital was based on a narrative analysis of 2 in-depth interviews with 4 fangcang hospital managers in Iran, a field visit of these places, and a review of their protocols and guidelines. RESULT: The patient flow for screening, treatment, and follow-up includes the following: Patients will be hospitalized if their symptoms are severe. If they are infected with mild symptoms, they will be referred to a fangcang hospital and admitted there if necessary, to prevent further spread of the disease. Patients will be monitored regularly and treated with routine health services. At the end of the 14-day quarantine period, patients approved for discharge are sent home. CONCLUSION: Traditional hospitals and fangcang hospitals are working together under the supervision of the Iran University of Medical Sciences. Our experience can serve as guidance for other clinics and recovery shelters. Having guidelines in place assists health care workers and managers in responding quickly to patients' needs during times of a disaster.","Kassaeian, Saeed; Gohari, Ali; Masoumi, Gholamreza; Ghomian, Zohreh; Dehghani, Arezoo",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,243,30

COVID-19 vaccine was allocated in a phased roll-out beginning December 14, 2020. Phase 1A included health care personnel with direct patient contact, and residents and staff of nursing homes (NHs) and assisted living facilities (ALFs). Following this initial phase, individuals 65 years of age and older became eligible for vaccination, along with individuals determined by hospital providers to be extremely medically vulnerable to COVID-19. This strategy was based on the desire to most immediately reduce morbidity and mortality, as COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is age-related. Through March 15, 2021, 4,338,099 individuals received COVID-19 vaccine, including 2,431,540 individuals who completed their vaccination series. Of all those vaccinated, 70% were 65 years of age and older, and 63% of those 65 years of age and older. Beginning February 1, 2021, the decline in the number of new cases per week became greater in those 65 years of age and older than those younger. By March 15, 2021, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per day for those 65 years of age and older relative to mid-January, were 82%, 80%, and 92% lower respectively. In comparison, the number of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per day for those younger than 65 years of age were 70%, 60%, and 87% lower respectively. Reductions in rates in those 65 year of age and older, were thus greater than in those who were younger (p <0.01; Wilcoxon test).

This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March–April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, which had lower infection rates, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation. METHODS: Using a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n = 2836) and again in July 2020 (n = 1526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture risk for stress/depression (WHO-5 < 50) and functional impairment (WSAS > 10). Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well as to answers in re-interviews in July. RESULTS: In our fully controlled models, we find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home (−.089, p < .01 (from pre lockdown baseline .273)). Measures of functional impairment also declined immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home (−.066, p < .05 (from pre lockdown baseline .150)). Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July (+.199, p < .001 (from pre lockdown baseline .248)), but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July (−.033, p < .05 (from pre lockdown baseline .332).

Adherence to chronic medicines is challenging and has stimulated health care providers to devise differentiated service delivery models of care to decentralise chronic medicine distribution to decrease the frequency of medicine collection at health care facilities. One such option includes a last kilometre medicine delivery service. This study investigated chronic patients’ preferences for a last kilometre medicine delivery service model. METHODS: An exploratory non-randomised quantitative study was conducted over 4 weeks at four public sector primary health care facilities in Cape Town, South Africa. Data was collected on a structured questionnaire from chronic patients queuing to receive medication at each facility’s pharmacy waiting area. Patient demographics were noted to align with preferences for chronic medicine service delivery characteristics including; mobile ordering, fee for service and location for delivery. Chi-square test and frequencies were employed to analyse data using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: A total of 116 patients participated in this study. Most were interested in a medicine delivery service (80.2%) and were willing to use a mobile application to order their medicines (84.5%). Almost all patients (96.8%) preferred that their medicines be delivered to their home. More than three quarters of participants were willing to pay for the service (77.6%). Chi-square test showed that gender, age group, employment status, distance to the health facility and /or average waiting time at the clinic significantly influenced the preference for certain characteristics of the medicine delivery service (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Most participants were interested in a last kilometre medicine delivery service, especially those older than 45 years, waiting for more than 6 h at the facility, and staying within one kilometre radius of the clinic. More studies are needed to establish the influence of patients’ employment status and the distance to health facility on interest in the medicine delivery service.

With the carotid bodies as a potential therapeutic target for numerous cardiorespiratory and metabolic diseases, an understanding of the neural control of its circulation is most relevant. Since nerve fibres track blood vessels and receive autonomic innervation, we initiate our review by describing the origins of arterial feed to the CB and its unique vascular architecture and blood flow. Arterial feed(s) vary amongst species and, unequivocally, the arterial blood supply is relatively high to this organ. The vasculature appears to form separate circuits inside the CB with one having arterial venous anastomoses. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves are present with postganglionic neurons located within the CB or close to it in the form of paraganglia. Their role in arterial vascular resistance control is described as is how CB blood flow relates to carotid sinus afferent activity. We discuss non-vascular targets of autonomic nerves, their possible role in controlling glomus cell activity, and how certain transmitters may relate to function. We propose that the autonomic nerves sub-serving the CB provide a rapid mechanism to tune the gain of peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity based on alterations in blood flow and oxygen delivery, and might provide future therapeutic targets. However, there remain a number of unknowns regarding these mechanisms that require further research that is discussed.","Brognara, Fernanda; Felippe, Igor S A; Salgado, Helio C; Paton, Julian F R",Cardiovasc Res,243,33

To achieve deep decarbonisation, recent scholarship identifies the crucial role of broad policy mixes that create reinforcing effects between climate and energy policies to trigger technological innovation, restrict polluting activities, promote green growth, and ensure just energy transitions. Drawing on this literature, the article explores the conditions for developing such policy mixes in the US context in three policy phases. How and why have key policy conditions developed differently in the climate- and energy policy fields, and to what effect for decarbonisation policies? The analysis shows that growing political polarisation blocked bipartisan agreement, produced negative policy feedback, and caused instability in the climate policy field, whereas these mechanisms did not dominate the energy policy field. A more bipartisan approach to renewable energy policy allowed long-term experience and positive feedback in energy-policy programmes that helped to trigger technology innovation and subsequent GHG emissions cuts. Different policy conditions within these policy fields discouraged a coupling between them that could have facilitated green-growth policies. The economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic may potentially change policy conditions and build a path to deep US decarbonisation in the future, but only if political polarisation on climate change can be overcome.","Bang, Guri",Int Environ Agreem,243,16

The main objective is to find out the spatiotemporal variation and dispersal of PM10 and PM2.5 along with COVID-19 infection in the dusty city Kolkata. The consecutive two years PM10 and PM2.5 data of different stations have been obtained from State Pollution Control Board, Govt. of West Bengal. Forward trajectory analysis has been done through HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model to find the path and direction of air particles. The result showed that the various meteorological or environmental factors (such as temperature, relative humidity, wind, wind speed, pressure and gusty wind) and geographical location regulate the spatiotemporal variation of PM10 and PM2.5. These factors like high temperature with relative humidity and strong wind influence to disperse the particulate matters from north to south direction from city to outside during summer in Kolkata metropolitan city. During summer (both pre and lockdown years), the height of particles is extended up to 1000 m owing to active atmospheric ventilation whereas in winter it is confined within 100 m. The HYSPLIT model clearly specified that the particles dispersed from south, south-west to north and north east direction due to strong wind. The constant magnification of PM10 and PM2.5 in the lower atmosphere leads to greater frequency of COVID-19 infections and deaths. In Kolkata, the one of the crucial reasons of high infection and deaths (COVID-19) is co-morbidity of people.","Bera, Biswajit; Bhattacharjee, Sumana; Sengupta, Nairita; Saha, Soumik",Geoscience Frontiers,243,1

By the end of April 2020, governments and professional organisations were publishing recommendations or guidance for the reopening/restructuring of dental services. The aim of this study was to assess how dental aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were defined in international dental guidelines, what mitigation processes were advised, and whether they were linked to COVID-19 epidemiology. METHODS: Electronic searches of a broad range of databases, along with grey literature searches, without language restriction were conducted up to 13 July 2020. Recommendations for the use of face masks and fallow times with patients without COVID-19 were assessed against the deaths per 1 million population in the included countries and country income level using Pearson Chi-squared statistics. RESULTS: Sixty-three guidance documents were included. Most (98%) indicated that AGPs can be performed with patients without COVID-19 with caveats, including advice to restrict AGPs where possible, with 21% only recommending AGPs for dental emergencies. Face masks were recommended by most documents (94%), with 91% also specifying the use of goggles or face shields. Fallow periods for patients without COVID-19 were mentioned in 48% of documents, ranging from 2 to 180 minutes. There were no significant differences in recommendations for face masks or fallow time in patients without COVID-19 by country death rate (P = .463 and P = .901) or World Bank status (P = .504 and P = .835). Most documents recommended procedural or environmental mitigations such as preprocedural mouthwash (82%) and general ventilation (52%). Few documents provided underpinning evidence for their recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: While the amount of high-quality direct evidence related to dentistry and COVID-19 remains limited, it is important to be explicit about the considered judgements for recommendations as well as generate new evidence to face this challenge.","Robertson, Clare; Clarkson, Jan E.; Aceves-Martins, Magaly; Ramsay, Craig R.; Richards, Derek; Colloc, Thibault",Int Dent J,243,28

This study aimed to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) can assist identification of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID‐19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 23 and November 12, 2020, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID‐19 (oxygen demand ≥4 L/min) were included consecutively. Lung ultrasound was performed daily until invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV‐group) or spontaneous recovery (non‐IMV‐group). Clinical parameters and lung ultrasound findings were compared between groups, at intubation (IMV‐group) and highest oxygen demand (non‐IMV‐group). A reference group with oxygen demand <4 L/min was examined at hospital admission. RESULTS: Altogether 72 patients were included: 50 study patients (IMV‐group, n = 23; non‐IMV‐group, n = 27) and 22 reference patients. LUS‐score correlated to oxygen demand (SpO(2)/FiO(2)‐ratio) (r = 0.728; p < 0.0001) and was higher in the IMV‐group compared to the non‐IMV‐group (20.0 versus 18.0; p = 0.026). Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, a LUS‐score of 19.5 was identified as cut‐off for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (area under the curve 0.68; sensitivity 56%, specificity 74%). In 6 patients, LUS identified critical coexisting conditions. Respiratory rate and oxygenation index ((SpO(2)/FiO(2))/respiratory rate) ≥4.88 identified no requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation with a positive predictive value of 87% and negative predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: LUS‐score had only a moderate diagnostic value for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID‐19. However, LUS proved valuable as complement to respiratory parameters in guidance of disease severity and identifying critical coexisting conditions.","Seiler, Claudia; Klingberg, Cecilia; Hårdstedt, Maria",J Ultrasound Med,243,12

Currently, there is a wide variety of tests available with different detection methodologies, levels of specificity and sensitivity, detection time, and with an extensive range of prices. This review therefore aimed to conduct a patent search in relation to tests for the detection of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The greatest number of patents identified in the search were registered between 2003 and 2011, being mainly deposited by China, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. Most of the patents used the existing RT-PCR, ELISA, and isothermal amplification methods to develop simple, sensitive, precise, easy to use, low-cost tests that reduced false-negative or false-positive results.

While single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) are commonly considered as driving virus adaption, RNA recombination events that delete or insert nucleic acid sequences are also critical. Whole genome targeting sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 is typically achieved using pairs of primers to generate cDNA amplicons suitable for next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, paired-primer approaches impose constraints on where primers can be designed, how many amplicons are synthesized and requires multiple PCR reactions with non-overlapping primer pools. This imparts sensitivity to underlying SNVs and fails to resolve RNA recombination junctions that are not flanked by primer pairs. To address these limitations, we have designed an approach called ‘Tiled-ClickSeq’, which uses hundreds of tiled-primers spaced evenly along the virus genome in a single reverse-transcription reaction. The other end of the cDNA amplicon is generated by azido-nucleotides that stochastically terminate cDNA synthesis, removing the need for a paired-primer. A sequencing adaptor containing a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) is appended to the cDNA fragment using click-chemistry and a PCR reaction generates a final NGS library. Tiled-ClickSeq provides complete genome coverage, including the 5’UTR, at high depth and specificity to the virus on both Illumina and Nanopore NGS platforms. Here, we analyze multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates and clinical samples to simultaneously characterize minority variants, sub-genomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs), structural variants (SVs) and D-RNAs. Tiled-ClickSeq therefore provides a convenient and robust platform for SARS-CoV-2 genomics that captures the full range of RNA species in a single, simple assay.","Jaworski, Elizabeth; Langsjoen, Rose M; Mitchell, Brooke; Judy, Barbara; Newman, Patrick; Plante, Jessica A; Plante, Kenneth S; Miller, Aaron L; Zhou, Yiyang; Swetnam, Daniele; Sotcheff, Stephanea; Morris, Victoria; Saada, Nehad; Machado, Rafael RG; McConnell, Allan; Widen, Steven G; Thompson, Jill; Dong, Jianli; Ren, Ping; Pyles, Rick B; Ksiazek, Thomas G; Menachery, Vineet D; Weaver, Scott C; Routh, Andrew L",eLife (Cambridge),243,1

Due to the constantly evolving nature of the coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2-mediated alterations on post-transcriptional gene regulations across human tissues remain elusive. In this study, we analyzed publicly available genomic datasets to systematically dissect the crosstalk and dysregulation of the human post-transcriptional regulatory networks governed by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and micro-RNAs (miRs) due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We uncovered that 13 out of 29 SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins directly interacted with 51 human RBPs, of which the majority of them were abundantly expressed in gonadal tissues and immune cells. We further performed a functional analysis of differentially expressed genes in mock-treated versus SARS-CoV-2-infected lung cells that revealed enrichment for the immune response, cytokine-mediated signaling, and metabolism-associated genes. This study also characterized the alternative splicing events in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells compared to the control, demonstrating that skipped exons and mutually exclusive exons were the most abundant events that potentially contributed to differential outcomes in response to the viral infection. A motif enrichment analysis on the RNA genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 clearly revealed the enrichment for RBPs such as SRSFs, PCBPs, ELAVs, and HNRNPs, suggesting the sponging of RBPs by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. A similar analysis to study the interactions of miRs with SARS-CoV-2 revealed functionally important miRs that were highly expressed in immune cells, suggesting that these interactions may contribute to the progression of the viral infection and modulate the host immune response across other human tissues. Given the need to understand the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with key post-transcriptional regulators in the human genome, this study provided a systematic computational analysis to dissect the role of dysregulated post-transcriptional regulatory networks controlled by RBPs and miRs across tissue types during a SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Srivastava, Rajneesh; Daulatabad, Swapna Vidhur; Srivastava, Mansi; Janga, Sarath Chandra",Int J Mol Sci,243,16

We find that firms with higher carbon intensities experienced significantly large decreases in stock values particularly those within the crude petroleum extraction, air transport and coke and refined petroleum industries. Our tentative conclusion is that efforts to revitalize the economy should avoid subsidizing stranded assets and instead target the industries of the future. However, identifying these will not necessarily be easy. We find, for example, that having an official ESG “climate change policy” has no effect on firm performance during the pandemic.

METHODS: Tianjin, a northeastern city in China, was chosen as the region of research and applied the influenza-like illness attack rate (ILI)% as the baseline and warning line to determine the severity of influenza epidemic. Then, an influenza early warning model was constructed based on the theory of rough set and support vector machines (RS-SVM), and the relationship between influenza and meteorology was explored through analyzing the monitoring data. RESULTS: The predictive performance of the model was good, which had achieved 81.8% accuracy when grouping the obtained data into three levels that represent no danger, danger of a light epidemic, and danger of a severe epidemic. The test results showed that if the host qi and guest qi were not balanced, this kind of situation was more likely to cause influenza outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of influenza closely relates to temperature, humidity, visibility, and wind speed and is consistent with some part of CM doctrine.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcomes data of hospitalized patients with severe COVID‐19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to 7 March 2020, were collected. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyse risk factors for disease progression from severe COVID‐19 illness to critical illness. The effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID‐19 disease were evaluated. RESULTS: The results of the multivariate analysis from 175 patients with severe COVID‐19 indicate that the use of methylprednisolone was a protective factor against disease progression from severe to critical illness(P < .001; OR: 0.054 95% CI: 0.017‐0.173). Among patients with severe COVID‐19 aged < 65 years, both the proportion of patients who progressed to critical illness (42.2% vs 90.0%, P = .000) and the mortality(6.7% vs 30.0%, P = .002) were lower for patients in methylprednisolone group, compared with those in the non‐methylprednisolone group, whereas no statistical differences between the methylprednisolone group and the non‐methylprednisolone group were found among patients with COVID‐19 older than 65 years. Moreover, both the levels of CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts (646 vs 463/µL, P = .007) and IL‐6 (241.9 vs 82.8 pg/mL, P = .025) were higher among patients with severe COVID‐19 aged < 65 years, compared with those patients ≥ 65 years old. CONCLUSION: Data from the limited sample showed that the early use of low or medium doses of methylprednisolone has a positive effect for patients with severe COVID‐19 younger than 65 years old, and excessive immune response and cytokine storm may be some of the reasons for the effectiveness.","Yang, Rongrong; Xiong, Yong; Ke, Hengning; Chen, Tielong; Gao, Shicheng",Eur J Clin Invest,243,8

Along with urbanization, an extensive literature has developed that examines the presence of natural areas in urban settings for the benefit of urban dwellers. However, little is known about how much people perceive the presence of nature in different types of areas (such as city or countryside) and the places where they seek this presence. In this article, we present a study of these two questions through the interviews of 52 inhabitants from 13 municipalities (cities, suburbs and other areas) in Southern France. Through the quotes where nature was mentioned, we studied their perceptions of its presence in the different categories of areas they distinguish (city, countryside, mountain, seaside), as well as the various places where they established a contact with nature. Our results highlight the ranking of the areas where such a connection is pursued. Their interviews show both the importance of the residence itself as a place of contact with nature, and of the mobility patterns that make people feel closer to nature, such as relocation, multiple residences, short outings and longer trips. This qualitative study attempts to enrich the vision of the human connection with nature beyond the present focus on such connections in the city.","Duvernoy, Isabelle; Gambino, Mélanie",GeoJournal,243,18

Furthermore, a number of the Korean healthcare system’s weaknesses seem to have been completely exposed. The MERS-CoV outbreak can be considered a typical public health crisis in that the public was not only greatly terrorized by the actual fear of the disease, but also experienced a great impact to their daily lives, all in a short period of time. Preparedness for and an appropriate response to a public health crisis require comprehensive systematic public healthcare measures to address risks comprehensively with an all-hazards approach. Consequently, discussion regarding establishment of post-MERS-CoV improvement measures must focus on the total reform of the national quarantine system and strengthening of the public health infrastructure. In addition, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must implement specific strategies of action including taking on the role of “control tower” in a public health emergency, training of Field Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, establishment of collaborative governance between central and local governments for infection prevention and control, strengthening the roles and capabilities of community-based public hospitals, and development of nationwide crisis communication methods.","Kim, Dong-Hyun",J Prev Med Public Health,243,29

The COVID-19 severity is associated with a “cytokine storm.” Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are proinflammatory molecules that can activate pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). DAMPs and TLRs have not received much attention in COVID-19 but can explain some of the gender-, weight- and age-dependent effects. In females and males, TLRs are differentially expressed, likely contributing to higher COVID-19 severity in males. DAMPs and cytokines associated with COVID-19 mortality are elevated in obese and elderly individuals, which might explain the higher risk for severer COVID-19 in these groups. Adenosine signaling inhibits the TLR/NF-κB pathway and, through this, decreases inflammation and DAMPs’ effects. As vaccines will not be effective in all susceptible individuals and as new vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 mutants might develop, it remains mandatory to find means to dampen COVID-19 disease severity, especially in high-risk groups. We propose that the regulation of DAMPs via adenosine signaling enhancement might be an effective way to lower the severity of COVID-19 and prevent multiple organ failure in the absence of severe side effects.","Silva-Lagos, Luis A.; Pillay, Janesh; van Meurs, Matijs; Smink, Alexandra; van der Voort, Peter H.

This study aimed to determine the effects of a positive thinking training program on hope and sleep quality of patients with thalassemia major. METHODS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted on 78 patients with thalassemia major including 36 males (46.2%) and 42 females (53.8%) with a mean age of 25.56 ± 29.6 in Iran. Subjects were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. Experimental group received 16 h training based on positive thinking materials published by Martin Seligman. Control group received only usual programs. Data were collected at baseline, as well as immediately and one month after the intervention, using Snyder’s Hope Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Software 18.0; statistical tests included the independent T-test, the Chi-square, Mann Whitney, and Friedman test. Significance level was set at 0.05 in this study. RESULTS: The experimental group had a significantly higher mean hope score compared to the control group immediately (45.38 ± 7.82 vs. 35.32 ± 5.54, P < 0.001) and one month following intervention (44.67 ± 3.47 vs. 35 ± .54, P < 0.001). Moreover, the mean sleep quality scores of the experimental group was significantly greater than that for control group immediately (5.35 ± 2.02 vs. 7 ± 2.4, P = 0.004) and one month after the intervention (4.23 ± 2.2 vs.7.02 ± 3.03, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Since our training program on positive thinking improved hope and quality of sleep in patients with thalassemia major, we recommend the use of such courses as an important step toward promotion of hope and sleep quality among these patients.

The early initiation of disease-modifying treatments is crucial for preventing disease progression and neurological damage. Unfortunately, a diagnostic delay of several years is not uncommon, particularly in the presence of physical and mental comorbidities. Among psychiatric comorbidities, the role of alcohol misuse is still under debate. In this paper, we discuss a case of early-onset alcohol dependence and its possible role in delaying the initiation of a specific therapy for MS. The differential diagnosis between idiopathic and secondary neurodegenerative disorders is often challenging. When dealing with patients reporting an early-onset substance abuse (likely to present organic damage), clinicians may be prone to formulate a diagnosis of secondary neuropathy, particularly when facing non-specific symptoms. This case report highlights the need for in-depth medical investigations (including imaging) in the presence of neurological signs suggesting a damage of the central nervous system, prompting a differential diagnosis between idiopathic and secondary neurodegenerative conditions. Indeed, a timely diagnosis is crucial for the initiation of specific therapies positively affecting the outcome.","Luca, Maria; Chisari, Clara Grazia; Zanghì, Aurora; Patti, Francesco",Int J Environ Res Public Health,243,29

Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. Objective: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. Methods: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24 hours after initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes include hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, amount of viral shedding, and 30-day mortality. Results: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: pending. Conclusions: With growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power larger studies.","Bonfanti, N.; Gundert, E.; Goff, K.; Drewry, A.; Bedimo, R.; Kulstad, E.",,243,21

Collecting demographically and geographically resolved data on NPIs and their association with SARS-CoV-2 infection history can provide critical information related to reopening geographies. METHODS: We sampled 1,030 individuals in Maryland from June 17 – June 28, 2020 to capture socio-demographically and geographically resolved information about NPI adoption, access to SARS-CoV-2 testing, and examine associations with self-reported SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: Median age of the sample was 43 years and 45% were men; Whites and Blacks/African Americans represented 60% and 23%, respectively. Overall, 96% of the sample reported traveling outside their home for non-employment related services: most commonly cited reasons were essential services (92%) and visiting friends/family (66%). Use of public transport was reported by 18% of respondents. 68% reported always social distancing indoors and 53% always wearing masks indoors; indoor social distancing was significantly less common among younger vs. older individuals, and race/ethnicity and income were significantly associated with mask use (p<0.05 for all). 55 participants (5.3%) self-reported ever testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with strong dose-response relationships between movement frequency and SARS-CoV-2 positivity that were significantly attenuated by social distancing. In multivariable analysis, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was negatively associated with the practice of social distancing (adjusted Odd Ratio [aOR]: 0.10; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.03 – 0.33); the only travel associated with higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection was use of public transport (aOR for ≥7 times vs. never: 4.29) and visiting a place of worship (aOR for ≥3 times vs. never: 16.0) after adjusting for social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Using a rapid cost-efficient approach, we highlight the role of movement and social distancing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. Continued monitoring of NPI uptake, access to testing, and the subsequent impact on SARS-CoV-2 transmission will be critical for pandemic control and decisions about reopening geographies.","Clipman, Steven J.; Wesolowski, Amy P.; Gibson, Dustin G.; Agarwal, Smisha; Lambrou, Anastasia S.; Kirk, Gregory D.; Labrique, Alain B.; Mehta, Shruti H.; Solomon, Sunil S.",medRxiv,243,2

Although the B.1.1.7 variant has been reported from several countries, only two cases have been identified through whole-genome sequencing from Pakistan. We used a two-step strategy for the detection of B.1.1.7 with initial screening through ThermoFisher TaqPathTM SARS-CoV-2 kit followed by partial sequencing of Spike (S) gene of samples having spike gene target failure (SGTF) on real-time PCR. From January 01, 2021, to February 21, 2021, a total of 2,650 samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using TaqPathTM kit and 70.4% (n=1,867) showed amplification of all the 3 genes (S, N, and ORF).

In this prospective study, we aim to study intracranial vessel wall imaging findings in bacterial and fungal infections. METHODS: We included 12 cases of nontubercular bacterial and fungal CNS infections each, in whom definitive microbiological diagnosis could be made. High-resolution vessel wall imaging (VWI) and time of flight MR angiography (TOF MRA) were incorporated in the routine imaging protocol. All cases were evaluated for the presence of vascular enhancement, pattern of enhancement, and stenosis on VWI. Statistical analysis was done to evaluate association between findings of vessel wall imaging and infarctions. RESULTS: We found infarctions in 5 out of 12 cases (41.7%) of the bacterial group and 7 out of 12 cases (58.3%) of the fungal group. Vessel wall enhancement was seen in 5 cases (41.7%) of the bacterial group and 9 cases (75%) of the fungal group. There was a significant association between infarctions and vessel wall enhancement in the fungal group. However, pattern of enhancement or stenosis on VWI was not significantly associated with presence of infarction. VWI detected more cases of vascular involvement than TOF MRA. CONCLUSION: Secondary infectious vasculitis in bacterial and fungal infections can be detected by VWI, which can play an important role in better patient management as detection of vascular involvement can prompt early treatment to prevent complications like infarctions or hemorrhages.","Choudhary, Neha; Vyas, Sameer; Ahuja, Chirag Kamal; Modi, Manish; Sankhyan, Naveen; Suthar, Renu; Sahu, Jitendra Kumar; Goyal, Manoj K.; Prabhakar, Anuj; Singh, Paramjeet",Neuroradiology,243,18

Also, a better understanding and validation of Rotavirus entry factors as well as the systematic monitoring of dominant strains could assist in tailoring vaccines to individual’s needs.

The pathogenesis of severe cases remains unknown. We performed an in-depth prospective analysis of immune and inflammation markers in two patients with severe COVID-19 disease from presentation to convalescence. Peripheral blood from 18 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 9 with severe and 9 with mild COVID-19 disease, was obtained at admission and analyzed for T-cell activation profile, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and cytokine profiles. MDSC functionality was tested in vitro. In four severe and in four mild patients, a longitudinal analysis was performed daily from the day of admission to the early convalescent phase. Early after admission severe patients showed neutrophilia, lymphopenia, increase in effector T cells, a persisting higher expression of CD95 on T cells, higher serum concentration of IL-6 and TGF-β, and a cytotoxic profile of NK and T cells compared with mild patients, suggesting a highly engaged immune response. Massive expansion of MDSCs was observed, up to 90% of total circulating mononuclear cells in patients with severe disease, and up to 25% in the patients with mild disease; the frequency decreasing with recovery. MDSCs suppressed T-cell functions, dampening excessive immune response. MDSCs decline at convalescent phase was associated to a reduction in TGF-β and to an increase of inflammatory cytokines in plasma samples. Substantial expansion of suppressor cells is seen in patients with severe COVID-19. Further studies are required to define their roles in reducing the excessive activation/inflammation, protection, influencing disease progression, potential to serve as biomarkers of disease severity, and new targets for immune and host-directed therapeutic approaches.","Agrati, Chiara; Sacchi, Alessandra; Bordoni, Veronica; Cimini, Eleonora; Notari, Stefania; Grassi, Germana; Casetti, Rita; Tartaglia, Eleonora; Lalle, Eleonora; D’Abramo, Alessandra; Castilletti, Concetta; Marchioni, Luisa; Shi, Yufang; Mariano, Andrea; Song, Jin-Wen; Zhang, Ji-Yuan; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhang, Chao; Fimia, Gian Maria; Capobianchi, Maria R.; Piacentini, Mauro; Antinori, Andrea; Nicastri, Emanuele; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Ippolito, Giuseppe",Cell Death Differ,243,1

Based on the conducted experiments, in-process quality control (QC) parameters and acceptance criteria were defined for the manufacturing of hospital exemption ATMP (HE-ATMP). Finally, we conducted a validation of the manufacturing process in a GMP facility. In the current study, we presented a process approach leading to the optimization of processing and the ex vivo expansion of AT-MSCs for the development of ATMP for use in humans.","Labedz-Maslowska, Anna; Szkaradek, Agnieszka; Mierzwinski, Tomasz; Madeja, Zbigniew; Zuba-Surma, Ewa",Cells,243,24

However, there is evidence that such curfews have little or no effect on disease dynamics when other measures such as bans on gatherings or business and school closures are already in place. There are two possible explanations for this. First, nighttime curfews may elicit reactance—a feeling of anger that drives non-adherence; second, nighttime curfews may motivate people to shift activities from night to daytime, thereby increasing contact density. METHODS: A survey experiment was conducted with German participants (N = 997) to investigate public perceptions of nighttime curfews and possible detrimental effects on contact behaviors. RESULTS: Most participants perceived nighttime curfews as ineffective. The introduction of a hypothetical curfew did not affect intentions to reduce private contacts but instead elicited reactance, motivating participants to violate curfew hours or to shift a fictitious dinner meeting to an earlier time rather than cancelling it. CONCLUSIONS: When people do not support nighttime curfews or do not understand the rationale behind them, introduction of this measure may fuel the spread of the disease. For that reason, nighttime curfews should be a measure of last resort and should be accompanied by a public communication campaign explaining the importance of contact reduction during both nighttime and daylight hours.","Sprengholz, Philipp; Siegers, Regina; Goldhahn, Laura; Eitze, Sarah; Betsch, Cornelia",Soc Sci Med,243,26

Study Design: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of all pregnant women delivering at three hospitals in a large not-for-profit health care organization from March through July 2020. We compared outcomes between women with and without confirmed SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Coarsened exact matching was performed to match women with and without SARS-CoV-2 using maternal age, body mass index, gestational age at delivery, parity and institution of delivery. The primary outcome was a composite of maternal complications including stillbirth, postpartum hemorrhage, intraamniotic infection, endometritis and ICU admission. Secondary outcomes of neonatal complications included Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes and low birth weight. Outcomes were examined by adjusted binomial logistic regression analysis incorporating matched weights. Result(s): Of 2,714 women who delivered at the three hospitals, a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 was made in 122 (4.5%) women during the pregnancy. After coarsened exact matching, the study cohort included 486 women, 91 (18.7%) with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and 395 (81.3%) without this diagnosis. Demographic data showed that more Hispanic women were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other races. Compared to uninfected women, women with SARS-CoV-2 infection had statistically significant higher odds of the composite maternal outcome (6.6% vs. 14.3%;aOR 2.35 [95% CI 1.16-4.78). No statistically significant differences were seen between the groups regarding neonatal outcomes. Conclusion(s): Hispanic women were more likely to be infected during pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2, illustrating the racial disparity that exists within virus infectivity. Our data illustrates increased maternal morbidity with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but no differences in neonatal outcomes.

Typically, COVID-19 originates in the lung, but lately it can extend to other organs and lead to tissue injury and multiorgan failure in severe patients, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure and sepsis or systemic inflammation. Given that COVID-19 has been detected in a range of other organs, the COVID-19-associated disease is an alert of aberrant activation of host immune response which drives un-controlled inflammation that affects multiple organs. Complement is a vital component of innate immunity where it forms the first line of defense against potentially harmful microbes, but its role in COVID-19 is still not clear. Notably, the abnormal activation and continuous deposits of complement components were identified in the pre-clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, which have been confirmed in animal models. Recent evidence has revealed that the administration of complement inhibitors leads to relieve inflammatory response in ARDS. Hence, we speculate that the targeting complement system could be a potential treatment option for organ damage in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Qin; Chen, Zi",Med Microbiol Immunol,243,16

Technology-based care has received buy-in from all participants, and the need for technological assistance has been prioritized. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the initial perceptions and experiences of interprofessional behavioral health providers about shifting from traditional face-to-face care to virtual technologies (telephonic and televideo) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey-based study was performed at a large, integrated medical health care system in West-Central Florida that rapidly implemented primary care provision via telephone and televideo as of March 18, 2020. A 23-item anonymous survey based on a 7-point Likert scale was developed to determine health care providers’ perceptions about telephonic and televideo care. The survey took 10 minutes to complete and was administered to 280 professionals between April 27 and May 11, 2020. RESULTS: In all, 170 respondents completed the survey in entirety, among which 78.8% (134/170) of the respondents were female and primarily aged 36-55 years (89/170, 52.4%). A majority of the respondents were outpatient-based providers (159/170, 93.5%), including psychiatrists, therapists, counselors, and advanced practice nurses. Most of them (144/170, 84.7%) had used televideo for less than 1 year; they felt comfortable and satisfied with either telephonic or televideo mode and that they were able to meet the patients’ needs. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey findings suggest that health care providers valued televideo visits equally or preferred them more than telephonic visits in the domains of quality of care, technology performance, satisfaction of technology, and user acceptance.","Wright, Jesse; Dewan, Shyam; Hilty, Donald; Dewan, Naakesh A",JMIR Ment Health,243,30

The policy was based on the view that data relating to the incidence of Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) was linked to transfusion with women’s plasma. While appearing to treat female donors as equal to male donors, exclusion criteria operate after donation at the stage of processing blood, thus perpetuating myths of universality even though only certain ‘extractions’ from women are retained for use in transfusion. Many women in the UK receive a plasma-derived product called Anti-D immunoglobulin which is manufactured from pooled male plasma. This article examines ways in which gender has significance for understanding blood relations, and how the blood economy is gendered. In our study of relations between blood donors and recipients, we explore how gendered bodies are produced through the discursive and material practices within blood services.

The study is based on trip records of all the shared e-scooter operators in Austin and includes trip start and end locations. We use both analysis of trip patterns and spatial regression techniques to examine how the built environment, land use, and demographics affect e-scooter trip generation. Our findings show that people use e-scooters almost exclusively in central Austin. Commuting does not seem to be the main trip purpose, and usage of e-scooters is associated with areas with high employment rates, and in areas with bicycle infrastructure. People use e-scooter sharing regardless of the affluence of the neighborhood, although less affluent areas with high usage rates have large student populations, suggesting that students use this mode of travel. Implications for planners suggest that better bicycle infrastructure will facilitate e-scooter usage, college towns are a ready market for e-scooter sharing services, and e-scooters may be a substitute for some short non-work trips, reducing car usage, and benefiting the environment.","Caspi, Or; Smart, Michael J.; Noland, Robert B.",Transp Res D Transp Environ,243,3

A study of monthly airfare data from 2002 to 2004 confirms that fare wars occur periodically, as well as price collusion. Both tend to be short-lived. The fact that collusion is more likely to occur in January and April when demand is high, as revealed by China Eastern's and China Southern's price-war and collusion models, has been confirmed by interview information obtained from the airlines' sales managers. However, there is also evidence in these models suggesting that collusion can be more easily formed when demand is low. High airport concentration measured by the HHI may facilitate collusion in certain circumstances, but it may also lead to more price wars under other conditions. Concentration in both airports and routes does not appear to systematically affect the occurrence of fare wars and collusion in all the models estimated. We also reject the possibility that mutual forbearance due to multimarket contact plays any important anti-competitive role in China's airline markets.","Zhang, Yahua; Round, David K.",Int J Ind Organ,243,29

Virus replication and cytokine responses were measured in tissues of fetuses recovered at 109–112 days of gestation, just prior to parturition. At the time of recovery, gross anatomical abnormalities were evident in both infected and non-infected fetuses from the infected dams. Virus isolation and immunohistochemistry identified the thymus as the primary site of virus replication. Steady state RT-PCR amplification of inflammatory, Th1 and Th2 cytokines, showed elevated IFN-γ and TNF-α mRNAs in tissues from infected fetuses, which corresponded to elevated cytokine proteins in serum but not amniotic fluid. Further evidence for induction of immunity was found in the hyperplastic response of lymph nodes, which included the development of germinal centers occupied CDw75+ B cells. Collectively, these data support the notion that the immunocompetent fetus is capable of initiating an antiviral response, which is compartmentalized within the infected fetus.

Accompanying data relating to the sampled animals were collected in order to identify potential factors associated with increased antibody prevalence. The antibody prevalence was high at both sampling times with approximately 85% and 80% of animals positive for antibodies to BCV and to BRSV, respectively. Conventional herds had a significantly higher mean antibody prevalence to BCV and BRSV than the organically managed herds (P < 0.01). Animal age was significantly associated with increased antibody prevalence (P < 0.001).

The burdens of pandemic-associated increases in domestic and caregiving responsibilities, professional demands, health risks associated with contracting COVID-19, and the resulting psychosocial distress have exacerbated existing gender disparities at home, at work, and in academia. School and day care closures have created additional childcare needs, primarily for women, yet little support exists for parents and families. These increased childcare and domestic responsibilities have forced women HCWs, who make up the overwhelming majority of the workforce, to adapt their schedules and, in some cases, leave their jobs entirely. In this article, the authors detail how COVID-19 has exacerbated existing childcare accessibility and affordability issues as well as gender disparities. They argue that unless government and health care organization support for childcare increases, families, specifically women and children, will continue to suffer. Lack of access to affordable childcare can prevent HCWs from doing their jobs, including conducting and publishing academic scholarship. This poses incalculable risks to families, science, and society. COVID-19 should serve as a call to action to all sectors, including the government and health care organizations, to prioritize childcare provision and increase support for women HCWs, both now during the pandemic and going forward.","Robinson, Londyn J.; Engelson, Brianna J.; Hayes, Sharonne N.",Acad Med,243,16

A number of promising vaccines have been recently developed as a protective measure; however, cost-effective treatments are also of great importance to support this critical situation. Previously, betulinic acid has shown promising antiviral activity against SARS CoV via targeting its main protease. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory potential of this compound together with three other triterpene congeners (i.e., ursolic acid, maslinic acid, and betulin) derived from olive leaves against the viral main protease (M(pro)) of the currently widespread SARS CoV-2. Interestingly, betulinic, ursolic, and maslinic acids showed significant inhibitory activity (IC(50) = 3.22–14.55 µM), while betulin was far less active (IC(50) = 89.67 µM). A comprehensive in-silico analysis (i.e., ensemble docking, molecular dynamic simulation, and binding-free energy calculation) was then performed to describe the binding mode of these compounds with the enzyme catalytic active site and determine the main essential structural features required for their inhibitory activity. Results presented in this communication indicated that this class of compounds could be considered as a promising lead scaffold for developing cost-effective anti-SARS CoV-2 therapeutics.","Alhadrami, Hani A.; Sayed, Ahmed M.; Sharif, Ahmed M.; Azhar, Esam I.; Rateb, Mostafa E.",Molecules,243,20

We aimed to determine whether anakinra, a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist, could improve outcomes in patients in hospital with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, Bayesian randomised clinical trial (CORIMUNO-ANA-1), nested within the CORIMUNO-19 cohort, we recruited patients from 16 University hospitals in France with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, requiring at least 3 L/min of oxygen by mask or nasal cannula but without ventilation assistance, a score of 5 on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale (WHO-CPS), and a C-reactive protein serum concentration of more than 25 mg/L not requiring admission to the intensive care unit at admission to hospital. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a web-based secure centralised system, stratified by centre and blocked with varying block sizes (randomly of size two or four), to either usual care plus anakinra (200 mg twice a day on days 1–3, 100 mg twice on day 4, 100 mg once on day 5) or usual care alone. Usual care was provided at the discretion of the site clinicians. The two coprimary outcomes were the proportion of patients who had died or needed non-invasive or mechanical ventilation by day 4 (ie, a score of >5 on the WHO-CPS) and survival without need for mechanical or non-invasive ventilation (including high-flow oxygen) at day 14. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04341584, and is now closed to accrual. FINDINGS: Between April 8 and April 26, 2020, we screened 153 patients. The study was stopped early following the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board, after the recruitment of 116 patients: 59 were assigned to the anakinra group, and 57 were assigned to the usual care group. Two patients in the usual care group withdrew consent and were not analysed. In the analysable population, the median age was 66 years (IQR 59 to 76) and 80 (70%) participants were men. In the anakinra group, 21 (36%) of 59 patients had a WHO-CPS score of more than 5 at day 4 versus 21 (38%) of 55 in the usual care group (median posterior absolute risk difference [ARD] −2·5%, 90% credible interval [CrI] −17·1 to 12·0), with a posterior probability of ARD of less than 0 (ie, anakinra better than usual care) of 61·2%. At day 14, 28 (47%; 95% CI 33 to 59) patients in the anakinra group and 28 (51%; 95% CI 36 to 62) in the usual care group needed ventilation or died, with a posterior probability of any efficacy of anakinra (hazard ratio [HR] being less than 1) of 54·5% (median posterior HR 0·97; 90% CrI 0·62 to 1·52). At day 90, 16 (27%) patients in the anakinra group and 15 (27%) in the usual care group had died.

INTERPRETATION: Anakinra did not improve outcomes in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of anakinra in other selected groups of patients with more severe COVID-19.

We collected data for caregivers of children with CKD and caregivers of healthy children and matched the two groups using propensity score matching (PSM). We compared the differences in social support and loneliness between the two groups after matching and analyzed the relationship between social support and loneliness in the observation group. Before PSM, we analyzed the data for 247 caregivers of children with CKD and 315 caregivers of healthy children from 13 provinces. After PSM, the two groups each included 202 caregivers. The social support score of caregivers of children with CKD was lower than that of caregivers of healthy children (P < 0.002), while the loneliness score was higher for caregivers of children with CKD than for caregivers of healthy children (P < 0.008). The social support score was negatively correlated with the loneliness score (r = −0.598, P < 0.001). Caregivers of children with CKD experienced less social support and greater loneliness than caregivers of healthy children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, greater attention should be paid to providing social support for caregivers of CKD children and to improving the ability of these caregivers to cope with loneliness.","Shi, Lin; Zhang, Hengci; Yang, Haiping; Wu, Daoqi; Li, Xiaoqin; Zhang, Yunzhi; Chen, Xuelan; Wang, Mo",Front Pediatr,243,20

With improvement in health and sanitation facilities across the globe, there has been almost a 50% reduction in mortality rate due to RHD over the last 25 years. However, recent estimates suggest that RHD still results in more than 300,000 deaths annually. In India alone, more than 100,000 deaths occur due to RHD every year (Watkins DA et al., N Engl J Med, 2017). Children and adolescents (aged below 15 years) constitute at least one-fourth of the total population in India. Besides, ARF is, for the most part, a pediatric disorder. The pediatric population, therefore, requires special consideration in developing countries to reduce the burden of RHD. In the developed world, Kawasaki disease (KD) has emerged as the most important cause of acquired heart disease in children. Mirroring global trends over the past two decades, India also has witnessed a surge in the number of cases of KD. Similarly, many regions across the globe classified as “high-risk” for ARF have witnessed an increasing trend in the incidence of KD. This translates to a double challenge faced by pediatric health care providers in improving cardiac outcomes of children affected with ARF or KD. We highlight this predicament by reviewing the incidence trends of ARF and KD over the last 50 years in ARF “high-risk” regions.","Banday, Aaqib Zaffar; Mondal, Sanjib; Barman, Prabal; Sil, Archan; Kumrah, Rajni; Vignesh, Pandiarajan; Singh, Surjit",Front Cardiovasc Med,243,1

Eighteen countries in Europe report weekly influenza activity to EISS (http://www.eiss.org). A questionnaire on the virological data collection was sent electronically to the EISS members. Questions on the specimen collection, representativity, laboratory diagnosis of influenza, reporting of variants, testing for other respiratory infections, serological testing, near-patient tests and preparedness for a pandemic were included. The results of the survey showed that for the typing of influenza, the methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) methods are used most frequently. For the subtyping of influenza, HAI and PCR are used most often. An east-west divide was seen for the use of PCR in typing and subtyping (more PCR use in the west). Differences in the virological surveillance systems in Europe can make direct comparisons difficult because detection rates may differ by test. For the reporting of other respiratory infections besides influenza, many networks (68%) collect information on RSV. This is important because RSV causes similar clinical symptoms as influenza and can have a similar impact in terms of burden of disease. With the collection of RSV data, EISS is moving to a broader spectrum of viral respiratory diseases. The findings of this survey will be used to better harmonise laboratory methods in EISS in order to obtain more reliable and comparable information on influenza activity in Europe.","Meerhoff, T.J; Paget, W.J; Aguilera, J.-F; van der Velden, J",Virus Res,243,16

Codon usage bias analysis can reveal much about the molecular evolution and host adaption of ZIKV. To gain insight into the evolutionary characteristics of ZIKV, we performed a comprehensive analysis on the codon usage pattern in 46 ZIKV strains by calculating the effective number of codons (ENc), codon adaptation index (CAI), relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), and other indicators. The results indicate that the codon usage bias of ZIKV is relatively low. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that translational selection plays a role in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. The results from a correspondence analysis (CA) indicate that other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity may also be involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Additionally, the results from a comparative analysis of RSCU between ZIKV and its hosts suggest that ZIKV tends to evolve codon usage patterns that are comparable to those of its hosts. Moreover, selection pressure from Homo sapiens on the ZIKV RSCU patterns was found to be dominant compared with that from Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Taken together, both natural translational selection and mutation pressure are important for shaping the codon usage pattern of ZIKV. Our findings contribute to understanding the evolution of ZIKV and its adaption to its hosts.","Wang, Hongju; Liu, Siqing; Zhang, Bo; Wei, Wenqiang",PLoS One,243,8

A variety of prediction models are available in the literature. The majority of these models are based on extrapolating by the parameters related to the diseases, which are history-oriented. Instead, the current research is designed to predict the mortality rate of COVID-19 by Regression techniques in comparison to the models followed by five countries. METHODS: The Regression method with an optimized hyper-parameter is used to develop these models under training data by Machine Learning Technique. RESULTS: The validity of the proposed model is endorsed by considering the case study on the data for Pakistan. Five distinct models for mortality rate prediction are built using Confirmed cases data as a predictor variable for France, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, and Pakistan, respectively. The results evidenced that Sweden has a fewer death case over 20000 confirmed cases without observing lockdown. Hence, by following the strategy adopted by Sweden, the chosen entity will control the death rate despite the increase of the confirmed cases. CONCLUSION: The evaluated results notice the high mortality rate and low RMSE for Pakistan by the GPR method based Mortality model. Therefore, the morality rate based MRP model is selected for the COVID-19 death rate in Pakistan. Hence, the best-fit is the Sweden model to control the mortality rate.","Khan, Y.A.; Abbas, S.Z.; Truong, Buu-Chau",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,243,1

The reasons are multifactorial and include deficits in leadership, communication and workflows. This publicly funded study evaluates the effectiveness of the newly developed participatory, interdisciplinary, and multimodal IMPROVEjob intervention on improving job satisfaction among GPs and practice personnel. Here, we report the baseline characteristics of the participating GPs and practice assistants, focusing on job satisfaction and perceived chronic stress. Methods: The IMPROVEjob study was performed as a cluster-randomised, controlled trial (cRCT) with German GP practices in the North Rhine Region. The IMPROVEjob intervention comprised two leadership workshops (one for practice leaders only; a second for leaders and practice assistants), a toolbox with supplemental printed and online material, and a nine-month implementation phase supported by IMPROVEjob facilitators. The intervention addressed issues of leadership, communication, and work processes. During study nurse visits, participants completed questionnaires at baseline and after nine months follow up. The primary outcome was the change in job satisfaction as measured by the respective scale of the validated German version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (German COPSOQ, version 2018). Perceived chronic stress was measured using the Trier Inventory of Chronic Stress (TICS- SSCS). Results: Recruitment of 60 practices was successful: 21 were solo, 39 were group practices. At baseline, n = 84 practice owners, n = 28 employed physicians and n = 254 practice assistants were included. The mean age of all participants was 44.4 (SD = 12.8). At baseline, the job satisfaction score in the total sample was 74.19 of 100 (±14.45) and the perceived chronic stress score was 19.04 of 48 (±8.78). Practice assistants had a significantly lower job satisfaction than practice owners (p < 0.05) and employed physicians (p < 0.05). In the regression analysis, perceived chronic stress was negatively associated with job satisfaction (b= −0.606, SE b = 0.082, p < 0.001, ICC = 0.10). Discussion: The degree of job satisfaction was similar to those in other medical professionals published in studies, while perceived chronic stress was markedly higher compared to the general German population. These findings confirm the need for interventions to improve psychological wellbeing in GP practice personnel.","Degen, Lukas; Linden, Karen; Seifried-Dübon, Tanja; Werners, Brigitte; Grot, Matthias; Rind, Esther; Pieper, Claudia; Eilerts, Anna-Lisa; Schroeder, Verena; Kasten, Stefanie; Schmidt, Manuela; Goebel, Julian; Rieger, Monika A.; Weltermann, Birgitta M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,243,20

We evaluated lung and kidney perfusion abnormalities in patients with COVID-19 by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and investigated the role of perfusion abnormalities on disease severity as a sign of microvascular obstruction. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with COVID-19 who underwent pulmonary DECT angiography and were suspected of having pulmonary thromboembolism were included. Pulmonary and kidney images were reviewed. Patient characteristics and laboratory findings were compared between those with and without lung perfusion deficits (PDs). RESULTS: DECT images showed PDs in eight patients (25.8%), which were not overlapping with areas of ground-glass opacity or consolidation. Among these patients, two had pulmonary thromboembolism confirmed by CT angiography. Patients with PDs had a longer hospital stay (p = 0.14), higher intensive care unit admission rates (p = 0.02), and more severe disease (p = 0.01). In the PD group, serum ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase, fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and troponin levels were significantly higher, whereas albumin level was lower (p < 0.05). D-dimer levels ≥ 0.485 μg/L predicted PD with 100% specificity and 87% sensitivity. Renal iodine maps showed heterogeneous enhancement consistent with perfusion abnormalities in 13 patients (50%) with lower sodium levels (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a large proportion of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 had PDs in their lungs and kidneys, which may be suggestive of the presence of systemic microangiopathy with micro-thrombosis. These findings help in understanding the physiology of hypoxemia and may have implications in the management of patients with COVID-19, such as early indications of thromboprophylaxis or anticoagulants and optimizing oxygenation strategies. KEY POINTS: • Pulmonary perfusion abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, associated with disease severity, can be detected by pulmonary DECT. • A cutoff value of 0.485 μg/L for D-dimer plasma levels predicted lung perfusion deficits with 100% specificity and 87% sensitivity (AUROC, 0.957). • Perfusion abnormalities in the kidney are suggestive of a subclinical systemic microvascular obstruction in these patients.

The aim of this study is to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody in eligible donors and to study the demography and lifestyle of asymptomatic cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One thousand four hundred eighteen eligible donors were enrolled in this study in the Dubai Blood Donation Center from August to December 2020. Blood samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Donors' demographic characteristics and lifestyle were studied further. The χ2 test was used to analyze the data association. RESULTS: 88.4% of the studied group were males, 85% were from age 17 to 45 years, and 53% were regular donors. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was 13.5% and significantly related to gender, frequency of donation, collection site, type of donation, and more frequent when donors shared transport and accommodation. Blood group and age had no significant association. 5.5% were found to have cough/fever or a history of contact with positive COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was 13.5% among eligible blood donors, and hence the current eligibility criteria allow asymptomatic COVID-19 patients to donate blood. The seroprevalence was seen more in first time donors, suggesting that regular blood donors are safer. Additional risk factors related to lifestyle can be identified to ensure safety of transfusion during COVID-19 pandemic.","Raouf, May; Rabeh, Mariem; Kaur, Suminder; Sharma, Ranjita; Thottumkal, Nimmy; Mohammed, Roukaya",Dubai Medical Journal,243,9

Asthma, a common chronic lung disease, has been considered likely to increase the severity of COVID-19, although data addressing this hypothesis have been scarce until very recently. Objectives: To review the epidemiologic literature related to asthma’s potential role in COVID-19 severity. Methods: Studies were identified through the PubMed (MEDLINE) and medRxiv (preprint) databases using the search terms “asthma,” “SARS-CoV-2” (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), and “COVID-19,” and by cross-referencing citations in identified studies that were available in print or online before December 22, 2020. Measurements and Main Results: Asthma prevalence data were obtained from studies of people with COVID-19 and regional health statistics. We identified 150 studies worldwide that allowed us to compare the prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 by region, disease severity, and mortality. The results of our analyses do not provide clear evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, severity, or mortality due to asthma. Conclusions: These findings could provide some reassurance to people with asthma regarding its potential to increase their risk of severe morbidity from COVID-19.","Terry, Paul D.; Heidel, R.

Influenza types are distinguished based on differences in the nucleoprotein (NP) present in the virus. Conserved NP regions were therefore used to design a TaqMan®-based triplex reverse transcription real-time PCR method. Variability of influenza A within the probe target region mandated the development of a novel molecular beacon, the “Mega” molecular beacon (MegaBeacon; MegB), for the detection of influenza A with this method. MegaBeacon is a mismatch-tolerant molecular beacon that is also a TaqMan® probe. The triplex method (3QPCR-MegB) was evaluated with influenza A isolates covering 18 HxNx combinations, two influenza B isolates, and five Japanese influenza C isolates, as well as influenza A, B and C synthetic DNA targets. One to ten viral RNA and cDNA genome equivalents were detected per PCR reaction for influenza A, B and C. Seventy-one human nasopharyngeal aspirates from respiratory infections yielded 30 influenza A, 11 influenza B and 0 influenza C with 3QPCR-MegB, where immunofluorescence (IF) found 28 influenza A and 10 influenza B. 3QPCR-MegB was more mismatch-tolerant than a variant PCR with an influenza A TaqMan® probe (3QPCR) and is a sensitive and rational method to detect influenza viruses of animal and human origin.

The CAD-score is a non-invasive acoustic measure that, when added to pretest probability of CAD, has shown good rule-out capabilities. We aimed to test whether implementation of CAD-score in clinical practice reduces the use of diagnostic tests without increasing major adverse cardiac events (MACE) rates in patients with suspected CCS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: FILTER-SCAD is a randomised, controlled, multicenter trial aiming to include 2000 subjects aged ≥30 years without known CAD referred for outpatient assessment for symptoms suggestive of CCS. Subjects are randomised 1:1 to either the control group: standard diagnostic examination (SDE) according to the current guidelines, or the intervention group: SDE plus a CAD-score. The subjects are followed for 12 months for the primary endpoint of cumulative number of diagnostic tests and a safety endpoint (MACE). Angina symptoms, quality of life and risk factor modification will be assessed with questionnaires at baseline, 3 months and 12 months after randomisation. The study is powered to detect superiority in terms of a reduction of ≥15% in the primary endpoint between the two groups with a power of 80%, and non-inferiority on the secondary endpoint with a power of 90%.

This technology has the potential to improve the drug discovery, planning, treatment, and reported outcomes of the COVID-19 patient, being an evidence-based medical tool. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, there are chances that the application of the AI approach in drug discovery is feasible. With prior usage experiences in patients, few of the old drugs, if shown active against SARS-CoV-2, can be readily applied to treat the COVID-19 patients. With the collaboration of AI with pharmacology, the efficiency of drug repurposing can improve significantly.","Mohanty, Sweta; Harun AI Rashid, Md; Mridul, Mayank; Mohanty, Chandana; Swayamsiddha, Swati",Diabetes Metab Syndr,243,17

Methods: From 16th to 24th March 2020, 241 consecutive patients addressed to hospital for COVID-19 suspicion had both chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 3 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, and not evocative or normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. Results: Observer agreement across the 3 categories was good between all readers (kappa value 0.68 95%CI 0.67-0.70) and good to very good between pairs of readers (0.64-0.85). It was very good (0.81 95%CI 0.79-0.83), fair (0.32 95%CI 0.29-0.34) and good (0.74 95%CI 0.71-0.76) for the categories evocative, compatible and not evocative or normal, respectively. RT-PCR was positive in 97%, 50% and 27% of cases classified in the respective categories. Observer agreement was lower (p=0.045) and RT-PCR positive cases were less frequently categorized evocative in presence of an underlying pulmonary disease (p<0.001). Conclusion: Inter-observer agreement for chest CT reporting using categorization of findings is good in patients suspected of COVID-19. Among patients considered for hospitalization in an epidemic context, CT categorized evocative is highly predictive of COVID-19, whereas the predictive value of CT decreases between the categories compatible and not evocative.","Debray, M.-P.; Tarabay, H.; Males, L.; Chalhoub, N.; Mahdjoub, E.; Pavlovsky, T.; Visseaux, B.; Bouzid, D.; Borie, R.; Wackenheim, C.; Crestani, B.; Rioux, C.; Saker, L.; Choquet, C.; Mullaert, J.; Khalil, A.",,243,16

The majority of migrants are indigenous (referred to as Scheduled Tribes or STs in India), come from very poor households and have little or no education. Prior to the lockdown, the majority of migrants engaged in seasonal, temporary migration—working in dangerous, informal, low-skilled odd jobs for low wages for a few months to supplement incomes at home the rest of the year. Lack of local employment alternatives is cited as the primary reason behind migration. After the lockdown, in the absence of income from migration, households with former migrants hope to earn a livelihood locally—with assistance from National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), India’s public works program. Besides providing employment, NREGA works can include physical and health infrastructure which improve connectivity of health workers. NREGA works can also include community assets, such as facilities for irrigation, rainwater harvesting and plantations as well as child-care centers under India’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program. We posit that in the long run, this can improve health, education levels and livelihoods of the local communities, addressing not only the immediate need for local employment but also distress migration in the future.","Bhattamishra, Ruchira",World Dev,243,3

Objective: To investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 induced lockdown in Zimbabwe on nutrition, physical activity and lifestyle patterns among Zimbabwean population aged [≥]18years. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect information on demographics (age, gender, place of residence, current employment), food system dimensions, diet and physical activity patterns, stress and anxiety, body image perceptions, lifestyle behaviours like smoking, alcohol intake, screen time, and ease of access to health services. Electronic informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to completing the survey. Results: The majority of the participants were between the ages of 31-40 years, were female (63.0%) and had tertiary education (91.3%). The lockdown resulted in increase in food prices (94.8%) and decrease in availability of nutritious foods (64%). Most (62.5%) of the participants reported a reduction in their physical activity levels. The prevalence of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was 40.4% and mostly affecting females [63.5%, P=0.909), 31-40 years age group (49.6%, P=0.886). Based on the BMI-based Silhouette Matching Test (BMI-SMT) 44.5% gained weight, 24.3% lost weight and 31.2% did not have weight change. The paired samples T test showed that there was a significant increase in perceived body weight (P<0.001). More than half (59.6%) reported having difficulties accessing drugs and medication and 37.8% growth monitoring services. Conclusions: The lockdown period was associated with increase in food prizes, decrease in dietary diversification, elevated stress, disrupted diet and consumption patterns. There was low levels of physical activity and perceived weight gained during the lockdown period. However, there are still lots on unknowns concerning the COVID-19 pandemic future studies with larger population are required.","Matsungo, T. M.; Chopera, P.",,243,11

Wet markets are critical for food security and sustainable development in their respective regions. Due to their cultural significance, they attract numerous visitors and consequently generate tourist-geared information on the Web (ie, on social networks such as TripAdvisor). These data can be used to create a novel, international wet market inventory to support epidemiological surveillance and control in such settings, which are often associated with negative health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Using social network data, we aimed to assess the level of wet markets’ touristic importance on the Web, produce the first distribution map of wet markets of touristic interest, and identify common diseases facing visitors in these settings. METHODS: A Google search was performed on 31 food market–related keywords, with the first 150 results for each keyword evaluated based on their relevance to tourism. Of all these queries, wet market had the highest number of tourism-related Google Search results; among these, TripAdvisor was the most frequently-occurring travel information aggregator, prompting its selection as the data source for this study. A Web scraping tool (ParseHub) was used to extract wet market names, locations, and reviews from TripAdvisor. The latter were searched for disease-related content, which enabled assignment of GeoSentinel diagnosis codes to each. This syndromic categorization was overlaid onto a mapping of wet market locations. Regional prevalence of the most commonly occurring symptom group - food poisoning - was then determined (ie, by dividing the number of wet markets per continent with more than or equal to 1 review containing this syndrome by the total number of wet markets on that continent with syndromic information). RESULTS: Of the 1090 hits on TripAdvisor for wet market, 36.06% (393/1090) conformed to the query’s definition; wet markets were heterogeneously distributed: Asia concentrated 62.6% (246/393) of them, Europe 19.3% (76/393), North America 7.9% (31/393), Oceania 5.1% (20/393), Africa 3.1% (12/393), and South America 2.0% (8/393). Syndromic information was available for 14.5% (57/393) of wet markets. The most frequently occurring syndrome among visitors to these wet markets was food poisoning, accounting for 54% (51/95) of diagnoses. Cases of this syndrome were identified in 56% (22/39) of wet markets with syndromic information in Asia, 71% (5/7) in Europe, and 71% (5/7) in North America. All wet markets in South America and Oceania reported food poisoning cases, but the number of reviews with syndromic information was very limited in these regions (n=2). CONCLUSIONS: The map produced illustrates the potential role of touristically relevant social network data to support global epidemiological surveillance. This includes the possibility to approximate the global distribution of wet markets and to identify diseases (ie, food poisoning) that are most prevalent in such settings.","Kogan, Nicole E; Bolon, Isabelle; Ray, Nicolas; Alcoba, Gabriel; Fernandez-Marquez, Jose L; Müller, Martin M; Mohanty, Sharada P; Ruiz de Castañeda, Rafael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,243,23

Many such interactions have been discovered by chance, yet they have rarely been studied systematically. Increasing evidence suggests that virus–virus interactions are common and may be critical to understanding viral pathogenesis in natural hosts. In this review we propose a system for classifying virus–virus interactions by organizing them into three main categories: (1) direct interactions of viral genes or gene products, (2) indirect interactions that result from alterations in the host environment, and (3) immunological interactions. We have so far identified 15 subtypes of interaction and assigned each to one of these categories. It is anticipated that this framework will provide for a more systematic approach to investigating virus–virus interactions, both at the cellular and organismal levels.","DaPalma, T.; Doonan, B.

One potential target for SARS-CoV antiviral drug development is the 3C-like protease (3CLpro). This enzyme is an attractive target since it is essential for viral replication, and since there are now a number of high resolution x-ray structures of SARS-CoV 3CLpro available making structure-based drug-design possible. As a result, SARS-CoV 3CLpro has become the focus of numerous drug discovery efforts worldwide, but as a consequence, a variety of different 3CLpro expression constructs and kinetic assays have been independently developed making evaluation and comparison between potential inhibitors problematic. Here, we review the literature focusing on different SARS-CoV 3CLpro expression constructs and assays used to measure enzymatic activity. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence showing that the activity of 3CLpro enzymatic is significantly reduced when non-native sequences or affinity-tags are added to the N- or C-termini of the enzyme, or when the enzyme used in assays is at concentrations below the equilibrium dissociation constant of the 3CLpro dimer. We demonstrate for the first time the utility of a highly sensitive and novel Alexa488-QSY7 FRET-based peptide substrate designed for routine analysis and high-throughput screening, and show that kinetic constants determined from FRET-based assays that are uncorrected for inner-filter effects can lead to artifacts. Finally, we evaluated the effects of common assay components including DTT, NaCl, EDTA and DMSO on enzymatic activity, and we recommend standardized assay conditions and constructs for routine SARS-CoV 3CLpro assays to facilitate direct comparisons between SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors under development worldwide.","Grum-Tokars, Valerie; Ratia, Kiira; Begaye, Adrian; Baker, Susan C.; Mesecar, Andrew D.",Virus Research,243,24

There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. Methods: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. Results: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.","Abbott, Sam; Hellewell, Joel; Munday, James; Funk, Sebastian",Wellcome Open Res,243,2

In this commentary, we first describe company proposals, based on available public information, for the (frozen) storage of mRNA vaccine drug products across the vaccine supply chain. We then review the literature on the pharmaceutical stability of mRNA vaccine candidates, including attempts to improve their stability, analytical techniques to monitor their stability, and regulatory guidelines covering product characterization and storage stability. We conclude that systematic approaches to identify the key physicochemical degradation mechanism(s) of formulated mRNA vaccine candidates are currently lacking. Rational design of optimally stabilized mRNA vaccine formulations during storage, transport, and administration at refrigerated or ambient temperatures should thus have top priority in the pharmaceutical development community. In addition to evidence of human immunogenicity against multiple viral pathogens, including compelling efficacy results against COVID-19, another key strength of the mRNA vaccine approach is that it is readily adaptable to rapidly address future outbreaks of new emerging infectious diseases. Consequently, we should not wait for the next pandemic to address and solve the challenges associated with the stability and storage of formulated mRNA vaccines.","Crommelin, Daan J.A.; Anchordoquy, Thomas J.; Volkin, David B.; Jiskoot, Wim; Mastrobattista, Enrico",J Pharm Sci,243,1

Herbal medicine, used for thousands of years in combinational therapies (Herb Formula), plays a significant role in stimulating the host immune system in vivo, and meanwhile, in fighting against the pandemic by directly inhibiting influenza virus in vitro. Such potential Janus functions may spark interest in therapeutic manipulation of virus diseases. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism of the Janus functions of the medicinal herbs in the treatment of influenza remains unclear. In this work, to illustrate the therapeutic concept of Janus functions in the treatment of influenza, we have introduced a novel systems pharmacology model that integrates pharmacokinetic screening, targeting and network analysis of two representative herbs Lonicera japonica and Fructus Forsythiae that are efficient in the treatment of influenza, inflammation and other diseases. 50 Chemicals with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles have been identified for the two herbs, and the ligand–target network was constructed by complementing the literature-based experimental data deposited in DrugBank. The annotation of these chemicals was assigned using a novel drug targeting approach, and mapped to target–disease and drug–target–pathway networks. The overall data suggest that the medicinal herbs function by indirectly suppressing the virus proliferation via regulating the immune systems in hosts, and also, by directly inhibiting virus proliferation through targeting viral proteins essential for the viral life cycle. For the first time, we have demonstrated the mechanism of medicinal herbs in prevention and treatment of virus diseases via the Janus functions on a systematic level.","Wang, Xia; Xu, Xue; Li, Yan; Li, Xiuxiu; Tao, Weiyang; Li, Bohui; Wang, Yonghua; Yang, Ling",Integr Biol (Camb),243,1

One of the first measures to prevent the spread of the disease was to close educational institutions. The students were forced to start a learning process through social networks and web platforms. In some countries, a return to face-to-face classes was established. However, weeks later, some of them had to return to virtual activities due to an upswing in the COVID-19 cases. In Mexico, classes have been held virtually, with face-to-face activities only re-established in two of the 32 states. In our state, Yucatan, scholarly activities are still virtual. In this work, the dispersion of COVID-19 at different academic establishments in Yucatan was simulated. Networks of Friendship, noncordial treatment, family ties and study groups were considered. Based on these networks, we evaluated the possibility of returning to school without inducing a rebound in the COVID-19 cases in the state. Agent-based simulations were used, with each student as an agent. Interaction rules were established based on international research regarding good practices in times of COVID-19. We used seven networks from different academic institutions, ranging from primary through college level. As a result, possible contagion curves were obtained for different scenarios, which leads to a discussion about the measures that would be relevant once a return to face-to-face classes is overseen. Simulations show that isolating students and reducing the number of students in the same classroom are good strategies and substantially reduce the possible contagiousness.","Hernández-Hernández, Ana María; Huerta-Quintanilla, Rodrigo",PLoS One,243,20

However, the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral immunity are poorly understood. Here we have isolated primary SARS-CoV-2 viral strains and studied their interaction with human plasmacytoid predendritic cells (pDCs), a key player in antiviral immunity. We show that pDCs are not productively infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, they efficiently diversified into activated P1-, P2-, and P3-pDC effector subsets in response to viral stimulation. They expressed CD80, CD86, CCR7, and OX40 ligand at levels similar to influenza virus–induced activation. They rapidly produced high levels of interferon-α, interferon-λ1, IL-6, IP-10, and IL-8. All major aspects of SARS-CoV-2–induced pDC activation were inhibited by hydroxychloroquine. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2–induced pDC activation critically depended on IRAK4 and UNC93B1, as established using pDC from genetically deficient patients.

Several different infectious agents can cause neurodegenerative conditions, with prominent examples being human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) dementia and prion disorders. Such infections of the central nervous system (CNS) typically have a relatively long incubation period and a chronic progressive course, and are therefore increasing in frequency as more people live longer. Infectious agents may enter the central nervous system in infected migratory macrophages, by transcytosis across blood–brain barrier cells or by intraneuronal transfer from peripheral nerves. Synapses and lipid rafts are important sites at which infectious agents may enter neurons and/or exert their cytotoxic effects. Recent findings suggest the possibility that infectious agents may increase the risk of common age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke. While scenarios can be envisioned whereby viruses such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, herpes simplex and influenza promote damage to neurons during aging, there is no conclusive evidence for a major role of these pathogens in neurodegenerative disorders.

Mitigating the COVID-19 transmission requires not only the state and federal level order of protective measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public awareness of time-dependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We propose a robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of SARS-CoV-2 at all US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths, and we use the daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a community.

Our findings also indicate that reducing infection and deaths by a shortened infectious period is more pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction number close to 1, suggesting that testing should be used along with other mitigation measures, such as social distancing and facial mask-wearing, to reduce the transmission rate.

The viral genome is capped at the 5′ end, followed by an untranslated region (UTR). There is a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end, preceded by a UTR. The self-interaction between the RNA regulatory elements present within the 5′ and 3′ UTRs and their interaction with host/virus-encoded proteins mediate the function of the 5′ and 3′ UTRs. Using an RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID) assay coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry, we identified host interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 5′ and 3′ UTRs and generated an RNA-protein interaction network. By combining these data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data proposed to be involved in virus replication, we generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network, likely to be essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, bioinformatics analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism. Lysosome-associated membrane protein-2a (Lamp2a), the receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy, is one of the host proteins that interact with the 5′ UTR. Further studies showed that the Lamp2 level is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and that the absence of the Lamp2a isoform enhanced the viral RNA level whereas its overexpression significantly reduced the viral RNA level. Lamp2a and viral RNA colocalize in the infected cells, and there is an increased autophagic flux in infected cells, although there is no change in the formation of autophagolysosomes. In summary, our study provides a useful resource of SARS-CoV-2 5′ and 3′ UTR binding proteins and reveals the role of Lamp2a protein during SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Replication of a positive-strand RNA virus involves an RNA-protein complex consisting of viral genomic RNA, host RNA(s), virus-encoded proteins, and host proteins. Dissecting out individual components of the replication complex will help decode the mechanism of viral replication. 5′ and 3′ UTRs in positive-strand RNA viruses play essential regulatory roles in virus replication. Here, we identified the host proteins that associate with the UTRs of SARS-CoV-2, combined those data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data (expected to be involved in virus replication), and generated the RNA-protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network. Analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism, which are important for virus replication. Analysis of one of the interaction partners of the 5′-UTR (Lamp2a) demonstrated its role in reducing the viral RNA level in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Collectively, our study provides a resource of SARS-CoV-2 UTR-binding proteins and identifies an important role for host Lamp2a protein during viral infection.","Verma, Rohit; Saha, Sandhini; Kumar, Shiv; Mani, Shailendra; Maiti, Tushar Kanti; Surjit, Milan",mSystems,243,1

METHODS AND RESULTS: We leveraged the American Heart Association COVID‐19 Cardiovascular Disease (AHA COVID‐19 CVD) Registry to conduct a cohort study of adults hospitalized for COVID‐19. IHCA was defined as those with documentation of cardiac arrest requiring medication or electrical shock for resuscitation. Mixed effects models with random intercepts were used to identify independent predictors of IHCA and mortality while accounting for clustering at the hospital level. The study cohort included 8518 patients (6080 not in the intensive care unit [ICU]) with mean age of 61.5 years (SD 17.5). IHCA occurred in 509 (5.9%) patients overall with 375 (73.7%) in the ICU and 134 (26.3%) patients not in the ICU. The majority of patients at the time of ICHA were not in a shockable rhythm (76.5%). Independent predictors of IHCA included older age, Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; CI, 1.4–2.4; P<0.001), and non‐Hispanic Black race (OR, 1.5; CI, 1.1–1.9; P=0.004). Other predictors included oxygen use on admission, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on admission, and hypertension. Overall, 35 (6.9%) patients with IHCA survived to discharge, with 9.1% for ICU and 0.7% for non‐ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: Older age, Black race, and Hispanic ethnicity are independent predictors of IHCA in patients with COVID‐19. Although the incidence is much lower than in ICU patients, approximately one‐quarter of IHCA events in patients with COVID‐19 occur in non‐ICU settings, with the latter having a substantially lower survival to discharge rate.","Acharya, Prakash; Ranka, Sagar; Sethi, Prince; Bharati, Rajani; Hu, Jinxiang; Noheria, Amit; Nallamothu, Brahmajee K.; Hayek, Salim S.; Gupta, Kamal",J Am Heart Assoc,243,0

Mean blood pressure and the prevalence of raised blood pressure have declined substantially in high-income regions since at least the 1970s. By contrast, blood pressure has risen in East, South and Southeast Asia, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa. Given these trends, the prevalence of hypertension is now higher in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. In 2015, an estimated 8.5 million deaths were attributable to systolic blood pressure >115 mmHg, 88% of which were in low-income and middle-income countries. Measures such as increasing the availability and affordability of fresh fruits and vegetables, lowering the sodium content of packaged and prepared food and staples such as bread, and improving the availability of dietary salt substitutes can help lower blood pressure in the entire population. The use and effectiveness of hypertension treatment vary substantially across countries. Factors influencing this variation include a country’s financial resources, the extent of health insurance and health facilities, how frequently people interact with physicians and non-physician health personnel, whether a clear and widely adopted clinical guideline exists and the availability of medicines. Scaling up treatment coverage and improving its community effectiveness can substantially reduce the health burden of hypertension.","Zhou, Bin; Perel, Pablo; Mensah, George A.; Ezzati, Majid",Nat Rev Cardiol,243,11

Different process parameters—glucose concentration, temperature, ACN/water ratio and pH—were optimized to achieve maximum extraction of erythromycin. 88% (w/w) of erythromycin was extracted from the model system with following optimized conditions: glucose 156.3 g/L; temperature 4 °C; ACN/water ratio 1 and pH 8.3. Further, the effect of typical fermentation media components (starch, soybean flour, CaCO(3), NaCl and (NH(4))(2)SO(4)) on sugaring out extraction of erythromycin was also investigated. Starch, soybean flour and CaCO(3) were observed to affect erythromycin extraction only at higher concentration. Removal of suspended solids from simulated as well as real broth prior to extraction enhanced the extraction efficiency (from 72% to 87%). Sugaring out extraction of erythromycin was found to be more effective than salting out extraction. Also, higher partition coefficient was achieved in the present work than other reported methods using carbohydrates as mass separating agent. Further, it was found that the antimicrobial activity of erythromycin was preserved during sugaring out extraction of erythromycin.","Moharkar, Sharayu; Dhamole, Pradip Babanrao",Korean J Chem Eng,243,1

Food insecurity and COVID-19 may exacerbate one another through bidirectional links, leading to a syndemic, or sequential disease clusters, which exacerbate one another. Experiencing food insecurity may be associated with macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies, which can weaken host defenses, thus increasing susceptibility to COVID-19. Food insecurity is associated with chronic medical conditions, which may afford a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness. People experiencing food insecurity may have increased exposure to COVID-19 while procuring food. People with COVID-19 may be unable to work, generate income, and procure food while quarantined, which may exacerbate food insecurity. Clinicians should screen for food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide referrals to food-assistance programs when appropriate.

We investigated antiviral compounds that may potentially target SARS-CoV-2 antigenic spike (S) and host proteins; angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2), and transmembrane serine protease2 (TMPRSS2). We scrutinized 36 phytochemicals from 15 Indian medicinal plants known to be effective against RNA viruses via molecular docking. Besides, the TMPRSS2 structure was modeled and validated using the SWISS-MODEL. Docking was performed using Autodock Vina and 4.2 followed by visualization of the docking poses on Pymol version 2.4.0 and Discovery Studio Visualizer. Molecular docking showed that 12 out of 36 active compounds interacted efficiently with S, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 proteins. The ADMET profile generated using the swissADME and pkCSM server revealed that these compounds were possessed druggable properties. The Amber 12 simulation package was used to carry out energy minimizations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total simulation time for both S protein: WFA and S protein: WND complexes was 300 ns (100 ns per replica). A total of 120 structures were extracted from the last 60 ns of each MD simulation for further analysis. MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA were employed to assess the binding energy of each ligand and the receptor-binding domain of the viral S-protein. The methods suggested that WND and WFA showed thermodynamically favorable binding energies, and the S protein had a higher affinity with WND. Interestingly, Leu455 hotspot residue in the S protein, also predicted to participate in binding with ACE2, was engaged by WND and WFA.

With the increased implementation of neuropsychological services performed via telehealth during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the relationship between health literacy and comfort with teleneuropsychology warrants further investigation. METHOD: The present study examined 77 Veterans participating in neuropsychological evaluations as a part of standard clinical care. The sample was diverse in terms of age ethnicity, and psychiatric and neurocognitive diagnoses. In addition to a fixed-flexible neuropsychological battery, the Brief Health Literacy Screening Tool (BRIEF) was administered to evaluate health literacy. Self-reported comfort with the teleneuropsychological evaluation was assessed using an informal 10-point scale, and qualitative comfort responses were also recorded. RESULTS: Independent samples t-tests revealed older adults were more likely to participate in the evaluation via telephone than with VA Video Connect. Although health literacy was not related to telehealth modality, it was correlated with comfort with the teleneuropsychological evaluation (r = .34, p < .01), although it is notable that average comfort levels were high across modalities (M = 8.16, SD = 2.50). CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the notion that teleneuropsychological services may feasibly be implemented with a diverse group of patients, although flexibility with modality may be necessary. Those performing these services should also be aware that patients with lower health literacy may feel less comfortable with teleneuropsychology as they seek to build rapport and optimize evaluation engagement.","Sullivan-Baca, Erin; Babicz, Michelle A; Choudhury, Tabina K; Miller, Brian I",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,243,16

Using data collected from a rapid survey led by the National Institute of Statistics, on a sample of 1,310 respondents from April to May 2020. These data show that a large proportion of workers suffered a wage cut (60.93%) and temporary job suspension (31.6%), and the smallest proportion suffered job loss (7.47%). The results of the logistic regression show that lower frequency of outgoings to work, difficulties in accessing transport services and the loss of customer confidence have a strong negative impact on both wage cuts and temporary suspensions of work. The closure (total or partial) of activities has increasingly enhanced job loss. Further, the log of odds show that workers in private firms are more affected than their peers in public firms, and the middle‐aged are the most affected group. So, it is recommended to revamp the old methods of activity into digital innovation that enables less physical touch and find an appropriate way to support those who have lost their jobs during this Covid‐19 pandemic, particularly in the private sector.","Djoumessi, Yannick Fosso",Afr Dev Rev,243,30

Unfortunately, identifying COVID-19 from the CXR images is challenging as its radiographic features have a variety of complex appearances, such as widespread ground-glass opacities and diffuse reticular-nodular opacities. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive attention network (AANet), which can adaptively extract the characteristic radiographic findings of COVID-19 from the infected regions with various scales and appearances. It contains two main components: an adaptive deformable ResNet and an attention-based encoder. First, the adaptive deformable ResNet, which adaptively adjusts the receptive fields to learn feature representations according to the shape and scale of infected regions, is designed to handle the diversity of COVID-19 radiographic features. Then, the attention-based encoder is developed to model nonlocal interactions by self-attention mechanism, which learns rich context information to detect the lesion regions with complex shapes. Extensive experiments on several public datasets show that the proposed AANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","Lin, Zhijie; He, Zhaoshui; Xie, Shengli; Wang, Xu; Tan, Ji; Lu, Jun; Tan, Beihai",IEEE trans. neural netw. learn. syst.

Traditionally, screen time has been associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of these outcomes. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the change in screen time during COVID-19 school closures for children with ASD, and (2) examine the parent perceived impact of screen time on mental health and quality of life of children and their families. Canadian parents and caregivers of children 19 years of age and younger were eligible to participate in an anonymous, online survey study. This survey was available in English, consisted of 28 questions, took ~10-min to complete, and was available for 6 weeks (May 22 through July 6, 2020). The total sample consisted of 414 responses (ASD: n = 127, mean age = 11.7 ± 4.06 years; community sample: n = 287, mean age = 9.4 ± 4.26 years). Seventy-one respondents were missing responses to our primary question and removed from the analyses (final sample n = 344). Compared to the community sample, the ASD group had a significantly higher screen time use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic school closures [weekdays: difference = 1.14 (SE = 0.18), t = 6.56, p < 0.0001; weekends: difference = 1.41 (SE = 0.20), t = 6.93, p < 0.0001]. Mean total screen time during the pandemic was 6.9 h (95% CI 6.49, 7.21) on weekdays and 6.3 h (95% CI 5.91, 6.63) on weekends for the ASD group, and 5.6 h (95% CI 5.28, 5.92) on weekdays and 5.0 h (95% CI 4.70, 5.34) on weekends for the community sample. There was a significant increase in screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to before the pandemic period in the ASD group [weekdays: mean difference = 3.8 h (95% CI 3.35–4.25), p < 0.0001; weekends: mean difference = 1.5 h (95% CI 1.17–1.92), p < 0.0001]. Gender was a significant predictor of parent perceived mental health and quality of life, with male gender associated with a higher likelihood of negative impact [quality of life (child/family) OR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.1–2.9), corrected p = 0.040; mental health OR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.1–3.1), corrected p = 0.0028]. Parents' most frequently endorsed emotions toward screen time were guilt, frustration, and worry. Results of this survey study revealed that children with ASD were less likely to benefit from screen time to cope with social isolation, and screen time resulted in significantly more lost time on social interactions than the community sample, which may exacerbate difficulties in social domains. Given the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the novel context of technology use, the findings of this study highlight the need for revision of screen time recommendations to reflect the current needs of children and families.","Cardy, Robyn E.; Dupuis, Annie; Anagnostou, Evdokia; Ziolkowski, Justine; Biddiss, Elaine A.; Monga, Suneeta; Brian, Jessica; Penner, Melanie; Kushki, Azadeh",Front Psychiatry,243,22

The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. METHODS: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike. RESULTS: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. CONCLUSIONS: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78.

Methods This technical report will highlight our experience with the use of paracervical blocks (PCB) and oral multimodal analgesia (MMA) for appropriately selected cervical ICBT cases, allowing for completely clinic-based treatment. Results 18 of 19 (95%) screened patients were eligible for in-clinic ICBT. The excluded patient had significant vaginal fibrosis. 38 of 39 intracavitary implants were successfully transitioned for entirely in-clinic treatment utilizing PCB and oral MMA (97% success rate). One case was aborted due to inadequate analgesia secondary to a significantly delayed case start time (PO medication effect diminished). 95% of patients reported no pain at the conclusion of the procedure.

We used genetic risk scores to model how susceptibility to severe COVID‐19 correlates with baseline levels of 35 inflammatory markers, by testing their impact in a SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative population cohort. Because of the established effects of age and body mass index on severe COVID‐19 risk, we further considered how these variables interacted with genetic risk to affect inflammatory marker levels. METHODS: We accessed data on 406 SARS‐CoV‐2‐negative individuals as part of a UK population study. Multiplex electrochemiluminescence methods were applied to blood serum, and 35 inflammatory markers were assayed. Corresponding genotype data, alongside results from a large genome‐wide association study of severe COVID‐19, allowed us to construct genetic risk scores and to test their impact on inflammatory protein levels. RESULTS: Our results revealed that a higher genetic risk for severe COVID‐19 was associated with lower blood levels of interferon gamma (IFN‐γ), vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF‐D) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α). Inflammatory profiles of those with high genetic risk increasingly diverge from the norm in association with age and obesity. CONCLUSION: Our results support the theory that individuals at risk of severe COVID‐19 have a deficient innate immunity marked by reduced levels of inflammatory markers at baseline, including IFN‐γ, VEGF‐D and TNF‐α. We hypothesise that a secondary overactive adaptive immune response may subsequently explain the high levels of cytokines observed in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive COVID‐19 patients.","Powell, Timothy R; Hotopf, Matthew; Hatch, Stephani L; Breen, Gerome; Duarte, Rodrigo RR; Nixon, Douglas F",Clin Transl Immunology,243,24

We used a simulation model of air travellers arriving to the UK from the EU or the USA and the timing of their stages of infection to evaluate the ability of these strategies to reduce the risk of seeding community transmission. We find that a quarantine period of 8 days on arrival with a PCR test on day 7 (with a 1-day delay for test results) can reduce the number of infectious arrivals released into the community by a median 94% compared to a no quarantine, no test scenario. This reduction is similar to that achieved by a 14-day quarantine period (median 99% reduction). Shorter quarantine periods still can prevent a substantial amount of transmission; all strategies in which travellers spend at least 5 days (the mean incubation period) in quarantine and have at least one negative test before release are highly effective (e.g. a test on day 5 with release on day 6 results in a median 88% reduction in transmission potential). Without intervention, the current high prevalence in the US (40 per 10,000) results in a higher expected number of infectious arrivals per week (up to 23) compared to the EU (up to 12), despite an estimated 8 times lower volume of travel in July 2020. Requiring a 14-day quarantine period likely results in less than 1 infectious traveller each entering the UK per week from the EU and the USA (97.5th percentile). We also find that on arrival the transmission risk is highest from pre-symptomatic travellers; quarantine policies will shift this risk increasingly towards asymptomatic infections if eventually-symptomatic individuals self-isolate after the onset of symptoms. As passenger numbers recover, strategies to reduce the risk of re-introduction should be evaluated in the context of domestic SARS-CoV-2 incidence, preparedness to manage new outbreaks, and the economic and psychological impacts of quarantine.","Clifford, S.; Quilty, B.

Many of the events here depicted are likely to last far beyond the crisis and affect the subsequent evolution of food consumption in Italy. The Italian retail supply chain successfully adapted to the big shift in consumption. Despite purchases for essential items having increased, no stockout harmed the food security of Italians. Out-of-home consumption moved inside houses giving space to home meal preparation and comfort food. Home delivery has been the most important element in this context, as it boomed during this period, helping laggard consumers fill the digital divide, as it was mostly mediated by e-commerce platforms and instant messaging. It was also the leverage that allowed small retailers and small producers regain their space. This crisis calls for a more sustainable food system that will be increasingly oriented to moving goods rather than people, which will also have relevance in the coming years.","Cavallo, Carla; Sacchi, Giovanna; Carfora, Valentina",Heliyon,243,1

Here, we studied drugs targeting the proteins in this interactome to identify whether any of them may potentially be repurposable against SARS-CoV-2. We studied each of the drugs using the BaseSpace Correlation Engine and identified those that induce gene expression profiles negatively correlated with SARS-associated expression profile. This analysis resulted in 20 drugs whose differential gene expression (drug versus normal) had an anti-correlation with differential expression for SARS (viral infection versus normal). These included drugs that were already being tested for their clinical activity against SARS-CoV-2, those with proven activity against SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, and those identified/prioritized by other computational re-purposing studies. In summary, our integrated computational analysis of the HoP interactome in conjunction with drug-induced transcriptomic data resulted in drugs that may be repurposable for COVID-19.","Karunakaran, Kalyani B.; Balakrishnan, N.; Ganapathiraju, Madhavi",Res Sq,243,1

Lung injury has been reported as the major outcome of COVID‐19 infection. However, liver damage has also been considered to occur in severe cases. Current meta‐analysis of retrospective studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between liver injury and severity of COVID‐19 infection. METHODS: Online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 April 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, a fixed‐ or random‐effects model was used depending on the heterogeneity between studies. Furthermore, publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also done. RESULTS: In total, 20 retrospective studies with 3,428 COVID‐19 infected patients (severe cases = 1,455 and mild cases = 1,973), were included in this meta‐analysis. Higher serum levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 8.84 U/L, 95% CI = 5.97 to 11.71, P<0.001), Alanine aminotransferase (weighted mean difference = 7.35 U/L, 95% CI = 4.77 to 9.93, P<0.001), total Bilirubin (weighted mean difference = 2.30 mmol/L, 95% CI = 1.24 to 3.36, P<0.001) and lower serum levels of Albumin (weighted mean difference = ‐4.24 g/L, 95% CI = ‐6.20 to ‐2.28, P<0.001), were associated with a significant increase in the severity of COVID‐19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of liver injury, as assessed by serum analysis (AST, ALT, total Bilirubin and Albumin levels), seems to be higher in patients with severe COVID‐19 infection.","Parohan, Mohammad; Yaghoubi, Sajad; Seraj, Asal",Hepatol Res,243,30

Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is associated with this virus, mainly affects the lungs, recent evidence from clinical and pathological studies indicates that this pathogen has a broad infective ability to spread to extrapulmonary tissues, causing multiorgan failure in severely ill patients. In this regard, there is increasing preoccupation with the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 due to the observation of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 patients. This concern is also supported by the neurotropism previously documented in other human coronaviruses, including the 2002–2003 SARS-CoV-1 outbreak. Hence, in the current review article, we aimed to summarize the spectrum of neurological findings associated with COVID-19, which include signs of peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, olfactory dysfunction, meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we analyze the mechanisms underlying such neurological sequela and discuss possible therapeutics for patients with neurological findings associated with COVID-19. Finally, we describe the host- and pathogen-specific factors that determine the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and possible routes employed by the virus to invade the nervous system from a pathophysiological and molecular perspective. In this manner, the current manuscript contributes to increasing the current understanding of the neurological aspects of COVID-19 and the impact of the current pandemic on the neurology field.","Guadarrama-Ortiz, Parménides; Choreño-Parra, José Alberto; Sánchez-Martínez, Claudia Marisol; Pacheco-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Rodríguez-Nava, Alberto Iván; García-Quintero, Gabriela",Front Neurol,243,1

It was also confirmed previously that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) can bind to PEDV, and anti-pAPN antibodies may inhibit the combination. To investigate whether pAPN is a receptor for PEDV, we transfected MDCK cells with porcine aminopeptidase (pAPN) cDNA and this enabled non-susceptible cells to support PEDV replication and serial viral propagation. Moreover, the infection was blocked by antibodies against pAPN, implies the critical role of pAPN during virus entry. In addition, immunofluorescence assays for detection of pAPN and PEDV antigens, together with neutralization assays using antibodies against pAPN, further confirmed the correlation between pAPN expression and viral replication in pAPN-transfected MDCK cells.

KD has been reported in association with dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis. COVID-19 and dengue coinfection has also been described. However, MIS-C with concomitant infection has rarely been reported. We report an adolescent girl with clinical and laboratory parameters of MIS-C resembling KD with positive serology for scrub typhus at presentation. Clinical manifestations resolved and laboratory parameters improved with IVIG, azithromycin and corticosteroids. However, she developed fever recurrence with thrombocytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, hypofibrinogenemia and hypertriglyceridemia which were consistent with MAS. With the emergence of MIS-C and increase in the number of such cases being reported throughout world, physicians should be aware of different phenotypes of hyperinflammation associated with COVID-19 and the possibility of coexistence of MIS-C with other infections. LAY SUMMARY: Clinical and laboratory parameters of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) mimic Kawasaki disease (KD). KD has been described in association with dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis. However, MIS-C with concomitant infection has rarely been reported in literature. A 14-year-old-girl presented with fever and rash with history of redness of eyes, lips and tongue. Investigations showed anemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytosis with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, pro-brain natriuretic peptide, Interleukin-6, ferritin and d-dimer. Scrub typhus immunoglobulin M was positive. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin G (IgG) level was also elevated. A diagnosis of MIS-C with concomitant scrub typhus was proffered. Child received azithromycin, intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. After an afebrile period of 2.5 days, child developed unremitting fever and rash. Repeat investigations showed anemia, worsening lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia and hypofibrinogenemia which were consistent with a diagnosis of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). KD, MIS-C and MAS represent three distinct phenotypes of hyperinflammation seen in children during coronavirus disease pandemic. Several tropical infections may mimic or coexist with MIS-C which can be a diagnostic challenge for the treating physician. Identification of coexistence or differentiation between the two conditions is important in countries with high incidence of tropical infections to guide appropriate investigations and treatment.","Gupta, Aman; Gill, Arpinder",J Trop Pediatr,243,17

The following work presents a methodology by which Twitter data surrounding the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK is harvested and analysed using two main approaches. The first is an investigation into localized outbreak predictions by developing a prototype early-warning system using the distribution of total tweet volume. The temporal lag between the rises in the number of COVID-19 related tweets and officially reported deaths by Public Health England (PHE) is observed to be 6–27 days for various UK cities which matches the temporal lag values found in the literature. To better understand the topics of discussion and attitudes of people surrounding the pandemic, the second approach is an in-depth behavioural analysis assessing the public opinion and response to government policies such as the introduction of face-coverings. Using topic modelling, nine distinct topics are identified within the corpus of COVID-19 tweets, of which the themes ranged from retail to government bodies. Sentiment analysis on a subset of mask related tweets revealed sentiment spikes corresponding to major news and announcements. A Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm is trained and applied in a semi-supervised manner to recognise tweets containing location keywords within the unlabelled corpus and achieved a precision of 81.6%. Overall, these approaches allowed extraction of temporal trends relating to PHE case numbers, popular locations in relation to the use of face-coverings, and attitudes towards face-coverings, vaccines and the national ‘Test and Trace’ scheme.","Cheng, I Kit; Heyl, Johannes; Lad, Nisha; Facini, Gabriel; Grout, Zara",Sci Rep,243,1

Based on a recent consensus statement supported by international medical mycology societies, it has been proposed to define CAPA as possible, probable, or proven on the basis of sample validity and thus diagnostic certainty. Considering current challenges associated with proven diagnoses, there is pressing need to study the epidemiology of proven CAPA. METHODS: We report the incidence of histologically diagnosed CAPA in a series of 45 consecutive COVID‐19 laboratory‐confirmed autopsies, performed at Padova University Hospital during the first and second wave of the pandemic. Clinical data, laboratory data and radiological features were also collected for each case. RESULTS: Proven CAPA was detected in 9 (20%) cases, mainly in the second wave of the pandemic (7/17 vs. 2/28 of the first wave). The population of CAPA patients consisted of seven males and two females, with a median age of 74 years. Seven patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. All patients had at least two comorbidities, and concomitant lung diseases were detected in three cases. CONCLUSION: We found a high frequency of proven CAPA among patients with severe COVID‐19 thus confirming at least in part the alarming epidemiological data of this important complication recently reported as probable CAPA.","Fortarezza, Francesco; Boscolo, Annalisa; Pezzuto, Federica; Lunardi, Francesca; Jesús Acosta, Manuel; Giraudo, Chiara; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Sella, Nicolò; Tiberio, Ivo; Godi, Ilaria; Cattelan, Annamaria; Vedovelli, Luca; Gregori, Dario; Vettor, Roberto; Viale, Pierluigi; Navalesi, Paolo; Calabrese, Fiorella",Mycoses,243,24

The neurological manifestations of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, headache, cerebrovascular disease, and skeletal muscle injury.

Moreover, the patient underwent extensive investigations, including neuroimaging, cardiac and laboratory work-up with no evidence of stroke etiology. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of cerebrovascular events in the setting of COVID-19 is still uncertain and probably multi-factorial. The prevailing hypothesis is a strong thrombotic tendency, which may even be prolonged after complete recovery. In our patient’s case, hypercoagulability in the context of viral infection is the most likely mechanism for the stroke. Further studies are needed to find out the exact pathogenesis of thromboembolic events in the setting of COVID-19 infection as well as the efficacy, safety, dosage, and duration of anticoagulants in such conditions.","Alhashim, Ali; Alqarni, Mustafa; Alabdali, Majed; Alshurem, Mohammed; Albakr, Aishah; Hadhiah, Kawther; Aljaafari, Danah; Alyami, Rawan",Int Med Case Rep J,243,19

As a result, medical educators are placing more emphasis on patient-centered communication skills. However, few published curricula currently offer a comprehensive discussion of skills for providing patient-centered education (PCE), a key component of shared decision-making. We developed an interactive, two-session workshop aiming to improve students’ abilities to provide PCE. METHODS: Our workshop included didactic instruction, group discussion, and interactive simulations. The workshop was delivered to 50 clinical clerkship medical students. The first session concentrated on educating patients about their diagnoses, while the second session focused on providing patients with information about medications and other treatments. We used detailed and realistic role-play exercises as a core tool for student practice and demonstration of confidence. To evaluate the workshop, we used pre- and postsurveys. RESULTS: The sessions were well received by students, who strongly agreed both before and after the workshop that PCE was an important skill. Students also strongly agreed that the role-play exercises were an effective tool for learning PCE. They demonstrated significant improvements in their confidence to name important elements of PCE and to deliver PCE in the future. DISCUSSION: This workshop fills a curricular gap in offering a comprehensive and interactive curriculum for improving students’ abilities to provide critical PCE. The format and content should be easily adaptable to various disciplines, learners, and teaching modalities.","Mitchell, Thomas O.; Goldenberg, Matthew N.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,243,20

One was a young patient who developed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus while receiving clozapine and the other was an aging man who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus but had contact with COVID-19 during initiation of clozapine treatment. Both responded to clozapine treatment and were safely discharged from hospital without any complication. These cases suggest that, in the absence of complications, exposure to COVID-19 per se and the onset of mild symptoms in those infected may not warrant withdrawal or postponement of clozapine treatment when this is indicated.","Boland, Xavier; Dratcu, Luiz",Clin Psychopharmacol Neurosci,243,1

Objectives: To understand how communication among families, patients, and the ICU team was enabled during the pandemic. The secondary objectives were to understand strategies used to facilitate virtual visiting and associated benefits and barriers. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional, and self-administered electronic survey was sent (June 2020) to all 217 UK hospitals with at least one ICU. Results: The survey response rate was 54%; 117 of 217 hospitals (182 ICUs) responded. All hospitals imposed visiting restrictions, with visits not permitted under any circumstance in 16% of hospitals (28 ICUs); 63% (112 ICUs) of hospitals permitted family presence at the end of life. The responsibility for communicating with families shifted with decreased bedside nurse involvement. A dedicated ICU family-liaison team was established in 50% (106 ICUs) of hospitals. All but three hospitals instituted virtual visiting, although there was substantial heterogeneity in the videoconferencing platform used. Unconscious or sedated ICU patients were deemed ineligible for virtual visits in 23% of ICUs. Patients at the end of life were deemed ineligible for virtual visits in 7% of ICUs. Commonly reported benefits of virtual visiting were reducing patient psychological distress (78%), improving staff morale (68%), and reorientation of patients with delirium (47%). Common barriers to virtual visiting were related to insufficient staff time, rapid implementation of videoconferencing technology, and challenges associated with family members' ability to use videoconferencing technology or access a device. Conclusions: Virtual visiting and dedicated communication teams were common COVID-19 pandemic innovations addressing the restrictions to family ICU visiting, and they resulted in valuable benefits in terms of patient recovery and staff morale. Enhancing access and developing a more consistent approach to family virtual ICU visits could improve the quality of care, both during and outside of pandemic conditions.","Rose, Louise; Yu, Lisa; Casey, Joseph; Cook, Amelia; Metaxa, Victoria; Pattison, Natalie; Rafferty, Anne Marie; Ramsay, Pam; Saha, Sian; Xyrichis, Andreas; Meyer, Joel",Ann Am Thorac Soc,243,16

Observed daily concentrations of NO(2), PM(2.5), and O(3) during a “pre-lockdown” period (15 February–14 March 2020) and a “lockdown” period (22 March–2 May 2020), when lockdown measures were in full force everywhere in Canada, were compared to the same periods in the previous decade (2010–2019). Higher-than-usual seasonal declines in mean daily NO(2) were observed for the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020. For PM(2.5), Montreal was the only city with a higher-than-usual seasonal decline, whereas for O(3) all four cities remained within the previous decadal range. In order to isolate the impact of lockdown-related emission changes from other factors such as seasonal changes in meteorology and emissions and meteorological variability, two emission scenarios were performed with the GEM-MACH air quality model. The first was a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with baseline emissions and the second was a more realistic simulation with estimated COVID-19 lockdown emissions. NO(2) surface concentrations for the COVID-19 emission scenario decreased by 31 to 34% on average relative to the BAU scenario in the four metropolitan areas. Lower decreases ranging from 6 to 17% were predicted for PM(2.5). O(3) surface concentrations, on the other hand, showed increases up to a maximum of 21% close to city centers versus slight decreases over the suburbs, but O(x) (odd oxygen), like NO(2) and PM(2.5), decreased as expected over these cities.

Results showed that educational attainment and political partisanship were the most consistent correlates of social distancing. State-level indicators of culture appeared to have differentiated effects depending on whether the model outcomes were reduction in general mobility or to non-essential venues. State-level neuroticism was generally positively related to social distancing, but states marked by high neuroticism were slower to engage in such behaviors. Counties and states characterized as already engaging in preventive health measures (e.g., vaccination rates, preparedness for at-risk populations) enjoyed quicker engagement in social distancing.

RECENT FINDINGS: The studies reviewed include clinical trials that assessed the use of dapagliflozin in patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 (DARE-19 trial); evinacumab for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis; effect of genotype-guided oral P2y12 inhibitors vs conventional clopidogrel on long-term ischemic outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (TAILOR-PCI trial); anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (ACTION trial); atorvastatin vs placebo in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU (INSPIRATION-S trial); rehabilitation therapy in older acute heart failure patients (REHAB-HF trial); and aspirin dosing: a patient-centric trial assessing benefits and long-term effectiveness (ADAPTABLE trial). In addition, we review the results of the American College of Cardiology Global Heart Attack Initiative (GHATI). Finally, we discuss the secondary analysis of the STRENGTH trial assessing the association of achieved levels of omega-3 fatty acid levels and major cardiovascular outcomes. SUMMARY: The studies presented at the virtual American College of Cardiology Scientific Session 2021 represent remarkable contributions in the field of cardiovascular disease and prevention.","Jain, Vardhmaan; Al Rifai, Mahmoud; Mahtta, Dhruv; Liu, Jing; Hussain, Aliza; Virani, Salim S.",Curr Atheroscler Rep,243,33

Contact tracing apps aim to trace infection chains and interrupt them as quickly as possible more effectively. Corona tracing apps can be designed in a variety of ways from a technological, a development, and a functional perspective. Due to the diversity of options, more than 40 different apps have been developed and released in Europe since the beginning of the corona pandemic. This diversity of technology becomes a problem because the effectiveness of corona tracing apps depends on how many citizens use the same app. This paper addresses the diversity of different app configurations. Based on a morphological analysis, we investigate in which aspects the apps differ and then show that these apps can be distinguished into two archetypes.","Brendel, Alfred Benedikt; Greve, Maike; Masuch, Kristin; Trang, Simon",HMD,243,24

In this study, we provide a comprehensive in situ analysis of noble metals (PGE, Au, Ag) for (Cu-Fe)-rich sulfides from the Elatsite, one of the world’s PGE-richest porphyry Cu deposits. These data, acquired using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), indicate that Pd was concentrated in all the (Cu-Fe)-rich sulfides at ppm-levels, with higher values in pyrite (~ 6 ppm) formed at the latest epithermal stage (i.e., quartz–galena–sphalerite assemblage) than in bornite and chalcopyrite (<5 ppm) from the hypogene quartz–magnetite–bornite–chalcopyrite ores. Likewise, Au is significantly more concentrated in pyrite (~ 5 ppm) than in the (Cu-Fe)-rich sulfides (≤0.08 ppm). In contrast, Ag reaches hundreds of ppm in pyrite and bornite (~ 240 ppm) but is in much lesser amounts in chalcopyrite (< 25 ppm). The inspection of the time-resolved spectra collected during LA-IPC-MS analyses indicate that noble metals are present in the sulfides in two forms: (1) structurally bound (i.e., solid solution) in the lattice of sulfides and, (2) as nano- to micron-sized inclusions (Pd-Te and Au). These observations are further confirmed by careful investigations of the PGE-rich (Cu-Fe)-rich sulfides by combining high-spatial resolution of field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and focused ion beam and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (FIB/HRTEM). A typical Pd-bearing mineral includes the composition PdTe2 close to the ideal merenskyite but with a distinct crystallographic structure, whereas Au is mainly found as native element. Our detailed mineralogical study coupled with previous knowledge on noble-metal inclusions in the studied ores reveals that noble metal enrichment in the Elatsite porphyry ores was mainly precipitated from droplets of Au-Pd-Ag telluride melt (s) entrained in the high-temperature hydrothermal fluid. These telluride melts could separate at the time of fluid unmixing from the silicate magma or already be present in the latter either derived from deep-seated crustal or mantle sources. Significant enrichment in Pd and Au (the latter correlated with As) in low-temperature pyrite is interpreted as remobilization of these noble metals from pre-existing hypogene ores during the epithermal overprinting.","González-Jiménez, José M.; Piña, Rubén; Kerestedjian, Thomas N.; Gervilla, Fernando; Borrajo, Iñigo; Pablo, Julia Farré-de; Proenza, Joaquín A.; Tornos, Fernando; Roqué, Josep; Nieto, Fernando",J Geochem Explor,243,24

Most studies target a specific viral component of the RTC such as the main protease or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. In contrast, our strategy is to target multiple conserved domains of the RTC to prevent SARS-CoV-2 genome replication and to create a high barrier to viral resistance and/or evasion of antiviral drugs. We show that the clinically safe Zn-ejector drugs disulfiram and ebselen can target conserved Zn(2+) sites in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 and nsp14 and inhibit nsp13 ATPase and nsp14 exoribonuclease activities. As the SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 domain targeted by disulfiram/ebselen is involved in RNA fidelity control, our strategy allows coupling of the Zn-ejector drug with a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog that would otherwise be excised by the nsp14 proofreading domain. As proof-of-concept, we show that disulfiram/ebselen, when combined with remdesivir, can synergistically inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. We present a mechanism of action and the advantages of our multitargeting strategy, which can be applied to any type of coronavirus with conserved Zn(2+) sites.","Chen, Ting; Fei, Cheng-Yin; Chen, Yi-Ping; Sargsyan, Karen; Chang, Chun-Ping; Yuan, Hanna S.; Lim, Carmay",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,243,16

The incidence of PD is expected to increase given the growing aging population. Motor symptoms associated with PD render the patients unable to self-care and function properly. Given that several drugs have been developed to control motor symptoms, highly sensitive scales for clinical evaluation of drug efficacy are needed. Among such scales, the objective and continuous evaluation of wearable devices is increasingly utilized by clinicians and patients. Several electronic technologies have revolutionized the clinical monitoring of PD development, especially its motor symptoms. Here, we review and discuss the recent advances in the development of wearable devices for bradykinesia, tremor, gait, and myotonia. Our aim is to capture the experiences of patients and clinicians, as well as expand our understanding on the application of wearable technology. In so-doing, we lay the foundation for further research into the use of wearable technology in the management of PD.","Lu, Ruirui; Xu, Yan; Li, Xiaohui; Fan, Yongli; Zeng, Weiqi; Tan, Yang; Ren, Kang; Chen, Wenwu; Cao, Xuebing",Parkinsons Dis,243,24

At the same time, lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels in patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies (aPL) targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Small case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG/IgM/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) IgG/IgM) in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected anticardiolipin IgM antibodies in 23%, anti-PS/PT IgG in 24%, and anti-PS/PT IgM in 18%. Any aPL was present in 52% of patients using the manufacturer's threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (>40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rates. Similar to patients with known and longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL and that these aPL are potentially pathogenic.","Zuo, Y.; Estes, S.

Despite vendor promises, supply chain gains from new technology are often unfulfilled or result in a reduction of performance. A critical component of achieving promised gains is the hospital’s ability to accurately and consistently capture hospital inventory use. In practice, recording demand with perfect, 100% accuracy is infeasible, so our models condition on the level of accuracy in a particular hospital department, or point-of-use (POU) inventory location. Similar to previous literature, we consider actual net inventory and recorded net inventory in developing the system performance measures. We develop two models, optimizing either cost or service level, and we assume a periodic-review, base-stock (or par-level) inventory policy with full backordering. In addition to choosing the optimal order-up-to level, we seek the optimal frequency of inventory counts to reconcile inaccurate records. Results from both models provide insights for supply chain managers in the hospital setting, as well as hospital administrators considering the adoption of similar technologies or systems.","Neve, Benjamin V.; Schmidt, Charles P.",Health Care Manag Sci,243,8

A response was required to reduce possible disease transmission between the hospital and university. College of Nursing academic staff developed a programme in response to the educational and emotional needs of participants. METHODS: A MERS-CoV Task Force responded to the rapidly unfolding epidemic. The aim was to find out what nursing staff and nursing students in the college knew about MERS- CoV. While most gaps in knowledge were addressed after an intense information seminar, other learning needs were identified and responded to. The Task Force developed mandatory information sessions for all nursing faculty, students and staff. All staff were informed by email, letters and posters. There are 28 faculty staff, 84 support staff and 480 students in the College of Nursing. The information settings all took place within the College of Nursing, Princess Nourah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Questionnaires were given to faculty, students and staff to understand their baseline knowledge. After the sessions, faculty, students and staff were asked about what was learned through the sessions, and what educational needs still needed to be addressed. Approval was sought and received by the Ethics Committee for the College of Nursing. Participants completed informed consent forms and the voluntary nature of the study was explained. RESULTS: The total number of people attending the education sessions was133, including 65 students. 18 faculty members attended and 57 support staff. Data was gathered on gaps in participant knowledge and a plan was developed to address the gaps. Policies were established around student participation in clinical and return to work practices for staff with any symptoms. CONCLUSION: In hospitals there is above average risk for exposure to infectious diseases. Student nurses travel between hospital and university, with the capacity to act as a conduit of pathogens to large, susceptible populations. Nursing colleges must respond thoroughly to protect students and staff and prevent spread of disease into the university community in the midst of an epidemic.","Stirling, Bridget V; Harmston, Jennie; Alsobayel, Hana",BMC Nurs,243,21

Of special interest is the impact of COVID-19 lockdown. Many studies reported substantial improvements in air quality during lockdowns compared with pre-lockdown or as compared with baseline values. Since the lockdown period coincided with the onset of the rainy season in some tropical countries such as Nigeria, it is unclear if such improvements can be fully attributed to the lockdown. We investigate whether significant changes in air quality in Nigeria occurred primarily due to statewide COVID-19 lockdown. We applied a neural network approach to derive monthly average ground-level fine aerosol optical depth (AODf) across Nigeria from year 2001–2020, using the Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AODs from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites, AERONET aerosol optical properties, meteorological and spatial parameters. During the year 2020. we found a 21% or 26% decline in average AODf level across Nigeria during lockdown (April) as compared to pre-lockdown (March), or during the easing phase-1 (May) as compared to lockdown, respectively. Throughout the 20-year period, AODf levels were highest in January and lowest in May or June, but not April. Comparison of AODf levels between 2020 and 2019 shows a small decline (1%) in pollution level in April of 2020 compare to 2019. Using a linear time-lag model to compare changes in AODf levels for similar months from 2002–2020, we found no significant difference (Levene’s test and ANCOVA; α=0.05) in the pollution levels by year, which indicates that the lockdown did not significantly improve air quality in Nigeria. Impact analysis using multiple linear regression revealed that favorable meteorological conditions due to seasonal change in temperature, relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height, wind speed and rainfall improved air quality during the lockdown.","Etchie, Tunde Ogbemi; Etchie, Ayotunde Titilayo; Jauro, Aliyu; Pinker, Rachel T.; Swaminathan, Nedunchezhian",Sci Total Environ,243,3

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and harms of remdesivir for COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: Several databases, tables of contents of journals, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration and company websites were searched from 1 January through 31 August 2020. STUDY SELECTION: English-language, randomized trials of remdesivir treatments for adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. New evidence will be incorporated using living review methods. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction and risk-of-bias assessment verified by a second reviewer; GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods used for certainty-of-evidence assessments. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four randomized trials were included. In adults with severe COVID-19, remdesivir compared with placebo probably improves recovery by a large amount (absolute risk difference [ARD] range, 7% to 10%) and may result in a small reduction in mortality (ARD range, -4% to 1%) and a shorter time to recovery or clinical improvement. Remdesivir may have little to no effect on hospital length of stay. Remdesivir probably reduces serious adverse events by a moderate amount (ARD range, −6% to −8%). Compared with a 10-day remdesivir course, a 5-day course may reduce mortality, increase recovery or clinical improvement by small to moderate amounts, reduce time to recovery, and reduce serious adverse events among hospitalized patients not requiring mechanical ventilation. Recovery due to remdesivir may not vary by age, sex, symptom duration, or disease severity. LIMITATIONS: Low-certainty evidence with few published trials, including 1 preliminary report and 2 open-label trials. Trials excluded pregnant women and adults with severe kidney or liver disease. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with COVID-19, remdesivir probably improves recovery and reduces serious adverse events and may reduce mortality and time to clinical improvement. For adults not receiving mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, a 5-day course of remdesivir may provide similar benefits to and fewer harms than a 10-day course.

FCoV seroprevalence increased until 2 years of age, was highest in 2014 and among household cats living with other cats and with outdoor access, and was lower in FIV seropositive compared to seronegative cats. Symptoms typically associated with wet feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) including ascites, abdominal distention or pleural effusion, coupled in many cases with non-antibiotic responsive fever, were observed in 19% (32/169) of cats, and 75% (24/32) of these cats were FCoV seropositive.
