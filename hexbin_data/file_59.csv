82,The Waiting Time for Inter-Country Spread of Pandemic Influenza,2007-01-03,"BACKGROUND: The time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning. We quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The model constructed for this time delay accounts for: (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. CONCLUSIONS: The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza.","Caley, Peter; Becker, Niels G.; Philp, David J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1764036/,59
434,Evolutionary Entropy Determines Invasion Success in Emergent Epidemics,2010-09-23,"BACKGROUND: Standard epidemiological theory claims that in structured populations competition between multiple pathogen strains is a deterministic process which is mediated by the basic reproduction number ([Image: see text]) of the individual strains. A new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that the quantity [Image: see text] is a valid predictor in structured populations only when size is infinite. In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on [Image: see text] as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size. CONCLUSION: An epidemiological analysis based on entropy is shown to explain empirical observations regarding the emergence of less pathogenic strains of human influenza during the antigenic drift phase. Furthermore, we exploit the entropy perspective to discuss certain epidemiological patterns of the current H1N1 swine 'flu outbreak.","Rhodes, Christopher J.; Demetrius, Lloyd",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944876/,59
1212,Development of an Aerosol Model of Cryptococcus Reveals Humidity as an Important Factor Affecting the Viability of Cryptococcus during Aerosolization,2013-07-23,"Cryptococcus is an emerging global health threat that is annually responsible for over 1,000,000 infections and one third of all AIDS patient deaths. There is an ongoing outbreak of cryptococcosis in the western United States and Canada. Cryptococcosis is a disease resulting from the inhalation of the infectious propagules from the environment. The current and most frequently used animal infection models initiate infection via liquid suspension through intranasal instillation or intravenous injection. These models do not replicate the typically dry nature of aerosol exposure and may hinder our ability to decipher the initial events that lead to clearance or the establishment of infection. We have established a standardized aerosol model of murine infection for the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus. Aerosolized cells were generated utilizing a Collison nebulizer in a whole-body Madison Chamber at different humidity conditions. The aerosols inside the chamber were sampled using a BioSampler to determine viable aerosol concentration and spray factor (ratio of viable aerosol concentration to total inoculum concentration). We have effectively delivered yeast and yeast-spore mixtures to the lungs of mice and observed the establishment of disease. We observed that growth conditions prior to exposure and humidity within the Madison Chamber during exposure can alter Cryptococcus survival and dose retained in mice.","Springer, Deborah J.; Saini, Divey; Byrnes, Edmond J.; Heitman, Joseph; Frothingham, Richard",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720958/,59
1434,Apolipoprotein D takes center stage in the stress response of the aging and degenerative brain(),2014-07-11,"Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) is an ancient member of the lipocalin family with a high degree of sequence conservation from insects to mammals. It is not structurally related to other major apolipoproteins and has been known as a small, soluble carrier protein of lipophilic molecules that is mostly expressed in neurons and glial cells within the central and peripheral nervous system. Recent data indicate that ApoD not only supplies cells with lipophilic molecules, but also controls the fate of these ligands by modulating their stability and oxidation status. Of particular interest is the binding of ApoD to arachidonic acid and its derivatives, which play a central role in healthy brain function. ApoD has been shown to act as a catalyst in the reduction of peroxidized eicosanoids and to attenuate lipid peroxidation in the brain. Manipulating its expression level in fruit flies and mice has demonstrated that ApoD has a favorable effect on both stress resistance and life span. The APOD gene is the gene that is upregulated the most in the aging human brain. Furthermore, ApoD levels in the nervous system are elevated in a large number of neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and stroke. There is increasing evidence for a prominent neuroprotective role of ApoD because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. ApoD emerges as an evolutionarily conserved anti-stress protein that is induced by oxidative stress and inflammation and may prove to be an effective therapeutic agent against a variety of neuropathologies, and even against aging.","Dassati, Sarah; Waldner, Andreas; Schweigreiter, Rüdiger",Neurobiol Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988949/,59
2037,Rapid drop in the reproduction number during the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo,2015-11-19,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) experienced a confined rural outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) with 69 reported cases from July to October 2014. Understanding the transmission dynamics during the outbreak can provide important information for anticipating and controlling future EVD epidemics. I fitted an EVD transmission model to previously published data of this outbreak and estimated the basic reproduction number R(0) = 5.2 (95% CI [4.0–6.7]). The model suggests that the net reproduction number R(t) fell below unity 28 days (95% CI [25–34] days) after the onset of symptoms in the index case. This study adds to previous epidemiological descriptions of the 2014 EVD outbreak in DRC, and is consistent with the notion that a rapid implementation of control interventions helped reduce further spread.","Althaus, Christian L.",PeerJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4655090/,59
2512,Viral factors in influenza pandemic risk assessment,2016-11-11,"The threat of an influenza A virus pandemic stems from continual virus spillovers from reservoir species, a tiny fraction of which spark sustained transmission in humans. To date, no pandemic emergence of a new influenza strain has been preceded by detection of a closely related precursor in an animal or human. Nonetheless, influenza surveillance efforts are expanding, prompting a need for tools to assess the pandemic risk posed by a detected virus. The goal would be to use genetic sequence and/or biological assays of viral traits to identify those non-human influenza viruses with the greatest risk of evolving into pandemic threats, and/or to understand drivers of such evolution, to prioritize pandemic prevention or response measures. We describe such efforts, identify progress and ongoing challenges, and discuss three specific traits of influenza viruses (hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity, hemagglutinin pH of activation, and polymerase complex efficiency) that contribute to pandemic risk.

2603,"An examination of the factorial and convergent validity of four measures of conspiracist ideation, with recommendations for researchers",2017-02-23,"A number scales have been developed to measure conspiracist ideation, but little attention has been paid to the factorial validity of these scales. We reassessed the psychometric properties of four widely-used scales, namely the Belief in Conspiracy Theories Inventory (BCTI), the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale (GCBS), and the One-Item Conspiracy Measure (OICM). Eight-hundred-and-three U.S. adults completed all measures, along with measures of endorsement of 9/11 and anti-vaccination conspiracy theories. Through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we found that only the BCTI had acceptable factorial validity. We failed to confirm the factor structures of the CMQ and the GBCS, suggesting these measures had poor factorial validity. Indices of convergent validity were acceptable for the BCTI, but weaker for the other measures. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for the future refinement in the measurement of conspiracist ideation.","Swami, Viren; Barron, David; Weis, Laura; Voracek, Martin; Stieger, Stefan; Furnham, Adrian",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5322923/,59
3658,Estimation of the effective reproduction number of influenza based on weekly reports in Miyazaki Prefecture,2019-02-22,"In Japan, as part of surveillance for seasonal influenza, the number of patients per influenza sentinel site is counted on a weekly basis. Currently, reference values are set for the weekly reported number of influenza cases per sentinel, and pre-epidemic and epidemic warnings are issued based on these values. In this study, we examined the association between these reference values and the effective reproduction number (R(t)) using surveillance data for Miyazaki Prefecture collected from 2010 to 2011. There are nine public health centre jurisdictions in this prefecture, and R(t) exceeded 1.0 at the time when pre-epidemic warnings were issued in almost all the jurisdictions. Thus, it was indicated that the validity of the reference value was also high for influenza transmission. However, our results indicated the presence of secondary epidemic caused by infections originating both from other jurisdictions and inner jurisdictions, and it is occasionally not possible to evaluate the end of an epidemic in a jurisdiction using only the reference value of termination. It is necessary to establish new methods after considering the situation in the surrounding jurisdictions for more detailed epidemic predictions.","Yamauchi, Takenori; Takeuchi, Shouhei; Yamano, Yuko; Kuroda, Yoshiki; Nakadate, Toshio",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6384943/,59
3679,"Projections of Ebola outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use in Équateur, Democratic Republic of Congo, as of May 27, 2018",2019-03-07,"As of May 27, 2018, 6 suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) had been reported in Équateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo. We used reported case counts and time series from prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without vaccine use. We modeled Ebola virus transmission using a stochastic branching process model that included reproduction numbers from past Ebola outbreaks and a particle filtering method to generate a probabilistic projection of the outbreak size and duration conditioned on its reported trajectory to date; modeled using high (62%), low (44%), and zero (0%) estimates of vaccination coverage (after deployment). Additionally, we used the time series for 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 to parameterize the Thiel-Sen regression model predicting the outbreak size from the number of observed cases from April 4 to May 27. We used these techniques on probable and confirmed case counts with and without inclusion of suspected cases. Probabilistic projections were scored against the actual outbreak size of 54 EVD cases, using a log-likelihood score. With the stochastic model, using high, low, and zero estimates of vaccination coverage, the median outbreak sizes for probable and confirmed cases were 82 cases (95% prediction interval [PI]: 55, 156), 104 cases (95% PI: 58, 271), and 213 cases (95% PI: 64, 1450), respectively. With the Thiel-Sen regression model, the median outbreak size was estimated to be 65.0 probable and confirmed cases (95% PI: 48.8, 119.7). Among our three mathematical models, the stochastic model with suspected cases and high vaccine coverage predicted total outbreak sizes closest to the true outcome. Relatively simple mathematical models updated in real time may inform outbreak response teams with projections of total outbreak size and duration.","Kelly, J. Daniel; Worden, Lee; Wannier, S.

4021,Effect of Saccharomyces boulardii Supplementation on Performance and Physiological Traits of Holstein Calves under Heat Stress Conditions,2019-07-31,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In this study, the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii (SB) supplement on the performance and physiological traits of Holstein calves under heat stress were investigated using a climatic chamber. We revealed that supplementation with SB incorporated into milk replacer can ameliorate the negative impact of heat stress on Holstein dairy calves by increasing dry matter intake (DMI), reducing rectal temperature and heart rate, and alleviating diarrhea via modulating pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tract. The results showed that SB can be used as an alternative anti-stressor in the diet of young dairy calves under heat stress (HS). ABSTRACT: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-1079 (SB) as a feed additive on performance, diarrhea frequency, rectal temperature, heart rate, water consumption, cortisol level, and fecal bacteria population in Holstein calves (28 ± 1.6 days of age, body weight of 45.6 ± 1.44 kg, n = 16) under thermal neutral (TN) and heat stress (HS) conditions. During the TN period for 21 days (d 1 to 21), calves receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher dry matter intake (DMI, p = 0.002), and water consumption (p = 0.007) but lower frequency of fecal diarrhea (p = 0.008), rectal temperature (p < 0.001), heart rate (p < 0.001), and fecal microbiota at 21 day (Escherichia coli, p = 0.025; Enterobacteriaceae, p = 0.041). Meanwhile, calves exposed to HS for 7 days (d 22 to 28) receiving SB showed quadratic or linear effects compared to the control group, showing higher DMI (p = 0.002) but lower water consumption (p = 0.023), rectal temperature (p = 0.026), and cortisol level (p = 0.014). Our results suggest that live SB is useful in the livestock industry as an alternative to conventional medication (especially in times of suspected health problems) that can be added to milk replacer for young dairy calves experiencing HS.","Lee, Jae-Sung; Kacem, Nouali; Kim, Won-Seob; Peng, Dong Qiao; Kim, Young-Jun; Joung, Youn-Geun; Lee, Chanhee; Lee, Hong-Gu",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719173/,59
4512,The challenge of describing the epidemiology of HTLV in the Amazon region of Brazil,2020-02-14,"BACKGROUND: Optimal timing for the start of vasopressors (VP) in septic shock has not been widely studied since it is assumed that fluids must be administered in advance. We sought to evaluate whether a very early start of VP, even without completing the initial fluid loading, might impact clinical outcomes in septic shock. METHODS: A total of 337 patients with sepsis requiring VP support for at least 6 h were initially selected from a prospectively collected database in a 90-bed mixed-ICU during a 24-month period. They were classified into very-early (VE-VPs) or delayed vasopressor start (D-VPs) categories according to whether norepinephrine was initiated or not within/before the next hour of the first resuscitative fluid load. Then, VE-VPs (n = 93) patients were 1:1 propensity matched to D-VPs (n = 93) based on age; source of admission (emergency room, general wards, intensive care unit); chronic and acute comorbidities; and lactate, heart rate, systolic, and diastolic pressure at vasopressor start. A risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model was fitted to assess the association between VE-VPs and day 28 mortality. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed also including those patients requiring VP support for less than 6 h. RESULTS: Patients subjected to VE-VPs received significantly less resuscitation fluids at vasopressor starting (0[0–510] vs. 1500[650–2300] mL, p < 0.001) and during the first 8 h of resuscitation (1100[500–1900] vs. 2600[1600–3800] mL, p < 0.001), with no significant increase in acute renal failure and/or renal replacement therapy requirements. VE-VPs was related with significant lower net fluid balances 8 and 24 h after VPs. VE-VPs was also associated with a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to D-VPs (HR 0.31, CI95% 0.17–0.57, p < 0.001) at day 28. Such association was maintained after including patients receiving vasopressors for < 6 h. CONCLUSION: A very early start of vasopressor support seems to be safe, might limit the amount of fluids to resuscitate septic shock, and could lead to better clinical outcomes.","Ospina-Tascón, Gustavo A.; Hernandez, Glenn; Alvarez, Ingrid; Calderón-Tapia, Luis E.; Manzano-Nunez, Ramiro; Sánchez-Ortiz, Alvaro I.; Quiñones, Egardo; Ruiz-Yucuma, Juan E.; Aldana, José L.; Teboul, Jean-Louis; Cavalcanti, Alexandre Biasi; De Backer, Daniel; Bakker, Jan",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023737/,59

Disease Transmission, Transmission-Facilitation, and the Importance of Trust",2011-12-10,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the accumulation of active BCR-ABL protein. Imatinib is the first-line treatment of CML; however, many patients are resistant to this drug. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in expression patterns and functions of time-series genes in imatinib-resistant CML cells under different drug treatments. GSE24946 was downloaded from the GEO database, which included 17 samples of K562-r cells with (n=12) or without drug administration (n=5). Three drug treatment groups were considered for this study: arsenic trioxide (ATO), AMN107, and ATO+AMN107. Each group had one sample at each time point (3, 12, 24, and 48 h). Time-series genes with a ratio of standard deviation/average (coefficient of variation) >0.15 were screened, and their expression patterns were revealed based on Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM). Then, the functional enrichment analysis of time-series genes in each group was performed using DAVID, and the genes enriched in the top ten functional categories were extracted to detect their expression patterns. Different time-series genes were identified in the three groups, and most of them were enriched in the ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Time-series genes in the three treatment groups had different expression patterns and functions. Time-series genes in the ATO group (e.g. CCNA2 and DAB2) were significantly associated with cell adhesion, those in the AMN107 group were related to cellular carbohydrate metabolic process, while those in the ATO+AMN107 group (e.g. AP2M1) were significantly related to cell proliferation and antigen processing. In imatinib-resistant CML cells, ATO could influence genes related to cell adhesion, AMN107 might affect genes involved in cellular carbohydrate metabolism, and the combination therapy might regulate genes involved in cell proliferation.","Zhao, Yan-hong; Zhang, Xue-fang; Zhao, Yan-qiu; Bai, Fan; Qin, Fan; Sun, Jing; Dong, Ying",J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088819/,59

6262,Research Letters,2014-07-30,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to show that 2009 H1N1 “swine” influenza pandemic vaccination policies deviated from predictions established in the theory of political survival, and to propose that pandemic response deviated because it was ruled by bureaucratized experts rather than by elected politicians. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Focussing on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the paper employs descriptive statistical analysis of vaccination policies in nine western democracies. To probe the plausibility of the novel explanation, it uses quantitative and qualitative content analyses of media attention and coverage in two deviant cases, the USA and Denmark. FINDINGS: Theories linking political survival to disaster responses find little empirical support in the substantial cross-country variations of vaccination responses during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Rather than following a political logic, the case studies of media coverage in the USA and Denmark demonstrate that the response was bureaucratized in the public health agencies (CDC and DMHA, respectively). Hence, while natural disaster responses appear to follow a political logic, the response to pandemics appears to be more strongly instituted in the hands of bureaucratic experts. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: There is an added value of encompassing bureaucratic dynamics in political theories of disaster response; bureaucratized expertise proved to constitute a strong plausible explanation of the 2009 pandemic vaccination response. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pandemic preparedness and response depends critically on understanding the lessons of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; a key lesson supported by this paper is that expert-based agencies rather than political leaders are the pivotal actors. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper is the first to pinpoint the limitations of political survival theories of disaster responses with respect to the 2009 pandemic. Further, it is among the few to analyze the causes of variations in cross-country pandemic vaccination policies during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.","Baekkeskov, Erik; Rubin, Olivier",Disaster Prev Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098007/,59

The damage-response framework is an integrated theory of microbial pathogenesis that puts forth the view that microbial pathogenesis reflects the outcome of an interaction between a host and a microbe, with each entiry contributing to the nature of the outcome, which in turn depends on the amount of host damage that results from the host-microbe interaction. This view is able to accommodate new information and explain why infection with the same microbe can have different outcomes in different hosts.

Twenty‐six species of seven genera of euphausiids occurred during the survey. Among them, subarctic‐transitional Euphausia pacifica was the most abundant throughout the year in coastal waters, as their relative contribution to the total abundance of euphausiids was 89–92%. This species occurred in each coastal water throughout the survey and was abundant from winter to early summer (February–June) off Sanriku and Joban and in autumn in south‐eastern Hokkaido. Thysanoessa inspinata occurred off south‐eastern Hokkaido and Sanriku throughout the survey, mainly in spring (April) but rarely occurred off Joban.

9952,"Myosin Crossbridge, Contractile Unit, and the Mechanism of Contraction in Airway Smooth Muscle: A Mechanical Engineer's Perspective",2019-02-08,"The deep inspiration (DI) maneuver entices a great deal of interest because of its ability to temporarily ease the flow of air into the lungs. This salutary effect of a DI is proposed to be mediated, at least partially, by momentarily increasing the operating length of airway smooth muscle (ASM). Concerningly, this premise is largely derived from a growing body of in vitro studies investigating the effect of stretching ASM by different magnitudes on its contractility. The relevance of these in vitro findings remains uncertain, as the real range of strains ASM undergoes in vivo during a DI is somewhat elusive. In order to understand the regulation of ASM contractility by a DI and to infer on its putative contribution to the bronchodilator effect of a DI, it is imperative that in vitro studies incorporate levels of strains that are physiologically relevant. This review summarizes the methods that may be used in vivo in humans to estimate the strain experienced by ASM during a DI from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). The strengths and limitations of each method, as well as the potential confounders, are also discussed. A rough estimated range of ASM strains is provided for the purpose of guiding future in vitro studies that aim at quantifying the regulatory effect of DI on ASM contractility. However, it is emphasized that, owing to the many limitations and confounders, more studies will be needed to reach conclusive statements.","Bossé, Ynuk",J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164505/,59

We assessed Fc receptor‐mediated attachment and phagocytosis by phase‐contrast microscopic examination of monolayers of alveolar and interstitial macrophages incubated with zymosan, nonopsonized sheep erythrocytes, or erythrocytes opsonized with rabbit antisheeperythrocyte IgG. Alveolar macrophages from virus‐infected rats had significantly (P ≤ .05) lower indices of attachment and phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes than control macrophages, but there was no difference in attachment of zymosan particles. Interstitial macrophages were not affected. Alveolar macrophages from SDAV‐infected rats produced significantly less interleukin‐1 than those from control rats, as assessed by testing supematants from lipopolysaccharide‐stimulated macrophage cultures for induction of mouse thymocytes to take up tritiated thymidine. Effects of SDAV infection on lung macrophages could increase host susceptibility to other pathogens or complicate studies of respiratory tract immunity.","Boschert, K.R.; Schoeb, T.R.; Chandler, D.B.; Dillehay, D.L.",J Leukoc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166627/,59

In the last 10 years it has been shown that a number of viruses induce ribosomes to shift reading frame in order to regulate the expression of gene products having enzymatic functions. Studies on ribosomal frameshifting in viruses of yeast have been particularly enlightening. The roles of viral mRNA sequences and secondary structures have been elucidated and a picture of how these interact with host chromosomal gene products is beginning to emerge. The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting is important for viral particle assembly, and has identified ribosomal frameshifting as a potential target for antiviral agents. The availability of mutants of host chromosomal gene products involved in maintaining the efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting bodes well for the use of yeast in future studies of ribosomal frameshifting.","Dinman, Jonathan D.",Yeast,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169727/,59

10789,Nineteen years of experience with autotransfusion for elective surgery in children: more troublesome than we expected,2007-05-29,"Abstract. Two extensive forest vegetation survey datasets are explored, using ordination and classification, for evidence of in situ regeneration by Pinus strobus (Eastern white pine) and P. resinosa (Red pine). Ordination of tree species contributions to total basal area in 320 upland northern hardwood‐ conifer stands produced distinct stand groups for P.banksiana, P. resinosa, P. strobus and mesic hardwoods in an ascending sequence along the first axis. Quercus rubra (red oak), Q. alba (white oak) and tolerant conifer groups formed segregates from the hardwood complex along the second axis. P. strobus mixes with all other forest types, but P. resinosa is restricted to its own group. Seedlings and trees of P. strobus are more abundant than saplings, which are restricted to the pine and oak forests. Therefore, seed production, dispersal and seedling establishment seem to be less of a barrier to in situ regeneration by P. strobus than subsequent survival and growth. Canonical correspondence analysis of 170 pine‐dominated stands from the Canadian Shield of Ontario, in which tree species variables are segmented into height‐class pseudo‐ species, yielded no linear relationship between environmental features or stand structure and seedling densities of P. strobus. However, total tree basal area appears to impose an upper limit to seedling density on the forest floor. Strong correlations emerged between pine seedling density and understorey vegetation. Stand classification of the understorey vegetation, using constrained indicator species analysis, yielded distinct high and low seedling groups. Low pine seedling density was associated with abundant broadleaved shrubs, herbs and seedlings as well as feathermosses and tolerant conifers. High seedling density could not be ascribed to the presence of seedbed taxa, such as Polytrichum, but is ascribed to the absence of competition and other forms of inhibition in the understorey vegetation and down through the canopy profile. In situ regeneration of P. strobus does, therefore, occur but conditions over the forest landscape are largely restrictive.","Carleton, T.J.; Maycock, P.F.; Arnup, R.; Gordon, A.M.",J Veg Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201876/,59

10926,Objective measures for sentinel surveillance in network epidemiology,2018-08-15,"With the entry into force of the Infection Protection Act (IfSG) in 2001, the reporting obligations for infectious diseases and infectious agents were placed on a new foundation. For the first time, a distinction was made between an obligation for the notification of infectious diseases by physicians and a notification obligation for infectious agents by laboratories. The aim was to reduce the notification burden on physicians and thus to improve the quality of the notifications. Since then, numerous new obligations for notifications have been added. The aim of this work is to describe and discuss the mandatory notification of infectious diseases in Germany on the basis of their development – compared to previous regulations in Germany (Federal Communicable Diseases Act) as well as international and Europe-wide recommendations (IHR; decisions of the EU Commission 1999, 2018) – and to submit suggestions for improvement. Regarding the considerable increase in reporting requirements and reports in recent years, and the fact that the IfSG provides other surveillance systems in addition to mandatory reporting, the mandatory reporting system should be focused on the necessary reporting requirements. In a first step, the proposed abolition of the mandatory reporting of noroviruses and rotaviruses could relieve both the notifiers and the health authorities, thus enabling more efficient reporting and more intensive and better investigation by the health authorities.","Heudorf, Ursel; Gottschalk, René",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217598/,59
11236,Poster,2020-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Scarce data are available on the characteristics of postoperative organ failure (POF) and mortality after gastrectomy. We aimed to describe the causes of organ failure and mortality related to gastrectomy for gastric cancer and to identify patients with POF who are at a risk of failure to rescue (FTR). METHODS: The study examined patients with POF or in-hospital mortality in Seoul National University Hospital between 2005 and 2014. We identified patients at a high risk of FTR by analyzing laboratory findings, complication data, intensive care unit records, and risk scoring including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) 3 at ICU admission. RESULTS: Among the 7304 patients who underwent gastrectomy, 80 (1.1%) were identified with Clavien–Dindo classification (CDC) grade ≥ IVa. The numbers of patients with CDC grade IVa, IVb, and V were 48 (0.66%), 11 (0.15%), and 21 (0.29%), respectively. Pulmonary failure (43.8%), surgical site complication (27.5%), and cardiac failure (13.8%) were the most common causes of POF and mortality. Cancer progression (100%) and cardiac events (45.5%) showed high FTR rates. In univariate analysis, acidosis, hypoalbuminemia, SOFA, APACHE IV, and SAPS 3 were identified as risk factors for FTR (P < 0.05). Finally, SAPS 3 was identified as an independent predictive factor for FTR. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer progression and acute cardiac failure were the most lethal causes of FTR. SAPS 3 is an independent predictor of FTR among POF patients after gastrectomy.","Park, Ji-Ho; Lee, Hyuk-Joon; Oh, Seung-Young; Park, Shin-Hoo; Berlth, Felix; Son, Young-Gil; Kim, Tae Han; Huh, Yeon-Ju; Yang, Jun-Young; Lee, Kyung-Goo; Suh, Yun-Suhk; Kong, Seong-Ho; Yang, Han-Kwang",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223481/,59

Evidence from in vitro studies performed on human and animal samples",2020-03-21,"The complement system is a critical component of both innate and adaptive immune responses. It has both protective and pathogenic roles in viral infections. There are no studies regarding the role of complement system in Chandipura virus (CHPV) infection. The current study has investigated the role of complement pathways in the in vitro neutralization of CHPV in Vero E6 cells. Using normal human serum (NHS), heat-inactivated serum (HIS), human serum deficient of complement factor, respective reconstituted serum, assays like in vitro neutralization, real-time PCR, and flow cytometry-based tissue culture-based limited dose assay (TC-LDA) were carried out for assessing the activation of different complement pathways. NHS from 9/10 donors showed complement dependent neutralization, reduction in viral load and decrease in percentage of CHPV-positive cells compared to their HIS counterparts. EGTA or EDTA pretreatment experiments indicated that CHPV neutralization proceeds through the alternative pathway of the complement activation. Our data showed a strong dependence on C3 for the in vitro neutralization of CHPV. Disparity in CHPV neutralization levels between factor B-deficient and reconstituted sera could be attributed to amplification loop/“tick-over” mechanism. Assays using C3, C5, and C8 deficient sera indicated that complement-mediated CHPV neutralization and suppression of CHPV infectivity are primarily through C3 and C5, and not dependent on downstream complement factor C8. With no specific anti-viral treatment/vaccine against Chandipura, the current data, elucidating role of human complement system in the neutralization of CHPV, may help in designing effective therapeutics.","Gupta, Pooja; Tripathy, Anuradha S.",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223837/,59
11969,Whole-organism behavioral profiling reveals a role for dopamine in state-dependent motor program coupling in C. elegans,2020-06-08,"In adolescence, there is a heightened propensity to take health risks such as smoking, drinking or driving too fast. Another facet of risk taking, social risk, has largely been neglected. A social risk can be defined as any decision or action that could lead to an individual being excluded by their peers, such as appearing different to one’s friends. In the current study, we developed and validated a measure of concern for health and social risk for use in individuals of 11 years and over (N = 1399). Concerns for both health and social risk declined with age, challenging the commonly held stereotype that adolescents are less worried about engaging in risk behaviours, compared with adults. The rate of decline was steeper for social versus health risk behaviours, suggesting that adolescence is a period of heightened concern for social risk. We validated our measure against measures of rejection sensitivity, depression and risk-taking behaviour. Greater concern for social risk was associated with increased sensitivity to rejection and greater depressed mood, and this association was stronger for adolescents compared with adults. We conclude that social risks should be incorporated into future models of risk-taking behaviour, especially when they are pitted against health risks.","Andrews, Jack L.; Foulkes, Lucy E.; Bone, Jessica K.; Blakemore, Sarah-Jayne",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7349691/,59

We investigate how miniaturized barometers can be used to perform accurate spirometry in a wearable system that is built on off-the-shelf training masks often used by athletes as a training aid. We perform an evaluation where differential barometric pressure sensors are compared concurrently with a digital spirometer, during an experimental setting of clinical forced vital capacity (FVC) test procedures with 20 participants. The relationship between the two instruments is derived by mathematical modeling first, then by various regression methods from experiment data. The results show that the error of FVC vital values between the two instruments can be as low as 2∼3%. Beyond clinical tests, the method can also measure continuous tidal breathing air volumes with a 1∼3% error margin. Overall, we conclude that barometers with millimeter footprints embedded in face mask apparel can perform similarly to a digital spirometer to monitor breathing airflow and volume in pulmonary function tests.","Zhou, Bo; Baucells Costa, Alejandro; Lukowicz, Paul",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7435382/,59

As the direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC GT) industry expands, critics have called for pre- and post-test genetic counseling to be included with the product. Several genetic testing companies offer genetic counseling. There has been no examination to date of this service provision, whether it meets critics’ concerns and implications it may have for the genetic counseling profession. Considering the increasing relevance of genetics in healthcare, the complexity of genetic information provided by DTC GT, the mediating role of the internet in counseling, and potential conflicts of interest, this is a topic which deserves further attention. In this paper we offer a discourse analysis of ways in which genetic counseling is represented on DTC GT websites, blogs and other online material. This analysis identified four types of genetic counseling represented on the websites: the integrated counseling product; discretionary counseling; independent counseling; and product advice. Genetic counselors are represented as having the following roles: genetics educator; mediator; lifestyle advisor; risk interpreter; and entrepreneur. We conclude that genetic counseling as represented on DTC GT websites demonstrates shifting professional roles and forms of expertise in genetic counseling. Genetic counselors are also playing an important part in how the genetic testing market is taking shape. Our analysis offers important and timely insights into recent developments in the genetic counseling profession, which have relevance for practitioners, researchers and policy makers concerned with the evolving field of personal genomics.","Harris, Anna; Kelly, Susan E.; Wyatt, Sally",J Genet Couns,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597267/,59

It can take years to reach a diagnosis and there is often no suitable therapy. Rare diseases are anything but rare among patients: around 4 million people are affected in Germany alone. Nevertheless, rare diseases can often only be diagnosed when they are well enough known and the population is made aware of their existence—this applies to both laypeople and medical professionals. The rather unusual form of imparting knowledge via entertainment television can make an important contribution to disseminate medical knowledge and to raise awareness of medical topics. In specific cases, entertainment television can help to diagnose rare diseases or encourage laypeople to take lifesaving measures, which we try to illustrate in this paper. Series and quiz shows reach more viewers than traditional health programs. They have also proven to be exceptionally effective in student teaching. Since the narrative form focuses on cheering and guessing, instead of simply conveying facts, the medical topics become more emotionally anchored memories and easier to recall. Entertainment television thus offers an innovative approach to increase the health literacy of the population—a potential that could be used more intensively in Germany.","Schaefer, Jürgen R.; von Hirschhausen, Eckart",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7724450/,59

Despite its importance, there is very little reporting of ADRs by healthcare professionals. The present study has evaluated the knowledge, attitude and practices of health care professionals (HCPs) regarding pharmacovigilance activities in Lahore, Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was employed, and a convenience sampling was opted to collect the data among physicians, pharmacists and nurses working in tertiary care public hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan from September 2018 to January 2019. RESULTS: Of the 384 questionnaires distributed, 346 health care professionals responded to the questionnaire (90.10% response rate). Most participants had good knowledge about ADR reporting, but pharmacist had comparatively better knowledge than other HCPs regarding ADR (89.18%) pharmacovigilance system (81.08%), its centres (72.97%) and function (91.89%). Most of the participants exhibited positive attitude regarding ADR reporting, such as 49.1% of physicians (P < 0.05), 70.2% pharmacists and 76.1% nurses showed a positive attitude that they are the most important HCPs to report an ADR. About 64.3% of physicians (P < 0.05) emphasized that consulting other colleagues is important before reporting an ADR. Of all, 77.7% physicians, 75.7% pharmacists and 68% of nurses had positive attitude that ADR reporting is a professional obligation and 67.6% of the pharmacists stated that they have reported ADRs in their workplace and 77.2% nurses have verbally reported ADRs to the concerned personnel or department. CONCLUSION: Among all HCPs, pharmacists had better knowledge about ADR reporting and pharmacovigilance. All HCPs had positive attitude and inclination towards ADR reporting. The discrepancies were observed in the practices related to ADR reporting, whereas most of the participants including physicians and nurses did not report any ADR. Based on the above, strategies are needed to educate, train, and empower the HCPs in the domain of pharmacovigilance.","Hussain, Rabia; Hassali, Mohamed Azmi; Hashmi, Furqan; Akram, Tayyaba",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7784002/,59

This study examined the joint effect of female sex and food insecurity on self-reported poor or fair mental health in Canadian adults. METHODS: The analysis was based on data from adults (age ≥ 18 yr) who participated in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015–2016. We determined past-year food security level (secure, moderately insecure or severely insecure) based on 18 questions. We used log-binomial regression to explore associations of sex and food insecurity with self-reported poor or fair mental health. We measured additive interaction between female sex and food insecurity using relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). RESULTS: The overall response rate for the CCHS was 59.5%. Data for 61 446 respondents were analyzed. Poor or fair mental health was reported by 4107 participants (6.1% when weighted to the Canadian population). Increased risk of poor or fair mental health was associated with female sex (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.31), and moderate (PR 2.50, 95% CI 2.21 to 2.82) and severe (PR 4.03, 95% CI 3.59 to 4.52) food insecurity. Significant additive interaction between female sex and severe food insecurity was found for those aged 40–64 years (RERI 1.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 2.47), and the PR for poor or fair mental health for severely food-insecure women was 5.55 (95% CI 4.48 to 6.89) compared to food-secure men of the same age group. INTERPRETATION: Poor or fair mental health is common in the food-insecure population, and there exists synergism between female sex and severe food insecurity among middle-aged people. This suggests the need to develop targeted mental health support strategies for food-insecure people, specifically middle-aged women.","Pound, Catherine M.; Chen, Yue",CMAJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864695/,59

Anti-inflammatory activities of a wide variety of CHOS mixtures have previously been reported, mainly based on studies with mouse models and murine macrophages. Since the mouse and human immune systems are quite different, gaining insight into the activity of CHOS on human cell lines, using well-characterized CHOS mixtures, is of considerable interest. Bacillus subtilis chitosanase (BsCsn46A) can efficiently convert chitosan to mixtures of water soluble low molecular weight CHOS. Here, the anti-inflammatory activity of a properly characterized CHOS mixture was studied, using human THP-1 cells that were differentiated to mature monocytes using vitamin D3. Addition of CHOS reduced the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with bacterial lipopolyssacharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner and without affecting cell viability. Interestingly, only minimal effects of CHOS were observed in similar experiments with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- (PMA-) differentiated, macrophage-like, THP-1 cells. Altogether, in addition to showing promising biological effects of well-characterized low molecular weight soluble CHOS in a human system, the present study also points at Vitamin D3-stimulated THP-1 cells as a favorable system for assessing the anti-inflammatory activity of bioactive compounds.","Jitprasertwong, Paiboon; Khamphio, Munthipha; Petsrichuang, Phornsiri; Eijsink, Vincent G.

This registry was performed under routine conditions and without any study-specific intervention, diagnostic procedures, or assessments. Data on clinical laboratory tests, health status, liver function, vital signs, and examinations were collected (DRKS-ID: DRKS00017068). Mortality rates 28 and 90 days after the first ADVOS treatment, adverse events and ADVOS treatment parameters, including treatment abortions, were documented. This analysis was performed 2 years after the first patient was included on January 18, 2017. As of February 20, 2019, 4 clinical sites in Germany participated and enrolled 118 patients with a median age of 60 (IQR: 45, 69) of whom 70 were male (59.3%). Patients had a median SOFA Score of 14 (IQR: 11, 16) and a predicted mortality of 80%. The median number of failing organs was 3 (IQR: 2, 4). Four hundred twenty nine ADVOS treatments sessions were performed with a median duration of 17 hours (IQR: 6, 23). A 5.8% of the ADVOS sessions (25 of 429) were aborted due to device related errors, while 14.5% (62 of 429) were stopped for other reasons. Seventy nine adverse events were documented, 13 of them device related (all clotting, and all recovered without sequels). A significant reduction in serum creatinine (1.5 vs 1.2 mg/dl), blood urea nitrogen (24 vs 17 mg/dl) and bilirubin (6.9 vs 6.5 mg/dl) was observed following the first ADVOS treatment session. Blood pH, bicarbonate (HCO(3)(-)) and base excess returned to the physiological range, while partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) remained unchanged. At the time of the analysis, 28- and 90-day mortality were 60% and 65%, respectively, compared to an expected ICU-mortality rate of 80%. SOFA score was an independent predictor for outcome in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. The reported data show a high quality and completion of all participating centers. Data interpretation must be cautious due to the small number of patients, and the nature of the registry, without a control group.

However, there are numerous distinct health IT capabilities, and it is unclear which, if any, are associated with lower readmission risk. To identify the specific health IT capabilities adopted by hospitals that are associated with hospital-level risk-standardized readmission rates (RSRRs) through path analyses using structural equation modeling. This STROBE-compliant retrospective cross-sectional study included non-federal U.S. acute care hospitals, based on their adoption of specific types of health IT capabilities self-reported in a 2013 American Hospital Association IT survey as independent variables. The outcome measure included the 2014 RSRRs reported on Hospital Compare website. A 54-indicator 7-factor structure of hospital health IT capabilities was identified by exploratory factor analysis, and corroborated by confirmatory factor analysis. Subsequent path analysis using Structural equation modeling revealed that a one-point increase in the hospital adoption of patient engagement capability latent scores (median path coefficient ß = −0.086; 95% Confidence Interval, −0.162 to −0.008), including functionalities like direct access to the electronic health records, would generally lead to a decrease in RSRRs by 0.086%. However, computerized hospital discharge and information exchange capabilities with other inpatient and outpatient providers were not associated with readmission rates. These findings suggest that improving patient access to and use of their electronic health records may be helpful in improving hospital performance on readmission; however, computerized hospital discharge and information exchange among clinicians did not seem as beneficial – perhaps because of the quality or timeliness of information transmitted. Future research should use more recent data to study, not just adoption of health IT capabilities, but also whether their usage is associated with lower readmission risk. Understanding which capabilities impact readmission risk can help policymakers and clinical stakeholders better focus their scarce resources as they invest in health IT to improve care delivery.","Elysee, Gerald; Yu, Huihui; Herrin, Jeph; Horwitz, Leora I.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909153/,59

This is particularly true for issues relating to the risks of ionizing radiation for CT, which has been a topic of discussion for nearly two decades. In addition to understanding these potential risks and the importance of minimizing individual pediatric patient exposure to ionizing radiation, it is equally important for radiologists to be able to frame these risks with respect to the potential for adverse outcomes associated with the use of anesthesia for cross-sectional imaging in the pediatric population. Notably, before such risks can be estimated and compared, one should always consider the potential utility of each imaging modality for a given diagnosis. If one cross-sectional imaging modality is likely to be far superior to the other for a specific clinical question, every effort must be made to safely image the child, even if sedation/anesthesia is required.","Callahan, Michael J.; Cravero, Joseph P.",Pediatr Radiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7952501/,59

Based on previous studies on climate change and vulnerability in Taipei, Taiwan, this study explores the correlations between place attachment and individual attributes of residents in different vulnerable areas in Taipei. First, this study investigates the integrated vulnerability (IV) of 12 districts of Taipei by overlaying natural vulnerability (NV) and social vulnerability (SV). This study selects four districts with high IV and low IV in Taipei, and with a large proportion of flooded areas, as the study sites. Second, a questionnaire survey (600 respondents) is conducted to examine the correlations between place attachment and the individual attributes of the respondents (age, residence duration, disaster experience, and education) in the four districts. Third, factor analyses are carried out to categorize place attachment into four factors: “security,” “familiarity,” “belongingness,” and “rootedness.” Finally, whether different factors have different relationships with place attachment are elucidated. The results show no consistent correlations between place attachment and individual attributes in areas with different vulnerabilities. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations before and after factor analyses of place attachment, among the four factors of place attachment (security, familiarity, belongingness, rootedness), there are no factors significantly relating to overall place attachment. This study further examines the mediator effect between risk experience and place attachment. The results show no mediator effects in the relationships of “perception → place attachment → coping behavior” and “attitude → place attachment → coping behavior.” Follow-up studies can elucidate factor analyses of place attachment and examine the effect of geographical scale (neighborhood, district, and city) on place attachment.","Lee, Yung-Jaan; Lin, Shih-Ying",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7955699/,59
16279,A new chapter for the Journal of Medicine and Life in 2021,2021,"Despite the significant health impacts of adverse events associated with drug-drug interactions, no standard models exist for managing and sharing evidence describing potential interactions between medications. Minimal information models have been used in other communities to establish community consensus around simple models capable of communicating useful information. This paper reports on a new minimal information model for describing potential drug-drug interactions. A task force of the Semantic Web in Health Care and Life Sciences Community Group of the World-Wide Web consortium engaged informaticians and drug-drug interaction experts in in-depth examination of recent literature and specific potential interactions. A consensus set of information items was identified, along with example descriptions of selected potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs). User profiles and use cases were developed to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Ten core information items were identified: drugs involved, clinical consequences, seriousness, operational classification statement, recommended action, mechanism of interaction, contextual information/modifying factors, evidence about a suspected drug-drug interaction, frequency of exposure, and frequency of harm to exposed persons. Eight best practice recommendations suggest how PDDI knowledge artifact creators can best use the 10 information items when synthesizing drug interaction evidence into artifacts intended to aid clinicians. This model has been included in a proposed implementation guide developed by the HL7 Clinical Decision Support Workgroup and in PDDIs published in the CDS Connect repository.

16914,Artificial Intelligence in Differential Diagnostics of Meningitis: A Nationwide Study,2021-03-28,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Photo-identification is a non-invasive method of identifying individual animals from natural markings present on one or more parts of the body. The dorsal fin of a dolphin is the portion that contains individually distinctive marks and the most commonly visible when an animal surfaces to breathe. The camera captures an image of the dorsal fin whenever it is sighted and based on the number of times an image is captured, a statistical method called capture–recapture is used to estimate the site fidelity and the size of the population in a defined area. Here, we applied these methods to study the bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) between 2017 and 2020 at the Tiber estuary (Mediterranean Sea, Rome, Italy), a polluted major river supplying organic material to the Capitoline (Roman) coastal area and nearby regions. We identified 347 unique individuals, with different patterns of residency (i.e., the tendency of dolphins to remain in, or return to, the study area): 42 were labeled resident, 73 part-time, and 232 transient. Estimating a total population size of 529 individuals and highlighting the presence of animals with a strong site-fidelity, this study suggests developing conservation plans for this vulnerable top-predator species not only focused on areas close to the Tiber River mouths but also extended to cover a broader scale of area. ABSTRACT: Periodic assessments of population status and trends to detect natural influences and human effects on coastal dolphin are often limited by lack of baseline information. Here, we investigated for the first time the site-fidelity patterns and estimated the population size of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at the Tiber River estuary (central Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian Sea, Rome, Italy) between 2017 and 2020. We used photo-identification data and site-fidelity metrics to study the tendency of dolphins to remain in, or return to, the study area, and capture–recapture models to estimate the population abundance. In all, 347 unique individuals were identified. The hierarchical cluster analysis highlighted 3 clusters, labeled resident (individuals encountered at least five times, in three different months, over three distinct years; n = 42), part-time (individuals encountered at least on two occasions in a month, in at least two different years; n = 73), and transient (individuals encountered on more than one occasion, in more than 1 month, none of them in more than 1 year; n = 232), each characterized by site-fidelity metrics. Open POPAN modeling estimated a population size of 529 individuals (95% CI: 456–614), showing that the Capitoline (Roman) coastal area and nearby regions surrounding the Tiber River estuary represent an important, suitable habitat for bottlenose dolphins, despite their proximity to one of the major urban centers in the world (the city of Rome). Given the high number of individuals in the area and the presence of resident individuals with strong site fidelity, we suggest that conservation plans should not be focused only close to the Tiber River mouths but extended to cover a broader scale of area.","Pace, Daniela Silvia; Di Marco, Chiara; Giacomini, Giancarlo; Ferri, Sara; Silvestri, Margherita; Papale, Elena; Casoli, Edoardo; Ventura, Daniele; Mingione, Marco; Alaimo Di Loro, Pierfrancesco; Jona Lasinio, Giovanna; Ardizzone, Giandomenico",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8066396/,59

Although understanding of underlying disease mechanisms is hampered by complex pathophysiology, it is clear that epithelial abnormalities underpin the disease. The mechanisms underpinning epithelial remodelling in OM remain unclear. We recently described a novel in vitro model of mouse middle ear epithelial cells (mMEECs) that undergoes mucociliary differentiation into the varied epithelial cell populations seen in the middle ear cavity. We now describe genome wide gene expression profiles of mMEECs as they undergo differentiation. We compared the gene expression profiles of original (uncultured) middle ear cells, confluent cultures of undifferentiated cells and cells that had been differentiated for 7 days at an air liquid interface (ALI). >5000 genes were differentially expressed among the three groups of cells. Approximately 4000 genes were differentially expressed between the original cells and day 0 of ALI culture. The original cell population was shown to contain a mix of cell types, including contaminating inflammatory cells that were lost on culture. Approximately 500 genes were upregulated during ALI induced differentiation. These included some secretory genes and some enzymes but most were associated with the process of ciliogenesis. The data suggest that the in vitro model of differentiated murine middle ear epithelium exhibits a transcriptional profile consistent with the mucociliary epithelium seen within the middle ear. Knowledge of the transcriptional landscape of this epithelium will provide a basis for understanding the phenotypic changes seen in murine models of OM.","Mulay, Apoorva; Chowdhury, Md Miraj K.; James, Cameron T.; Bingle, Lynne; Bingle, Colin D.",Biol Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8084567/,59

While these therapies hold great promise, they face the same limitation as other kinase inhibitors, the emergence of resistant mechanisms. The biology behind KRAS G12C inhibitor resistance has been investigated with genome-wide approaches, in the hopes of finding a way to improve the efficacy of these new molecules. Here, we review the biology of KRAS G12C, mechanisms of drug resistance and potential approaches to overcome the later. ABSTRACT: Lung cancer represents the most common form of cancer, accounting for 1.8 million deaths globally in 2020. Over the last decade the treatment for advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have dramatically improved largely thanks to the emergence of two therapeutic breakthroughs: the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeting of oncogenic driver alterations. While these therapies hold great promise, they face the same limitation as other inhibitors: the emergence of resistant mechanisms. One such alteration in non-small cell lung cancer is the Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (KRAS) oncogene. KRAS mutations are the most common oncogenic driver in NSCLC, representing roughly 20–25% of cases. The mutation is almost exclusively detected in adenocarcinoma and is found among smokers 90% of the time. Along with the development of new drugs that have been showing promising activity, resistance mechanisms have begun to be clarified. The aim of this review is to unwrap the biology of KRAS in NSCLC with a specific focus on primary and secondary resistance mechanisms and their possible clinical implications.","Addeo, Alfredo; Banna, Giuseppe Luigi; Friedlaender, Alex",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8196854/,59

PRRS was first detected in Costa Rica in 1996 and has since then severely affected the local swine industry. Studies of the molecular characterization of circulating strains, correlation with clinical records, and associations with pathogens associated with Porcine Respiratory Disease Complex (PRDC) have not been done in Costa Rica. RESULTS: Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of ORF5 proved that PRRSV-2 was the only species detected in all locations analyzed. These sequences were grouped into three clusters. When comparing samples from San Jose, Alejuela, and Puntarenas to historical isolates of the previously described lineages (1 to 9), it has been shown that these were closely related to each other and belonged to Lineage 5, along with the samples from Heredia. Intriguingly, samples from Cartago clustered in a separate clade, phylogenetically related to Lineage 1. Epitope analysis conducted on the GP5 sequence of field isolates from Costa Rica revealed seven peptides with at least 80% amino acid sequence identity with previously described and experimentally validated immunogenic regions. Previously described epitopes A, B, and C, were detected in the Santa Barbara-Heredia isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the virus has three distinct origins or introductions to the country.

The newly discovered C. difficile adenine methyltransferase A (CamA) is specified by all C. difficile genomes sequenced to date (>300), but is rare among other bacteria. CamA is an orphan methyltransferase, unassociated with a restriction endonuclease. CamA-mediated methylation at CAAAAA is required for normal sporulation, biofilm formation, and intestinal colonization by C. difficile. We characterized CamA kinetic parameters, and determined its structure bound to DNA containing the recognition sequence. CamA contains an N-terminal domain for catalyzing methyl transfer, and a C-terminal DNA recognition domain. Major and minor groove DNA contacts in the recognition site involve base-specific hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts and the Watson-Crick pairing of a rearranged A:T base pair. These provide sufficient sequence discrimination to ensure high specificity. Finally, the surprisingly weak binding of the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) might provide avenues for inhibiting CamA activity using SAM analogs.","Zhou, Jujun; Horton, John R.; Blumenthal, Robert M.; Zhang, Xing; Cheng, Xiaodong",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8187626/,59

One such intervention is to apply cost-effectiveness evidence to decisions regarding drug coverage and pricing, but this intervention depends on the existence of such evidence to guide decisions. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the availability and quality of cost-effectiveness studies for prescription drugs with the greatest Medicare Part D spending. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this national cross-sectional analysis, publicly available 2016 Medicare drug spending records were merged with 2016 US Food & Drug Administration Orange Book data and the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry. All studies published through 2015 that evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the 250 drugs for which Medicare Part D spending was the greatest in US-based adult patient populations were included. Data were analyzed from September 2018 to June 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The presence and quality of published cost-effectiveness analyses for the 250 drugs for which Medicare Part D spending was greatest in 2016 were assessed based on the inclusion of key cost-effectiveness analysis elements and global ratings by independent reviewers for the Tufts CEA Registry. RESULTS: Medicare Part D spending on the 250 drugs in the sample totaled $122.8 billion in 2016 (84.1% of total spending). Of these 250 drugs, 91 (36.4%) had a generic equivalent and 159 (63.6%) retained some patent exclusivity. There were 280 unique cost-effectiveness analyses for these drugs, representing data on 135 (54.0%) of the 250 drugs included and 67.0% of Part D spending on the top 250 drugs. The 115 drugs (46.0%) without cost-effectiveness studies accounted for 33.0% of Part D spending on the top 250 drugs. Of the 280 available studies, 128 (45.7%) were industry sponsored. A large proportion of the studies (250 [89.3%]) did not meet the minimum quality requirements. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, a substantial proportion of 2016 Medicare Part D spending was for drugs with absent or low-quality cost-effectiveness analyses. The lack of quality analyses may present a challenge in efforts to develop policies addressing drug spending in terms of value.","Tisdale, Rebecca L.; Ma, Iris; Vail, Daniel; Bhattacharya, Jay; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D.; Heidenreich, Paul A.; Sandhu, Alexander T.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8214163/,59

The recurring drought is a major challenge to smallholder livestock farmers in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. This study assesses the perception of smallholder livestock farmers towards agricultural drought resilience. The study utilised a perception index score using primary data collected from 207 smallholder livestock farmers following a structured questionnaire survey and multistage sampling procedures. The study found that the average perception index of the role of social networks and government to enhance agricultural drought resilience was negative, which implied that their role in enhancing resilience towards agricultural drought was insufficient. However, the perception of smallholder livestock farmers on the role of social networks was lower than the role of government. This study recommends coordination and cooperation amongst all role players to reinforce strategies to enhance smallholder livestock farmers’ resilience. This includes coordinator amongst the local, provincial government, African Farmers’ Association of South Africa, extension officers, private sectors, monitoring agencies in terms of reliable early warning information and communication amongst decision-makers. Collaboration amongst government departments at the national and provincial levels should be strengthening to enhance farmer’s resilience. The collaboration includes the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries at the national level, Provincial Departments of Agriculture, National and Provincial Disaster Management Centres, South African Weather Service and Department of Water Affairs.

19226,"Exploring willingness to participate in future Human Infection Studies in Lusaka, Zambia: A nested qualitative exploratory study",2021-07-09,"Cancer development and its response to therapy are regulated by inflammation, which either promotes or suppresses tumor progression, potentially displaying opposing effects on therapeutic outcomes. Chronic inflammation facilitates tumor progression and treatment resistance, whereas induction of acute inflammatory reactions often stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen presentation, leading to anti-tumor immune responses. In addition, multiple signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT), toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways, cGAS/STING, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); inflammatory factors, including cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL), interferon (IFN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α), chemokines (e.g., C-C motif chemokine ligands (CCLs) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligands (CXCLs)), growth factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β), and inflammasome; as well as inflammatory metabolites including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxane, and specialized proresolving mediators (SPM), have been identified as pivotal regulators of the initiation and resolution of inflammation. Nowadays, local irradiation, recombinant cytokines, neutralizing antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, DC vaccines, oncolytic viruses, TLR agonists, and SPM have been developed to specifically modulate inflammation in cancer therapy, with some of these factors already undergoing clinical trials.

20108,Contents and quality of travel tips on malaria in English and Spanish travel blogs,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal pressure measurement is a minimally invasive monitoring process that assesses respiratory mechanics in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Airway pressure release ventilation is a relatively new positive pressure ventilation modality, characterized by a series of advantages in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 55-year-old chilean female, with preexisting hypertension and recurrent renal colic who entered the cardiosurgical intensive care unit with signs and symptoms of urinary sepsis secondary to a right-sided obstructive urolithiasis. At the time of admission, the patient showed signs of urinary sepsis, a poor overall condition, hemodynamic instability, tachycardia, hypotension, and needed vasoactive drugs. Initially the patient was treated with volume control ventilation. Then, ventilation was with conventional ventilation parameters described by the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network. However, hemodynamic complications led to reduced airway pressure. Later she presented intraabdominal hypertension that compromised the oxygen supply and her ventilation management. Considering these records, an esophageal manometry was used to measure distending lung pressure, that is, transpulmonary pressure, to protect lungs. Initial use of the esophageal balloon was in a volume-controlled modality (deep sedation), which allowed the medical team to perform inspiratory and expiratory pause maneuvers to monitor transpulmonary plateau pressure as a substitute for pulmonary distension and expiratory pause and determine transpulmonary positive end-expiratory pressure. On the third day of mechanical respiration, the modality was switched to airway pressure release ventilation. The use of airway pressure release ventilation was associated with reduced hemodynamic complications and kept transpulmonary pressure between 0 and 20 cmH(2)O despite a sustained high positive end-expiratory pressure of 20 cmH(2)O. CONCLUSION: The application of this technique is shown in airway pressure release ventilation with spontaneous ventilation, which is then compared with a controlled modality that requires a lesser number of sedative doses and vasoactive drugs, without altering the criteria for lung protection as guided by esophageal manometry.","Arellano-Pérez, Óscar; Castillo Merino, Felipe; Torres-Tejeiro, Roberto; Ugarte Ubiergo, Sebastián",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8367393/,59
20243,From the Editorial Desk,2021-06-05,"INTRODUCTION: The survival of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has achieved little progress in the last several decades. ALTER1202 confirmed the efficacy and safety of anlotinib as a third- or further-line option for relapsed SCLC. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of anlotinib compared with placebo as third- or further-line treatment for advanced SCLC in China. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of advanced SCLC and estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of anlotinib versus placebo. The health outcomes and utilities were derived from the ALTER1202 (NCT03059797) and published sources, respectively. Total costs were calculated from the perspective of Chinese society. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore the model uncertainties. RESULTS: Anlotinib was estimated to result in an additional 0.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $2131.32, resulting in an ICER of $17,741.94/QALY. The ICER did not exceed the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $30,833 per QALY, which was three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of China in 2019. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of anlotinib exerted the maximum influence on the result of the model, followed by the utility of progression-free survival (PFS) state in the anlotinib group and median overall survival (mOS) in the anlotinib group. In PSA, the probability of anlotinib being cost-effective was 26.6% and 78.5% when the WTP threshold was one and three times the GDP per capita, respectively. CONCLUSION: Anlotinib is likely to be a cost-effective option compared with placebo for patients with relapsed SCLC who experience failure of at least two lines of chemotherapy in China.

20655,"The origin of Modern Epidemiology, the book",2021-08-28,"BACKGROUND: In England, neonatal care is delivered in operational delivery networks, comprising a combination of the Neonatal Intensive Care (NICU), Local-Neonatal (LNU) or Special-Care Units (SCU), based on their ability to care for babies with different degrees of illness or prematurity. With the development of network care pathways, the most premature and sickest are mostly triaged for delivery in services linked to NICU. This has created anxiety for teams in LNU and SCU. Less exposure to sicker babies has resulted in limited opportunities to maintain expertise for when these babies unexpectedly deliver at their centre and thereafter require transfer for care, to NICU. Simultaneously, LNU and SCU teams develop skills in the care of the less ill and premature baby which would also be of benefit to NICU teams. A need for mutual learning through inter-unit multidirectional collaborative learning and engagement (hereafter also called neonatal networking) between teams of different designations emerged. Here, neonatal networking is defined as collaboration, shared clinical learning and developing an understanding of local systems strengths and challenges between units of different and similar designations. We describe the responses to the development of a clinical and systems focussed platform for this engagement between different teams within our neonatal ODN. METHOD: An interactive 1-day programme was developed in the West Midlands, focussing on a non-hierarchical, equal partnership between neonatal teams from different unit designations. It utilised simulation around clinical scenarios, with a slant towards consultant engagement. Four groups rotating through four clinical simulation scenarios were developed. Each group participated in a clinical simulation scenario, led by a consultant and supported by nurses and doctors in training together with facilitators, with a further ~two consultants, as observers within the group. All were considered learners. Consultant candidates took turns to be participants and observers in the simulation scenarios so that at the end of the day all had led a scenario. Each simulation-clinical debrief session was lengthened by a further ~ 20 min, during which freestyle discussion with all learners occurred. This was to promote further bonding, through multidirectional sharing, and with a systems focus on understanding the strengths and challenges of practices in different units. A consultant focus was adopted to promote a long-term engagement between units around shared care. There were four time points for this neonatal networking during the course of the day. Qualitative assessment and a Likert scale were used to assess this initiative over 4 years. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five individuals involved in frontline neonatal care participated. Seventy-seven were consultants, supported by neonatal trainees, staff grade doctors, clinical fellows, advanced neonatal nurse practitioners and nurses in training. All were invited to participate in the survey. The survey response rate was 80.6%. Seventy-nine percent felt that this learning strategy was highly relevant; 96% agreed that for consultants this was appropriate adult learning. Ninety-eight percent agreed that consultant training encompassed more than bedside clinical management, including forging communication links between teams.

20869,Evolution of Intestinal Microbiota of Asphyxiated Neonates Within 1 Week and Its Relationship With Neural Development at 6 Months,2021-08-23,"BACKGROUND: Although SARS‐CoV‐2 immunizations have started in most countries, children are not currently included in the vaccination programs; thus, it remains crucial to define their anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immune response in order to minimize the risk for other epidemic waves. This study sought to provide a description of the virology ad anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 immunity in children with distinct symptomatology. METHODS: Between March and July 2020, we recruited 15 SARS‐CoV‐2 asymptomatic (AS) and 51 symptomatic (SY) children, stratified according to WHO clinical classification. We measured SARS‐CoV‐2 viral load using ddPCR and qPCR in longitudinally collected nasopharyngeal swab samples. To define anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies, we measured neutralization activity and total IgG load (DiaSorin). We also evaluated antigen‐specific B and CD8+T cells, using a labeled S1+S2 protein and ICAM expression, respectively. Plasma protein profiling was performed with Olink. RESULTS: Virological profiling showed that AS patients had lower viral load at diagnosis (p = .004) and faster virus clearance (p = .0002) compared with SY patients. Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 humoral and cellular response did not appear to be associated with the presence of symptoms. AS and SY patients showed similar titers of SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG, levels of neutralizing activity, and frequency of Ag‐specific B and CD8+ T cells, whereas pro‐inflammatory plasma protein profile was found to be associated with symptomatology. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the development of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 humoral and cellular response with any regard to symptomatology, suggesting the ability of both SY and AS patients to contribute toward herd immunity. The virological profiling of AS patients suggested that they have lower virus load associated with faster virus clearance.","Cotugno, Nicola; Ruggiero, Alessandra; Pascucci, Giuseppe Rubens; Bonfante, Francesco; Petrara, Maria Raffaella; Pighi, Chiara; Cifaldi, Loredana; Zangari, Paola; Bernardi, Stefania; Cursi, Laura; Santilli, Veronica; Manno, Emma Concetta; Amodio, Donato; Linardos, Giulia; Piccioni, Livia; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Perrotta, Daniela; Campana, Andrea; Donà, Daniele; Giaquinto, Carlo; Concato, Carlo; Brodin, Petter; Rossi, Paolo; De Rossi, Anita; Palma, Paolo",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8420243/,59

METHODS: From January 2018 to April 2021, 246 consecutive patients with OSAHS diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) in our hospital were selected. All patients were grouped according to the minimum nocturnal oxygen saturation and apnea hypopnea index (AHI). There were 33 cases in the no sleep hypoxia group, 34 cases in the mild hypoxia group, 119 cases in the moderate hypoxia group, and 60 cases in the severe hypoxia group. There were 30 cases in the simple snoring group, 55 cases in the mild OSAHS group, 48 cases in the moderate OSAHS group, and 113 cases in the severe OSAHS group. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores of each group were compared. All patients were grouped according to ESS score. Those with score ≥9 were included in the lethargy group (n = 118), and those with score ≤10 were included in the no lethargy group (n = 128). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the influencing factors of daytime sleepiness in OSAHS patients. Pearson correlation analysis showed the correlation between ESS score and pulse oxygen decline rate in patients with severe OSAHS. RESULTS: The ESS score of the severe hypoxia group > the moderate hypoxia group > the mild hypoxia group > the no sleep hypoxia group. There was significant difference among the groups (F = 19.700, P < 0.0001). There were significant differences between the severe hypoxia group and other groups and between the moderate hypoxia group and the no sleep hypoxia group and the mild hypoxia group (P < 0.05). The ESS score of the severe OSAHS group > the moderate OSAHS group > the mild OSAHS group > the simple snoring group. There was significant difference among the groups (F = 19.000, P < 0.0001). There were significant differences between the severe OSAHS group and other groups and between the moderate OSAHS group and the simple snoring group (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that BMI, neck circumference, snoring degree, total apnea hypopnea time, AHI, micro arousal index (MAI), oxygen saturation (CT90%), lowest oxygen saturation (LSaO2), and mean oxygen saturation (MSaO2) were the influencing factors of daytime sleepiness in OSAHS patients (P < 0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that AHI and CT90% were independent risk factors for daytime sleepiness in OSAHS patients (P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between ESS score and pulse oxygen decline rate in patients with severe OSAHS (r = 0.765, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: OSAHS patients may be accompanied by daytime sleepiness in varying degrees, which may be independently related to AHI and CT90%. The degree of daytime sleepiness in patients with severe OSAHS may be closely related to the decline rate of pulse oxygen, which should be paid great attention in clinic.","Zhang, Fengying; Wu, Xijiang; Duan, Wenping; Wang, Fangfang; Huang, Tingting; Xiang, Meiling",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452394/,59
21525,The role of cognitive and non‐cognitive factors in dental anxiety: A mediation model,2021-05-04,"How do students discover ecology? Answering this question is essential for diversifying the environmental workforce because scientific disciplines, such as ecology, are often not discovered until students enter academia and are exposed to different disciplinary options. Ecology, and many of the environmental sciences, have persistent and alarmingly low numbers of underrepresented minorities (URM; African American, Hispanic American, Native American, and Pacific Islanders), while other science and technology fields have shown progress in diversification. Why does such underrepresentation persist in environmental disciplines? Social factors such as sense of belonging, science identity, implicit biases, and stereotypes all have been explored and are known to influence the participation of URM students in science. The unique role of the field experience in environmental sciences as a “rite of passage” and “authentic” research experience is one important influence on how URM students experience ecology. Interventions using social elements such as belonging and sense of place are demonstrated ways to broaden participation particularly in environmental science fields, yet dramatic underrepresentation still persists. Here we review known factors affecting and enhancing the recruitment and retention of URMs in the sciences and focus on comprehensive strategies shown to be effective recruiting URM students into the environmental workforce.","Bowser, Gillian; Cid, Carmen R.",Ecol Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459229/,59
21602,The Study of Growth and Performance in Local Chicken Breeds and Varieties: A Review of Methods and Scientific Transference,2021-08-25,"BACKGROUND: Deciding whether to resuscitate extremely preterm infants (EPIs) is clinically and ethically problematic. The aim of the study was to understand neonatologists’ clinical–ethical decision-making for resuscitation of EPIs. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in Belgium, following a constructivist account of the Grounded Theory. We conducted 20 in-depth, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with neonatologists. Data analysis followed the qualitative analysis guide of Leuven. RESULTS: The main principles guiding participants’ decision-making were EPIs’ best interest and respect for parents’ autonomy. Participants agreed that justice as resource allocation should not be considered in resuscitation decision-making. The main ethical challenge for participants was dealing with the conflict between EPIs’ best interest and respect for parents’ autonomy. This conflict was most prominent when parents and clinicians disagreed about births within the gray zone (24–25 weeks). Participants’ coping strategies included setting limits on extent of EPI care provided and rigidly following established guidelines. However, these strategies were not always feasible or successful. Although rare, these situations often led to long-lasting moral distress. CONCLUSIONS: Participants’ clinical–ethical reasoning for resuscitation of EPIs can be mainly characterized as an attempt to balance EPIs’ best interest and respect for parents’ autonomy. This approach could explain why neonatologists considered conflicts between these principles as their main ethical challenge and why lack of resolution increases the risk of moral distress. Therefore, more research is needed to better understand moral distress in EPI resuscitation decisions.

22116,A call to action on UHC commitments,2021-06-17,"OBJECTIVE: The lack of a validated and cross-culturally equivalent scale for measuring individual-level water insecurity has prevented identification of those most vulnerable to it. Therefore, we developed the 12-item Individual Water InSecurity Experiences (IWISE) Scale to comparably measure individual experiences with access, use, and stability (reliability) of water. Here, we examine the reliability, cross-country equivalence, and cross-country and within-country validity of the scale in a cross-sectional sample. METHODS: IWISE items were implemented by the Gallup World Poll among nationally representative samples of 43 970 adults (>15 y) in 31 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. Equivalence was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA), the alignment method, and item response theory. Cross-country validity was assessed by regressing mean national IWISE scores on measures of economic, social, and water infrastructure development. Within-country validity was tested with logistic regression models of dissatisfaction with local water quality by IWISE score and regressing individual IWISE scores on per capita household income and difficulty getting by on current income. FINDINGS: Internal consistency was high; Cronbach’s alpha was ≥0.89 in all countries. Goodness-of-fit statistics from MGCFA, the proportion of equivalent item thresholds and loadings in the alignment models, and Rasch output indicated equivalence across countries. Validity across countries was also established; country mean IWISE scores were negatively associated with gross domestic product and percentage of the population with access to basic water services, but positively associated with fertility rate. Validity within countries was also demonstrated; individuals’ IWISE scores were positively associated with greater odds of dissatisfaction with water quality and negatively associated with lower financial standing. CONCLUSIONS: The IWISE Scale provides an equivalent measure of individual experiences with water access and use across LMICs. It will be useful for establishing and tracking changes in the prevalence of water insecurity and identifying groups who have been ‘left behind’.","Young, Sera L; Bethancourt, Hilary J; Ritter, Zacchary R; Frongillo, Edward A",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493920/,59

Average survival was 4.98 years for the patients with tracheostomy and 5.48 years for the patients with translaryngeal intubation (not significant). Sex, age, premium-based monthly salary difference, occupation, urbanization level, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, chronic renal disease, and cerebrovascular diseases were significantly associated with mortality for endotracheal intubation. Male sex, chronic heart failure, chronic renal disease, age ≥45 years, and low income were associated with significantly higher mortality. Although total medical expenditures were higher for the patients with tracheostomy, annual medical expenditures were not significantly different.

24119,3 Medische microbiologie,2006,"The vascular endothelium can be considered as an organ/tissue which comprises a monolayer of endothelial cells which serve as a semipermeable cellular barrier separating the inner space of blood vessels from its surrounding tissue and to control the exchange of fluids and cells between the two compartments. Since the pulmonary circulation receives the entire cardiac output, the large surface area of the lung microvasculature is well suited for sensing mechanical, chemical, and cellular injury by inhaled or circulating substances. This endothelial barrier is dynamically regulated through exposure to these various stimuli of physiological and pathological origin and serves to regulate multiple key biological processes (including lung fluid balance and solute transport between vascular compartments). For example, an increase in vascular permeability is a necessary feature of the body’s defense mechanism to provide injured tissues with access to leucocytes, resulting in tissue edema due to fluid extravasation. However, during conditions of intense lung inflammation such as observed in acute lung injury or its severer form of acute respiratory distress syndrome, the large surface area becomes a liability and provides the opportunity for profound vascular permeability resulting in massive fluid accumulation in the alveolar space and progressively leading to pulmonary failure. Alterations in vascular permeability occur not only in acute inflammatory lung disorders primarily caused by sepsis, pneumonia, and trauma which result in high rates of patient morbidity and mortality, but are an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in subacute lung inflammatory disorders such as ischemia–reperfusion injury, radiation lung injury, and asthma. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of endothelial barrier dysfunction is vital for the management and treatment of key and enigmatic pulmonary disorders.","Chiang, Eddie T.; Wang, Ting; Garcia, Joe G.

Dissection of its signaling mechanisms over the past decades has led to the discovery of several novel concepts, such as tissue-specific metabolism of Ang peptides. Identification and cloning of the various receptors through which Ang II acts on almost all tissues has led to the development of specific pharmacologic inhibitors with proven clinical benefit in patients with cardiovascular disorders. Work on the G-protein-coupled Ang II Type 1 receptor has demonstrated that different receptors interact through oligomerization, compartmentalization, and transactivation, and may explain how Ang II can activate G-protein-independent pathways. Unraveling the downstream effects of Ang II in specific cell types corroborates the importance of the cellular redox state on certain signaling pathways. Finally, the effects of Ang II on cell function and phenotype, such as the expression of inflammatory cytokines and receptors promoting the recruitment of inflammatory cells into vascular tissues, have indicated its role in local inflammation as a general pathogenetic basis of cardiovascular disease. The recognition of Ang II as a contributor to such fundamental pathophysiologic mechanisms, which are believed to be a common pathway for diverse cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension and diabetes, has greatly advanced our knowledge of pathologic signaling in vascular tissues and may help to eventually define novel targets for pharmacologic interventions.","Engberding, Niels; Griendling, Kathy K.",Signal Transduction in the Cardiovascular System in Health and Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121295/,59

The influenza virus is divided into different types and subtypes, three of which are currently circulating widely in humans: influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B. The virus undergoes constant evolution, leading to annual seasonal winter epidemics in temperate countries and necessitating annual updates to the vaccine. Rarely, completely new influenza viruses can emerge in human populations, giving rise to influenza pandemics. Children aged <5 years (especially those <2 years) and those with underlying illness such as cardiac, respiratory and severe neurologic disease have an increased risk of severe outcomes associated with influenza. Pregnant women have an increased risk of severe influenza. Complications may involve the respiratory tract (e.g. otitis media or pneumonia) or, less commonly, other organ systems (e.g. encephalitis or myocarditis). Specific antiviral treatment should be offered as soon as possible for hospitalized children with presumed or confirmed influenza and for influenza of any severity for children at high risk of severe complications of influenza without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Antiviral treatment is usually not warranted for uncomplicated influenza as this is usually self-limiting. Annual influenza vaccination should be offered to all individuals at increased risk for complications of influenza. Vaccine cannot be given to children aged <6 months but maternal influenza immunization during pregnancy is recommended and can confer protection to the young infant.","Cohen, Cheryl; Reubenson, Gary","Viral Infections in Children, Volume I",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121810/,59

Viral and bacterial pneumonia kills more children than any other illness, accounting for 19 % of all deaths in children less than five years of age worldwide; and under-nutrition, which includes vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, has been implicated in 53 % of all these deaths. Poor vitamin D status is a result of insufficient sunlight exposure and/or poor dietary intake. Greater understanding of the role of vitamin D deficiency in precipitating lung infections grew from the use of rodent models and observational and intervention studies in infants and toddlers. Vitamin D adequacy is important to maintaining the key protective mechanism of developing lungs since it mediates the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, the lungs strongest defense against viral and bacterial pathogens. If vitamin D intervention currently under study in several clinical trials is proven successful, then implementation of new fortification practices, revised guidelines for healthy sun exposure and public health programs for vitamin D supplementation of pregnant/lactating women and their infants may be effective strategies to aide in preventing neonates and children under five from developing pneumonia. Globally, there is potential to save more than a million young lives with preventive treatment, a compelling reason why the efficacy of optimizing vitamin D mediated defense against respiratory pathogens in infants and children merits further study.","Balan, K.

26739,Strategies and Challenges for the Development of Industrial Enzymes Using Fungal Cell Factories,2019-09-27,"Severe falciparum malaria is an acute systemic disease that can affect multiple organs, including those in which few parasites are found. The acute disease bears many similarities both clinically and, potentially, mechanistically, to the systemic diseases caused by bacteria, rickettsia, and viruses. Traditionally the morbidity and mortality associated with severe malarial disease has been explained in terms of mechanical obstruction to vascular flow by adherence to endothelium (termed sequestration) of erythrocytes containing mature-stage parasites. However, over the past few decades an alternative ‘cytokine theory of disease’ has also evolved, where malarial pathology is explained in terms of a balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The final common pathway for this pro-inflammatory imbalance is believed to be a limitation in the supply and mitochondrial utilisation of energy to cells. Different patterns of ensuing energy depletion (both temporal and spatial) throughout the cells in the body present as different clinical syndromes. This chapter draws attention to the over-arching position that inflammatory cytokines are beginning to occupy in the pathogenesis of acute malaria and other acute infections.

While the main clinical applications of immunoglobulin therapy concern their use as replacement for patients with primary immunodeficiencies, or as treatment for autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, their role in infectious disease is limited largely to viral and toxin neutralization and replacement therapy in patients with immunoglobulin deficiencies. Many aspects of the therapeutic regimen of immunoglobulins even in the established indications remain open. Recently, due to the worldwide surge of immunosuppression caused by AIDS, organ transplantation, cancer, and autoimmune therapies, as well as the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, there has been renewed interest in the use of antibody preparation to prevent infections in high-risk groups. Knowing the limitations of the current anti-infective armamentarium, approaches that target the host through manipulations to augment the host immune response provide a helpful aid to conventional treatment options. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated that strategies aiming to support or stimulate immune response could be feasible approaches that would benefit immunocompromised patients. In the present chapter, we present contemporary indications of immunoglobulin administration for therapy and prophylaxis of infections in the immunocompromised population.","Katragkou, Aspasia; Roilides, Emmanuel; Walsh, Thomas J.",Management of Infections in the Immunocompromised Host,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123824/,59

29015,Emerging coordination and knowledge transfer process during disease outbreak,2012-05-07,"Emerging viral infections are a crucial challenge to the organization of human public health policies. In the past decades, numerous viral pathogens have barged into the field of medicine, being viruses either newly appeared in the population or newly identified or exhibiting unexpected epidemiological properties. Several factors have been reported to promote such emergences, including viral traffic from animals, ongoing viral genetic evolution, host factors, environmental and social changes. As an example, HIV-1 pandemic perfectly illustrates the evolutionary success of a simian retrovirus introduced into the human population as well as its dramatic impact both on the demographic and economic status of many countries. Influenza viruses remain a classic persisting model of emerging pathogens, which is supported by the coalescence of many contributing characteristics, particularly an animal reservoir consisting of birds and mammals and a segmented RNA genome prone to point mutations and reassortments. Two recent examples, the avian flu due to A/H5N1 virus and the pandemic flu due to A/H1N1 2009, show the difficulties both for predicting the outcome of flu emergences and defining the right strategy for their control. Despite their complexity, influenza virus infections provide a permanent incitement to improve our knowledge and monitoring of viral emergences.","Agut, H.; Boutolleau, D.; Deback, C.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148866/,59
29090,Postgraduate Educational Programme,2008-04-19,"ABSTRACT: This study mainly aimed to optimize a sustainable and green process for extracting bioactive compounds from Foshou fruit by using an integrated technique based on ultrasonic-microwave assisted extraction (UMAE). Response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box–Behnken design was applied to determine optimal conditions. The following optimized UMAE processing parameters were obtained: sonication time (96.13 s), microwave power (305.28 W), and solid/solvent ratio (1:37). Based on a total phenolic compound extraction yield of 9.21 mg gallic acid (GA) equ/g dry weight (DW), a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 27.52 μg GA equ, and an antioxidant capacity detected by 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assay of 8.79 mg trolox equ/g DW. The optimized UMAE extract was superior to those obtained using microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) or conventional solvent extraction (CSE) methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the three extraction methods affected the sample tissue microstructure. Among them, UMAE caused the most marked structural disruption. UPLC-PDA-Q-TOF-MS analysis identified 67 phenolic compounds in the optimized UMAE extract of the Foshou fruit extract. This study indicated that the integrated UMAE technique is a suitable and safe technique to enhance the qualitative and quantitative extraction of phenolic compounds from Foshou fruit. These phenolic compounds can be used as a functional food ingredient in industrial production. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]","Mahdi, Amer Ali; Rashed, Marwan M.

30080,Atemorgane,2008-11-28,"Deliberate dissemination of a biological agent via several different routes presents the latest challenge to global public health security. Novel pathogens and transmission methods can easily be exploited to cause disease outbreaks. Advancements in molecular biology that make it possible to genetically modify, edit, or disrupt the genome of pathogens increase the disease risk of an accidental or intentional release of pathogens with pandemic potential. The occurrence of a disease at more than an endemic level may stimulate an investigation to determine the source of the disease, who has the disease, when it occurred, and how it spreads. When intentional release of pathogens is suspected, investigators have the additional task of attributing the outbreak not only to a pathogen but also to a human source. The deliberate nature of such dissemination may be obvious. However, some forms of bioterrorism may be more covert, requiring molecular methods to uncover. The field of microbial forensics emerged following the anthrax attack in the United States in 2001 to extend epidemiologic principles to aid in the investigation of bioterrorism incidents. Microbial forensics combines epidemiology with genomic and microbiologic methods, to identify, characterize, and ascribe the cause of an incident resulting from the intentional or unintentional release of a harmful pathogen. Unlike routine epidemiologic investigations, microbial forensic investigations are undertaken when there is a potential crime due to the release of a pathogen with disease-causing potential. The investigation is conducted to attribute cause to a source based on indisputable evidence and is used to support criminal charges against the perpetrator(s). However, because bioterrorism may be unannounced, the initial investigation will start the same as to any public health incident of concern. This chapter discusses how epidemiology integrated with laboratory science can be used to identify the source of diseases caused by microorganisms or toxins—especially for attribution purposes.","Khan, Ali S.; Amara, Philip S.; Morse, Stephen A.",Microbial Forensics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153336/,59

The consensus tree shows progressive morphological change from basal to more derived taxa, but a derived group is marked by major morphological innovation, including 27 character state changes that permit subdivision of the family into two sharply demarcated clades – the more basal group is here placed within a redefined Scalpellinae (A rcoscalpellum, A rcuatoscalpellum gen. nov., D iotascalpellum gen. nov., G raviscalpellum, R egioscalpellum gen. nov., and S calpellum), and a more derived group named A migdoscalpellinae subfam. nov. that shows numerous progressive trends in morphology, permitting the recognition of three genera (A migdoscalpellum, C atherinum, and W eltnerium). The phylogeny is independently supported by a recently published multiple DNA marker‐based molecular phylogeny. The more basal Scalpellinae appeared in the Aptian (Early Cretaceous, 120 Mya), and derived Amigdoscalpellinae were already present by the Campanian (Late Cretaceous, 78 Mya), represented by C atherinum anglicum sp. nov. and A migdoscalpellum bellulum from the UK Chalk.

34155,Long-term Changes of Disinfection Byproducts in Treatment of Simulated Ballast Water,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Stress response always occurs in cardiac valve replacement patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: 60 patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement were recruited and randomized into control and Dex groups. Dex group received 1.0 μg·kg-1 of Dex for 10 min intravenously before anesthesia, followed by 0.5 μg·kg-1·h-1 of Dex, steadily administered throughout the procedure. And controlled group received the identical velocity of saline as Dex group. Plasma level of cortisol (Cor), epinephrine (E), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) were evaluated at four timepoints: Before administration (T0), sawn sternum (T1), end of extracorporeal circulation (T2), and 24 h post operation (T3). General data of operation and recovery such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), intraoperative bispectral index (BIS), and hospitalization time in the intensive care unit (ICU) were also compared. RESULTS: Increase of Cor, E, NE, and 5-HT for the Dex group was significant lesser than that in the control group (P < 0.05), and ICU hospitalization time and ventilator support time was significantly shorter in the Dex group. The proportion of patients discharged from the hospital with better prognosis was significantly higher than that in the control group, while there were no significant differences in hospitalization costs and vasoactive drugs use between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dex reduces plasma Cor, E and NE elevations in patients after CPB, alleviates the stress reaction of the body, shortens the hospitalization time and ventilator support time in ICU, and plays a positive role in the rehabilitation of patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement.

The usual way out of this dilemma is to impose norms, maintain reputations and incentivize individuals to contribute. In situations of high uncertainty, however, such as confrontations of protesters with a dictatorial regime, the usual measures are not feasible, but cooperation can be achieved nevertheless. We use an Ising model with asymmetric spins that represent cooperation and defection to show numerically how public goods can be realized. Under uncertainty, people use the heuristic of conformity. The turmoil of a confrontation causes some individuals to cooperate accidentally, and at a critical level of turmoil, they entail a cascade of cooperation.

Barriers to access drive the need to have telehealth as a modality for delivering evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic processes, which can be impactful in improving developmental trajectories and functional outcomes. The chapter concludes with guidance for clinicians interested in leveraging telehealth, with directions elucidated to further advance the use of telehealth to support families with ASD. More recently, in light of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and social distancing guidelines and restrictions, this chapter highlights changes in telehealth policy and the use of telehealth for diagnosis and treatment of ASD as well as thoughts about future directions.","Solomon, Dasha; Soares, Neelkamal",Interprofessional Care Coordination for Pediatric Autism Spectrum Disorder,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7310994/,59
35830,Cover 1,2020-07-01,"Sequent calculus is a pervasive technique for studying logics and their properties due to the regularity of rules, proofs, and meta-property proofs across logics. However, even simple proofs can be large, and writing them by hand is often messy. Moreover, the combinatorial nature of the calculus makes it easy for humans to make mistakes or miss cases. Sequoia aims to alleviate these problems. Sequoia is a web-based application for specifying sequent calculi and performing basic reasoning about them. The goal is to be a user-friendly program, where logicians can specify and “play” with their calculi. For that purpose, we provide an intuitive interface where inference rules can be input in [Image: see text] and are immediately rendered with the corresponding symbols. Users can then build proof trees in a streamlined and minimal-effort way, in whichever calculus they defined. In addition to that, we provide checks for some of the most important meta-theoretical properties, such as weakening admissibility and identity expansion, given that they proceed by the usual structural induction. In this sense, the logician is only left with the tricky and most interesting cases of each analysis.","Reis, Giselle; Naeem, Zan; Hashim, Mohammed",Automated Reasoning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324041/,59

36728,The UK lockdown and the economic value of human life,2020-06-29,"Software testing is an important process of detecting bugs in the software product thereby a quality software product is developed. Verification and Validation (V & V) activities are the effective methods employed to achieve quality. Static and dynamic testing activities are performed during V & V. During static testing, the program code is not executed while in dynamic testing (Black Box and White Box), the execution of the program code is performed. Effective test cases are designed by both these methods. Tables are employed to represent test case documentation. The most beneficial representation - State table based testing, for generating test inputs is explained with the help of state graphs and state tables. This technique is mainly employed in embedded system software testing, real time applications and web application based software product testing where time constraints are a major criteria. Automatic generation of test cases will help to reduce time overhead in testing activities. Our study is to develop optimum test cases by a modified Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique in an automated method and it ensures maximum coverage. The prediction model used in this paper ensures better accuracy of the design of test inputs. A comparison of the similar optimization techniques was also discussed that is used in automated test case generation. A case study of the various states during the execution of a task in an operating system has been presented to illustrate our approach.","S, Saju Sankar; S S, Vinod Chandra",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354778/,59

Our understanding of the disease has dramatically changed due to multiple discoveries and insights. One of the key features of AITL is aberrant immune activity. Although AITL is now understood to be a neoplastic disease, pathologists appreciated that it was an inflammatory condition. The more we understand AITL at cellular and genetic levels, the more we view it as both a neoplastic and an inflammatory disease. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of AITL, focusing on as yet unsolved questions.","Chiba, Shigeru; Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko",Leukemia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7376827/,59

The objective of this study was to evaluate the P(TC)CO(2) and P(ET)CO(2) methods with actual PaCO(2) levels, and to assess the variability of measurements in relation to subject-related factors, such as skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness and presence of pulmonary diseases. P(TC)CO(2), P(ET)CO(2) and PaCO(2) were measured at the same time in intubated pediatric subjects. Subjects’ demographic characteristics, clinical features, laboratory parameters, skin and subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness were identified. The study was carried out on 102 subjects with a total of 1118 values for each method. In patients with non-pulmonary disease, the mean difference between P(TC)CO(2) and PaCO(2) was − 0.29 mmHg (± 6.05), while it was 0.44 mmHg (± 6.83) bias between P(ET)CO(2) and PaCO(2). In those with pulmonary diseases, the mean difference between P(TC)CO(2) and PaCO(2) was − 1.27 mmHg (± 8.32), while it was − 4.65 mmHg (± 9.01) between P(ET)CO(2) and PaCO(2). Multiple linear regression demonstrated that increased subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness, core body temperature and inotropic index were related with higher P(TC)CO(2) values relative to the actual PCO(2) values. Other factors, such as skin tissue thickness, presence of pulmonary disease, measurement location and measurement times were non-significant. The P(TC)CO(2) method has higher reliability than the P(ET)CO(2) method, and P(TC)CO(2) measurements are not influenced by most subject-related factors; however, core body temperature, inotropic index and subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness can lead to significant differences in PCO(2) measurement.","Duyu, Muhterem; Mocan Çağlar, Yasemin; Karakaya, Zeynep; Usta Aslan, Mine; Yılmaz, Seyhan; Ören Leblebici, Aslı Nur; Doğan Bektaş, Anıl; Bahar, Meral; Yersel, Meryem Nihal",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384390/,59

39083,Benefit-Risk Assessment of Vaccines. Part II: Proposal Towards Consolidated Standards of Reporting Quantitative Benefit-Risk Models Applied to Vaccines (BRIVAC),2020-09-12,"Endothelial cells adopt tissue-specific characteristics to instruct organ development and regeneration(1,2). This adaptability is lost in cultured adult endothelial cells, which do not vascularize tissues in an organotypic manner. Here, we show that transient reactivation of the embryonic-restricted ETS variant transcription factor 2 (ETV2)(3) in mature human endothelial cells cultured in a serum-free three-dimensional matrix composed of a mixture of laminin, entactin and type-IV collagen (LEC matrix) ‘resets’ these endothelial cells to adaptable, vasculogenic cells, which form perfusable and plastic vascular plexi. Through chromatin remodelling, ETV2 induces tubulogenic pathways, including the activation of RAP1, which promotes the formation of durable lumens(4,5). In three-dimensional matrices—which do not have the constraints of bioprinted scaffolds—the ‘reset’ vascular endothelial cells (R-VECs) self-assemble into stable, multilayered and branching vascular networks within scalable microfluidic chambers, which are capable of transporting human blood. In vivo, R-VECs implanted subcutaneously in mice self-organize into durable pericyte-coated vessels that functionally anastomose to the host circulation and exhibit long-lasting patterning, with no evidence of malformations or angiomas. R-VECs directly interact with cells within three-dimensional co-cultured organoids, removing the need for the restrictive synthetic semipermeable membranes that are required for organ-on-chip systems, therefore providing a physiological platform for vascularization, which we call ‘Organ-On-VascularNet’. R-VECs enable perfusion of glucose-responsive insulin-secreting human pancreatic islets, vascularize decellularized rat intestines and arborize healthy or cancerous human colon organoids. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and epigenetic profiling, we demonstrate that R-VECs establish an adaptive vascular niche that differentially adjusts and conforms to organoids and tumoroids in a tissue-specific manner. Our Organ-On-VascularNet model will permit metabolic, immunological and physiochemical studies and screens to decipher the crosstalk between organotypic endothelial cells and parenchymal cells for identification of determinants of endothelial cell heterogeneity, and could lead to advances in therapeutic organ repair and tumour targeting.","Palikuqi, Brisa; Nguyen, Duc-Huy T.; Li, Ge; Schreiner, Ryan; Pellegata, Alessandro F.; Liu, Ying; Redmond, David; Geng, Fuqiang; Lin, Yang; Gómez-Salinero, Jesus M.; Yokoyama, Masataka; Zumbo, Paul; Zhang, Tuo; Kunar, Balvir; Witherspoon, Mavee; Han, Teng; Tedeschi, Alfonso M.; Scottoni, Federico; Lipkin, Steven M.; Dow, Lukas; Elemento, Olivier; Xiang, Jenny Z.; Shido, Koji; Spence, Jason R.; Zhou, Qiao J.; Schwartz, Robert E.; De Coppi, Paolo; Rabbany, Sina Y.; Rafii, Shahin",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480005/,59

This literature review targeted for evaluating the infection rate of Neospora caninum in animals in Iran. Until April 2020, all of published documents in the main English and Persian-language databases were searched. A total number of 110 documents (English = 85 and Persian = 25) were extracted. Most of reports were sero-epidemiological studies using ELISA in Iranian cattle population. The range of Neospora infection was 3.8–76.2% in cattle, 0–54.6% in dogs, 0.9–9.9% in sheep, 6.2% in goats, 19.2–55.9% in buffaloes, 20–42.2% in horses, 52% in donkeys, 3.2–27% in camels, 14% and 19% in cats, and 0–20.4% in rodents. This rate in birds was 17.3% in chicken, 9.8% and 30.4% in pigeons, 2.8% and 3.7% in sparrows, and 9.9% in hooded crows. This is a comprehensive literature review on Neospora infection in Iran at the first time. The infection of N. caninum is widespread in Iran especially in dogs and cattle population. This review can provide baseline information for future research. Study on other hosts especially on wild and exotic animals is recommended for exact estimate of neosporosis in Iran. Investigations into molecular diagnosis and genotyping of N. caninum strains are also needed; this will be helpful for developing vaccines and finding the connection among wild and domestic cycles of disease.

Paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) mutations are found in most of the patients with CCHS. In recent years, the condition has evolved from a life-threatening neonatal onset disorder to include broader and milder clinical presentations, affecting children, adults and families. Genes other than PHOX2B have been found responsible for CCHS in rare cases and there are as yet other unknown genes that may account for the disease. At present, management relies on lifelong ventilatory support and close follow up of dysautonomic progression. BODY: This paper provides a state-of-the-art comprehensive description of CCHS and of the components of diagnostic evaluation and multi-disciplinary management, as well as considerations for future research.

39825,Challenges and priorities for delivering on the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 25 years on,2020-09-24,"The term ‘worldviews’ is employed across disciplinary boundaries, yet with no agreed definition it may actually obscure rather than clarify meaning. The use of the term has grown in frequency, particularly in Religious Education (RE) in England, since the Commission on RE’s final report (2018), which recommended changing the name of RE to ‘Religion and worldviews’. Response to the report has been mixed. Some fear that an introduction of worldviews may lead to a dilution of RE and overburden an already overstretched teaching profession; others welcome a meaningful study of non-religious worldviews which they view as more pertinent in the current growth of ‘nones’ (Nones’ term used for those who adhere to ‘no faith’, see Woodhead (J Br Acad 4:245–261, 2016)) in England. Teaching worldviews raises questions of selection: are all worldviews equally appropriate for pupils to study and consistent with the aims of education? For example, is it appropriate for a 6 year old to study Hedonism or National Socialism? This paper problematizes the binary nature of the debate and interrogates the usage of the term 'worldviews'. Focusing on ‘institutional worldviews’ is questionable as the role of master narratives, embedded in these, lose currency. The ‘disintegration of master narratives’, (Riessman in Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences. SAGE Publications, Thousand Oaks, 2008, p. 17), has led to a rise in individuals creating their personal embodied worldviews, albeit subconsciously. Rather than consider worldviews as a discrete body of knowledge that imposes on an already overburdened curriculum, I propose that employing worldviews as an overarching concept, providing a type of paradigmatic analysis for RE, may lead to a greater and more profound understanding of religion(s).","Flanagan, Ruth",j,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7506207/,59

METHODS: A convenience-based internet survey of health-care workers in Canada was facilitated through various labor organizations between April 7 and May 13, 2020. A total of 7,298 respondents started the survey, of which 5,988 reported information on the main exposures and outcomes. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screener, and depression symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) screener. We assessed the perceived need and adequacy of 8 types of PPE and 10 different ICP. Regression analyses examined the proportion of GAD-2 and PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across levels of PPE and ICP, adjusted for a range of demographic, occupation, workplace, and COVID-19-specific measures. RESULTS: A total of 54.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 53.5% to 56.1%) of the sample had GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher, and 42.3% (95% CI, 41.0% to 43.6%) of the sample had PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher. Absolute differences of 18% (95% CI, 12% to 23%) and 17% (95% CI, 12% to 22%) were observed in the prevalence of GAD-2 scores of 3 and higher between workers whose perceived PPE needs and ICP needs were met compared to those who needs were not met. Differences of between 11% (95% CI, 6% to 17%) and 19% (95% CI, 14% to 24%) were observed in PHQ-2 scores of 3 and higher across these same PPE and ICP categories.

METHODS: The integrated epidemiological and microbiological surveillance systematically collects and analyzes information on all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases. Regional reference laboratories analyze samples, inform Local Health Authorities of the results and coordinate data flow between cases, hospitals and GPs. Regions provide data through a web interface connected to a dedicated IT platform or by sending a dataset. The Infectious Diseases Department at Istituto Superiore di Sanità processes and analyzes data, producing reports on a daily and weekly basis, as well as indicator analyses based on the monitoring of “phase 2” (post-lockdown). Moreover, mathematical models are constructed daily on these data. RESULTS: Since the beginning of the epidemic, the surveillance system recorded 238.901 COVID-19 cases and 33.369 deaths on 19-6. Main challenges were the coordination of different actors, hampered by the decentralization of health to the Regions, and data interpretation due to the delay in the detection of cases and deaths. Besides the COVID-19 surveillance, we planned ad hoc studies and periodic surveys: health care workers, long term care facilities, clusters and red zones, health system resilience monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 surveillance is an essential tool to inform the public about the epidemic trend and provide support to public health response. We urge upon all relevant stakeholders a reflection on important issues such as defining ethical boundaries for data scavenging during emergencies, how existing laws on data protection could affect record linkage among different existing datasets to assess diseases and other variables for correlation, or which ethical approaches on open data would apply to our setting. KEY MESSAGES: A strong and adequately funded public health system in place allows an efficient response in times of epidemics both in terms of data collection and public health response, policy and decisions. COVID-19 epidemic showed us all the limits of a regionalized health system which was not entirely coordinated between periphery and central institutions.","Pezzotti, P; Punzo, O; Bella, A; Del Manso, M; Urdiales, A M; Fabiani, M; Ciervo, A; Andrianou, X; Riccardo, F; Stefanelli, P",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543512/,59

Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity of non-repeat regions of csp in P. knowlesi from Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 46 csp genes were subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification. The genes were obtained from P. knowlesi isolates collected from different divisions of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and Peninsular Malaysia. The targeted gene fragments were cloned into a commercial vector and sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed while incorporating 168 csp sequences retrieved from the GenBank database. The genetic diversity and natural evolution of the csp sequences were analysed using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.01. A genealogical network of the csp haplotypes was generated using NETWORK ver. 4.6.1.3. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis revealed indistinguishable clusters of P. knowlesi isolates across different geographic regions, including Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. Nucleotide analysis showed that the csp non-repeat regions of zoonotic P. knowlesi isolates obtained in this study underwent purifying selection with population expansion, which was supported by extensive haplotype sharing observed between humans and macaques. Novel variations were observed in the C-terminal non-repeat region of csp. CONCLUSIONS: The csp non-repeat regions are relatively conserved and there is no distinct cluster of P. knowlesi isolates from Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. Distinctive variation data obtained in the C-terminal non-repeat region of csp could be beneficial for the design and development of vaccines to treat P. knowlesi.","Chong, Eric Tzyy Jiann; Neoh, Joveen Wan Fen; Lau, Tiek Ying; Lim, Yvonne Ai-Lian; Chai, Hwa Chia; Chua, Kek Heng; Lee, Ping-Chin",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579551/,59

In India, the lockdown was imposed from 24 March to 31 May 2020. That was the period of harvesting of Rabi (winter) season crop and sowing of Zaid (summer) season crop. However, the government announced a large number of measures to provide relaxation to agricultural activities during the lockdown. A satellite remote sensing-based assessment was carried out to see the impact of the lockdown and government measures. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time composite all-India product derived from Resourcesat-2/2A Advanced Wide Field Sensor for February, May, and July 2020 was used to assess the crop situation, representing three crop seasons, i.e. Rabi, Zaid and Kharif (rainy). NDVI images of 2020 were compared with corresponding images of 2019. Change images were generated, and state-level NDVI values were computed. The state-level cropped area proportion was also mapped using the NDVI thresholding approach. The crop sown area statistics, crop cutting experiment (CCE) numbers and rainfall data were also compared for both the years. It was observed that the differences were very low between the NDVI of 2019 and 2020 in February month. However, the differences were high in many states during May and in most of the states during July. A statistical test of significance (paired t test) was carried out for state-level NDVI and crop area values, which validated this result. This NDVI change was mostly due to increased crop area during Zaid and Kharif (rainy) seasons and higher rainfall from May to July. The satellite and other data (crop area and CCE numbers) analysis also showed the sowing and harvesting operations in major parts of the country went on smoothly, during the lockdown period.","Saxena, Shalini; Rabha, Amit; Tahlani, Preeti; Ray, Shibendu S.",J Indian Soc Remote Sens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7590910/,59

41895,"Curriculum Kardiologie: 2., aktualisierte Auflage",2020-11-10,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the first cluster of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Wuhan, China. The disease was declared a global pandemic on 11(th) March 2020. COVID-19 was initially thought to cause respiratory complications only, however several extra pulmonary manifestations of the infection have since emerged. We report a rare case of reactive arthritis (ReA), urticarial rash and angioedema in a young female secondary to COVID-19 infection. Rashes were recently added to the World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 demonstrating their significance. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old female doctor was admitted with acute swelling of her lips, dysphagia, and a widespread urticarial rash. Preceding this she had a one-week history of fever, cough, and constitutional symptoms of malaise and weight loss. Her symptoms had started at the end of April 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Three days later she developed painful swelling of her wrists, elbows, knees, and hands. She reported no back or sacroiliac joint pain, enthesitis or any previous history of inflammatory joint pains. She had a history of platelet dysfunction and was treated with Desmopressin. Clinical examination revealed a widespread urticarial rash over her face, limbs, and trunk, with no nail abnormalities. She had active synovitis in her right wrist, elbow, and mild bilateral knee effusions. All other joints including spine and sacroiliac joints were normal. She had no dactylitis or enthesitis. Systemic examination was normal. Investigations revealed Hb 113 g/L, MCV 88.2 fL, Platelets 282 x 10(9)/L, WCC 6.6 x 10(9)/L and Lymphocytes of 0.63 x 10(9)/L with normal neutrophil and eosinophil count. CRP was raised at 107mg/L. She had a negative autoimmune screen including ANA, ANCA, IgM-RF, anti-CCP antibodies and HLA B27. Plain radiographs of knees were normal. SARS CoV-2 PCR was positive following a nasal swab. Urine and blood cultures were negative. Treatment was commenced with intravenous hydrocortisone and antihistamines with resolution of her angioedema symptoms; however, her rash and arthritis persisted. The patient was diagnosed with Reactive Arthritis (ReA), urticarial rash and angioedema secondary to COVID-19 infection. Prednisolone 30mg daily was started, and within a week her arthritis and rash markedly improved. Prednisolone was tapered over six weeks. By her two-month clinic follow up, she reported no further joint swelling and was functioning normally. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: The most common complication of COVID-19 is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) however several other serious complications have been identified including cardiac injury, thromboembolic events, neurological abnormalities, and an aggravated inflammatory response causing a cytokine storm. ReA is a post infectious arthritis commonly seen following gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections and is yet to be recognised as a complication of this disease. ReA most commonly presents as an asymmetrical peripheral or axial spondyloarthropathy. The affected joints do not contain pathogen. More than half of ReA cases resolve spontaneously within six months without requiring long-term treatments. Up to 20% of patients with COVID-19 infection have been shown to develop cutaneous manifestations including erythematous rash, vesicular rash, acral ischaemia, rash with petechiae, and widespread urticaria. This has led to the recent addition of rashes to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Additionally, as COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days where patients can be asymptomatic, cutaneous manifestations may serve as an early indicator of infection, aiding in a more rapid diagnosis. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: We present a rare case of ReA secondary to COVID-19 infection, with complete resolution of symptoms following administration of oral glucocorticoids. A detailed history and examination of the musculoskeletal system should be undertaken in all patients presenting with COVID-19. Urticarial rashes should be considered as an early symptom of COVID-19 infection as per the WHO criteria for diagnosis. Glucocorticoids can be considered in treating patients with this presentation, where traditional anti-inflammatory agents have been refractory or contraindicated.","Sidhu, Arslan; Selvan, Shilpa; Alkutobi, Ziad",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607321/,59

Case 3: A 12‐year‐old healthy male suffering from nasal congestion and taste disorder. OUTCOME: The three patients were prescribed saikatsugekito. Cases 1 and 3 initially presented with white and yellow tongue coating, which disappeared several days after the prescription of saikatsugekito. All three patients were discharged from the hospital without symptom exacerbation. CONCLUSION: We believe that treatment with Kampo medicine, which is relatively safe clinically and has few side effects, should be taken at an early stage of COVID‐19 along with coping therapy. And we think that saikatsugekito may contribute to prevent the worsening of COVID‐19.","Irie, Yasuhito; Nakae, Hajime; Fukui, Shin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7675595/,59

Even in highly prevalent countries, primary gastroduodenal tuberculosis is a rare manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. In recent years, as the incidence of tuberculosis has increased year by year, the occur of gastroduodenal tuberculosis has also increased. Endoscopy is an important tool for diagnosing gastroduodenal tuberculosis. The performance of gastroduodenal tuberculosis under endoscopy is often non-specific, which may imitate other benign or malignant gastroduodenal diseases. Diagnosis of gastroduodenal tuberculosis relies on a combination of endoscopy and guided biopsy. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a rare and interesting case of gastroduodenal tuberculosis with acute pancreatitis. The case initially mimicked gastroduodenal ulcers in morphology and appeared in a middle-aged person with normal immunity but with prolonged fever and abdominal pain. The disease was diagnosed through endoscopy and guided biopsy, and it responded well to antituberculosis drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians must remember that even in the absence of immunodeficiency, as in this case, tuberculosis can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract.","Li, Yuanhua; Liao, Suhuan; Zuo, Haijun; Yang, Wei; Jiang, Di",Eur J Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720036/,59

In this study, we describe enhancements to Threat Poker, which is a game designed for the software development team to deal with security threats identified during the agile development project. Games can be valuable educational tools for actively engaging students and practitioners alike.

In this paper, we study how online promotions that are notified through mobile payment apps, can be a pair of technology enabling successful and rapid fund transfer, thereby offering protective security during a crisis, along with transparency in transactions (Sen 2001). We examine the role of the two technologies in combination through field interviews amidst the Covid-19 crisis in India and draw implications for relief fund collection mechanisms. Initial results show that the role of online promotions and mobile payments have questionable implications in terms of transparency.

However, little is known about the impact of ambient bioaerosols on fungal infections in humans. To identify the correlation between the incidence of pulmonary aspergillosis and PM-associated bioaerosols (PM(2.5) and PM(10)), we retrospectively analyzed data between 2015 and 2018 (first stage) and prospectively analyzed data in 2019 (second stage). Patient data were collected from patients in three medical institutions in Tainan, a city with a population of 1.88 million, located in southern Taiwan. PM data were obtained from the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network. Overall, 544 non-repeated aspergillosis patients (first stage, n = 340; second stage, n = 204) were identified and enrolled for analysis. The trend of aspergillosis significantly increased from 2015 to 2019. Influenza A (H1N1) and ambient PMs (PM(2.5) and PM(10)) levels had significant effects on aspergillosis from 2015 to 2018. However, ambient PMs and influenza A (H1N1) in Tainan were correlated with the occurrence of aspergillosis in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Overall (2015–2019), aspergillosis was significantly correlated with influenza (p = 0.002), influenza A (H1N1) (p < 0.001), and PM(2.5) (p = 0.040) in Tainan City. Using a stepwise regression model, influenza A (H1N1) (p < 0.0001) and Tainan PM(10) (p = 0.016) could significantly predict the occurrence of aspergillosis in Tainan.

This book review with a rich tapestry of current research and thinking about integrity in education and research, is no exception. This publication is the product of a virtual conference that took place in April 2020, which, had the Covid-19 pandemic not arrived, would have been held face-to-face in Dubai. Each of the 15 chapters brings to light new ideas for encouraging academic integrity and ethical conduct, or for deterring and managing academic dishonesty. Some chapters place familiar problems and solutions into new contexts and illustrate classroom experiences in different parts of the world. The key topic of education and training of teachers, researchers and students features in several chapters, including a welcome focus on secondary education. There is no shortage of empirical research in the book, including analysis of data on institutional policies an, admissions. Three chapters concern innovations in use of technology and how they are being applied and developed, with useful take-aways for evidencing contract cheating. Inclusion of the student voice is important in research into academic integrity. We hear from students through formal research, informal feedback and a whole chapter about one student’s journey.

Basildon University Hospital established an elective Green Zone for COVID-19 swab negative patients who isolated for 14 days. This study reviewed the outcomes of the first 100 patients. METHOD: A single-centre study was performed. Demographic and perioperative electronic data were supplemented with telephone follow-up for the first 100 Green Zone patients and analysed in Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: One hundred Green Zone patients underwent surgery between 21/05/2020 and 16/06/2020. The median age was 55 (14-88) years. 52% were female. Their operations were performed by General Surgery (39%), Gynaecology (17%), Vascular Surgery (14%), Oral Surgery (12%), ENT (9%), Urology (8%), and Pain Management (1%). Preoperatively, 100% had a negative SARS-CoV-2 swab and one had CT evidence of mild resolving COVID-19. Two patients had postoperative SARS-CoV-2 swabs, both negative. Median length of stay was 0 (0-7) days. 84% responded to telephone follow-up at a median 25 (13-54) postoperative days, 69% of whom were asymptomatic There were no 30-day major complications (>Clavien-Dindo IIIa) or 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Elective surgery can be safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, with appropriate measures in place. This has significant implications in the context of an ever-expanding NHS waiting list during a pandemic of uncertain duration.","Fisher, R; Hadjittofi, C; Ali, Z; Antonas, P; Parekh, K; Seraj, S; Thomas, L; Uddin, A; Lovett, B",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135925/,59

As the morbidity and mortality rates increased, the healthcare system was burdened with grave challenges including decisions on how to manage patients who needed emergency surgery during the pandemic. In the absence of clear guidelines and undetermined effects of peri-operative COVID-19 infection on surgical patient outcomes; our aim was to publish our surgical outcomes for emergency appendicentomies done during the pandemic. METHOD: Prospective data was collated from 1st of March to 5th of June 2020 (n = 132) had appendicectomies over the period stated. Patient demographics, presenting symptoms, peri-operative events, investigations, and post-operative results and complications were documented and analysed. The results were then compared with outcomes of retrospective analysis at the same centre (n = 206) carried out from 1st March to 30th June 2019. RESULTS: The incidence of complications of appendicitis were similar without any significant differences. The negative appendix rate was significantly lesser in 2020 group, which may correlate to strict patient selection criteria for surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Under strict selection protocols to reduce transmission of COVID- 19 and best surgical practice emergency appendicectomy is safe and feasible. However these observations warrant further well-designed future studies.","Aladeojebi, A; Salgaonkar, H; Murcott, D; Cheruvu, C",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135958/,59

We use a dictionary classifier to categorize 612'177 tweets by parties, politicians, and the public as well as 441'458 articles published in 76 newspapers between February and August 2020. We distinguish between “problem” (COVID‐19) and “solutions” (face masks and contact‐tracing apps) and, using a vector autoregression approach, we analyze the relationship between their salience on social and traditional media, as well as among different groups on social media. We find that overall attention to COVID‐19 was not driven by endogenous dynamics between the different actors. By contrast, the debate on face masks was led by the attentive public and by politicians, whereas parties and newspapers followed. The results illustrate how social media challenge the capacity of party and media elites to craft a consensus regarding the appropriateness of different measures as responses to a major crisis.","Gilardi, Fabrizio; Gessler, Theresa; Kubli, Maël; Müller, Stefan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242806/,59
55540,Sound Effects on Physiological State and Behavior of Drivers in a Highway Tunnel,2021-06-23,"This essay argues for the importance of error as an organizing concept in the management of hazardous technical systems to high levels of reliability and safety. The concept of “error” has been essential to the development of high reliability organizations (HROs). As practiced in HROs, error management has also been an important strategy for the management of uncertainty. “Uncertainty” has been conceived by some analysts as a condition that can convey little or no reliable information about its own boundary conditions or its specific threat to the operation of complex systems. The argument here is that uncertainty is differentiated and specified in HROs and provides important information in relation to error. Uncertainty does not, in the special context of HROs, end the possibility and practice of reliable management. In fact, error in HROs can be a starting point for the further analysis of ways in which uncertainty itself can be managed reliably. But the argument offered here does not mean that uncertainty does not challenge reliability in other settings. The COVID‐19 pandemic is offered as an example of how uncertainties may invalidate even the application of ""reliability"" as a performance standard in certain domains of management and policy.","Schulman, Paul R.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8251209/,59
55590,ANZCA at 25: past presidents in conversation,2020-11-11,"ABSTRACT: We assess the role of race in loans made through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP program, created by the U.S. government as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, provides loans to small businesses so they can keep employees on their payroll. We argue that the historical record and PPP program design choices made it likely that many Black-owned businesses received smaller PPP loans than White-owned businesses. Using newly released data on the PPP program, we find that Black-owned businesses received loans that were approximately 50% lower than observationally similar White-owned businesses. The effect is marginally smaller in areas with more bank competition and disappeared over time as changes to the PPP program were implemented allowing for entry by fintechs and other non-traditional lenders. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: We find that Black-owned businesses received loans through the Paycheck Protection Program that were approximately 50 percent lower than White-owned businesses with similar characteristics. However, this difference in loan size shrank over time as more non-bank lenders such as fintechs were allowed to participate in the program and began approving PPP loans. Loan size differences were also slightly smaller in zip codes containing a larger number of bank branches. These results are consistent with prior research which shows lending discrimination by commercial banks against Black borrowers. It is also consistent with studies showing that greater access to and competition among banks and other lenders can reduce discrimination. In light of these results we recommend that policy makers account for existing racial inequalities within banking or other systems in their program design to produce more equitable outcomes.","Atkins, Rachel; Cook, Lisa; Seamans, Robert",Small Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8255164/,59

This issue is often realized via maps which are often animated. The web-application which is presented here uses an alternative statistical concept for the display of Corona incidences. Instead of the standard assumption of a uniform distribution over the reference area we use the approach of Gross et al. (2020). This general statistical approach is applied here for the estimation of local Corona incidences. The approach avoids the discontinuities at the borderlines of counties which appear in standard maps by a joint analysis of neighboring counties. The focus of the presentation is the realization of this concept by a web-application and its use. By three examples we demonstrate that during the second Corona wave there exist in Germany fixed local clusters which may broaden over time and which may also merge.,"Rendtel, Ulrich; Neudecker, Andreas; Fuchs, Lukas",AStA Wirtsch Sozialstat Arch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8278176/,59

57018,Competency-Based Assessment in Pediatrics for the New Undergraduate Curriculum,2021-04-20,"With the development of the bike-sharing system (BSS) and the introduction of green and low carbon development, the environmental impacts of BSS had received increasing attention in recent years. However, the emissions from the rebalancing of BSS, where fossil-fueled vehicles are commonly used, are usually neglected, which goes against the idea of green travel in a sharing economy. Previous studies on the bike-sharing rebalancing problem (BRP), which is considered NP-hard, have mainly focused on algorithm innovation instead of improving the solution model, thereby hindering the application of many existing models in large-scale BRP. This study then proposes a method for optimizing the CO(2) emissions from BRP and takes the BSS of Beijing as a demonstration. We initially analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of BSS, especially the flow between districts, and find that each district can be independently rebalanced. Afterward, we develop a rebalancing optimization model based on a partitioning strategy to avoid deciding the number of bikes being loaded or unloaded at each parking node. We then employ the tabu search algorithm to solve the model. Results show that (i) due to over launch and lack of planning in rebalancing, the BSS in Beijing shows great potential for optimization, such as by reducing the number of vehicle routes, CO(2) emissions, and unmet demands; (ii) the CO(2) emissions of BSS in Beijing can be reduced by 57.5% by forming balanced parking nodes at the end of the day and decreasing the repetition of vehicle routes and the loads of vehicles; and (iii) the launch amounts of bikes in specific districts, such as Shijingshan and Mentougou, should be increased.","Qin, Meng; Wang, Jiayu; Chen, Wei-Ming; Wang, Ke",Front,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8375285/,59

60198,Letter from the guest editor.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Early recognition of complications during intracranial neuroendovascular interventions is important for medical decision making and prompts administration of life-saving treatments. Low contrast imaging (LCI) provides computed tomographic (CT)-like images of anatomical brain structures, capable of detecting hydrocephalus and intracranial hemorrhage complications. We present our early experience with LCI using the Toshiba Infinix-i biplane angiographic suite during neurointerventional cases, including acute stroke interventions, aneurysm embolization, and subarachnoid hemorrhage management. METHODS Six patients underwent LCI during various neuroendovascular procedures. We describe clinical and imaging findings and provide visual comparison of LCI with conventional noncontrast cranial CT imaging. RESULTS Our initial experience shows that LCI is capable of detecting or excluding intracerebral hemorrhage and hydrocephalus during neurointerventional procedures as well as confirming ventriculostomy catheter placement when compared to noncontrast CT imaging. Motion artifact is a major limitation associated with this technology and can be overcome in part by performing shorter duration rotation sequences. CONCLUSIONS LCI is a promising tool in the arsenal of a neuroendovascular interventionist, especially when a complication is suspected during an intervention, potentially obviating the need for immediate transfer of the patient to a conventional CT scanner. Further studies comparing LCI with conventional noncontrast CT imaging are necessary.","Mokin, Maxim; Levy, Elad I; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,https://doi.org/10.1111/jon.12123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717096/,59

60720,Deep learning in the quest for compound nomination for fighting COVID-19.,2021-01-13,"The spread of COVID-19 within any given country or community at the onset of the pandemic depended in part on the sheltering-in-place rate of its citizens. The pandemic led us to revisit one of psychology's most fundamental and most basic questions in a high-stakes context: what determines human behavior? Adopting a Lewinian interactionist lens, we investigate the independent and joint effects of macrolevel government policies and microlevel psychological factors-that is, personality-on whether individuals sheltered-in-place. We analyzed data collected in late March and early April 2020 from 101,005 participants in 55 countries, a time period that coincided with the early and accelerating stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. This time period also contained substantial variation in the stringency of governmental policy toward sheltering-in-place, both between countries and within each country over time. Analyses revealed that personality and the stringency of governmental policies independently predicted sheltering-in-place rates. Policy stringency was positively related to sheltering-in-place. For the personality dimensions, Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism all predicted higher rates of sheltering-in-place, whereas Extraversion was negatively related to staying at home. In addition, two personality traits-Openness to Experience and Neuroticism-interacted with governmental policy to predict whether individuals sheltered-in-place; openness and neuroticism each had weaker effects on sheltering-in-place as governmental policies became stricter. Theoretically, the findings demonstrate that individual differences predict behavior (i.e., sheltering-in-place) even when governments take strong action targeting that behavior. Practically, they suggest that even if governments lift their shelter-in-place restrictions, some individuals will shelter-in-place less than others.

However, while pain management and palliative care have steadily expanded in recent years, many underserved populations, such as rural older adults, experience barriers in accessing such specialty services, in part due to transportation issues. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the specific types of transportation-related barriers experienced by rural older adults in accessing pain and palliative care. METHODS Studies were searched through the following 10 databases: Abstracts in Social Gerontology, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, SocINDEX with Full Text, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Nursing & Allied Health Database, Sociological Abstracts, and PubMED. Studies were chosen for initial review if they were written in English, full text, included older adults in the sample, and examined pain/palliative care/hospice, rural areas, and transportation. A total of 174 abstracts were initially screened, 15 articles received full-text reviews and 8 met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS Findings of the 8 studies identified transportation-related issues as major access barrier to pain and palliative care among rural older adults: specifically, lack of public transportation; lack of wheelchair accessible vehicles; lack of reliable drivers; high cost of transportation services; poor road conditions; and remoteness to the closest pain and palliative care service providers.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, some clinicians might have opted for less potent immunosuppressive agents to counterbalance the novel infectious risk. We conducted a nationwide study to characterize immunosuppression use and subsequent clinical outcomes during the first 5 months of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we studied all kidney-only recipients in the United States from 1/1/2017 to 3/12/2020 (""prepandemic"" era; n=64 849) and from 3/13/2020 to 7/31/2020 (""pandemic"" era; n=5035). We compared the use of lymphocyte-depleting agents (vs. basiliximab or no induction) and maintenance steroids (vs. steroid avoidance/withdrawal) in the pandemic era compared to the prepandemic era. Then, we compared early posttransplant outcomes by immunosuppression regimen during the pandemic era. RESULTS Recipients in the pandemic era were substantially less likely to receive lymphocyte-depleting induction agents compared to their prepandemic counterparts (aOR=0.400.530.69); similar trends were found across subgroups of state-level COVID-19 incidence, donor type, and recipient age. However, lymphocyte-depleting induction agents were associated with decreased rejection during admission (aOR=0.110.230.47), but not with increased mortality in the pandemic era (aHR=0.130.471.66). On the other hand, the use of maintenance steroids versus early steroid withdrawal remained similar (aOR=0.711.071.62). CONCLUSIONS The use of lymphocyte-depleting induction agents has decreased in favor of basiliximab and no induction during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this shift might have resulted in increases in rejection with no clear reductions in posttransplant mortality.","Bae, Sunjae; McAdams-DeMarco, Mara A; Massie, Allan B; Ahn, JiYoon B; Werbel, William A; Brennan, Daniel C; Lentine, Krista L; Durand, Christine M; Segev, Dorry L",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33093404/,59

PRETEXT is being intensively studied in the current Children's Oncology Group (COG) AHEP-0731 trial in an attempt to validate interobserver reproducibility and ability to monitor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and determine surgical resectability. PRETEXT is now used to identify those patients who are at risk for having an unresectable tumor and who should be referred to a liver specialty center with transplant capability early in their treatment schema.

65253,Long covid: coding is caring.,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND Hypertensive patients, often characterized by chronic inflammation, are susceptible to diabetes. Evidence suggests that the positive association between serum ferritin (SF) and diabetes was affected by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), an inflammation marker. We investigate whether there was an interaction between SF and hs-CRP on diabetes in hypertensive patients. METHODS We analysed data of 1,735 hypertensive people in this cross-sectional study. Diabetes was diagnosed when fasting blood glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L and/or a previous clinical diagnosis of diabetes. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of the SF and hs-CRP with diabetes. Multiplicative interaction was evaluated by incorporating a cross-product term for SF and hs-CRP to the logistic regression model. Additive interaction was assessed by calculating the relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) and attributed proportion due to interaction (AP). RESULTS In the adjusted analysis, SF (highest vs lowest tertile: odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.16) was positively associated with diabetes. There was no multiplicative interaction between SF and hs-CRP, but evidence of additive interaction in regard to diabetes (RERI: 0.86; 95 % CI: 0.06-1.67). Compared to the patients with low SF (lower two thirds) and low hs-CRP (≤ 2 mg/L), those with high SF (upper one third) and high hs-CRP (> 2 mg/L) had increased OR for diabetes (adjusted OR: 2.33 [1.65-3.30]), with 37.0 % of the effects attributed to the additive interaction (AP: 0.37; 95 % CI: 0.09-0.65). CONCLUSIONS Within a cross-sectional study consisting of hypertensive patients, co-exposure to high SF and high hs-CRP was synergistically associated with diabetes. Dietary intervention or pharmacological treatment to lowering SF concentration may help to reduce diabetes morbidity in hypertensive patient with chronic inflammation.","Zhou, Juan; Wang, Ning; Wang, Dongxia; Zhao, Rui; Zhao, Dan; Ouyang, Binfa; Peng, Xiaolin; Hao, Liping",Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtemb.2021.126824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352498/,59

In this study, we aimed to verify locations at which it is feasible to perform TU-ESD in the upper gastric body and to demonstrate the safety of TU-ESD in single-basin lymph node dissection (SBLND). METHODS In vitro, TU-ESD was performed at three lesion sites (anterior wall, AW; posterior wall, PW; and lesser curvature, LC) in each porcine stomach using an EASIE-R tray (cases = 10). In vivo, TU-ESD was performed with SBLND in 9 pigs. Seven days after the operation, the pigs were sacrificed and examined. RESULTS In the in vitro feasibility study, the TU-ESD time was significantly faster in the PW group (5.9 ± 2.0 min) than in the LC group (8.5 ± 1.5 min) (p < 0.05) in all 10 cases. In the in vivo survival study, TU-ESD with SBLND was successfully performed without any complications (N = 9). There were no cases of delayed perforation, and healing ulcers were found in all pigs 7 days after the operation. Ulcer size (5.2 ± 3.5 cm2) was approximately 36% smaller than that observed at the ESD operation site (8.1 ± 1.9 cm2) (p = 0.05). Epithelialization in the margin and healing of the gastric ulcers were confirmed by microscopy. CONCLUSIONS TU-ESD with SBLND is a feasible and safe method. The upper posterior gastric body could be the most feasible location for performing TU-ESD, perhaps because of the difference in the subcutaneous dissection time.","Jeong, Sang-Ho; Min, Jae-Seok; Park, Ji-Ho; Hong, Soon-Chan; Jung, Eun-Jung; Ju, Young-Tae; Jeong, Chi-Young; Lee, Han Shin; Park, Miyeong; Lee, Young-Joon; Ha, Chang Yoon",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-06801-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016457/,59
65762,Comparing the turn performance of different motor control schemes in multilink fish-inspired robots.,2021-02-18,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the feasibility of laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) in mid and lower rectal cancers following neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT). BACKGROUND The laparoscopic approach for colon cancer has been widely accepted. A few studies have shown that there are advantages of laparoscopic over open TME surgery for rectal cancer. However, the role of laparoscopy has not been clearly defined specifically in cases following nCRT. METHODS All patients with rectal cancer who underwent nCRT were identified; no operations for rectal carcinoma were performed laparoscopically between 1997 and 2005. The laparoscopic cases were matched to open cases based on gender, procedure, age, and body mass index (BMI). The medical records were reviewed and short-term outcome was compared between these two groups. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15 software. RESULTS Between 2002 and 2008, 64 patients were identified, including 32 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery and 32 who had a laparotomy. There was no difference between the two groups based on gender, procedure, age, BMI or American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification. The procedures performed within each group included 8 abdominoperineal resections and 24 anterior resections, which included 20 colonic J-pouch-anal anastomoses and 4 straight coloanal anastomoses. In the laparoscopic group, 12 patients underwent totally laparoscopic operations, 12 were either laparoscopic-assisted or hand-assisted procedures, and 8 were converted to laparotomy. The reasons for conversion included bleeding, splenic injury, and difficult anatomy. There were no differences in comorbidities, tumor location, tumor size, tumor stage or radiation dose between the two groups. Operative time was longer in the laparoscopic group (267 + or - 76 versus 205 + or - 49 min, p < 0.001). Operative blood loss, complication rate, and mortality rate were all similar between the two groups. However, the laparoscopic group benefited from shorter length of stay (6.1 + or - 2.4 versus 7.6 + or - 2.3 days, p = 0.012), earlier first bowel movement (1.9 + or - 1 versus 3.3 + or - 2.4 days, p = 0.006), and shorter time to regular diet (3.9 + or - 2.1 versus 5.8 + or - 2.5 days, p = 0.003). There was no difference in lymph node harvest (both positive node harvest and total lymph node harvest), distal margin or radial margin. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, laparoscopic TME for mid and lower rectal cancer is feasible and safe. Patients benefit from the short-term advantages of laparoscopy, including shorter length of hospital stay, time to tolerating a regular diet, and time to first bowel movement or stoma function. Although there were no short-term differences in oncologic parameters, the long-term oncologic outcome requires further investigation.","Denoya, P; Wang, H; Sands, D; Nogueras, J; Weiss, E; Wexner, Steven D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0702-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19851807/,59

Some of these benefits include reduced postoperative pain, earlier return to normal activity, and improved cosmesis when compared with open surgery. For these reasons, since its first description by Delaitre and Maignien in 1991, laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) has been increasingly utilized for a safe surgical removal of the spleen with nearly equivalent or superior short- and long-term outcomes when compared with the open approach. In this technical report, we aim to describe our preoperative and postoperative management of patients undergoing LS and to illustrate our preferred surgical technique, its rationale, and our results.","Fisichella, P Marco; Wong, Yee M; Pappas, Sam G; Abood, Gerard J",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-013-2366-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24114681/,59

66197,2020 Spring Highlights Meeting: Presidential Address.,2020-08-01,"The mucosal immunity plays an important role against African swine fever virus (ASFV) infection and the efficacy of mucosal vaccination is highly dependent on the adjuvant. However, the mucosal adjuvant for ASFV vaccination is poorly studied. Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands such as the FlaB flagellin from Vibrio vulniﬁcus and the heat shock protein 70 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mHsp70) hold a great promise as novel vaccine adjuvant. However, the mucosal adjuvanticities of such TLR ligands have not been studied in pigs. In this study, three recombinant Adenovirus (rAd) vectors, namely rAd-F1, rAd-FlaB-F1 and rAd-F1-Hsp70, were constructed by fusing the FlaB or mHsp70 to ASFV CD2v-p30-p54 fusion antigen. Western blotting showed that the three fusion proteins expressed in rAd-infected cells reacted positively with ASFV antibodies. After intranasal immunization of pigs with the three rAd vectors, the antigen-specific IgG antibodies were detectable from day 7 after primary immunization, which were significantly boosted by the secondary immunization. Strong Th1/Th2 cytokine responses were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Compared to immunization with the control rAd-F1, significantly higher levels of the antigen-specific IgA antibodies were detected in the nasal fluids, tracheal washes and lung lavages.1 Compared to immunization with rAd-Flab-F1, immunization with rAd-F1-Hsp70 induced significantly stronger mucosal IgA antibody response. Cytokine detection of the pig lung lavages showed that the elevated IgA antibody responses were correlated mainly with IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-α, which were confirmed by the significantly increased antigen-recall cytokine expression in the porcine alveolar macrophages. These data suggest that mHsp70 has potent mucosal adjuvanticity in pigs, and the fusion rAd vector can be used for ASFV mucosal vaccine development.","Lu, Huipeng; Zhou, Xiaohui; Wu, Zhi; Zhang, Xinyu; Zhu, Liqi; Guo, Xiaoyu; Zhang, Quan; Zhu, Shanyuan; Zhu, Hongfei; Sun, Huaichang",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2021.110307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399310/,59
66975,Attributes and predictors of long COVID.,2021-03-10,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe and has involved more than 215 countries and territories. Due to a lack of effective therapy or vaccine, urgent and concerted efforts are needed to identify therapeutic targets and medications. COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition. This simulated study indicates that these phytochemicals may be considered as potent inhibitors of the viral protease; however, more investigations are required to explore their potential medicinal use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

67924,In the literature: August 2021.,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND Hip fracture is a common, painful injury with increasing global incidence. Patients require optimal acute pain management. Systematic reviews have investigated the postoperative use of epidural analgesia and found that it may have advantages over systemic analgesia. It is of interest to determine whether pre-operative use of epidural analgesia is also advantageous. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses on the effect of epidural analgesia on pre-operative pain management in hip fracture patients. METHODS We included randomized controlled trials comparing pre-operatively initiated epidural analgesia with any other method of analgesia, in adults aged ≥55 years scheduled for hip fracture surgery. The main outcome was pre-operative pain at rest. Electronic searches of four medical databases were performed. Two authors independently screened for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We conducted meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of the evidence by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS Three articles were included, with 179 randomized patients. All studies compared epidural analgesia with systemic analgesia, one additionally with 3-in-1-block. Meta-analyses of pre-operative pain measurements resulted in a mean difference of -5.85 95% CI [-14.90; 3.19] on a 0-100 Visual Analogue Scale with a p-value of 0.17 and a very low certainty of evidence according to the GRADE rating. CONCLUSIONS We did not find a difference in pre-operative pain at rest between epidural analgesia and any other method of pre-operatively initiated analgesia. The studies were few, of low quality and the difference between the two interventions remains unknown. EDITORIAL COMMENT This trustworthy systematic review highlights that the existing evidence supporting preoperative epidural analgesia in patients with hip fracture is sparse and of low quality, with no firm evidence for benefit or harm.","Rubin, Monika Afzali; Stark, Nikolaj Francis; Hårsmar, Simon Julius Chamli; Møller, Ann Merete",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aas.13760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296497/,59
68529,Memento Mori.,2020-11-03,"PURPOSE To assess the value of intraoperative ultrasonography (US) for different types of pancreatic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS An institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective review with waiver of informed consent was performed to evaluate all cases of pancreatic surgery with intraoperative US or laparoscopic US that occurred at a single institution during a 10-year period. Surgical notes, radiologic images, and clinical data for each surgical procedure and subsequent clinical course were reviewed by pancreatic surgeons and radiologists. Presumptive diagnosis, type of surgical procedure performed, and final pathologic data were recorded. A relative value score was established by consensus and assigned to each case with a grade of 0-3, which indicated the value of the intraoperative or laparoscopic US. The type of operation and pathologic data were compared in each of the value score groups. Categoric variables were compared by using either χ(2) or Fisher exact test. RESULTS One hundred ninety-three intraoperative or laparoscopic US procedures were performed in 189 patients. Of the patients, there were 102 men and 87 women. The mean age was 57.8 years (range, 18-86 years). Intraoperative or laparoscopic US value scores were as follows: value score 0, 3.6%; value score 1, 11.9%; value score 2, 31.1%; and value score 3, 53.4%. The most common contribution that resulted in a high score (value score 3) was facilitation of technical performance of the surgery (n = 60). High value score was significantly associated with performance of pancreatitis-related surgery (P < .001). The surgical indication that most commonly resulted in a low value score of 0 or 1 was staging of pancreatic cancers. All cases that received a score of 0 occurred in the laparoscopic adenocarcinoma surgical setting (staging or pancreatic biopsy). CONCLUSION Intraoperative or laparoscopic US can be a valuable procedure in multiple types of surgical procedures that involve the pancreas and shows clear patterns of value in the different types of surgery.","Ní Mhuircheartaigh, Jennifer M; Sun, Maryellen R M; Callery, Mark P; Siewert, Bettina; Vollmer, Charles M; Kane, Robert A",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.12120201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220893/,59

Previously, SSC has been shown to improve neonatal physiological stability, support brain development, and promote bonding and attachment. Limited research exists investigating SSC duration and neonatal physiological responses. PURPOSE This study examined the relationship between SSC duration and the neonate's oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and temperature. METHOD An observational cohort study was conducted at The Royal Women's Hospital NISC Unit in Melbourne, Australia. For each neonate participant, 1 SSC with their parent was studied (parent convenience) and neonatal physiological parameters recorded, with a bivariate correlation used to explore the relationship between the duration of SSC and the percentage of time during SSC that the neonate's physiological variables remained within a target range. FINDINGS No correlation existed between the duration of SSC and the neonatal physiological variables of oxygen saturation, HR, RR, and temperature. However, neonatal oxygen requirement was more often reduced across the duration of SSC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND FUTURE RESEARCH Due to previously documented benefits to neonates physiologically from SSC, and our supportive finding that SSC reduces neonatal oxygen requirement, we believe that this study adds to the evidence to support promotion of SSC in NISC Units. The duration of SSC does not appear to negatively impact the physiological effects to the neonate. Thus, SSC should be encouraged in all NISC Units to be conducted for the length of time the parent is able. This study should be repeated with a larger sample size.","Jones, Hannah; Santamaria, Nick",Advances in neonatal care : official journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/anc.0000000000000485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29596071/,59

Recently, however, non-neutropenic patients in the ICU population have shown an increasing risk profile for aspergillosis. Associations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and corticosteroid therapy have been frequently documented in this cohort. Difficulties in achieving a timely diagnosis of aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients is related to the non-specificity of symptoms and to lower yields with microbiological tests compared to neutropenic patients. Since high mortality rates are typical of invasive aspergillosis in critically ill patients, a high level of suspicion and prompt initiation of adequate antifungal treatment are mandatory. Epidemiology, risk factors, diagnostic algorithms, and different approaches in antifungal therapy for invasive aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients are reviewed.","Bassetti, Matteo; Righi, Elda; De Pascale, Gennaro; De Gaudio, Raffaele; Giarratano, Antonino; Mazzei, Tereesita; Morace, Giulia; Petrosillo, Nicola; Stefani, Stefania; Antonelli, Massimo",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-014-0458-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25167934/,59

Sleep has a profound influence on the physiology of body systems and biological processes. Molecular studies have shown circadian-regulated shifts in protein expression patterns across human tissues, further emphasizing the unique functional, behavioral and pharmacokinetic landscape of sleep. Thus, many pathological processes are also expected to exhibit sleep-specific manifestations. Modern advances in biosensor technologies have enabled remote, non-invasive recording of a growing number of physiologic parameters and biomarkers. Sleep is an ideal time frame for the collection of long and clean physiological time series data which can then be analyzed using data-driven algorithms such as deep learning. Here, we introduce key clinical studies in selected medical fields, which leveraged novel technologies and the advantageous period of sleep to diagnose, monitor and treat pathologies. We then discuss possible opportunities to further harness this new paradigm and modern technologies to explore human health and disease during sleep and to advance the development of novel clinical applications - from sleep medicine to medicine during sleep.","Bar, Nitai; Sobel, Jonathan A; Penzel, Thomas; Shamay, Yosi; Behar, Joachim A",Physiological measurement,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abf47c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794516/,59

METHODS The retrospective study included newborn infants who were hospitalized for LRI during the two consecutive RSV seasons, and then tested for possible etiological agent by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. All relevant data were reviewed, and the clinical characteristics of RSV-related infection were compared to those of others. RESULTS Of 224 patients, 160 (71 %) were positive for at least one potentially causative agent. Of them, 65 % had RSV, and 15 % had more than on ecausative agent (co-infection). The RSV group had more the findings of respiratory distress (p< 0.01), abnormal chest radiography (p< 0.01), need for intensive care (p< 0.01), and duration of oxygen requirement (p< 0.01) but less fever on admission and duration of antibiotic use (for both, p< 0.01), and no longer hospital stay. Need of intensive care nursery was more common in patients with co-infection than others (25 % vs. 6.5 %, p< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study highlighted that RSV was the most frequent agent in neonates hospitalized for LRI during the season, with a more severe clinical course than other detected pathogens. The disease severity of RSV infection may have seemed to be increased by the presence of coinfection and abnormal chest radiography.","Celik, Kiymet; Olukman, Ozgur; Demirol, Hatice; Terek, Demet; Gulfidan, Gamze; Devrim, Ilker; Gulcu, Pelin; Arslanoglu, Sertac; Calkavur, Sebnem",Archivos argentinos de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.5546/aap.2019.eng.e356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31339272/,59

Enteric leaks can differ in severity, presentation, and management, depending on the type of bariatric surgery performed. Our objective was to describe the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes in patients who developed postoperative leaks at a university hospital bariatric referral center. METHODS A retrospective observational study using descriptive statistics was conducted on data from 1499 bariatric operations performed at our institution from 1994 to 2010. The procedures included a variant of biliopancreatic diversion with long limb reconstruction (BPD-LL) in 820 patients (791 open and 29 laparoscopic), Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) in 301 patients (105 open and 196 laparoscopic), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in 208 patients (5 open and 203 laparoscopic). RESULTS Of these patients, 30 (2%) developed a postoperative leak at a median of 18 days (range 2-32) postoperatively. The primary procedure was laparoscopic SG in 12 patients (5.8%), laparoscopic RYGB in 5 patients (1.6%), and BPD-LL (12 open and 1 laparoscopic) in 13 patients (1.6%). In all patients who underwent laparoscopic SG, the leak site was along the staple line. The gastrojejunal anastomosis was leaking in 4 (80%) and 12 (92.3%) patients in the RYGB and BPD-LL group, respectively. The enteroenteral anastomosis was leaking in 1 patient each in the RYGB and BPD-LL groups (20% and 7.7%, respectively). Three patients (10%; 2 from the BPD-LL group and 1 from the RYGB group) presented with generalized peritonitis and underwent emergency re-exploration; nonoperative treatment was successful in the remaining 27 patients (90%). Stent placement for persistent gastrocutaneous fistula was used in 9 patients (30%; 8 from the SG cohort and 1 from the BPD-LL group). The overall mortality rate was 3.3%. CONCLUSION In our experience, most leaks resulting from antiobesity surgery were successfully managed using nonoperative methods.

For stent delivery, we used a 300-cm 0.014-in microguidewire (Transend), which was placed into the target branch using an exchange technique. A 0.027-in microcatheter (Excelsior XT-27), which was designed for the stent, was advanced over the exchange microguidewire. If we had trouble in advancing the microcatheter over the exchange microguidewire, we inserted a regular microguidewire (Traxcess), into the microcatheter lumen in a parallel fashion. We also analyzed the mechanism underlying microcatheter positioning failure and the success rate of the 'parallel-wire technique'. RESULTS Among the 15 cases, we faced with navigation difficulty in five patients. In those five cases, we could advance the microcatheter successfully by applying the parallel-wire technique. There were no procedure-related complications. CONCLUSION Simply by using another microguidewire together with pre-existing microguidewire in a parallel fashion, the stent-delivery microcatheter can be easily navigated into the target location in case of any advancement difficulty.","Adrianto, Yudhi; Yang, Ku Hyun; Koo, Hae-Won; Park, Wonhyoung; Park, Jung Cheol; Lee, Deok Hee",Neurointervention,https://doi.org/10.5469/neuroint.2016.11.1.24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958409/,59

What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? In a previous randomized controlled trial, barbed polyglyconate suture for vesico-urethral anastomosis was associated with more frequent cystogram leaks, longer mean catheterization times and greater suture costs per case. In the current randomized controlled trial, we show that barbed polyglyconate suture is associated with decreased anastomosis time, decreased need to readjust suture tension, cost reduction, and equal continence and early/late urinary complication rates. OBJECTIVE To examine the effectiveness of barbed polyglyconate suture (V-Loc 180; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) compared with standard monofilament for posterior reconstruction (PR) and vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in 70 consecutive RARP cases by a single surgeon (K.C.Z.). Standard VUA was performed using three 4-0 poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl; Ethicon Endosurgery, Cincinnati, OH, USA) sutures secured with absorbable suture clips (LapraTy, Ethicon; one single 6-inch [15.2 cm] for PR and two attached 6-inch [15.2 cm] for VUA). Barbed suture VUA was performed using two 3-0 6-inch (15.2 cm) barbed polyglyconate sutures. Time to complete the suture set-up by the nursing team, anastomosis time and need to adjust suture tension were recorded. Suture-related complications, validated-questionnaire continence and cost were also examined. RESULTS Compared with a conventional reconstruction technique, there was a significant reduction in mean nurse set-up time (31 vs. 294 s; P < 0.01) and reconstruction time (13.1 vs. 20.8 min; P < 0.01) for the barbed suture technique. Need to readjust suture tension or to place additional suture clips for watertight closure was greater in the standard monofilament group than in the barbed suture group (6% vs. 24%; P= 0.03). • A cost reduction was recorded at our institution (48.05 vs. 70.25 $CAN) with the barbed suture technique. • With a mean follow-up of 6.2 months, no delayed anastomotic leak or bladder neck contracture was observed in either group. • Pad-free continence outcomes for the monofilament suture vs the barbed suture groups at 1 (64 vs. 69%, P= 0.6), 3 (76 vs. 81%, P= 0.5) and 6 months (88 vs. 92%, P= 0.7) were similar. CONCLUSIONS • Compared with standard monofilament suture, the unidirectional barbed polyglyconate suture appears to provide safe, efficient and cost-effective PR and VUA during RARP. • Use of the interlocked barbed polyglyconate suture technique prevents slippage, precluding the need for assistance, knot-tying and constant reassessment of anastomosis integrity.","Zorn, Kevin C; Trinh, Quoc-Dien; Jeldres, Claudio; Schmitges, Jan; Widmer, Hugues; Lattouf, Jean-Baptiste; Sammon, Jesse; Liberman, Dan; Sun, Maxine; Bianchi, Marco; Karakiewicz, Pierre I; Denis, Ronald; Gautam, Gagan; El-Hakim, Assaad",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2011.10763.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22221566/,59

The members of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family prevent viral replication and are crucial for defending the host cell against influenza A virus (IAV). Several studies suggest that the CC genotype at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12252 of IFITM3 confers a genetic predisposition to pandemic influenza A in Europeans and Han Chinese, although one study in a British cohort failed to show an association. In order to examine whether an SNP of the IFITM3 gene is correlated with the disease severity of pandemic IAV (H1N1) infection in a Korean population, we investigated the genotype and allele frequencies of this polymorphism in 300 healthy Koreans by automatic direct sequencing and compared the disease severity based on epidemiological studies of the H1N1 virus reported in several countries. The frequencies of the CC genotype and the C allele in the IFITM3 polymorphism were higher in the Korean population than in the European populations, but not in Chinese and Japanese populations. The prevalence of severe cases of the pandemic 2009 IAV infection in Koreans was similar to that in Europeans (p = 0.106). In addition, the prevalence of deaths among all positive cases with pandemic 2009 IAV infection in Koreans was significantly lower than that in Europeans. These results suggest that the IFITM3 genotype may not be a determinant of disease severity of IAV infection.","Kim, Yong-Chan; Jeong, Byung-Hoon",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000479087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28813716/,59

Sequencing of the 3' one-third of the MHV-1 genome demonstrated that the genetic organization of MHV-1 was similar to that of other strains of MHV. The hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein was truncated, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) studies confirmed previous work that suggested that the MHV-1 HE is a pseudogene. Targeted recombination was used to select chimeric viruses containing either the MHV-1 S gene or genes encoding all of the MHV-1 structural proteins, on an MHV-A59 background. Challenge studies in mice demonstrated that expression of the MHV-1 S gene within the MHV-A59 background (rA59/S(MHV-1)) increased the pneumovirulence of MHV-A59, and mice infected with this recombinant virus developed pulmonary lesions that were similar to those observed with MHV-1, although rA59/S(MHV-1) was significantly less virulent. Chimeras containing all of the MHV-1 structural genes on an MHV-A59 background were able to reproduce the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like pathology observed with MHV-1 and reproducibly increased pneumovirulence relative to rA59/S(MHV-1), but were still much less virulent than MHV-1. These data suggest that important determinants of pneumopathogenicity are contained within the 3' one-third of the MHV-1 genome, but additional important virulence factors must be encoded in the genome upstream of the S gene. The severity of the pulmonary lesions observed correlates better with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines than with viral replication in the lungs, suggesting that pulmonary disease has an important immunological component.","Leibowitz, Julian L; Srinivasa, Rajiv; Williamson, Shawn T; Chua, Ming Ming; Liu, Mingfeng; Wu, Samantha; Kang, Hyojeung; Ma, Xue-Zhong; Zhang, Jianhua; Shalev, Itay; Smith, Robert; Phillips, Melville J; Levy, Gary A; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00330-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20631137/,59

76067,Atmospheric Methane Oxidizers Are Dominated by Upland Soil Cluster Alpha in 20 Forest Soils of China.,2020-08-15,"INTRODUCTION Ecological studies show association between antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and inappropriate oral antibiotics use. Moderating antibiotic prescribing requires an understanding of all drivers of local prescribing. The aim was to quantify how much is determined by external factors compared to discretionary clinical choices. METHODS Oral antibiotic useage taken from England GP/FD practice prescribing data was aggregated using WHO/ATC defined daily doses (DDD). The Average Annual Antibiotic Daily Prescribing Rate (AAADPR) in each practice was the total DDD of oral antibiotics divided by registered population and 365. The AAADPR of English practices in 2017_18 was linked by regression to factors including demographics, geography, medical comorbidities, clinical performance, patient satisfaction, medical workforce characteristics and prescribing selection. The regression coefficients for modifiable prescribing selection factors were applied to the difference between the median and top decile practice values to establish overall reduction opportunities through changing prescribing behaviour. RESULTS 25 factors accounted for 58% of the AAADPR variation in 5,889 practices supporting 49.8 million patients. Non-modifiable factors linked increased AAADPR to more northerly location, higher prevalence of diabetes, COPD, CHD, and asthma; higher white ethnicity; higher patient satisfaction and lower population density. Modifiable behaviour accounted for 11% of the variation in AAADPR, with increases associated with a wider range of antibiotics, higher proportion taken as liquids, higher doses in each prescription, lower guideline compliance, lower targeted antibiotics, lower spend/dose, and less seasonal variation. If all practices achieved the level of modifiable factors of the top decile, this model suggests that overall AAADPR could reduce by 31% CONCLUSION: Such analysis is associative and does not infer causation. However, demographics, location, medical condition of the population, and prescribing selection are drivers of overall antibiotic prescribing. This analysis provides benchmarks for both non-modifiable and modifiable factors against which practices could evaluate their opportunities to reduce antibiotic prescribing.","Stedman, Michael; Lunt, Mark; Davies, Mark; Fulton-McAlister, Erin; Hussain, Abid; Staa, Tjeerd van; Anderson, Simon G; Heald, Adrian",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13515; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306458/,59
76498,Consistency and sealing of advanced bipolar tissue sealers.,2015,"Siraitia grosvenorii, an herbaceous perennial plant, native to the southern parts of China, is commonly used as a low-calorie natural sweetener. It contains cucurbitane-type triterpene glycosides known as mogrosides. The extract from monk fruit is about 300 times sweeter than sucrose. In spite of its immense importance and International demand, Siraitia grosvenorii (Swingle) is not commercially cultivated outside China since scientific information for cultivation of this species is lacking. Planting material of monk fruit plant was not available in India. Thus, the seeds of monk fruit were introduced in India from China after following International norms. Then the experiments were conducted on different aspects such as seed germination, morphological and anatomical characterization, phenology, flowering and pollination behaviors, and dynamic of mogroside-V accumulation in fruit. The hydropriming at 40 °C for 24 h was found effective to reduce the germination time and to increase the germination rate (77.33%). The multicellular uniseriate trichomes were observed in both the leaf surfaces, however, higher trichomes density was observed in the ventral surface of males compared to females. The microscopic view revealed that the ovary was trilocular (ovary consists three chambers) having two ovules in each chamber or locule. Most of the fruits were globose or oblong type with 5-7 cm in length and 4-7 cm diameter. Mogroside-V content in fruit at 80 days after pollination was 0.69% on dry weight basis. The rate of increase of mogroside-V accumulation from 50 to 70 days was very slow, whereas a sharp increase was observed from 70 to 80 days. The higher receptivity of stigma was observed with fully open flowers. The floral diagram and formula have also been developed for both male and female flowers. Our results highlighted that monk fruit can be grown in Indian conditions.","Shivani,; Thakur, Babit Kumar; Mallikarjun, C P; Mahajan, Mitali; Kapoor, Priya; Malhotra, Jigyasa; Dhiman, Rimpy; Kumar, Dinesh; Pal, Probir Kumar; Kumar, Sanjay",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85689-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737610/,59

Participants from the Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction study were categorized according to smoking status (current or previous smoking vs no history of smoking). The primary imaging outcome was cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-assessed IS of left ventricular mass (%) at 30 days. The primary clinical outcome was the rate of MACE at 30 days and 1 year, defined as the composite of death, reinfarction, new-onset heart failure, or rehospitalization. Of 447 patients enrolled in Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction, 271 (60.6%) were current or past smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers were almost 10 years younger and had a lower prevalence of clinical co-morbidities. Smokers had better procedural success and angiographic reperfusion compared with nonsmokers. At 30 days, there were no differences between smokers and nonsmokers in median IS (16.8% vs 17.4%, p = 0.67) or metrics of left ventricular function. By multivariable linear regression analysis, smoking was not significantly associated with IS at 30 days (beta coefficient: 0.83, p = 0.42). At 1 year, smokers had lower crude rates of MACE (7.6% vs 15%, p = 0.01). After multivariable adjustment, there were no significant differences in 1-year MACE between smokers and nonsmokers (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.33, p = 0.30). In conclusion, smoking history had no significant effect on IS at 30 days. Although current or previous smokers had lower rates of 1-year MACE than those with no history of smoking, adjustment for baseline characteristics rendered this association nonsignificant. These findings support the hypothesis that the smoker's paradox is largely attributable to differences in demographic and clinical baseline risk, rather than differences in IS after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.","Gennaro, Giustino; Brener, Sorin J; Redfors, Björn; Kirtane, Ajay J; Généreux, Philippe; Maehara, Akiko; Neunteufl, Thomas; Metzger, D Christopher; Mehran, Roxana; Gibson, C Michael; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27553094/,59

79162,"Antimicrobial resistance: the good, the bad, and the ugly.",2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The best time for administering anticoagulation therapy in acute cardioembolic stroke remains unclear. This prospective cohort study of patients with acute stroke and atrial fibrillation, evaluated (1) the risk of recurrent ischemic event and severe bleeding; (2) the risk factors for recurrence and bleeding; and (3) the risks of recurrence and bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy and its starting time after the acute stroke. METHODS The primary outcome of this multicenter study was the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack, symptomatic systemic embolism, symptomatic cerebral bleeding and major extracranial bleeding within 90 days from acute stroke. RESULTS Of the 1029 patients enrolled, 123 had 128 events (12.6%): 77 (7.6%) ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack or systemic embolism, 37 (3.6%) symptomatic cerebral bleeding, and 14 (1.4%) major extracranial bleeding. At 90 days, 50% of the patients were either deceased or disabled (modified Rankin score ≥3), and 10.9% were deceased. High CHA2DS2-VASc score, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, large ischemic lesion and type of anticoagulant were predictive factors for primary study outcome. At adjusted Cox regression analysis, initiating anticoagulants 4 to 14 days from stroke onset was associated with a significant reduction in primary study outcome, compared with initiating treatment before 4 or after 14 days: hazard ratio 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.30-0.93). About 7% of the patients treated with oral anticoagulants alone had an outcome event compared with 16.8% and 12.3% of the patients treated with low molecular weight heparins alone or followed by oral anticoagulants, respectively (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS Acute stroke in atrial fibrillation patients is associated with high rates of ischemic recurrence and major bleeding at 90 days. This study has observed that high CHA2DS2-VASc score, high National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, large ischemic lesions, and type of anticoagulant administered each independently led to a greater risk of recurrence and bleedings. Also, data showed that the best time for initiating anticoagulation treatment for secondary stroke prevention is 4 to 14 days from stroke onset. Moreover, patients treated with oral anticoagulants alone had better outcomes compared with patients treated with low molecular weight heparins alone or before oral anticoagulants.","Paciaroni, Maurizio; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Falocci, Nicola; Caso, Valeria; Becattini, Cecilia; Marcheselli, Simona; Rueckert, Christina; Pezzini, Alessandro; Poli, Loris; Padovani, Alessandro; Csiba, Laszló; Szabó, Lilla; Sohn, Sung-Il; Tassinari, Tiziana; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Michel, Patrik; Cordier, Maria; Vanacker, Peter; Remillard, Suzette; Alberti, Andrea; Venti, Michele; Scoditti, Umberto; Denti, Licia; Orlandi, Giovanni; Chiti, Alberto; Gialdini, Gino; Bovi, Paolo; Carletti, Monica; Rigatelli, Alberto; Putaala, Jukka; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Masotti, Luca; Lorenzini, Gianni; Tassi, Rossana; Guideri, Francesca; Martini, Giuseppe; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Vadikolias, Kostantinos; Liantinioti, Chrissoula; Corea, Francesco; Del Sette, Massimo; Ageno, Walter; De Lodovici, Maria Luisa; Bono, Giorgio; Baldi, Antonio; D'Anna, Sebastiano; Sacco, Simona; Carolei, Antonio; Tiseo, Cindy; Acciarresi, Monica; D'Amore, Cataldo; Imberti, Davide; Zabzuni, Dorjan; Doronin, Boris; Volodina, Vera; Consoli, Domenico; Galati, Franco; Pieroni, Alessio; Toni, Danilo; Monaco, Serena; Baronello, Mario Maimone; Barlinn, Kristian; Pallesen, Lars-Peder; Kepplinger, Jessica; Bodechtel, Ulf; Gerber, Johannes; Deleu, Dirk; Melikyan, Gayane; Ibrahim, Faisal; Akhtar, Naveed; Mosconi, Maria Giulia; Bubba, Valentina; Silvestri, Ilenia; Lees, Kennedy R",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.008891; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26130094/,59

MERS-CoV strains from early epidemic clade A and contemporary epidemic clade B have not been phenotypically characterized to compare their ability to infect cells and mice. We isolated the clade B MERS-CoV ChinaGD01 strain from a patient infected during the South Korean MERS outbreak in 2015 and compared the phylogenetics and pathogenicity of MERS-CoV EMC/2012 (clade A) and ChinaGD01 (clade B) in vitro and in vivo Genome alignment analysis showed that most of clade-specific mutations occurred in the orf1ab gene, included mutations that were predicted to be potential glycosylation sites. Minor differences in viral growth but no significant differences in plaque-size and sensitivity to IFN-β were detected between these two viruses in vitro ChinaGD01 virus infection induced more weight loss and inflammatory cytokine production in human DPP4 transduced mice. Viral titers were higher in the lungs of ChinaGD01 infected mice as compared to EMC/2012 infection. Decreased virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells numbers were detected in the lungs of ChinaGD01 infected mice. Together, MERS-CoV evolution induced changes to reshape its pathogenicity and virulence in vitro and in vivo and to evade adaptive immune response to hinder viral clearance.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV is an important emerging pathogen and causes severe respiratory infection in humans. MERS-CoV strains from early epidemic clade A and contemporary epidemic clade B have not been phenotypically characterized to compare their ability to infect cells and mice. Here, we showed that a clade B virus ChinaGD01 strain caused more severe disease in mice with delayed viral clearance, increased inflammatory cytokines and decreased anti-viral T cells responses compared to the early clade A virus EMC/2012. Given the differences in pathogenicity of different clades of MERS-CoV, periodic assessment of currently circulating MERS-CoV is needed to monitor potential severity of zoonotic disease.","Wang, Yanqun; Sun, Jing; Li, Xiaobo; Zhu, Airu; Guan, Wenda; Sun, De-Qiang; Gan, Mian; Niu, Xuefeng; Dai, Jun; Zhang, Lu; Zhang, Zhaoyong; Shi, Yongxia; Huang, Shuxiang; Mok, Chris Ka Pun; Yang, Zifeng; Wang, Zhongfang; Tan, Wenjie; Li, Yimin; Chen, Ling; Chen, Rongchang; Peiris, Malik; Zhong, Nanshan; Zhao, Jingxian; Huang, Jicheng; Zhao, Jincun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00861-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434886/,59
80897,Novel coronavirus: Australian GPs raise concerns about shortage of face masks.,2020-02-05,"Importance Data on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are needed. Objective To determine whether hydroxychloroquine is an efficacious treatment for adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted at 34 hospitals in the US. Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were enrolled between April 2 and June 19, 2020, with the last outcome assessment on July 17, 2020. The planned sample size was 510 patients, with interim analyses planned after every 102 patients were enrolled. The trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients. Interventions Patients were randomly assigned to hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses) (n = 242) or placebo (n = 237). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization as assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged from the hospital and able to perform normal activities). The primary outcome was analyzed with a multivariable proportional odds model, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) greater than 1.0 indicating more favorable outcomes with hydroxychloroquine than placebo. The trial included 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality. Results Among 479 patients who were randomized (median age, 57 years; 44.3% female; 37.2% Hispanic/Latinx; 23.4% Black; 20.1% in the intensive care unit; 46.8% receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure; 11.5% receiving noninvasive ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen; and 6.7% receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 433 (90.4%) completed the primary outcome assessment at 14 days and the remainder had clinical status imputed. The median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7 days). Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (median [IQR] score, 6 [4-7] vs 6 [4-7]; aOR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.42]). None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups. At 28 days after randomization, 25 of 241 patients (10.4%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and 25 of 236 (10.6%) in the placebo group had died (absolute difference, -0.2% [95% CI, -5.7% to 5.3%]; aOR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.54 to 2.09]). Conclusions and Relevance Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, compared with placebo, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14. These findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.

We sought to describe the radiographic and CT findings of severe adenovirus community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in eight immunocompetent adults. METHODS We reviewed systematically chest imaging manifestations of laboratory-confirmed severe adenovirus pneumonia in eight immunocompetent adults from April 2012 to April 2014. RESULTS All patients showed abnormal results on initial chest radiograph and CT, with the exception of one normal initial chest radiograph. The abnormalities of the initial chest radiographs were unilateral (n=4) or bilateral (n=3), including consolidation (n=4), dense patchy opacity (n=3), ground glass opacity (GGO) (n=1), and pleural effusion (n=1). The initial CT findings consisted of unilateral (n=5) and bilateral (n=3) abnormalities, including consolidation (n=8), GGO (n=2), pleural effusion (n=3) and small nodules (n=1). Focal consolidation was the predominant finding in six patients whose initial CT scans were examined within one week after illness onset. Follow-up radiologic findings showed rapid development of bilateral consolidation within ten days after illness onset, usually accompanied by adjacent ground-glass opacity and pleural effusion. The parenchymal abnormalities began to absorb around two weeks after illness onset, with no appearances of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS Severe adenovirus CAP in immunocompetent adults mainly appears as focal consolidation followed by rapid progression to bilateral consolidation, usually accompanied by adjacent GGO and pleural effusion, which may resemble bacterial pneumonia. Adenovirus should be considered in severe pneumonia cases with negative cultures and failure to respond to antibiotics.","Tan, Dingyu; Fu, Yangyang; Xu, Jun; Wang, Zhiwei; Cao, Jian; Walline, Joseph; Zhu, Huadong; Yu, Xuezhong",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2016.03.38; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27162658/,59

In cancer, CAIX expression is associated with tumor hypoxia. CAIX is also overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma and is a molecular target for the therapeutic antibody cG250 (girentuximab). Radionuclide imaging of CAIX expression might be used for identification of patients who may benefit from cG250 therapy and from treatment strategies for hypoxic tumors. Affibody molecules are small (7 kDa) scaffold proteins having a high potential as probes for radionuclide molecular imaging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate feasibility of in vivo imaging of CAIX-expression using radiolabeled Affibody molecules. A histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate (HE)3-tag-containing CAIX-binding Affibody molecule (HE)3-ZCAIX:1 was labeled with [(99m)Tc(CO)3](+). Its binding properties were evaluated in vitro using CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 renal carcinoma cells. (99m)Tc-(HE)3-ZCAIX:1 was evaluated in NMRI nu/nu mice bearing SK-RC-52 xenografts. The in vivo specificity test confirmed CAIX-mediated tumor targeting. (99m)Tc-(HE)3-ZCAIX:1 cleared rapidly from blood and normal tissues except for kidneys. At optimal time-point (4 h p.i.), the tumor uptake was 9.7 ± 0.7% ID/g, and tumor-to-blood ratio was 53 ± 10. Experimental imaging of CAIX-expressing SK-RC-52 xenografts at 4 h p.i. provided high contrast images. The use of radioiodine label for ZCAIX:1 enabled the reduction of renal uptake, but resulted in significantly lower tumor uptake and tumor-to-blood ratio. Results of the present study suggest that radiolabeled Affibody molecules are promising probes for imaging of CAIX-expression in vivo.","Honarvar, Hadis; Garousi, Javad; Gunneriusson, Elin; Höidén-Guthenberg, Ingmarie; Altai, Mohamed; Widström, Charles; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Frejd, Fredrik Y",International journal of oncology,https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.2014.2782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25434612/,59

Here, in this work, we pave a new way to achieve this through the use of a smart thermogalvanic hydrogel film, in which the ions and water undergo two separate thermodynamic cycles: thermogalvanic reaction and water-to-vapor phase transition. When the hydrogel is attached to a heat source, it can achieve efficient evaporative cooling while simultaneously converting a portion of the waste heat into electricity. Moreover, the hydrogel can absorb water from the surrounding air to regenerate its water content later on. This reversibility can be finely designed. As an applicative demonstration, the hydrogel film with a thickness of 2 mm was attached to a cell phone battery while operating. It successfully decreased the temperature of the battery by 20 °C and retrieved electricity of 5 μW at the discharging rate of 2.2 C.","Pu, Shirui; Liao, Yutian; Chen, Kyle; Fu, Jia; Zhang, Songlin; Ge, Lurong; Conta, Giorgio; Bouzarif, Sofia; Cheng, Ting; Hu, Xuejiao; Liu, Kang; Chen, Jun",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c00800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32319296/,59

Despite the numerous examples where payers and providers have attempted to independently address SDoH, there is limited evidence for the success of these interventions. Since most stakeholders individually do not have access to financial and clinical data, identifying an ROI for SDoH interventions is logistically challenging, but even when these data are available, stakeholders may not want to share their learnings due to negative findings and/or unwillingness to share proprietary information. These issues are further amplified by the effects of COVID-19 and its worsening effect on widening health disparities, but many payers and providers have risen to the challenge together. This article advocates for the importance of payer-provider partnerships to address SDoH and uses examples of integrated delivery and finance systems as case studies of how these partnerships could function.

84300,From Editor's desk.,2020,"PURPOSE The saline-filled endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff can be easily identified under cervical ultrasound and can serve as an ideal puncture target during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT). The authors present their initial experience with this novel technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 38 consecutive critically ill patients who underwent saline-filled cuff puncture PDT between October 2016 and December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The saline-filled ETT cuff was easily identified using ultrasound. Ultrasound-guided puncture into the cuff, followed by an inward-push of the ETT through the tube exchanger, facilitated accurate passage of the guidewire through the needle tip into the tracheal lumen. RESULTS Of 38 consecutive procedures, 37 (97.4%) were performed successfully, with only one converted to surgical tracheostomy due to guidewire displacement. The median procedure time was 8 min. There were no complications, such as accidental extubation, major bleeding, or posterior tracheal wall laceration or pneumothorax, and no procedure-related mortalities. CONCLUSIONS PDT performed using a saline-filled cuff as the ultrasound-guided puncture target and an endotracheal tube exchanger is feasible, and appeared to be easier to perform than standard PDT. Larger studies are required to confirm the safety and benefits of this technique.","Lin, Chien-Hung; Yang, Shun-Mao; Chiang, Xu-Heng; Chuang, Jen-Hao; Ko, Huan-Jang; Huang, Pei-Ming",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2018.08.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30176526/,59

But this acknowledgment must go further: infants are not simply small adolescents. As data for pediatric mechanical ventilation, in general, and the management for pediatric acute lung injury, more specifically, are very limited, the pediatric critical care clinician must closely assess the available adult data and evaluate its application for infants and children. Given the hurdles in studying pediatric acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, clinicians involved with the care of critically ill infants and children are left with extrapolation of data from the neonatal and adult populations, reliance on the limited available pediatric data, careful assessment of the applicable physiologic and pathophysiologic principles, and/or reliance on their own experience and their colleagues' experience. Hopefully, with the collaboration of multicenter investigator networks, additional and definitive pediatric data may be on the horizon. In the meantime, sharing data between adult and pediatric populations seems to be an essential approach to the management of critically ill patients.","Cheifetz, Ira M",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21944680/,59

However, less is known about its impact on vulnerable populations, such as veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. Data were analyzed from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative cohort of U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) were examined in veterans with pre-existing psychiatric conditions. 19.2% of veterans screened positive for SI peri-pandemic. Relative to veterans without SI, they had lower income, were more likely to have been infected with COVID-19, reported greater COVID-19-related financial and social restriction stress, and increases in psychiatric symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. A multivariable analysis revealed that older age, greater pre-pandemic psychiatric symptom severity, past-year SI, lifetime suicide attempt, psychosocial difficulties, COVID-19 infection, and past-year increase in psychiatric symptom severity were linked to peri-pandemic SI, while pre-pandemic higher income and purpose in life were protective. Among veterans who were infected with COVID-19, those aged 45 or older and who reported lower purpose in life were more likely to endorse SI. Monitoring for suicide risk and worsening psychiatric symptoms in older veterans who have been infected with COVID-19 may be important.

84910,Authors' response.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is an essential tool for physicians to guide treatment decisions in both hospital and prehospital settings. Despite the potential patient care and system utilization benefits of prehospital ultrasound, the financial burden of a ""hands-on"" training program for large numbers of paramedics remains a barrier to implementation. In this study, we conducted a prospective, observational, double-blinded study comparing paramedics to emergency physicians in their ability to generate usable abdominal ultrasound images after a 1-hour didactic training session. METHODS Canadian aeromedical critical care paramedics were compared against emergency medicine physicians in their ability to generate adequate abdominal ultrasound images on five healthy volunteers. Quality of each scan was evaluated by a trained expert in POCUS who was blinded to the identity of the participant using a 5-point Likert scale and using the standardized QUICk Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) assessment tool. RESULTS Fourteen Critical care paramedics and four emergency department (ED) physicians were voluntarily recruited. Of paramedics, 57% had never used ultrasound before, 36% has used ultrasound without formal training, and 7% had previous training. Physicians had a higher proportion of usable scans compared with paramedics (100% v. 61.4%, Δ38.6%; 95% confidence interval, 19.3-50.28). CONCLUSIONS Paramedics were not able to produce images of interpretable quality at the same frequency when compared with emergency medicine physicians. However, a 61.4% usable image rate for paramedics following a short 1-hour didactic training session is promising for future studies, which could incorporate a short hands-on tutorial while remaining cost-effective.","Waterman, Bradley; Van Aarsen, Kristine; Lewell, Michael; Myslik, Frank; Peddle, Michael; Doran, Sean",CJEM,https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2020.29; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084552/,59

This is the first systematic review to provide a comprehensive overview of 3DP for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) planning and intervention, evaluating the readiness of current levels of technology for mainstream implementation. METHODS A systematic literature search of PubMed and MEDLINE was performed as per PRISMA guidelines using the terms '3D Printing', 'AAA' OR 'EVAR' and related index terms, and further relevant articles were appraised via a snowballing approach. Our last search was conducted on 14 November 2020. RESULTS Twenty-five articles were identified for critical analysis, with 14 cases or technical reports. Nineteen publications utilized 3DP AAA phantoms to aid presurgical decision making, device selection and design. Four publications explored the utility of 3DP phantoms as EVAR trainers, and one publication examined the technology as a tool for patient education. Flexible, transparent phantoms were deemed most useful; however, the cost and availability of higher end machines limited accessibility. CONCLUSION 3DP phantoms have been used in EVAR to facilitate visualization of complex patient anatomy, appropriate device selection, in predicting navigational difficulties and the shape and position of endograft after deployment. These phantoms show promise in reducing known complications such as endoleak, stent graft occlusion and migration; however, larger scale prospective studies are required to validate its impacts on patient outcomes and cost savings to the healthcare system.","Coles-Black, Jasamine; Bolton, Damien; Robinson, Domenic; Chuen, Jason",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33825293/,59

METHODS The medical records of patients who received LS TAPP inguinal hernia repair between 2009 and 2012 at our institution were reviewed. Patients were included if the received LS TAPP with either no mesh fixation, mesh fixation with NBCA only, fixation with ST only, or fixation with NBCA + ST. Outcome measures were operation time, postoperative length of stay, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score 24 h after surgery, postoperative complications, and hernia recurrence. RESULTS A total of 1,027 TAPP cases were included. In 552 cases, meshes were fixed with NBCA only, in 89 cases only ST were used, in 47 cases ST and NBCA were used, and in 339 cases meshes were not fixed. The groups were comparable with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics. No surgical complications occurred in any group. VAS pain scores were significantly lower in the nonfixation and NBCA only groups (1.4 ± 0.6 and 1.3 ± 0.6, respectively) than in the ST and NBCA + ST groups (2.2 ± 0.9 and 2.2 ± 0.7, respectively; P = 0.001). The mean follow-up duration was ~19 months. At the final follow-up, no wound infections or hernia recurrences had occurred in any of the groups. No occurrence of chronic pain was noted in the nonfixation and NBCA only groups, whereas two cases (2.2%) were noted in the ST group and one case (2.1%) in the NBCA + ST group (P = 0.005).

However, beyond remotely-triggered therapies that require advanced infrastructures and optimization, new combination therapies based on internally triggered cell-killing effects have also demonstrated promising therapeutic profiles. In this revision, we focus on self-triggered strategies able to improve the therapeutic effect of drug delivery nanosystems. As reviewed, ferroptosis, hypoxia, and immunotherapy show potency enough to treat satisfactorily tumors in vivo. However, the interest of combining those with chemotherapeutics, especially with carriers based on mesoporous silica, has provided a new generation of therapeutic nanomedicines with potential enough to achieve complete tumor remission in murine models.

87824,Crystalline defects in bulk metallic glasses: consequences on fracture toughness determination and ductility.,2020-07-29,"BACKGROUND Health educators and advocacy groups often use side-by-side visual images to communicate about equity and to distinguish it from equality. Despite the near-ubiquity of these images, little is known about how they are understood by different audiences. AIMS To assess the effectiveness of an image commonly used to communicate about health equity. METHOD In 167 interviews with health stakeholders in Greater Cleveland, Ohio, in 2018 to 2019, a commonly used health equity image was shown to participants, who were asked to interpret its meaning. Interviewees included 21 health professionals, 21 clinicians, 22 metro-wide decision makers, 24 community leaders, and 79 community members. RESULTS About two thirds of our socioeconomically, racial/ethnically, educationally, and professionally diverse sample said the equity image helped clarify the distinction between ""equality"" and ""equity."" Yet less than one third offered an interpretation consistent with the image's goals of foregrounding not only injustice but also a need for systemic change. Patterns of misinterpretation were especially common among two groups: ideological conservatives and those of lower socioeconomic status. Conservatives were most likely to object to the image's message. CONCLUSIONS Equity images are widely used by public health educators and advocates, yet they do not consistently communicate the message that achieving equity requires systemic change. In this moment of both public health crisis and urgent concern about systemic racism, new visual tools for communicating this crucial message are needed.","Willen, Sarah S; Walsh, Colleen C; Williamson, Abigail Fisher",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090198121994520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739205/,59

88213,The big picture.,2017,"PURPOSE This study analyzed the current status of face mask usage. It also identified factors related to the knowledge and behavior regarding the same among older adults living alone during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This descriptive study was conducted via a telephone survey involving 283 older adults living alone in S City from March to April 2020. Knowledge and behavior pertaining to face mask usage were measured using Hilda Ho's Face Mask Use Scale; reliability of the measurement was Kuder-Richardson formula-20 = .62, Cronbach's α = .92. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, independent t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression. RESULTS Older adults used one mask for 3.55 days on an average. The knowledge level was 9.97 (± 1.84) out of 12 and behavior level was 15.49 (± 1.55) out of 16. Level of education (β = - .31, p < .001), living region (β = .13, p = .017), personal income (β = .12, p = .041) significantly affected the face mask usage-related knowledge, and living region (β = .15, p = .010) significantly affected the face mask usage-related behavior. CONCLUSION Older adults living alone are aware of the effects of using face masks. However, their mask usage is inappropriate, for example, the prolonged use of the same mask. Considering the low level of face mask usage-related knowledge, it is necessary to develop customized education programs and infectious disease prevention strategies for older adults possessing low educational levels living alone in urban-rural complex areas.","Han, A Reum; Park, Yeon Hwan",Journal of Korean Academy of Nursing,https://doi.org/10.4040/jkan.20252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993126/,59

METHODS we submitted eight adult dogs to femoral vein reconstruction, on the left with BP tubular graft and on the right with autologous vein. In the postoperative period, the animals underwent clinical evaluation and femoral vein Doppler flowmetry. After 360 days, we reoperated the dogs and submitted them to femoral vein phlebography with iodinated contrast. We removed the segments of the femoral veins containing the grafts and sent them for histopathological evaluation. RESULTS the dogs did not present hemorrhage, hematoma, surgical wound infection or operated limb edema. One animal had superficial venous dilatation in the left inguinal region. Phlebography performed 360 days after the first surgery showed that three (37.5%) BP grafts and seven (87.5%) grafts from the control group (C) were patent. In the histopathological evaluation, we found an inflammatory reaction, with neutrophils and lymphocytes on the external surface of both groups. In the intimal layer of the grafts and in the outer layer in the two groups, we observed fibrosis. CONCLUSION based on the results obtained with the experimental model used, BP presents potential to be used as a tubular graft for venous revascularization. However, new research must be performed to confirm its efficacy in the revascularization of medium and large diameter veins, which could allow its use in clinical practice.","Silva, Daniella Maria Souza; Lins, Esdras Marques; Marques, Sílvio Romero Barros; Albuquerque, Amanda Vasconcelos; Aguiar, José Lamartine Andrade",Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,https://doi.org/10.1590/0100-6991e-20181837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30088524/,59

This study also explores the possible laboratory characteristics used for prognostication in patients with NSCLC and COVID-19. Additionally, this study evaluated potential differences in laboratory values between the case and control groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS This is a single-center retrospective cohort study conducted in Dharmais National Cancer Hospital, Indonesia, enrolling patients with NSCLC undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapy between May 2020 and January 2021. All patients with NSCLC and COVID-19 in these periods were enrolled into the case group. The control group was age-matched NSCLC patients without COVID-19 that was derived from the NSCLC cohort through randomization. RESULTS There were 342 patients with NSCLC between May 2020 and January 2021. Twenty-seven (7.9%) of the patients were infected by COVID-19. To facilitate comparison, thirty-five age-matched controls with NSCLC were selected from the cohort. The mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 was 46.2%. Eleven patients (40.7%) had severe COVID-19, of which none survived. NLR >8.35 has a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 92.9%, LR+ of 12, and LR- of 0.18.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The 443 employees of Krasmash JSC, who have been working under conditions of increased noise for at least 1 year, were surveyed and examined. A hearing study was performed by speech and tonal audiometry. Tonal audiometry was carried out in accord with according to a standard method in the frequency range 125-8000 Hz. People with chronic hearing impairment, survivors of meningitis and family history of hearing impairment were excluded from the study. The allelic composition of the studied genes was determined in the remaining group of 288 workers (study group). Polymorphisms were detected using bioluminescent method, developed by the authors earlier. The study group comprised 122 people with hearing impairment (experimental group) and 166 people without impairment (control group). RESULTS The genotyping results of on allelic variants rs494024 (CAT), rs7598759 (NCL), rs2227956 (HSPA1L), rs7095441 (PCDH15) and rs7785846 (PON2) showed that their frequencies in the study group did not differ and were comparable with those for the European population. No statistically significant differences were revealed in the distribution of the genotypes of the studied mutations between the experimental and control groups. Also no statistically significant associations we found between hearing impairment and availability of two or several SNPs, or these SNPs and clinical characteristics of the disease (degree of hearing impairment, tinnitus). In the group of workers with an experience of 5 to 16 years, an association was found for hearing impairment and SNP rs494024, as well as when it is combined with rs7598759.

ACE2 functions as a carboxymonopeptidase hydrolyzing the cleavage of a single C-terminal residue from Angiotensin-II (Ang-II), the key peptide hormone of RAS, to form Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), which binds to the G-protein-coupled Mas receptor and activates signaling pathways that counteract the pathways activated by Ang-II. ACE2 is expressed in a variety of tissues and overwhelming evidence substantiates the beneficial effects of enhancing ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis under many pathological conditions in these tissues in experimental models. This review will provide a succinct overview on current strategies to enhance ACE2 as therapeutic agent, and discuss limitations and future challenges. ACE2 also has other functions, such as acting as a co-factor for amino acid transport and being exploited by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) as cellular entry receptor, the implications of these functions in development of ACE2-based therapeutics will also be discussed.","Li, Qiuhong; Grant, Maria B; Richards, Elaine M; Raizada, Mohan K",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33063820/,59
90808,In this issue.,2014,"OBJECTIVE Various different surgical methods are used for obesity surgery. Among them, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic gastric plication (LGP) have been both successfully performed in recent years. In this study, we compared the treatment results of patients who underwent LGP, a method that was introduced later consisting of plication of gastric greater curvature to achieve volume reduction, with results of patients who underwent LSG. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed data on morbid obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery with either LSG or LPG in Konya Beyhekim Hospital between 2009 and 2012. Demographic features including age and sex, preoperative blood biochemistry, body mass index (BMI) before and after operation, duration of hospital stay, morbidity, mortality and complications were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-five patients who were operated for obesity between 2009 and 2012 were included in the study. 29 patients underwent LGP, and 26 patients LSG. The BMI in the LGP and LSG groups was 41.4±3 kg/m(2) and 42.0±3.1 kg/m(2), respectively. There was no significant difference between two groups in terms of BMI. Two groups were also similar in terms of age and gender. In the LGP group, one patient had postoperative necrosis of the suture line. One patient in the LSG group was re-operated due to bleeding. Another patient in this group had leakage at the suture line. Postoperative BMI assessment of groups revealed significantly lower BMI levels in the LSG group. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the LGP group. There was no significant difference in complication rates between two groups. CONCLUSION In this study, we obtained similar results in patients who were treated with LGP or LSG. Moreover, LSG was more efficient in decreasing BMI in morbid obesity surgery when compared to LGP. However, duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter in LGP group. We concluded that both methods could be effectively and safely used in the surgical management of morbid obesity.","Toprak, Şükrü Salih; Gültekin, Yücel; Okuş, Ahmet",Ulusal cerrahi dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5152/ucd.2015.2991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26985155/,59

BACKGROUND Since inception in 2011, there has been an exponential increase in the number of TAVR centers across the world. Multiple studies have questioned if a relationship exists between institutional TAVR volume and patient outcomes. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search for relevant articles using a combination of free text terms in the title/abstract related to volume, TAVR, and patient outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened all titles/abstracts for eligibility based on pre-specified criteria. All-cause mortality data was pooled from eligible studies and centers were categorized as low-(30-50 cases), intermediate-, or high-volume (75-130 cases) based on their annual TAVR volumes. RESULTS Our search yielded an initial list of 11,153 citations, 120 full text studies were reviewed and 7 studies met all inclusion and exclusion criteria, yielding a total of 1,93,498 TAVRs. Categorized according to center's annual volume; 25,062 TAVRs were performed in low-, 77,093 in intermediate- and 91,343 in high-volume centers. Network meta-analysis showed a relative reduction in mortality rates of 37%, 23% and 19%, for high volume versus low volume centers, high volume versus intermediate volume centers and intermediate versus low volume centers, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Existing research clearly shows an inverse relationship between annual TAVR procedural volume and all-cause mortality. We need to focus on development of strong referral networks and consolidation rather than expansion of existing TAVR centers to improve patient outcomes, while ensuring adequate access-to-care.","Kir, Devika; Shapero, Kayle; Chatterjee, Saurav; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Oddleifson, August; Spatz, Erica S; Goldsweig, Andrew M; Desai, Nihar R",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.29502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565695/,59

Due to this, medical practitioners in recipient countries may be facing a broader spectrum of conditions and unusual presentations not previously encountered, including a wide range of infections with pulmonary involvement. Tuberculosis is known to be more common in migrants and has been covered broadly in other publications. The scope of this review was to provide an overview of exotic infections with pulmonary involvement that could be encountered in refugees and migrants and to briefly describe their epidemiology, diagnosis, and management. As refugees and migrants travel from numerous countries and continents, it is important to be aware of the various organisms that might cause disease according to the country of origin. Some of these diseases are very rare and geographically restricted to certain regions, while others have a more cosmopolitan distribution. Also, the spectrum of severity of these infections can vary from very benign to severe and even life-threatening. We will also describe infectious and noninfectious complications that can be associated with HIV infection as some migrants might originate from high HIV prevalence countries in sub-Saharan Africa. As the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases can be challenging in certain situations, patients with suspected infection might require referral to specialized centers with experience in their management. Additionally, a brief description of noncommunicable pulmonary diseases will be provided.","Olaru, Ioana D; Van Den Broucke, Steven; Rosser, Andrew J; Salzer, Helmut J F; Woltmann, Gerrit; Bottieau, Emmanuel; Lange, Christoph",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000486451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29414830/,59
91185,Not Just Bystanders: A Qualitative Study on the Vicarious Effects of Surgical Training on the Wellness of Support Persons for Trainees.,2021-04-07,"BACKGROUND Healthcare systems are overloaded and changing. In response to growing demands on the healthcare systems, new models of healthcare delivery are emerging. Community paramedicine is a novel approach in which paramedics use their knowledge and skills beyond emergency health response to contribute to preventative and rehabilitative health. In our systematic review, we aimed to identify evidence of the community paramedicine role in care delivery for elderly patients, with an additional focus on palliative care, and the possible impact of this role on the wider healthcare system. METHODS A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Sciences was undertaken to identify relevant full-text articles in English published until October 3, 2019. Additional inclusion criteria were studies focussing on extended care paramedics or community paramedics caring for elderly patients. Case studies were excluded. All papers were screened by at least two authors and underwent a quality assessment, using the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal checklists for cross sectional, qualitative, cohort, and randomised controlled trial studies to assess the methodological quality of the articles. A process of narrative synthesis was used to summarise the data. RESULTS Ten studies, across 13 articles, provided clear evidence that Community Paramedic programs had a positive impact on the health of patients and on the wider healthcare system. The role of a Community Paramedic was often a combination of four aspects: assessment, referral, education and communication. Limited evidence was available on the involvement of Community Paramedics in palliative and end-of-life care and in care delivery in residential aged care facilities. Observed challenges were a lack of additional training, and the need for proper integration and understanding of their role in the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS The use of community paramedics in care delivery could be beneficial to both patients' health and the wider healthcare system. They already play a promising role in improving the care of our elderly population. With consistent adherence to the training curriculum and effective integration within the wider healthcare system, community paramedics have the potential to take on specialised roles in residential aged care facilities and palliative and end-of-life care.","van Vuuren, Julia; Thomas, Brodie; Agarwal, Gina; MacDermott, Sean; Kinsman, Leigh; O'Meara, Peter; Spelten, Evelien",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-06037-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33407406/,59

The yeast is concerning for multiple reasons, primarily: (1) challenges with accurate identification; (2) reported multi-drug resistance; (3) published mortality rates of 30 - 60%; and (4) persistence in the environment associated with human transmission. We report the emergence of a healthcare-associated cluster in the Greater Vancouver area in 2018 and describe the measures implemented to contain its transmission. METHODS Cases were identified through passive and ring surveillance of affected wards. Positive isolates were sent to provincial and national reference laboratories for confirmation and genomic characterization. Extensive infection control measures were implemented immediately after the initial case was identified. RESULTS Four cases were identified during the outbreak. In a 4 month period, over 700 swabs were collected in order to screen 180 contacts. Whole genome sequencing concluded that all isolates clustered together and belonged to the South Asian clade. No isolates harbored FKS gene mutations associated with resistance to echinocandins. Infection control measures, including surveillance, education, cleaning/disinfection, patient cohorting, isolation, and hand hygiene, effectively contained the outbreak; it was declared over within 2 months. CONCLUSIONS The spread of C. auris in healthcare facilities has not spared Canadian institutions. Our experience demonstrates that strict infection control measures combined with microbiological screening can effectively halt transmission in healthcare centres.

91666,X-ray-Induced Acoustic Computed Tomography (XACT): Initial Experiment on Bone Sample.,2020-10-21,"INTRODUCTION Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary eye tumour in adults. Distant metastases are seen in 50% of cases regardless of treatment, which contributes to high mortality rates. Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is a protein regulator of mitotic entry and cytokinesis. Increased PLK-1 expression has been shown in different tumours, which makes its inhibition a potential treatment target. To date, no study has been published to discuss the prognostic role of PLK-1 expression in patients with uveal melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS . We assessed by immunohistochemistry PLK-1 expression in uveal melanoma cells collected in 158 patients treated by primary enucleation. We determined the correlation between PLK-1 levels evaluated by the immunoreactivity scale (IRS) method and detailed clinical as well as histological parameters. Additionally, we determined the association between PLK-1 expression levels and long-term prognosis. RESULTS Elevated PLK-1 expression in tumour cells, defined as IRS >2, was observed in 70% (111/158) of cases, whereas low expression or no expression was seen in the remaining 30% (47/158) of patients. There was a significant correlation between low PLK-1 expression and a higher clinical tumour stage (pT, p = 0.04) as well as a higher AJCC prognostic stage group (p = 0.037). We observed an inverse correlation between PLK-1 expression and tumour cell pigment content (p = 0.0019). There was no correlation between PLK-1 expression and other histological parameters such as mitotic rate or histological subtype. The Kaplan-Meier's analysis demonstrated that low PLK-1 expression was associated with significantly reduced overall survival (p = 0.0058). A similar trend, albeit not significant, was observed for disease-free survival (p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS . Downregulated PLK-1 expression is a negative prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. It warrants further, multicentre research on prognostic role of PLK-1 expression and possibility of PLK-1 inhibition in uveal melanoma.","Berus, Tomasz; Markiewicz, Anna; Zwierzchowska, Katarzyna; Biecek, Przemyslaw; Orlowska-Heitzman, Jolanta; Romanowska-Dixon, Bozena; Donizy, Piotr",Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,https://doi.org/10.5603/fhc.a2020.0017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602935/,59

In this article, we analyse the Spanish law regulating euthanasia and PAS, comparing it with the rest of the European laws on euthanasia and PAS (Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg). Identified strengths of the Spanish law, with respect to other norms, are that it is a law with many safeguards, which broadly recognises professionals' right to conscientious objection and the specification that it makes on the prior comprehensive care of the patient, including the approach to care dependency. Regarding its shortcomings, the law does not differentiate well between euthanasia and PAS; it barely assigns a role to the healthcare team as a whole (similar to other regulations); it does not clarify the functions of the different professionals involved; it does not detail the specific composition and duration of theevaluation commission; it has not been accompanied by a prior or simultaneous regulation of palliative care; and, lastly, the period of time to implement the law is too short.","Velasco Sanz, Tamara Raquel; Pinto Pastor, Pilar; Moreno-Milán, Beatriz; Mower Hanlon, Lydia Frances; Herreros, Benjamin",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34330794/,59

DESIGN Systematic review. POPULATION Adults (aged 18 years and over) with intellectual disabilities. INTERVENTION Deinstitutionalisation, that is, the move from institutional to community settings. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES Studies were eligible if evaluating within any cost-consequence framework (eg, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis) or resource use typically considered to fall within the societal viewpoint (eg, cost to payers, service-users, families and informal care costs). SEARCH We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EconLit, Embase and Scopus to September 2017 and supplemented this with grey literature searches and handsearching of the references of the eligible studies. We assessed study quality using the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme suite of tools, excluding those judged to be of poor methodological quality. RESULTS Two studies were included; both were cohort studies from the payer perspective of people leaving long-stay National Health Service hospitals in the UK between 1984 and 1992. One study found that deinstitutionalisation reduced costs, one study found an increase in costs. CONCLUSION A wide-ranging literature review found limited evidence on costs associated with deinstitutionalisation for people with intellectual disabilities. From two studies included in the review, the results were conflicting. Significant gaps in the evidence base were observable, particularly with respect to priority populations in contemporary policy: older people with intellectual disabilities and serious medical illness, and younger people with very complex needs and challenging behaviours.

However, little systematic research has been carried out to assess the mental health needs of FLWs in Europe, or the extent of psychological suffering in FLWs within different European countries of varying outbreak severity. Accordingly, this project will employ a mixed-methods approach over three work packages to develop best-practice guidelines for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs during the different phases of the pandemic. Work package 1 will identify the point and long-term prevalence of psychological distress symptoms in a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs, and the predictors of these symptoms. Work package 2 will perform a qualitative needs assessment on a sample of Irish and Italian FLWs to identify sources of stress and resilience, barriers to psychological care, and optimal strategies for alleviating psychological distress in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Work package 3 will synthesise the findings from the preceding work packages to draft best practice guidelines, which will be co-created by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using the Delphi method. The guidelines will provide clinicians with a framework for alleviating psychological distress in FLWs, with particular relevance to the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also have relevance for future pandemics and other public health emergencies.","Flynn, Jack; O'Connor, Laura; Hanlon, Michelle; Bellani, Giacomo; Contreras, Maya; Doherty, Anne; Durand, Hannah; Fallon, Elaine; Gormley, Clare; Laffey, John; Molloy, Gerry; Sarma, Kiran; Strepparava, Maria Grazia; Russo, Selena; Walsh, Jane; McGuire, Brian E",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13117.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870088/,59

As such, work is needed to understand the factors impacting real-world treatment delivery. The present paper describes the implementation of the McFarlane-model multifamily psychoeducational groups (MFG) in established FEP early intervention programs within a single state. The aims were to examine (a) training participation and implementation of MFG, (b) barriers and facilitators to implementation, and (c) modifications made to MFG. METHODS Practitioners from six established FEP early intervention programs received in-person training and ongoing consultation in MFG. Training participation data were obtained via attendance and implementation outcomes were obtained from practitioner reports. Fifteen months following the initial training, practitioners reported on clinic-specific barriers, facilitators, and modifications across four categories (context, intervention, practitioner, and recipient). RESULTS Twenty-three practitioners across six clinics received in-person training and were offered ongoing consultation to support implementation. Difficulties in starting MFG were salient as the earliest group was run 7 months after the initial training, thereby resulting in low overall frequency of groups. A number of barriers spanning context, intervention, practitioner, and recipient domains were noted, the majority of which were clinic-specific. Despite challenges, practitioners identified several facilitators and made modifications to the intervention and its delivery in service of implementation. CONCLUSIONS Results from this implementation case study highlighted the challenges of delivering MFG in real-world FEP early intervention programs. Further, this paper emphasizes the value in identifying and addressing clinic-specific factors when implementing MFG.","Browne, Julia; Sanders, A Simone; Friedman-Yakoobian, Michelle; Guyer, Margaret; Keshavan, Matcheri; Kim, Bo; Kline, Emily",Early intervention in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161640/,59

To enhance pharmacist's involvement in future emergency situations, there is a critical need to understand pharmacists' knowledge, willingness and preparedness in response to various emergency situations. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to describe pharmacists and pharmacist extenders on their participation in emergency response activities and training, preparedness and willingness to respond in emergency situations, and knowledge of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and their pharmacy's emergency preparedness plans. METHODS A cross-sectional design with an online survey of pharmacist, pharmacy owner, and pharmacy technician members of the National Community Pharmacists Association was employed in the United States in July - August 2020. Descriptive statistics summarized participants' level of actual participation and their willingness to participate in emergency situations and training and their knowledge of MOU and their pharmacy's emergency plans. A non-response bias investigation was conducted by comparing the early and late responders. RESULTS Of the 6,486 members, 255 completed the questionnaire (RR1 = 4.0%). With the confidence level of 95%, the margin of error was 6%. About 60% were independently owned and in urban areas. More than 80% and 64% of the participants have not volunteered in any emergency or participated in any emergency training program, respectively. Over 60% were very willing to assist with the distribution of medications and vaccine administration. Less than 10% had MOUs with health departments. More than 60% of respondents were not aware of what MOU is. CONCLUSION Despite limited involvement in actual emergency activities and training, pharmacists and pharmacist extenders exhibited a high level of willingness to participate in emergency training and assist in case of emergencies. This study recommends the development of programs aimed at increasing pharmacists' and pharmacist extenders' participation in emergency training and in future public health emergencies.","Zhao, Yi; Diggs, Kavon; Ha, David; Fish, Hannah; Beckner, John; Westrick, Salisa C",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2021.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34148842/,59

We describe the epidemiology and outcomes of RVI in a cohort enrolling 3294 consecutive patients undergoing SOT from May 2008 to December 2015 in Switzerland. Patient and allograft outcomes, and RVI diagnosed during routine clinical practice were prospectively collected. Median follow-up was 3.4 years (interquartile range 1.61-5.56). Six-hundred-ninety-six RVI were diagnosed in 151/334 (45%) lung and 265/2960 (5%) non-lung transplant recipients. Cumulative incidence was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] 53%-69%) in lung and 12% (95% CI 11%-14%) in non-lung transplant recipients. RVI led to 17.9 (95% CI 15.7-20.5) hospital admissions per 1000 patient-years. Intensive care unit admission was required in 4% (27/691) of cases. Thirty-day all-cause case fatality rate was 0.9% (6/696). Using proportional hazard models we found that RVI (adjusted-hazard ratio [aHR] 2.45; 95% CI 1.62-3.73), lower respiratory tract RVI (aHR 3.45; 95% CI 2.15-5.52), and influenza (aHR 3.57; 95% CI 1.75-7.26) were associated with graft failure or death.

95899,How can I feel less isolated from colleagues?,2020-04-16,"The opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae has dual lifestyles: one of an asymptomatic colonizer in the human nasopharynx and the other of a deadly pathogen invading sterile host compartments. The latter triggers an overwhelming inflammatory response, partly driven via pore forming activity of the cholesterol dependent cytolysin (CDC), pneumolysin. Although pneumolysin-induced inflammation drives person-to-person transmission from nasopharynx, the primary reservoir for pneumococcus, it also contributes to high mortality rates, creating a bottleneck that hampers widespread bacterial dissemination, thus acting as a double-edged sword. Serotype 1 ST306, a widespread pneumococcal clone, harbours a non-hemolytic variant of pneumolysin (Ply-NH). Performing crystal structure analysis of Ply-NH, we identified Y150H and T172I as key substitutions responsible for loss of its pore forming activity. We uncovered a novel inter-molecular cation-π interaction, governing formation of the transmembrane β-hairpins (TMH) in the pore state of Ply, which can be extended to other CDCs. H150 in Ply-NH disrupts this interaction, while I172 provides structural rigidity to domain-3, through hydrophobic interactions, inhibiting TMH formation. Loss of pore forming activity enabled improved cellular invasion and autophagy evasion, promoting an atypical intracellular lifestyle for pneumococcus, a finding that was corroborated in in vivo infection models. Attenuation of inflammatory responses and tissue damage promoted tolerance of Ply-NH-expressing pneumococcus in the lower respiratory tract. Adoption of this altered lifestyle may be necessary for ST306 due to its limited nasopharyngeal carriage, with Ply-NH, aided partly by loss of its pore forming ability, facilitating a benign association of SPN in an alternative, intracellular host niche.","Badgujar, Dilip C; Anil, Anjali; Green, Angharad E; Surve, Manalee Vishnu; Madhavan, Shilpa; Beckett, Alison; Prior, Ian A; Godsora, Barsa K; Patil, Sanket B; More, Prachi Kadam; Sarkar, Shruti Guha; Mitchell, Andrea; Banerjee, Rinti; Phale, Prashant S; Mitchell, Timothy J; Neill, Daniel R; Bhaumik, Prasenjit; Banerjee, Anirban",PLoS pathogens,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33216805/,59

The purpose of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of synovial fluid biomarkers and to determine which test has the highest diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) for the diagnosis of PJI. METHODS An online literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases identified 33 articles reporting a total of 13 major parameters for diagnosing PJI through analysis of synovial fluid. Each of the included articles was independently analyzed for risk of bias and for concerns regarding applicability utilizing the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) tool. The mada (meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy) tool was used to generate forest plots for sensitivity, specificity, and the log of the DOR, as well as summary statistics. RESULTS In this analysis, 13 index tests (leukocyte count; measurement of the percentage of polymorphonucleocytes [PMN%] and the levels of C-reactive protein [CRP], α-defensin, leukocyte esterase [LE], interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF]; culture; and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] analysis) were evaluated on the basis of ≥2 articles. Of these tests, 8 (leukocyte count, PMN%, CRP, α-defensin, LE, IL-6, IL-8, and culture) were appropriate for pooled analysis. The overall sensitivity of these 8 markers was 0.85, and all but culture showed a sensitivity of ≥0.8. All markers showed a specificity of ≥0.9. Of the 8 tests, measurement of the α-defensin level showed the highest log DOR. CONCLUSIONS Synovial fluid leukocyte count, PMN%, CRP, α-defensin, LE, IL-6, and IL-8 all demonstrated high sensitivity for diagnosing PJI, with α-defensin being the best synovial marker based on the highest log DOR. However, other synovial fluid tests that demonstrate good diagnostic performance can also be used in combination for the diagnosis of PJI. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Diagnostic Level IV.

In the absence of containment measures, the epidemics spread exponentially fast whenever the infectivity rate is positive λ>0. The containment measures are modeled by considering a time-dependent modulation of the bare infectivity λ leading to effective infectivity that decays in time for each infected individual, mimicking, for instance, the combined effect of the asymptomatic onset of the disease, testing policies, and quarantine. We consider a wide range of temporal kernels for effective infectivity, and we investigate the effect of the considered containment measures. We find that not all kernels are able to push the epidemic dynamics below the epidemic threshold with some containment measures only able to reduce the rate of the exponential growth of newly infected individuals. We also propose a pandemic model caused by a growing number of separated foci.","Bianconi, Ginestra; Krapivsky, P L",Physical review.

97023,Posters of the 2020 American Association of Neuroscience Nurses Annual Meeting: The Year There Was No Wall on Which to Hang Them.,2020-10-01,"INTRODUCTION Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods are safe for adolescents and provide the greatest assurance against rapid repeated pregnancy when inserted during the immediate postpartum (IPP) and immediate post-abortion (IPA) period. Despite increasing enthusiasm for IPP/IPA LARC insertion, adolescents' preferences and experiences have seldom been examined. The objective of this review was to examine the attitudes of adolescents (aged 10-19 years) towards IPP/IPA LARC, their experiences and perceptions around having a LARC device fitted IPP/IPA and the factors involved in decision-making to use, not use or discontinue IPP/IPA LARC. MATERIAL AND METHODS In January 2021 we searched seven bibliographic databases for original research articles published in English, from the year 2000. Studies of any design focussed on IPP/IPA LARC were eligible for inclusion. Three of the authors assessed articles for eligibility and extracted data relevant to the outcomes of the review. Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess methodological quality. Key themes emerging from the data were synthesised and reported narratively. RESULTS We identified 10 relevant articles, four of which were entirely adolescent-focused. Only three addressed IPA LARC. IPP availability was important for ensuring access to LARC postpartum. Attitudes towards LARC IPP were associated with adolescents' sociodemographic characteristics and positive perceptions related to the long duration of action. Determinants of discontinuation and non-use included poor-quality contraceptive counseling, intolerable side-effects and subsequent distress, misconceptions about LARC safety IPP and the influence of partners and community on autonomy. No factors involved in IPA LARC decision-making were available. Limited evidence demonstrated that adolescents may favour contraceptive implants over intrauterine devices, and in certain contexts may face greater barriers to IPA LARC access than adult women. CONCLUSIONS Immediate insertion of LARC postpartum appears acceptable to adolescents who do not experience side-effects and those with the opportunity to make autonomous contraception decisions. This important topic has been addressed in few studies involving an entirely adolescent population. Very limited evidence is available on IPA LARC. Further research on adolescents' lived experiences of IPP/IPA LARC access and use is necessary to inform the provision of person-centred care when assisting adolescents' contraceptive choice following pregnancy.","Buckingham, Pip; Moulton, Jessica E; Subasinghe, Asvini K; Amos, Natalie; Mazza, Danielle",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608901/,59
97035,Our choice is not binary between lockdown and herd immunity.,2020-10-22,"Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are experiencing a range of emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including anxiety, traumatic stress, and burnout. As many as half of all HCWs will exhibit clinically significant distress. This distress may endure for years, and health care institutions must respond to these emotional needs. We propose the Matched Emotional Supports in Health Care (MESH) Framework to guide institutions in implementing a tiered, or ""stepped care"" model for deploying sustainable emotional support programs for HCWs for COVID-19 and beyond. Recognizing the variability in HCWs' response to stress, MESH outlines a continuum of services, including universal (e.g., self-help), selected (e.g., support from trained volunteers), and indicated (e.g., professional therapy, psychotropic medication management) interventions matched to individual need. We provide a targeted review of evidence-based resources available at each level of care and potential processes for determining when higher levels of care are needed. Finally, we delineate key implementation factors for institutions to consider in developing, implementing, and sustaining services for HCWs. Employing the MESH Framework may also facilitate health care institutions' ability to meet the fourth aim of the Quadruple Aims of Health Care to ensure a healthy workforce for this and future crises.

CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) are good candidates for CO2 reduction because of their excellent photoelectric properties, including high molar extinction coefficient, low exciton binding energy, and defect tolerance. However, the pristine CsPbBr3 QDs generally have low photocatalytic performance mainly due to dominant charge recombination and lack of efficient catalytic sites for CO2 adsorption/activation. Herein, we report a new photocatalytic system, in which CsPbBr3 QDs are coupled with covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction. In this hybrid photocatalytic system, the robust triazine rings and periodical pore structures of CTFs promote the charge separation in CsPbBr3 and endow them with strong CO2 adsorption/activation capacity. The resulting photocatalytic system exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction. This work presents a new photocatalytic system based on CTFs and perovskite QDs for visible-light-driven CO2 reduction, which highlights the potential of perovskite-based photocatalysts for solar fuel applications.","Wang, Qi; Wang, Jin; Wang, Ji-Chong; Hu, Xin; Bai, Yu; Zhong, Xinhua; Li, Zhengquan",ChemSusChem,https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202002847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411408/,59
97581,Editor Profile: Brent Derry.,2021-08-01,"BACKGROUND Suicide is now the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Suicide rates for health care providers are thought to be higher than for people in other occupations because of job strain and burnout. Despite the National Academy of Medicine's Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-Being and Resilience, which focuses on reducing stress and preventing suicide, a shortage of data limits our understanding of nurse suicide. Neither employers nor professional nursing associations track suicide data. PURPOSE To determine the number of suicides and estimated rate of suicide among RNs, using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). METHODS We extracted data from the NVDRS, which is based on death certificates, coroner reports, and law enforcement reports, for the year 2015. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System was used to code the data. Industry and occupation coding experts reviewed the coding for accuracy. RESULTS Analysis of 2015 NVDRS data from 17 states showed that among civilian employed nurses ages 16 to 64 years, the estimated suicide rates for female and male nurses (11.4 and 29.3 per 100,000 nurses, respectively) were each higher than the rates for the comparable total population (8.2 and 26.1 per 100,000 people, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that RNs may die by suicide at higher rates than the total employed population in the 16-to-64-year age range.

Eosinophilic cardiovascular toxicity mostly consists of endomyocardial damage or eosinophilic vasculitis, while reported cases of venous thrombosis (VT) are scarce. We aimed to report on the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with unexplained VT and eosinophilia, and to identify predictors of relapse. This retrospective, multicenter, observational study included patients aged over 15 years with VT, concomitant blood eosinophilia ≥ 1G/L and without any other moderate-to-strong contributing factors for VT. Fifty-four patients were included. VT was the initial manifestation of eosinophil-related disease in 29 (54%) patients and included pulmonary embolism (52%), deep venous thrombosis (37%), hepatic (11%) and portal vein (9%) thromboses. The median [IQR] absolute eosinophil count at VT onset was 3.3G/L [1.6-7.4]. Underlying eosinophil-related diseases included FIP1L1-PDGFRA-associated chronic myeloid neoplasm (n = 4), Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (n = 9), lymphocytic (n = 1) and idiopathic (n = 29) variants of hypereosinophilic syndrome. After a median [IQR] follow-up of 24 [10-62] months, 7 (13%) patients had a recurrence of VT. In multivariate analysis, persistent eosinophilia was the sole variable associated with a shorter time to VT relapse (HR 7.48; CI95% [1.94-29.47]; p = 0.015).

However, our understanding of the gene family in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is quite limited. RESULTS In the present study, we identified 27 barley HAK/KUP/KT genes (hereafter called HvHAKs) through a genome-wide analysis. These HvHAKs were unevenly distributed on seven chromosomes, and could be phylogenetically classified into four clusters. All HvHAK protein sequences possessed the conserved motifs and domains. However, the substantial difference existed among HAK members in cis-acting elements and tissue expression patterns. Wheat had the most orthologous genes to barley HAKs, followed by Brachypodium distachyon, rice and maize. In addition, six barley HAK genes were selected to investigate their expression profiling in response to three abiotic stresses by qRT-PCR, and their expression levels were all up-regulated under salt, hyperosmotic and potassium deficiency treatments. CONCLUSION Twenty seven HAK genes (HvHAKs) were identified in barley, and they differ in tissue expression patterns and responses to salt stress, drought stress and potassium deficiency.","Cai, Kangfeng; Zeng, Fanrong; Wang, Junmei; Zhang, Guoping",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07633-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932999/,59

This report describes the initial experience with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) appendectomy. METHODS Between December 2008 and March 2009, patients with acute appendicitis admitted to the General Surgery and Emergency Unit of the authors' institution who agreed to undergo LESS appendectomy were included in a prospective study. All operations were performed by the same surgical team specially trained in this type of emergency surgery. The umbilicus was the sole point of entry for all patients, and the same operative technique was used in all cases. The data for patients undergoing LESS appendectomy were compared with the data from an uncontrolled group of patients undergoing standard laparoscopic appendectomy during the same study period. RESULTS The LESS and standard appendectomy groups included 15 patients each. The LESS procedure was performed successfully for all the patients, and none required conversion to an open procedure or a conventional laparoscopic appendectomy by the addition of more entry ports. The mean operating time of 51 min in the LESS group was not significantly different from the 46 min in the standard laparoscopic appendectomy group. CONCLUSIONS In this study, LESS appendectomy was technically feasible and safe, representing a reproducible alternative to standard laparoscopic appendectomy.","Vidal, Oscar; Valentini, Mauro; Ginestà, Cesar; Martí, Josep; Espert, Juan J; Benarroch, Guerson; García-Valdecasas, Juan C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0661-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690912/,59

Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of death in influenza virus infected patients. Recent studies indicated that active glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) encoded by glucagon (GCG) gene exerts anti-inflammatory functions. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of active GLP-1 in H9N2 influenza virus-induced ALI/ARDS in mice. First, we uncovered that GCG mRNA expression levels and GCG precursor protein levels were significantly increased, but total GLP-1 and active GLP-1 levels were decreased in the lungs of H9N2-infected mice. Next, liraglutide, an active GLP-1 analogue, was used to treat infected mice and to observe its effects on H9N2 virus-induced ALI. Liraglutide treatment ameliorated the declined body weight, decreased food intake and mortality observed in infected mice. It also alleviated the severity of lung injury, including lowering lung index, decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration and lowing total protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In addition, liraglutide did not influence viral titers in infected lungs, but decreased the levels of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in BALF. These results indicated that liraglutide alleviated H9N2 virus-induced ALI in mice most likely due to lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Bai, Yu; Lian, Pengjing; Li, Jingyun; Zhang, Zihui; Qiao, Jian",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33285220/,59

Despite the emergency of COVID-19 worldwide, remdesivir is the only treatment that has been recently approved to treat the diseases, and other effective therapies are still lacking. SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe illness in 20% of patients. Based on available data, there is an association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and severe COVID-19. Sarilumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody binding to both membrane-bound and soluble IL-6 receptors with high affinity and has been considered for off-label use in the treatment of COVID-19. Areas covered: The present article reviews recently published literature focusing on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 induced cytokine storm, the potential therapeutic role, and important clinical issues of sarilumab in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Expert opinion: The off-label treatment administration is unavoidable in the critical situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further efforts should be directed to determine mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced immune dysregulation as well as indications of sarilumab in the patients with COVID-19 to minimize concerns regarding its off-label administration.","Khiali, Sajad; Rezagholizadeh, Afra; Entezari-Maleki, Taher",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2021.1847269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33161757/,59

Therefore, identification of factors in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that are associated with cancer progression may represent novel therapeutic targets. Recent studies have highlighted a previously unappreciated role for the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on T cells and their effects on cell survival and proliferation. TLRs can bind exogenous molecules derived from pathogens as well as endogenous self-ligands released from damaged cells. Recent reports demonstrate that TLR engagement on primary mouse or human T cells enhances proliferation and/or cell survival. The mechanisms by which TLR stimulation on T cells influences these parameters and the different T-cell subsets that are affected by TLR stimulation are currently under investigation. Furthermore, neither the biological importance of stimulating TLRs on neoplastic T cells nor the prevalence of TLR expression in T-cell malignancies have yet to be characterized. Based on published reports and compelling preliminary data, we propose that the activation of the TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway in neoplastic T cells contributes to disease progression by reducing cell death and enhancing cell division. In this article, we present both theoretical arguments and experimental data in support of this hypothesis.","Morrison, Cori; Baer, Maria R; Zandberg, Dan P; Kimball, Amy; Davila, Eduardo",Future oncology,https://doi.org/10.2217/fon.10.185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345147/,59

Many interventions have been tested to increase screening uptake. AIM The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of cancer screening pamphlets as a standalone intervention. The outcome of interest was uptake of cancer screening tests. METHODS A systematic review was performed on the effectiveness of pamphlets compared to usual care without pamphlets. We searched five databases for research papers in English from 2000 up to May 2019. Randomised controlled trials were included. This research group independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and then compared the information as a group. RESULTS A total of nine trials involving 4912 participants met our inclusion criteria, of which five were about colorectal cancer screening, three were about prostate cancer screening and one was about lung cancer screening. Five of the nine trials showed that pamphlets alone increased uptake significantly, while the remaining four trials did not show significant effects. DISCUSSION There is some evidence that pamphlets increase uptake for cancer screenings, especially for colorectal cancer. Due to the small number of studies in this area, generalisability could be limited.","Teo, Boon See; Li, Esther; Tan, Clara; Munro, Yasmin Lynda",Journal of primary health care,https://doi.org/10.1071/hc18093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171373/,59

After induction of anesthesia, the pulmonary artery catheter was revealed to be advanced into the left brachiocephalic vein and then slipped into another vein that drains into the left brachiocephalic vein. In this case, we assumed that the catheter had most likely slipped into the left pericardiophrenic vein since the catheter follows the left heart border similarly to the route of this vein according to the chest X-ray. Patients with liver cirrhosis develop many collateral vessels and have enlarged veins due to portal hypertension, which makes this vascular route possible.

99707,A review of oligo(arylene ethynylene) derivatives in molecular junctions.,2021-06-10,"Patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve are at risk of mortality and morbidity after major surgery. Augmentation of oxygen delivery index (DO2I) with i.v. fluids and inotropes (goal-directed therapy, GDT) has been shown to reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity in high-risk patients. Concerns regarding cardiac complications associated with fluid challenges and inotropes may prevent clinicians from performing GDT in patients who need it most. We hypothesized that GDT is not associated with an increased risk of cardiac complications in high-risk, non-cardiac surgical patients. We performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GDT in high-risk surgical patients. Studies including cardiac surgery, trauma, and paediatric surgery were excluded. We reviewed the rates of all cardiac complications, arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, and acute pulmonary oedema. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan software. Data are presented as odds ratios (ORs), [95% confidence intervals (CIs)], and P-values. Twenty-two RCTs including 2129 patients reported cardiac complications. GDT was associated with a reduction in total cardiovascular (CVS) complications [OR=0.54, (0.38-0.76), P=0.0005] and arrhythmias [OR=0.54, (0.35-0.85), P=0.007]. GDT was not associated with an increase in acute pulmonary oedema [OR=0.69, (0.43-1.10), P=0.12] or myocardial ischaemia [OR=0.70, (0.38-1.28), P=0.25]. Subgroup analysis revealed the benefit is most pronounced in patients receiving fluid and inotrope therapy to achieve a supranormal DO2I, with the use of minimally invasive cardiac output monitors. Treatment of high-risk surgical patients GDT is not associated with an increased risk of cardiac complications; GDT with fluids and inotropes to optimize DO2I during early GDT reduces postoperative CVS complications.","Arulkumaran, N; Corredor, C; Hamilton, M A; Ball, J; Grounds, R M; Rhodes, A; Cecconi, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aet466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24413429/,59

Hypertrophic effects of concentric vs. eccentric muscle actions: A systematic review and meta-analysis. J Strength Cond Res 31(9): 2599-2608, 2017-Controversy exists as to whether different dynamic muscle actions produce divergent hypertrophic responses. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing the hypertrophic effects of concentric vs. eccentric training in healthy adults after regimented resistance training (RT). Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (a) were an experimental trial published in an English-language refereed journal; (b) directly compared concentric and eccentric actions without the use of external implements (i.e., blood pressure cuffs) and all other RT variables equivalent; (c) measured morphologic changes using biopsy, imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography, or ultrasound), bioelectrical impedance, and/or densitometry; (d) had a minimum duration of 6 weeks; and (e) used human participants without musculoskeletal injury or any health condition that could directly, or through the medications associated with the management of said condition, be expected to impact the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise. A systematic literature search determined that 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Results showed that eccentric muscle actions resulted in a greater effect size (ES) compared with concentric actions, but results did not reach statistical significance (ES difference = 0.25 ± 0.13; 95% confidence interval: -0.03 to 0.52; p = 0.076). The mean percent change in muscle growth across studies favored eccentric compared with concentric actions (10.0% vs. 6.8, respectively). The findings indicate the importance of including eccentric and concentric actions in a hypertrophy-oriented RT program, as both have shown to be effective in increasing muscle hypertrophy.","Schoenfeld, Brad J; Ogborn, Dan I; Vigotsky, Andrew D; Franchi, Martino V; Krieger, James W",Journal of strength and conditioning research,https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000001983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28486337/,59

Although all the cubicles were in 'positive pressure' towards the corridor, the virus-containing bioaerosols generated from the index patient's cubicle were still transmitted to other cubicles, which cannot be explained in a traditional manner. A multi-zone model combining the two-way airflow effect was used to analyse this phenomenon. The multi-zone airflow model was evaluated by our experimental data. Comparing with the previous computational fluid dynamic simulation results, we found that the air exchange owing to the small temperature differences between cubicles played a major role in SARS transmission. Additionally, the validated multi-zone model combining the two-way airflow effect could simulate the pollutant transport with reasonable accuracy but much less computational time. A probable improvement in general ward design was also proposed.","Chen, Chun; Zhao, Bin; Yang, Xudong; Li, Yuguo","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2010.0486; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21068029/,59

Outbreak forecasting and modelling suggest that infection numbers will continue to rise globally in the forthcoming months. Upon investigation of the disease patterns differences in mortality between south-European and north-European countries became striking with mortality in Italy and Spain exceeding 10% and <5% in Germany and Poland so far. It is unknown if this difference is associated with the higher virulence of the viral strains, differences in host genomics, access to medical resources or other unknown variables. Little is also known about SARS CoV-2 evolutionary and transmission patterns as limited number of the large-scale sequence and phylogenetic analyses have been performed so far.

DESIGN Retrospective, quasi-experimental study comparing guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing before and after an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) intervention. SETTING Family medicine residency clinic affiliated with a community teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS Adult and pediatric patients prescribed antibiotics for URI, UTI, or SSTI between November 1, 2017, and April 31, 2018 (pre-ASP group), or October 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019 (ASP group), were eligible for inclusion. METHODS The health-system ASP physician and pharmacist provided live education and pocket cards to FMRC staff with local guidelines as a quick reference. Audit with feedback was delivered every other week by the clinic's AMCP. Guideline-concordance was determined based on the institution's outpatient ASP guidelines. RESULTS Overall, 525 antibiotic prescriptions were audited (pre-ASP n = 90 and ASP n = 435). Total guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing at baseline was 38.9% (URI, 53.3%; SSTI, 16.7%; UTI, 46.7%) and improved across all 3 infection types to 57.9% (URI, 61.2%; SSTI, 57.6%; UTI, 53.5%; P = .001).

However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of training on highly automated driving. Moreover, available interactive trainings are mostly based on automated driving simulators and the application of immersive technology such as Virtual Reality (VR) as a low-cost training solution has not been widely adopted. In this study, we developed three types of familiarization tours (low-fidelity VR, high-fidelity VR, and video) to train first-time users of highly automated cars. Then, the effectiveness of these tours was investigated on automation trust and driving performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks in four groups: control, video, low-fidelity VR, and high-fidelity VR. The results revealed the positive impact of the tours on trust and transition performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials. Knowledge resulting from this research could help develop cost-effective solutions for automated driving training in dealerships and car rental centers.","Ebnali, Mahdi; Lamb, Richard; Fathi, Razieh; Hulme, Kevin",Applied ergonomics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818840/,59

This study aimed to document organizational approaches to identifying and addressing rumors and provide practical recommendations for future outbreaks. METHODS We conducted semistructured interviews with 34 individuals who participated in the EVD response in Liberia and/or Sierra Leone. Interviews focused on the general organizational approach and organizational response to specific rumors. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. RESULTS Most respondents reported that rumors were considered an organizational priority and their importance increased over time. Formal rumor identification systems using community-level reporters were described in Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as varied informal systems. A wide range of approaches was used to address rumors including Community Led Ebola Action, Community Led Total Sanitation, drama performances, Ebola Treatment Center/Unit-based approaches, radio, leveraging community leaders as an information source, and organization change. Interpersonal and community-led approaches were described most often. Staff whose professional roles did not involve rumor management reported informally addressing rumors with colleagues and beneficiaries. Rumors reflecting valid concerns with the EVD response, such as potential infection in health care facilities, were addressed through organizational change and improvement. DISCUSSION Interpersonal and community-led approaches were considered effective by participants and hold promise for future outbreaks. Informal systems developed at Ebola Treatment Centers/Units highlighted how these facilities may be utilized as an information hub. Professionals who interact with beneficiaries, especially local staff, are likely to address rumors informally and organizations may benefit from considering local staff an asset in rumor management. Rumors alerted responders to issues in the EVD response, but this may not be the most efficient mechanism to receive and address concerns.","Brandt, Amelia J; Katalenich, Bonnie; Seal, David W","Global health, science and practice",https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-21-00203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34593588/,59

The only difference between the groups was the technique to control the DVC. Pad-free continence (PFC) and overall continence (0 pads/day with or without security pad) was assessed with patient reported pad usage records and validated questionnaires (EPIC) at 3, 12, and 15 months. Secondary endpoints were erectile function recovery (defined as erections sufficient for sexual activity) and the rate of apical surgical margins. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine predictors for recovery of both urinary continence and erectile function. RESULTS The three groups were comparable in terms of age, BMI, prostate size, AUA symptom score, SHIM, and clinical stage. There were no differences found in terms of operative times, EBL, pathological stage, and positive apical margin. There was no difference between the three groups with regard to overall continence or pad-fee continence at 3 months. However, overall continence at 15 months for ligation and suspension was 99% and was superior to stapler (88%) (p=0.002) and cut and suture ligation (88%) (p=0.002). Additionally, pad-free continence at 15 months was superior for ligation and suspension (87%) as compared to stapler (73%) and cut and suture ligation (75%) (p=0.045). The technique of DVC control did not impact erectile function. Men with nerve sparing had better continence compared to no nerve sparing at 3 months (62 vs 42%, p=0.045) but not at 15 months. Median time to continence was 2 months for patients receiving nerve sparing compared to 4.5 months for non-nerve sparing (p=0.02). CONCLUSION Suture suspension of the DVC during RARP contributes to higher overall continence rates compared to stapling and cut and sew. Nerve sparing contributes to earlier return of continence than non-nerve sparing.","Feng, Tom; Heulitt, Gerald; Lee, Janet J; Liao, Michael; Li, Hsin-Fang; Porter, James R",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.15133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32521115/,59

METHODS This prospective case-control study included 34 cats. Nineteen cats had a definitive histopathological diagnosis of FIP (seven of these with neurological and/or ocular signs), and 15 cats had other diseases but similar clinical signs (three of these with neurological and/or ocular signs). Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the CSF of all cats, and sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated. RESULTS Real-time RT-PCR of CSF showed a specificity of 100% in diagnosing FIP, a sensitivity of 42.1%, a PPV of 100% and an NPV of 57.7%. The sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR of CSF in cats with neurological and/or ocular signs was 85.7%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although it is known that RT-PCR can give false positive results, especially if performed using serum or plasma, this real-time RT-PCR detecting FCoV RNA in CSF can be considered a reliable specific tool for the diagnosis of FIP. If only cats with neurological involvement are evaluated, the sensitivity of this real-time RT-PCR in CSF is also high.","Doenges, Stephanie J; Weber, Karin; Dorsch, Roswitha; Fux, Robert; Fischer, Andrea; Matiasek, Lara A; Matiasek, Kaspar; Hartmann, Katrin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15574757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736448/,59

In addition to the benefits of wireless powering and miniaturization leading to less traumatic surgery, piezoelectric neural stimulators can also exhibit prolonged operational lifetimes for a long-term stable neural interface, and show promise for clinical translation. As one of first steps to demonstrate the value of ultrasound-powered piezoelectric neural interface, Li et al. developed a piezoelectric stimulator to activate spinal cord neural circuits for locomotion restoration in a rat model with spinal cord injury (SCI) and compared its efficacy with conventional electrical stimulation (ES). From the point of view of materials science, neural engineering and microelectronics, we provide our commentary on the article, highlighting its importance and discussing the issues that remain to be addressed in future studies in the emerging field of ultrasound powered piezoelectric neurostimulation devices.","Sun, Tao; Wright, Jason; Datta-Chaudhuri, Timir",Bioelectronic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42234-020-00052-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832580/,59
102424,Performance of using multiple stepwise algorithms for variable selection.,2010,"Widespread reuse of building components can promote the circularity of materials in the building sector. However, the reuse of building components is not yet a mainstream practise. Although there have been several studies on the factors affecting the reuse of building components, there is no single study that has tried to harmonize the circumstances affecting this intervention. Through a systematic literature review targeting peer-reviewed journal articles, this study intends to identify and stratify factors affecting the reuse of components of the superstructure of a building and eventually delineate correlations between these factors. Factors identified throughout this study are classified into six major categories and 23 sub-categories. Then the inter-dependencies between the barriers are studied by developing the correlation indices between the sub-categories. Results indicate that addressing the economic, social and regulatory barriers should be prioritized. Although the impact of barriers under perception, risk, compliance and market sub-categories are very pronounced, the highest inter-dependency among the sub-categories is found between perception and risk. It suggests that the perception of the stakeholders about building components reuse is affected by the potential risks associated with this intervention.","Rakhshan, Kambiz; Morel, Jean-Claude; Alaka, Hafiz; Charef, Rabia","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x20910463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32116140/,59

World Health Organization (WHO) has already praised their contribution and their essential role in controlling this disease. Some of the main concerns of covid-19's impact to health service staff include work overload, exhaustion, and high risk of self-infection or transmission to family members. Moreover, during the pandemic, caregivers' mental health inevitably becomes vulnerable, with salient stress and anxiety-related symptoms. Uncertainty, fear of contagion, guilt, hopelessness, stigmatization and, in some cases, long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are few of the potential effects posed by this outbreak on health workers. In this review, lessons learnt from previous global crises or pandemics on the psychological impact of health workers are presented. History could potentially provide essential information on how to best manage, support and optimize our approach to this highly appreciated and much needed group of professionals. Targeted and prompt interventions could reduce the psychological strain of health professionals, thus, further improving provided patient care. Covid-19 is an on-going health crisis and this work, even though generated by limited existing data, could be used to inform governments and/or institutions and lead on decisions and changes in current guidelines.","Tsonis, Orestis; Diakaki, Kalliopi; Gkrozou, Fani; Papadaki, Aikaterini; Dimitriou, Evangelos; Paraskevaidis, Maria; Kyrgiou, Maria; Paraskevaidis, Evangelos; Paschopoulos, Minas; Tsapakis, Evangelia Maria; Siafaka, Vassiliki",Rivista di psichiatria,https://doi.org/10.1708/3594.35763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899826/,59

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which exhibits high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is a risk factor of CVD. The relationship of Lp(a) with CVD has been characterized in populations specific to FH. Material and methods Studies reporting on the relationship of Lp(a) with CVD among FH subjects via PubMed up to 2020 were reviewed. Results Eight studies were identified as eligible. In the meta-analyses, a high Lp(a) level was significantly and predictively associated with CVD compared to a low Lp(a) level in 2 cross-sectional studies (odds ratio = 2.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-5.73) and 6 cohort studies (risk/hazard ratio = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.50-2.43). The totally integrated relative risk of these studies was 1.97 (95% CI: 1.57-2.46). Conclusions FH subjects with high Lp(a) levels can have a high CVD risk, and besides LDL-C, attention should be paid to Lp(a) levels in FH subjects.","Watanabe, Jun; Hamasaki, Masato; Kotani, Kazuhiko",Archives of medical sciences.

Concern grew as epidemiological models began to predict alarming hospital bed shortages for the state. Massive scheduling adjustments were needed as faculty and residents found themselves in groups at high risk for severe COVID-19 and residents found themselves dismissed from nonessential learning experiences in an effort to conserve personal protective equipment and limit exposures. A dedicated surge team was formed to tackle these issues while continuing to support our goals of maximizing patient safety, resident education, and physician wellness. The surge team created a plan that was implemented in 2 main phases. Phase 1 assumed business as usual with increased layers of backup for both residents and faculty. Phase 2 redistributed unassigned residents and inpatient faculty to increase capacity for adult medicine and COVID-19 patients on our essential services. Lessons learned from these surge efforts may help inform similar decisions being made by other residency programs presently and in the future.","Devitt, Jessica; Malam, Naomi; Montgomery, Linda",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.s1.200193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622841/,59

The aim of this report is to describe the results of treating COVID-19 positive patients with nitazoxanide in three clinical settings: pregnancy/puerperium, hospitalized patients in an Internal Medicine Service and in an ambulatory setting. METHODOLOGY This was a prospective follow-up and report of COVID-19 cases in three different situations, pregnant women, hospitalized patients receiving medical attention in an Internal Medicine Service and ambulatory patients residing in Toluca City, and Mexico City. RESULTS The experience with a first group of 20 women, pregnant (17) or in immediate puerperium (3) was successful in 18 cases with two unfortunate deaths. The five cases treated in an Internal Medicine service showed a positive outcome with two patients weaned from mechanical ventilation. Of the remaining 16 patients treated in an ambulatory setting, all got cured. Nitazoxanide seems to be useful against SARS-CoV-2, not only in an early intervention but also in critical condition as well as in pregnancy without undesired effects for the babies. As an adjunctive therapy budesonide was used that seems to contribute to the clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS Nitazoxanide could be useful against COVID-19 as a safe and available regimen to be tested in a massive way immediately.","Meneses Calderón, José; Figueroa Flores, Ma Del Rocío; Paniagua Coria, Leopoldo; Briones Garduño, Jesús Carlos; Meneses Figueroa, Jazmín; Vargas Contretas, María José; De la Cruz Ávila, Lilia; Díaz Meza, Salvador; Ramírez Chacón, Reynaldo; Padmanabhan, Srivatsan; Mendieta Zerón, Hugo",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031085/,59
104141,The Self-Paced Submaximal Run Test: Associations With the Graded Exercise Test and Reliability.,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND Antibiotics represent the most widely prescribed drugs in children worldwide, both in hospital and community settings. A comprehensive approach to understanding the reasons and determinants of antibiotic prescription in the pediatric age is needed. This study aimed to assess parents' attitudes and perspectives about antibiotic use. METHODS Prospective observational study was conducted in all Italian Regions between February 1 and April 30, 2020, using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS Six thousand six hundred twenty-five parents from all Italian regions completed the survey. Seventy-six percent of parents were aware that only bacteria are the target of antibiotics, but 92.9% knew that the antibiotic has no direct effect on fever. Antibiotic self-prescription (10.4%) or by remote consultation by phone call (19.9%) or message (9.6%) were relatively common. Ninety-three percent of parents were aware that excessive use of antibiotics could select resistant bacteria and 84.7% of them knew that they could actively fight antibiotic resistance. About two thirds of participants (66.1%) received information on antibiotic resistance from their family pediatrician. Parents born of Italy or those with lower income had a higher probability of having less information from pediatricians or knowledge of proper antibiotic use. DISCUSSION Our study suggests that parents' knowledge and attitudes toward antibiotic use and prescription are improving compared with previous studies, while there is still a gap regarding antibiotic resistance, particularly on practices that can reduce its burden. Our study's negative finding is that families from low-income settings or those born abroad have significantly more misconceptions about important antibiotic practices.","Pierantoni, Luca; Lo Vecchio, Andrea; Lenzi, Jacopo; Corsi, Vincenza; Campana, Lara; Luca Trobia, Gian; Amendolea, Antonella; Di Felice, Benedetta; Alighieri, Giovanni; Fabrizio, Giovanna Carmela; Bisceglia, Massimo; Peia, Francesco; Chiale, Federica; Bartolomei, Beatrice; Siciliano, Chiara; Di Battista, Caterina; Passone, Eva; di Giovanni, Chiara; Piergentili, Edward; Donà, Daniele; Buonsenso, Danilo",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437339/,59
104155,Development of a transpiration model for precise tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) irrigation control under various environmental conditions in greenhouse.,2021-03-05,"BACKGROUND Variability in the health effects of dietary fiber might arise from inter-individual differences in the gut microbiota's ability to ferment these substrates into beneficial metabolites. Our understanding of what drives this individuality is vastly incomplete and will require an ecological perspective as microbiomes function as complex inter-connected communities. Here, we performed a parallel two-arm, exploratory randomized controlled trial in 31 adults with overweight and class-I obesity to characterize the effects of long-chain, complex arabinoxylan (n = 15) at high supplementation doses (female: 25 g/day; male: 35 g/day) on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid production as compared to microcrystalline cellulose (n = 16, non-fermentable control), and integrated the findings using an ecological framework. RESULTS Arabinoxylan resulted in a global shift in fecal bacterial community composition, reduced α-diversity, and the promotion of specific taxa, including operational taxonomic units related to Bifidobacterium longum, Blautia obeum, and Prevotella copri. Arabinoxylan further increased fecal propionate concentrations (p = 0.012, Friedman's test), an effect that showed two distinct groupings of temporal responses in participants. The two groups showed differences in compositional shifts of the microbiota (p ≤ 0.025, PERMANOVA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses revealed that the propionate response was predictable through shifts and, to a lesser degree, baseline composition of the microbiota. Principal components (PCs) derived from community data were better predictors in MLR models as compared to single taxa, indicating that arabinoxylan fermentation is the result of multi-species interactions within microbiomes. CONCLUSION This study showed that long-chain arabinoxylan modulates both microbiota composition and the output of health-relevant SCFAs, providing information for a more targeted application of this fiber. Variation in propionate production was linked to both compositional shifts and baseline composition, with PCs derived from shifts of the global microbial community showing the strongest associations. These findings constitute a proof-of-concept for the merit of an ecological framework that considers features of the wider gut microbial community for the prediction of metabolic outcomes of dietary fiber fermentation. This provides a basis to personalize the use of dietary fiber in nutritional application and to stratify human populations by relevant gut microbiota features to account for the inconsistent health effects in human intervention studies.

104313,Wound care in the era of COVID-19.,2020-08-02,"OBJECTIVES Adolescents and young adults with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions are often socially isolated because of the demands of their illness. Although adolescents and young adults have a noticeable online and social media presence, their motivations for using social media remain unclear. This article aims to summarise empirical research undertaken about how and why social media is used by adolescents and young adults with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. METHODS An integrative literature review was undertaken. Key healthcare research databases including CINHAL, MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO were searched for empirical studies reporting the use of social media by adolescents and young adults with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria; included articles were quality appraised and a thematic synthesis undertaken to identify key themes. RESULTS The reasons why adolescents and young adults with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions use social media are diverse, with differences relating to age and gender. However, this population in general uses social media to connect with others who have similar lived experiences. CONCLUSION Social media platforms can be useful adjuncts to the care of adolescents and young adults with life-limiting or life-threatening conditions. However, current evidence is dominated by studies on social media use by adolescents and young adults with cancer. More research is required to gain a holistic understanding of how and why social media is used by this population and its perceived benefits and limitations.","Peat, George; Rodriguez, Alison; Smith, Joanna",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2018-001646; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514717/,59

104948,Good for Us All.,2020-07-09,"OBJECTIVES Recently, several adult trials have investigated the potential benefit of high-dose vitamin C therapy in critically ill patients. In pediatric patients, little is known on the efficacy, safety, and risk of high-dose vitamin C therapy. We aimed to review the efficacy and potential harm associated with high-dose vitamin C treatment. DATA SOURCES We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and National Institute of Health Clinical Trials Register. STUDY SELECTION We included studies in neonatal and pediatric patients who received IV or intra-arterial high-dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid) defined as greater than or equal to 75 mg/kg/d. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent investigators screened articles and extracted data. DATA SYNTHESIS We found 1,364 articles, assessed 193 full texts for eligibility, and identified 12 eligible studies. These studies included 855 patients, with 194 receiving high-dose vitamin C. The age of patients who received high-dose vitamin C ranged from 2 hours after delivery to 8.4 years (median 2.4 yr), and the vitamin C dose ranged from 100 to 1,500 mg/kg/d (median 260.5 mg/kg/d). Four studies were double-blind randomized controlled trials, and no clinical efficacy outcome was reported in favor of or against vitamin C. Furthermore, no adverse event or signal of harm was reported with high-dose vitamin C. CONCLUSIONS In 12 studies with 194 children treated with parenteral high-dose vitamin C, there was no evidence of clinical efficacy or inferior clinical outcomes in double-blind randomized controlled trials, and no reported harmful effects. These findings justify further investigations of this treatment in children.","Yanase, Fumitaka; Raman, Sainath; Naorungroj, Thummaporn; McCarthy, Avril; Cree, Michele; Schlapbach, Luregn J; Bellomo, Rinaldo",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000002686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729732/,59

The aim of this scoping review was to evaluate what is known about physical functional limitations and physical activity levels and how they are measured in adults experiencing homelessness. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for scoping reviews. Suitable quantitative and qualitative articles were searched using PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases using a combination of keywords and a gray literature search was performed. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were studies that examined physical functional limitations and/or physical activity among homeless adults (with/without co-occurring mental illness, infectious disease, substance use disorder), as a primary or secondary outcome measure. Results: We identified 15 studies for inclusion including 2,018 participants. Studies were primarily quantitative (n=13) and there were 2 qualitative studies. The following outcomes related to physical functioning were reported; mobility levels (n=3), frailty (n=1), flexibility (n=2), strength (n=1), physical symptom burden (n=3), and exercise capacity (n=3). Eight studies reported outcomes related to physical activity. The majority of studies reported high levels of functional limitations among participants and low physical activity levels although a spectrum of abilities was noted. Conclusion: This review showed that many adults who are homeless appear to show a high burden of physical functional limitations and low physical activity levels but more objective and consistent measures should be applied to examine these factors in future studies. This will help address and plan future care, physical rehabilitation and housing needs for this vulnerable cohort. This scoping review will help direct research and future systematic reviews in this emerging area.","Kiernan, Sinéad; Mockler, David; Ní Cheallaigh, Clíona; Broderick, Julie",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13011.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33728397/,59

Sizing and landing zone predictions are still very challenging steps in the procedure. Virtual stent deployment may help therapeutic planning, device choice, and hemodynamic simulations. We aimed to assess the predictability of our recently developed virtual deployment model by comparing in vivo and virtual stents implanted in a consecutive series of patients presenting with intracranial aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Virtual stents were implanted in patient-specific geometries of intracranial aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device. The length and cross-section of virtual and real stents measured with conebeam CT were compared. The influence of vessel geometry modifications occurring during the intervention was analyzed. RESULTS The virtual deployment based on pre- and poststent implantation 3D rotational angiography overestimated (underestimated) the device length by 13% ± 11% (-9% ± 5%). These differences were highly correlated (R2 = 0.67) with the virtual-versus-real stent radius differences of -6% ± 7% (5% ± 4%) for predictions based on pre- and poststent implantation 3D rotational angiography. These mismatches were due principally to implantation concerns and vessel-shape modifications. CONCLUSIONS The recently proposed geometric model was shown to predict accurately the deployment of Pipeline Embolization Devices when the stent radius was well-assessed. However, unpredictable delivery manipulations and variations of vessel geometry occurring during the intervention might impact the stent implantation.","Bouillot, P; Brina, O; Yilmaz, H; Farhat, M; Erceg, G; Lovblad, K-O; Vargas, M I; Kulcsar, Z; Pereira, V M",AJNR.

The etiology and pathophysiology of fibromyalgia are not fully explained and there are no effective drug treatments. Here we show that IgG from FMS patients produced sensory hypersensitivity by sensitizing nociceptive neurons. Mice treated with IgG from FMS patients displayed increased sensitivity to noxious mechanical and cold stimulation, and nociceptive fibers in skin-nerve preparations from mice treated with FMS IgG displayed an increased responsiveness to cold and mechanical stimulation. These mice also displayed reduced locomotor activity, reduced paw grip strength, and a loss of intraepidermal innervation. In contrast, transfer of IgG-depleted serum from FMS patients or IgG from healthy control subjects had no effect. Patient IgG did not activate naive sensory neurons directly. IgG from FMS patients labeled satellite glial cells and neurons in vivo and in vitro, as well as myelinated fiber tracts and a small number of macrophages and endothelial cells in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but no cells in the spinal cord. Furthermore, FMS IgG bound to human DRG. Our results demonstrate that IgG from FMS patients produces painful sensory hypersensitivities by sensitizing peripheral nociceptive afferents and suggest that therapies reducing patient IgG titers may be effective for fibromyalgia.","Goebel, Andreas; Krock, Emerson; Gentry, Clive; Israel, Mathilde R; Jurczak, Alexandra; Urbina, Carlos Morado; Sandor, Katalin; Vastani, Nisha; Maurer, Margot; Cuhadar, Ulku; Sensi, Serena; Nomura, Yuki; Menezes, Joana; Baharpoor, Azar; Brieskorn, Louisa; Sandström, Angelica; Tour, Jeanette; Kadetoff, Diana; Haglund, Lisbet; Kosek, Eva; Bevan, Stuart; Svensson, Camilla I; Andersson, David A",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci144201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196305/,59

We examined outcomes in patients who underwent vein reconstruction using polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). STUDY DESIGN Review of prospectively maintained databases at 3 centers identified all patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with vein resection and reconstruction using PTFE grafts between 1994 and 2009. Patient, operative, and outcomes variables were studied. Graft patency and survival were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier technique. RESULTS Thirty-three patients underwent segmental vein resection with interposition PTFE graft reconstruction. Median age was 67 years; median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was 1. Most operations were performed for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 28, 85%); 96% were T3 lesions or greater. Standard PD was performed in 12 (36%) patients, pylorus-preservation in 17 (52%), and total pancreatectomy in 4 (12%). Combined resection of portal and superior mesenteric veins (SMV) was required in 49%, with resection isolated to PV in 12% and SMV in 39%. Splenic vein ligation was necessary in 30%. Median graft diameter was 12 mm (range 8 to 20 mm), with the majority being ring-enforced (73%). Median operative and vascular clamp times were 463 and 41 minutes, respectively, with median blood loss of 1,500 mL. The negative margin rate was 64%. Overall morbidity rate was 46%, and 30-day mortality was 6%. No patients developed irreversible hepatic necrosis or graft infection. Pancreatic fistulas occurred in 3 (9.1%). With mean follow-up of 14 months, overall graft patency was 76%. Estimated median duration of graft patency was 21 months. Median survival was 12 months for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS With careful patient selection, PTFE graft reconstruction of resected PV/SMV during pancreaticoduodenectomy is possible with minimal risk of hepatic necrosis or graft infection.

METHODS A systematic review was conducted. Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov, and the WHO International Trial Registry Platform were searched, from inception until May 2018, to identify randomised clinical trials comparing rubber band ligation with haemorrhoidectomy for grade II-III haemorrhoids. The primary outcome was control of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included postoperative pain, postoperative complications, anal continence, patient satisfaction, quality of life and healthcare costs were assessed. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. RESULTS Three hundred and twenty-four studies were identified. Eight trials met the inclusion criteria. All trials were of moderate methodological quality. Outcome measures were diverse and not clearly defined. Control of symptoms was better following haemorrhoidectomy. Patients had less pain after rubber band ligation. There were more complications (bleeding, urinary retention, anal incontinence/stenosis) in the haemorrhoidectomy group. Patient satisfaction was equal in both groups. There were no data on quality of life and healthcare costs except that in one study patients resumed work more early after rubber band ligation. CONCLUSIONS Haemorrhoidectomy seems to provide better symptom control but at the cost of more pain and complications. However, due to the poor quality of the studies analysed/it is not possible to determine which of the two procedures provides the best treatment for grade II-III haemorrhoids. Further studies focusing on clearly defined outcome measurements taking patients perspective and economic impact into consideration are required.","Dekker, L; Han-Geurts, I J M; Rørvik, H D; van Dieren, S; Bemelman, W A",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-021-02430-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683503/,59

Personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks and gloves is needed to avoid transmission. Adverse skin reactions associated with PPE have been described, but there is no information regarding objective measures to assess skin impairment related to PPE. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of using facial mask and nitrile gloves on epidermal barrier function and skin homeostasis. METHODS A cross-sectional study was designed. Thirty-four health care workers wearing nitrile gloves and a mask for 2 hours were included. Transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration, erythema, and temperature were measured. RESULTS Transepidermal water loss (31.11 vs 14.24 g·m-2·h-1), temperature (33.29°C vs 32.57°C), and erythema were significantly greater at the area covered by gloves compared with the noncovered area. Transepidermal water loss (22.82 vs 13.69 g·m-2·h-1), temperature, and erythema (411.43 vs 335.52 arbitrary units) were significantly increased at the area covered by mask, whereas stratum corneum hydration was lower. Transepidermal water loss was greater at the area covered by a surgical mask than at a filtering respirator mask coded filtering facepiece 2 (27.09 vs 18.02 g·m-2·h-1, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS Skin homeostasis and epidermal barrier function may be impaired by gloves and mask use. High-quality PPE should be provided, and adequate skin prevention measures should be implemented to reduce epidermal barrier damage.","Montero-Vilchez, Trinidad; Martinez-Lopez, Antonio; Cuenca-Barrales, Carlos; Rodriguez-Tejero, Andrea; Molina-Leyva, Alejandro; Arias-Santiago, Salvador","Dermatitis : contact, atopic, occupational, drug",https://doi.org/10.1097/der.0000000000000682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33449481/,59

Although injuries associated with PWCs have been examined broadly, there is a lack of investigation into craniofacial injuries within this setting. This paper reviews the literature discussing PWC incidents and PWC-related craniofacial injuries. A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and National Library of Medicine databases was conducted for studies published through January 2021. Articles were selected if they contained information on PWC accidents and related craniofacial injuries. We also examined 3 patient cases of PWC-related craniofacial injuries. Overall, our review suggests that over the past 20 years, injuries and accidents have decreased significantly whereas fatalities have decreased to a lesser extent. Most PWC-related craniofacial injuries result from blunt trauma and a notable number of deaths and traumatic brain injuries occur in adolescents. Given the increasing number of PWC sales, PWC-related craniofacial injuries may be more prevalent, which prompts improved regulations and protective gears. Existing state laws on PWCs vary dramatically. As of now, there is no uniform policy that requires protective equipment use like helmets or instruction before PWC use. There also should be limitations on alcohol consumption as well as age of the riders. Overall, our review indicates that more research is needed to reduce the number of craniofacial injuries among PWC riders.","Mirsky, Nicholas; Kim, Minji; Plotsker, Ethan; Thaller, Seth R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34015801/,59

Seventeen drivers were identified and categorized into 3 groups: globalization and environment, sociodemographic, and public health systems. A combination of >2 drivers was responsible for most IDTEs. The driver category globalization and environment contributed to 61% of individual IDTEs, and the top 5 individual drivers of all IDTEs were travel and tourism, food and water quality, natural environment, global trade, and climate. Hierarchical cluster analysis of all drivers identified travel and tourism as a distinctly separate driver. Monitoring and modeling such disease drivers can help anticipate future IDTEs and strengthen control measures. More important, intervening directly on these underlying drivers can diminish the likelihood of the occurrence of an IDTE and reduce the associated human and economic costs.","Semenza, Jan C; Lindgren, Elisabet; Balkanyi, Laszlo; Espinosa, Laura; Almqvist, My S; Penttinen, Pasi; Rocklöv, Joacim",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26982104/,59

Consequently, it is important to explore physical therapists' referral practice patterns for surgical consult. Currently, physical therapist referral patterns for surgical consult in this patient population are unknown. OBJECTIVES To describe physical therapist referral patterns for immediate neurosurgical consult in patients with foot drop due to suspected acute LDH with LR. DESIGN Cross-sectional descriptive research design using an electronic, internet-based survey that utilized two clinical vignettes. METHOD An electronic survey was developed by an expert peer review panel. Survey participants were licensed physical therapists in the United States and members of the Orthopedic Section of the American Physical Therapy Association. RESULTS Of the individuals receiving the survey invitation, 2172 completed the survey. Depending on the severity of foot drop, 34-61% were likely to refer for immediate neurosurgical consult. Presence of imaging to confirm suspected clinical diagnosis slightly affected the likelihood of referral (4-12% increase) for immediate neurosurgical consult. CONCLUSION In patients with foot drop due to suspected acute LDH with LR, this study found that physical therapist referral patterns for immediate neurosurgical consult varied and are likely influenced by the severity of weakness and availability of MRI findings. Further research regarding the optimal management of this patient population and potential reasons for variation in practice is warranted.","Wielechowski, Adam; Keil, Aaron; Hamstra-Wright, Karrie",The Journal of manual & manipulative therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/10669817.2020.1776491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530795/,59
109768,Vaccine trials ramp up in children and adolescents.,2021-02-26,"Background Modified pectoral nerves (PECSII) and serratus blocks have been recently used for analgesia in breast surgery, but evidence comparing their analgesic benefits is limited. This prospective randomized, controlled study aims to examine the analgesic efficacy and safety profile of ultrasound-guided PECSII versus serratus blocks in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) for breast cancer. Patients and Methods One-hundred and eighty adult females scheduled for MRM were randomly allocated to three groups. PECS group patients received a PECSII block with 30mL of bupivacaine 0.25%, whereas SAPB group received a serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) using the same volume of bupivacaine 0.25% before induction of anesthesia. The control group received general anesthesia alone. Outcomes included 24 hours morphine consumption, intraoperative fentanyl requirements, visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for pain at rest and during movement, time to first rescue analgesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and sedation scores. Results Both PECSII and serratus blocks were associated with reduced postoperative morphine consumption compared to the control group (p<0.001). Both blocks were associated with reduced intraoperative fentanyl requirements, VAS scores, and PONV as compared with the control group. Also, they were associated with prolonged time to first rescue analgesia and better sedation scores in comparison with the control group.

We examined the species diversity and host specificity of PyVs in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.), a broadly distributed and highly speciose mammalian genus. We annotated six PyV genomes, comprising four new PyV species, based on pairwise identity within the large T antigen (LTAg) coding region. Phylogenetic comparisons revealed two instances of highly related PyV species, one in each of the Alphapolyomavirus and Betapolyomavirus genera, present in different horseshoe bat host species (Rhinolophus blasii and R. simulator), suggestive of short-range host-switching events. The two pairs of Rhinolophus PyVs in different horseshoe bat host species were 99.9 and 88.8 % identical with each other over their respective LTAg coding sequences and thus constitute the same virus species. To corroborate the species identification of the bat hosts, we analysed mitochondrial cytb and a large nuclear intron dataset derived from six independent and neutrally evolving loci for bat taxa of interest. Bayesian estimates of the ages of the most recent common ancestors suggested that the near-identical and more distantly related PyV species diverged approximately 9.1E4 (5E3-2.8E5) and 9.9E6 (4E6-18E6) years before the present, respectively, in contrast to the divergence times of the bat host species: 12.4E6 (10.4E6-15.4E6). Our findings provide evidence that short-range host-switching of PyVs is possible in horseshoe bats, suggesting that PyV transmission between closely related mammalian species can occur.","Carr, Michael; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Sasaki, Michihito; Dool, Serena E; Ito, Kimihito; Ishii, Akihiro; Hang'ombe, Bernard M; Mweene, Aaron S; Teeling, Emma C; Hall, William W; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28984241/,59

Only 29 patients (training group, 15; control group, 14) completed the study. INTERVENTION The training group underwent a sensorimotor training programme using a sling suspension system complemented by a routine physical therapy. The control group underwent a routine physical therapy. MAIN MEASURES Active joint repositioning, functional testings, and self-reported function with the Western Ontario & McMaster Universities Arthritis Index before and after the eight-week intervention. RESULTS There were significant differences between the two groups with respect to the improvement in proprioception as measured by active joint repositioning (the changes in the absolute error were 1.9+/- 1.7 degrees , training group versus 0.1 +/- 2.8 degrees , control group (P<0.05), and in self-reported functional difficulty (33.2 +/-35.1, training group versus 8.0+/- 10.2, control group; P<0.05)).

However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. AIMS To explore the potential molecular mechanism of angiogenesis induced by NBP after cerebral ischemia. RESULTS NBP treatment attenuated body weight loss, reduced brain infarct volume, and improved neurobehavioral outcomes during focal ischemia compared to the control rats (P < 0.05). NBP increased the number of CD31+ microvessels, the number of CD31+ /BrdU+ proliferating endothelial cells, and the functional vascular density (P < 0.05). Further study demonstrated that NBP also promoted the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 (P < 0.05), which was accompanied by upregulated sonic hedgehog expression in astrocytes in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSION NBP treatment promoted the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1, induced angiogenesis, and improved neurobehavioral recovery. These effects were associated with increased sonic hedgehog expression after NBP treatment.

The use of information and communication technologies is beginning to receive greater attention in the context of occupational stress. An exploratory qualitative study was conducted to examine both stressors and benefits resulting from technologies among practitioners in the advertising, public relations, and journalism industry in Hong Kong and Austria. Results suggest that technologies allow instant availability, which facilitates communication processes as well as information exchange. Notably, modern technologies enable employees to organize their work with greater temporal and spatial flexibility, thus creating an opportunity for better balancing work and private life. However, evolving technologies have come with a cost; the pressure to be constantly available via technologies constitutes a major source of stress, increasing the risk of experiencing prolonged work stress and its adverse consequences on employee health and well-being, such as a burnout. Furthermore, findings suggest that availability pressure may be attributed to an inner obligation rather than to an organizational expectation. Hence, making employees aware of their connectivity behaviour may help to diminish the experience of technology-induced work stress and improve and maintain employees' health and well-being in the long term.

This article introduces readers to core concepts, as well as recent advances, in bedside and instrumented vestibular assessments. RECENT FINDINGS Vestibular testing has improved immensely in the past 2 decades. While history and bedside testing is still the primary method of differential diagnosis in patients with dizziness, advances in technology such as the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test for superior canal dehiscence and the video head impulse test for vestibular neuritis have capabilities that go far beyond the bedside examination. Current vestibular testing now allows clinicians to test all five vestibular sensors in the inner ear.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA The risk factors of morbidity after surgery for CD, particularly the role of anti-TNF therapy, remain controversial and have not been evaluated in a large prospective cohort study. METHODS From 2013 to 2015, data on 592 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for CD in 19 French specialty centers were collected prospectively. Possible relationships between anti-TNF and postoperative overall morbidity were tested by univariate and multivariate analyses. Because treatment by anti-TNF is possibly dependent on the characteristics of the patients and disease, a propensity score was calculated and introduced in the analyses using adjustment of the inverse probability of treatment-weighted method. RESULTS Postoperative mortality, overall and intra-abdominal septic morbidity rates in the entire cohort were 0%, 29.7%, and 8.4%, respectively; 143 (24.1%) patients had received anti-TNF <3 months prior to surgery. In the multivariate analysis, anti-TNF <3 months prior to surgery was identified as an independent risk factor of the overall postoperative morbidity (odds-ratio [OR] =1.99; confidence interval [CI] 95% = 1.17-3.39, P = 0.011), with preoperative hemoglobin <10 g/dL (OR = 4.77; CI 95% = 1.32-17.35, P = 0.017), operative time >180 min (OR = 2.71; CI 95% = 1.54-4.78, P < 0.001) and recurrent CD (OR = 1.99; CI 95% = 1.13-3.36, P = 0.017). After calculating the propensity score and adjustment according to the inverse probability of treatment-weighted method, anti-TNF <3 months prior to surgery remained associated with a higher risk of overall (OR = 2.98; CI 95% = 2.04-4.35, P <0.0001) and intra-abdominal septic postoperative morbidities (OR = 2.22; CI 95% = 1.22-4.04, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative anti-TNF therapy is associated with a higher risk of morbidity after surgery for ileocolonic CD. This information should be considered in the surgical management of these patients, particularly with regard to the preoperative preparation and indication of temporary defunctioning stoma.","Brouquet, Antoine; Maggiori, Léon; Zerbib, Philippe; Lefevre, Jérémie H; Denost, Quentin; Germain, Adeline; Cotte, Eddy; Beyer-Berjot, Laura; Munoz-Bongrand, Nicolas; Desfourneaux, Véronique; Rahili, Amine; Duffas, Jean-Pierre; Pautrat, Karine; Denet, Christine; Bridoux, Valérie; Meurette, Guillaume; Faucheron, Jean-Luc; Loriau, Jérome; Guillon, Françoise; Vicaut, Eric; Benoist, Stéphane; Panis, Yves",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000002017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29300710/,59
113579,Novel Mechanistic PBPK Model to Predict Renal Clearance in Varying Stages of CKD by Incorporating Tubular Adaptation and Dynamic Passive Reabsorption.,2020-09-25,"INTRODUCTION Enteral access through the jejunum is indicated when patients cannot tolerate oral intake or gastric feeding. While multiple approaches for feeding jejunal access exist, few studies have compared the efficacy of these techniques. The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term durability, re-intervention rates, and nutritional outcomes following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes with jejunal extension tubes (PEG-JET) versus laparoscopic jejunostomy tubes (j-tubes). METHODS Retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent PEG-JET or laparoscopic jejunostomy tube placement from January 2005 through December 2015 at our institution. Thirty-day and long-term outcomes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 105 patients underwent PEG-JET and 307 patients underwent laparoscopic j-tube placement during the defined study period. In terms of 30-day outcomes, patients who underwent PEG-JET placement were significantly more likely to experience a tube dislodgement event (p = 0.005) and undergo a re-intervention (p < 0.001). Patients who had a laparoscopic j-tube placed were significantly more likely to meet their enteral feeding goals (p = 0.002) and less likely to require nutritional supplementation with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (p < 0.001). With regard to long-term outcomes, patients who underwent PEG-JET placement were significantly more likely to experience tube occlusion (p < 0.001) and require an endoscopic or surgical tube re-intervention (p < 0.001). Patients who underwent laparoscopic j-tube placement were significantly more likely to experience a tube site leak (p = 0.015) but were less likely to require nutritional supplementation with TPN (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic jejunostomy tubes provide more durable long-term enteral access compared to PEG-JET. Consideration should be given to laparoscopic jejunostomy tube placement in eligible patients who cannot tolerate oral intake or gastric enteral feeding.","Haskins, Ivy N; Strong, Andrew T; Baginsky, Mary; Sharma, Gautam; Karafa, Matthew; Ponsky, Jeffrey L; Rodriguez, John H; Kroh, Matthew D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5954-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29218657/,59

Here we report a 3D cryo-EM structure of the human spliceosomal C complex at 3.4 Å core resolution and 4.5-5.7 Å at its periphery, and aided by protein crosslinking we determine its molecular architecture. Our structure provides additional insights into the spliceosome's architecture between the catalytic steps of splicing, and how proteins aid formation of the spliceosome's catalytically active RNP (ribonucleoprotein) conformation. It reveals the spatial organization of the metazoan-specific proteins PPWD1, WDR70, FRG1, and CIR1 in human C complexes, indicating they stabilize functionally important protein domains and RNA structures rearranged/repositioned during the Bact to C transition. Structural comparisons with human Bact, C∗, and P complexes reveal an intricate cascade of RNP rearrangements during splicing catalysis, with intermediate RNP conformations not found in yeast, and additionally elucidate the structural basis for the sequential recruitment of metazoan-specific spliceosomal proteins.","Bertram, Karl; El Ayoubi, Leyla; Dybkov, Olexandr; Agafonov, Dmitry E; Will, Cindy L; Hartmuth, Klaus; Urlaub, Henning; Kastner, Berthold; Stark, Holger; Lührmann, Reinhard",Molecular cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007253/,59

METHODS Several databases were systematically searched in September 2017 for studies fulfilling the following criteria: trauma patients (Population); supplementary oxygen/high FiO2 (Intervention) versus no supplementary oxygen/low FiO2 (Control) for spontaneously breathing or intubated trauma patients, respectively, in the initial phase of treatment; mortality, complications, days on mechanical ventilation and/or length of stay (LOS) in hospital/intensive care unit (ICU) (Outcomes); prospective interventional trials (Study design). Two independent reviewers screened and identified studies and extracted data from included studies. RESULTS 6142 citations were screened with an inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa) of 0.88. One interventional trial of intubated trauma patients was included. 68 trauma patients were randomised to receive an FiO2 of 0.80 (intervention group) or 0.50 (control group) during mechanical ventilation (first 6 hours). There was no significant difference in hospital or ICU LOS between the groups. No patient died in either group. Another interventional trial, not strictly fulfilling the inclusion criteria, was presented for descriptive purposes. 21 trauma patients were alternately assigned to two types of mechanical ventilation (first 48 hours), both aiming at an FiO2 of 0.40, but resulted in estimated mean FiO2s of 0.45 (intervention group) and 0.60 (control group). No difference in days on mechanical ventilation was found. Two patients in the control group died, none in the intervention group. No prospective, interventional trials on spontaneously breathing trauma patients were identified. CONCLUSIONS Evidence for the use of supplementary oxygen for spontaneously breathing trauma patients is lacking, and the evidence for low versus high FiO2 for intubated trauma patients is limited.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between serum levels of IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), FoxO1 and mTORC1 and the components of metabolic syndrome (MS) and AV. METHODS This prospective case-control study was carried out on 89 participants, including 49 AV patients and 40 controls. The serum levels of IGF-1, IGFBP-3, insulin, FoxO1 and mTORC1 were measured along with the components of MS. RESULTS The blood pressure (BP) measures were significantly higher in the AV patients than in the controls (p = 0.001). The mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower in the AV patients than in the controls (p = 0.040). The numbers of accompanying MS components were significantly higher in the AV patients than in the controls (p = 0.001). The IGFBP-3 levels were significantly higher in the AV patients than in the controls (p = 0.02). The IGF-1, mTORC1 and FoxO1 levels were higher in the AV patients than in the controls; neither were statistically significant (p = 0.093, p = 0.741, p = 0.564; respectively). CONLUSIONS The higher BP and IGFBP-3 levels, the lower HDL-C levels and the common presence of MS components demand caution in terms of new therapeutic strategies and possible associated comorbidities.

As a mitigation entity, border security has been recorded by numerous scholarly works as being essential to the support of the health of the U.S. population. Consequently, the lack of current health care monitoring of the permeable U.S. border places the U.S. population at risk in the broad sectors of infectious disease and interpersonal violence. Visualizing border security in the context of public health mitigation has significant potential to protect migrant health as well as that of all populations on both sides of the border. Examples of how commonly this philosophy is held can be found in the expansive use of security-focused terms regarding public health. Using tools such as GIS to screen for disease in people before their entrance into a nation would be more efficient and ethical than treating patients once they have entered a population and increased the impact on the healthcare system.

115486,Automatic lung segmentation in COVID-19 patients: Impact on quantitative computed tomography analysis.,2021-06-07,"Preeclampsia (PE) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and impaired autonomic function, which is hypothesized to cause cerebral hemodynamic abnormalities. Our aim was to test this hypothesis by estimating the difference in the cerebrovascular response to breath holding (BH; known to cause sympathetic stimulation) between women with preeclampsia and a group of normotensive controls. In a prospective cohort analysis, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler), blood pressure (BP, noninvasive arterial volume clamping), and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) were simultaneously recorded during a 20-s breath hold maneuver. CBFV changes were broken down into standardized subcomponents describing the relative contributions of BP, cerebrovascular resistance index (CVRi), critical closing pressure (CrCP), and resistance area product (RAP). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for changes in relation to baseline values. A total of 25 preeclamptic (before treatment) and 25 normotensive women in the second half of pregnancy were enrolled, and, 21 patients in each group were included in the analysis. The increase in CBFV and EtCO2 was similar in both groups. However, the AUC for CVRi and RAP during BH was significantly different between the groups (3.05 ± 2.97 vs. -0.82 ± 4.98, P = 0.006 and 2.01 ± 4.49 vs. -2.02 ± 7.20, P = 0.037), indicating an early, transient increase in CVRi and RAP in the control group, which was absent in PE. BP had an equal contribution in both groups. Women with preeclampsia have an altered initial CVRi response to the BH maneuver. We propose that this is due to blunted sympathetic or myogenic cerebrovascular response in women with preeclampsia.","van Veen, Teelkien R; Panerai, Ronney B; Haeri, Sina; Zeeman, Gerda G; Belfort, Michael A",Journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00562.2014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25614597/,59

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of common mental disorders in widowed people in the community. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo were searched for papers reporting on prevalence of common mental disorders and widowhood. Eligible studies were included in random effects meta-analyses of the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. Subgroup analyses were performed on method of assessment of depression and age and sex. RESULTS The literature search identified 13,781 titles of which 42 were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression in studies using a screening scale was 40.6% (33.6%-47.6%) (n = 30). For studies using full diagnostic criteria the pooled prevalence of depression was 19.2% (13.4%-25.0%) (n = 12). Subgroup analyses of age (≥ or < 65) and sex did not show any differences regarding depression. Five studies reported the prevalence of anxiety disorders. The pooled prevalence estimate was 26.9% (8.1%-45.7%). LIMITATIONS The prevalence estimates in this study are summary estimates of prevalences from existing literature. Although the reporting bias assessment showed no evidence, there could be some reporting bias, as studies might only present results if there is a high prevalence.

Thanks to several strategies including donor screening and deferral, blood testing and pathogen inactivation, their risks have reached all-time low levels, particularly in developed nations. Nonetheless, new and emerging infections remain a threat that is likely to exacerbate in the coming years with continued globalization and climate change. More effective strategies of pathogen inactivation and more vigilant horizon screening are hoped to abate the risk. Additionally, allogeneic transfusion has repeatedly been shown to be associated with worsening of outcomes in patients, including the documented increased risk of infections (often nosocomial) in recipients of transfusions. The underlying mechanism is likely to be related to immunosuppressive effects of allogeneic blood, iron content, and bacterial contamination. This issue is best addressed by more judicious and evidence-based use of allogeneic blood components to ensure the potential benefits outweigh the risks.","Shander, Aryeh; Lobel, Gregg P; Javidroozi, Mazyar",Expert review of hematology,https://doi.org/10.1586/17474086.2016.1164593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26959944/,59
116435,Authors' response.,2017,"The captive breeding program for the endangered Puerto Rican crested toad (Peltophryne [Bufo] lemur) has been hampered by an undiagnosed condition called ""Brown Skin Disease"" (BSD). Toads develop widespread skin darkening, skin thickening and abnormal shedding and eventually succumb to a chronic loss of viability. This project evaluated the marine toad (Bufo marinus) as a model for the PRCT, examining vitamin A deficiency as a potential cause of BSD. Wild caught marine toads had significantly higher liver vitamin A concentrations (61.89 ± 63.49 µg/g) than captive born marine toads (0.58 ± 0.59 µg/g); P<0.001). A significant difference in serum vitamin A concentration was found between the captive and wild caught toads (P=0.013) and between the low vitamin A-fed and wild caught toads (P=0.004), when controlling for liver vitamin A concentrations. After captive toads were treated with topical and/or oral vitamin A, their hepatic vitamin A concentrations were similar to those of the wild toads, averaging 48.41 ± 37.03 µg/g. However, plasma vitamin A concentrations pre- and post-vitamin A supplementation did not differ statistically. We concluded that plasma vitamin A concentrations do not provide a linear indication of liver/body vitamin A status, and that both topical and oral supplementation with an oil-based vitamin A formulation can increase liver stores in amphibians. No evidence of BSD or other signs of deficiency were noted in the marine toads, although this feeding trial was relatively short (127 days). To date, clinical, pathological and research findings do not support vitamin A deficiency as a primary factor underlying BSD.","Berkvens, Charlene N; Lentini, Andrew; Dutton, Christopher J; Pearl, David L; Barker, Ian K; Crawshaw, Graham J",Zoo biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/zoo.21169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230391/,59

Methods Pre-post study investigating 2,999 telemedicine encounters: February 1, 2020-May 15, 2020, was performed. A total of 2,919 completed visits before and after strict social distancing implementation were analyzed for patient and provider characteristics, encounter characteristics (e.g., history and physical examination), and quality and safety metrics (phone calls ≤ 7 days postvisit, visit-cause-specific hospital admission or mortality ≤ 30 days after visit). Stratified analysis of 3 groups for outcomes (young age, neuromuscular diagnosis, and new encounters) was performed. Results Patients ranging from 1 month to 33 years of age were seen. Rural patients were less likely to be seen during the pandemic compared with urban patients (8% vs 90%; p < 0.0001); teaching clinic and specialty clinic encounters increased significantly during the pandemic (8% vs 3%; p = 0.005), and documentation of at least 2 systems on examination was noted significantly more frequently during the pandemic (13% vs 7%; p = 0.009). No deaths were reported. There were no differences before/during the pandemic in safety or telemedicine failure metrics within the entire group and high-risk subgroups. Conclusions Despite a markedly and rapidly expanded scope of ambulatory telemedicine care during the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine remained a safe and high-quality option for pediatric neurology patients. In addition, populations perceived as high risk for telemedicine (the very young, new patients, and those with neuromuscular diagnoses) can benefit from telemedicine visits, particularly when access to in-person care is limited.","Joshi, Charuta N; Yang, Michele L; Eschbach, Krista; Tong, Suhong; Jacobson, Mona P; Stillman, Chelsey; Kropp, Annmarie E; Shea, Stephanie A; Frunzi, Gerard M; Thomas, J Fred; Olson, Christina A",Neurology.

We report the application of and indication for the Williams-Isu method for OPLL and present our clinical and radiological results. METHODS Using the Williams-Isu method, we treated 17 patients with cervical OPLL; 15 had segmental- and 2 had continuous-type OPLL. The median follow-up term was 24 months. The patients underwent anterior decompression and fusion at a single level (n = 8) or at two levels (n = 9). As a control, 17 patients with cervical spondylosis underwent anterior single-level decompression and fusion using the Williams-Isu method. Pre- and postoperative radiographs of the cervical spine were obtained in all patients, and the alignment of the whole cervical and fused segment and the height of the fused segment were compared. RESULTS All but one patient experienced alleviation of clinical symptoms without deterioration during the follow-up period. The recovery rate on the JOA score was 71.7%. The patient with continuous-type OPLL suffered postoperative neurological deterioration because of a remnant of the upper-level OPLL. Radiological studies confirmed the absence of bone graft dislocation and fracture, and of satisfactory bone fusion in all patients. There was no significant difference between the two patient groups with respect to whole spine alignment and the alignment and height of the fused segment. CONCLUSIONS The Williams-Isu method is useful for treating not only cervical spondylosis but also cervical segmental OPLL at one or two levels.","Kim, Kyongsong; Isu, Toyohiko; Sugawara, Atsushi; Morimoto, Daijiro; Matsumoto, Ryoji; Isobe, Masanori; Mishina, Masahiro; Kobayashi, Shiro; Teramoto, Akira",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-009-0478-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19657579/,59

Infants and very young children are especially vulnerable. The 'Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease' observed an incidence rate for pneumococcal septicaemia of 10 per 100 person years in children under the age of three years. Vaccines, including customary pneumococcal vaccines, may be of limited use in this age group. Therefore, prophylactic penicillin regimens may be advisable for this population. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002, and previously updated, most recently in 2014. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis against pneumococcus in children with SCD in relation to:1. incidence of infection;2. mortality;3. drug-related adverse events (as reported in the included studies) to the individual and the community;4. the impact of discontinuing at various ages on incidence of infection and mortality. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and also two clinical trials registries: ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Registry Platform. Additionally, we carried out handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of the most recent search: 19 December 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antibiotics to prevent pneumococcal infection in children with SCD with placebo, no treatment or a comparator drug. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. The authors used the GRADE criteria to assess the quality of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS Five trials were identified by the searches, of which three trials (880 children randomised) met the inclusion criteria. All of the included trials showed a reduced incidence of infection in children with SCD (SS or Sβ0Thal) receiving prophylactic penicillin. In trials which investigated initiation of penicillin on risk of pneumococcal infection, the odds ratio was 0.37 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.86) (two trials, 457 children) (low-quality evidence), while for withdrawal the odds ratio was 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 2.71) (one trial, 400 children) (low-quality evidence). Adverse drug effects were rare and minor. Rates of pneumococcal infection were found to be relatively low in children over the age of five.Overall, the quality of the evidence for all outcomes was judged to be low. The results from the risk of bias assessment undertaken identified two domains in which the risk of bias was considered to be high, these were incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) (two trials) and allocation concealment (selection bias) (one trial). Domains considered to have a low risk of bias for all three trials were selective reporting (reporting bias) and blinding (performance and detection bias). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The evidence examined suggests that prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous SCD, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. Further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.","Rankine-Mullings, Angela E; Owusu-Ofori, Shirley",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd003427.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28994899/,59

METHODS Cross sectional survey data was collected from 2,068 parents in the Northeastern US. Parents reported personal and household experiences of COVID-19 stressors, their level of distress, and use of neglectful parenting and discipline practices for a randomly selected child in their home. Analyses estimated rates of COVID-19 related stress and parenting practices. Logistic regression was used to assess the relation of COVID-19 stress to parenting behaviors. RESULTS Individual and household stressor level, as well as distress were each positively associated with likelihood of neglect. Personal exposure to stressors was minimally related to discipline, but household stressor level and parents' distress were positively associated with harsh and positive discipline. DISCUSSION Indicators of COVID-19 stress (e.g., exposure to stressors and distress) each uniquely predicted parents' use of neglect, particularly physical and family-based sub-types, and use of harsh and positive discipline practices. Results suggest that parents may require additional support to provide appropriate care for their children while coping with the increased rates of stress associated with the pandemic and the resulting public health response.","Connell, Christian M; Strambler, Michael J",Child maltreatment,https://doi.org/10.1177/10775595211006465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787377/,59

METHODS We reviewed the medical records of subjects who underwent vaginal USLS using polyglyconate suture. Primary outcomes were suture complications and anatomic failures defined as recurrent apical prolapse stage 1 or greater. Secondary outcomes were subjective failures and reoperation rate for apical prolapse. RESULTS Fifty-seven out of 68 subjects who underwent USLS with polyglyconate suture over the study period were included in analysis. At median follow-up of 12 months, 3.5% had suture complications.

120170,Advances in Telemedicine in Ophthalmology.,2020-07-09,"Therapeutic hypothermia is widely used to treat neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injuries. However, potentially deleterious effects of delaying the induction of hypothermia and of rewarming on white matter injury remain unclear. We used a piglet model of HI to assess the effects of delayed hypothermia and rewarming on white matter apoptosis. Piglets underwent HI injury or sham surgery followed by normothermic or hypothermic recovery at 2h. Hypothermic groups were divided into those with no rewarming, slow rewarming at 0.5°C/h, or rapid rewarming at 4°C/h. Apoptotic cells in the subcortical white matter of the motor gyrus, corpus callosum, lateral olfactory tract, and internal capsule at 29h were identified morphologically and counted by hematoxylin & eosin staining. Cell death was verified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. White matter neurons were also counted, and apoptotic cells were immunophenotyped with the oligodendrocyte marker 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). Hypothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming increased apoptosis in the subcortical white matter relative to normothermia (p<0.05). The number of white matter neurons was not lower in groups with more apoptosis after hypothermia or rapid rewarming, indicating that the apoptosis occurred among glial cells. Hypothermic piglets had more apoptosis in the lateral olfactory tract than those that were rewarmed (p<0.05). The promotion of apoptosis by hypothermia and rewarming in these regions was independent of HI. In the corpus callosum, HI piglets had more apoptosis than shams after normothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming (p<0.05). Many apoptotic cells were myelinating oligodendrocytes identified by CNPase positivity. Our results indicate that delaying the induction of hypothermia and rewarming are associated with white matter apoptosis in a piglet model of HI; in some regions these temperature effects are independent of HI. Vulnerable cells include myelinating oligodendrocytes. This study identifies a deleterious effect of therapeutic hypothermia in the developing brain.","Wang, B; Armstrong, J S; Reyes, M; Kulikowicz, E; Lee, J-H; Spicer, D; Bhalala, U; Yang, Z-J; Koehler, R C; Martin, L J; Lee, J K",Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.12.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26739327/,59

120654,Restrictive Policies Threaten Efforts to Stop 2 West Virginia HIV Outbreaks.,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND Endoscopic surgery for infrarenal para-aortic lymphadenectomy has been widely accepted. Two major approaches, ""transperitoneal"" and ""extraperitoneal"", are generally used; however, they have several disadvantages. A ""transperitoneal"" approach to the left para-aortic region is usually indirect, often performed after wide extension of the right para-aortic region. An ""extraperitoneal"" approach is unsuitable when a peritoneal tear exists after a prior surgical procedure such as hysterectomy. Here, we propose a modified transperitoneal technique, ""Left dome formation (LDF),"" which directly provides a surgical field for left infrarenal para-aortic lymphadenectomy even after hysterectomy. METHODS The LDF procedure comprised three processes: (1) setting, (2) dissection of inframesenteric lymph nodes (step 1), and (3) dissection of infrarenal lymph nodes (step 2). SETTING two trocars were added 4 cm bilateral to the low-mid abdominal trocar that was used in prior hysterectomy. Step 1: The posterior layer of the renal fascia along with the left ureter and left ovarian vessel were separated from the left common iliac artery and iliopsoas. Left inframesentric nodes were removed from the surgical field. Step 2: The left ureter was isolated from the posterior renal fascia, and the dome was expanded cranially to the left renal vein, with the ovarian vein always visualizable at the dome ceiling. Left infrarenal nodes were removed. RESULTS We applied LDF to ten endometrial cancer patients, recommended for additional dissection of para-aortic nodes based on intraoperative evaluation using the laparoscopically removed uterus. The operative time and number of removed lymph nodes in Step 1 and Step 2 were 28.8 (20-49) min and 5.3 (2-10) and 54.6 (52-70) min and 6.5 (1-11), respectively. Blood loss was below 50 ml. No serious organ injury occurred during procedures. CONCLUSION Since the left ureter is always observable, LDF procedure facilitates effective surgery to overcome the anatomical complexity of the left para-aortic region and is potentially useful for sentinel node sampling.","Mizumoto, Yasunari; Iwadare, Junpei; Nakade, Kyohei; Obata, Takeshi; Matsumoto, Takeo; Kagami, Kyosuke; Iizuka, Takashi; Matsuoka, Ayumi; Ono, Masanori; Nakamura, Mitsuhiro; Fujiwara, Hiroshi",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07103-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489501/,59

A Systematic Review.,2021-04-01,"In the present study, we aimed to determine whether mice with coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE) develop neurogenic bladder dysfunction that is comparable with the neurogenic detrusor overactivity observed in patients with multiple sclerosis. Adult mice (C57BL/6J, 8 wk of age, n = 146) were inoculated with a neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus (A59 strain) and followed for 4 wk. Inoculation with the virus caused a significant neural deficit in mice with an average clinical symptom score of 2.6 ± 0.5 at 2 wk. These changes were accompanied by 25 ± 5% weight loss at 1 and 2 wk postinoculation (P ≤ 0.001 vs. baseline) followed by a recovery phase. Histological analysis of spinal cord sections revealed multifocal sites of demyelinated lesions. Assessment of micturition patterns by filter paper assay determined an increase in the number of small and large urine spots in CIE mice starting from the second week after inoculation. Cystometric recordings in unrestrained awake animals confirmed neurogenic bladder overactivity at 4 wk postinoculation. One week after inoculation with the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus, mice became increasingly sensitive to von Frey filament testing with responses enhanced by 45% (n = 8, P ≤ 0.05 vs. baseline at 4 g); however, this initial increase in sensitivity was followed by gradual and significant diminution of abdominal sensitivity to mechanical stimulation by 4 wk postinoculation.

To model the interaction between fat grafting and breast cancer cells, two approaches were employed. In the first approach, graded numbers of viable MDA-MB-231 or BT-474 cells were admixed directly into human fat grafts and injected subcutaneously into immune-deficient mice to determine if the healing graft is a supportive environment for the tumor. In the second approach, graded doses of MDA-MB-231 cells were suspended in Matrigel and injected into the mammary fat pads of mice. Two weeks after the tumor cells engrafted, 100 μL of human adipose tissue was grafted into the same site. Histologically, MDA-MB-231 cells seeded within fat grafts were observed and stained positive for human-specific pan-cytokeratin and Ki67. The BT-474 cells failed to survive when seeded within fat grafts at any dose. In the second approach, MDA-MB-231 cells had a strong trend toward lower Ki67 staining at all doses. Regression analysis on all groups with fat grafts and MDA-MB-231 revealed fat tissue was associated with lower cancer cell Ki67 staining. Healing fat grafts do not support the epithelial BT-474 cell growth, and support the mesenchymal MDA-MB-231 cell growth only at doses ten times greater than in Matrigel controls. Moreover, fat grafts in association with MDA-MB-231 cancer cells already present in the wound resulted in decreased tumor proliferation and increased fibrosis. These findings suggest that clinical fat grafting does not induce breast cancer cell growth, and may even have a suppressive effect.

Methods The technical skills, experience and pitfalls of laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients were described. These include perioperative care of patients' pulmonary function, patients' operating position and trocar placement, and the key steps and risks of laparoscopic HH repair in this special condition. Results Paraesophageal HHs were successfully laparoscopically repaired, and prolonged hospital stay was due to post-operative pulmonary complications. Conclusion These techniques are essential to minimise the perioperative complications in laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients, and great pulmonary care is required in these patients.","Li, Junsheng; Shao, Guoyi",Journal of minimal access surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/jmas.jmas_113_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29974871/,59

123288,"Moving From Just ""Thinking Outside the Box"" to Doing.",2021-01-28,"OBJECTIVES Language barriers limit healthcare access. However, professional interpretation usage is infrequent due to high cost and poor interpreter availability. Healthcare-oriented mobile applications are becoming more accepted and may help alleviate this burden. This literature review aims to better understand the utility of mobile technology in healthcare interpretation. Specifically, the objective of this review is to synthesize the feasibility, outcome, and challenges of implementing technological medical interpretation services. PATIENT INVOLVEMENT No patients were involved for this review. METHODS In December 2019, MEDLINE (Ovid) was systematically searched according to PRISMA guidelines. All articles discussing the utility of technology in healthcare interpretation encounters were included. RESULTS Two major themes emerged: 1) comparing video and phone interpretation with in-person interpretation and 2) assessing direct translation software in healthcare settings. Phone and video interpretation help reduce overall patient wait-times. Both patients and clinicians preferred in-person or video interpretation over interpretation by phone. Chief benefits of using direct translation software include immediate access, low costs, and sustainability. Several studies discussed potential translation inaccuracies and the importance of having professional interpreters in medico-legal discussions. CONCLUSION Mobile applications may be used to facilitate access to medical interpreters with high clinician and patient satisfaction. Direct in-app translations facilitate access but risk inaccuracies with important medico-legal considerations. PRACTICAL VALUE Mobile applications are available at low costs and can improve access to interpreters though video and phone calls. Mobile software can also provide direct translation and facilitate clinical care. Clinicians should prioritize face-to-face encounters with professional medical interpreters, whenever possible. In a time of social distancing amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is crucial value in elucidating the best telehealth interpretation practices.","Ji, Xinyu; Chow, Ellen; Abdelhamid, Kenzy; Naumova, Darya; Mate, Kedar K V; Bergeron, Amy; Lebouché, Bertrand",Patient education and counseling,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.02.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33653659/,59

123750,Early Warning Signs and Rapid Response on the Nursing Floor-Can We Do More?,2019,"The HIV-1 Gag protein playing a key role in HIV-1 viral assembly has recently been shown to interact through its nucleocapsid domain with the ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7) that acts as a cellular co-factor promoting Gag's nucleic acid (NA) chaperone activity. To further understand how the two proteins act together, we examined their mechanism individually and in concert to promote the annealing between dTAR, the DNA version of the viral transactivation element and its complementary cTAR sequence, taken as model HIV-1 sequences. Gag alone or complexed with RPL7 was found to act as a NA chaperone that destabilizes cTAR stem-loop and promotes its annealing with dTAR through the stem ends via a two-step pathway. In contrast, RPL7 alone acts as a NA annealer that through its NA aggregating properties promotes cTAR/dTAR annealing via two parallel pathways. Remarkably, in contrast to the isolated proteins, their complex promoted efficiently the annealing of cTAR with highly stable dTAR mutants. This was confirmed by the RPL7-promoted boost of the physiologically relevant Gag-chaperoned annealing of (+)PBS RNA to the highly stable tRNALys3 primer, favoring the notion that Gag recruits RPL7 to overcome major roadblocks in viral assembly.","Karnib, Hassan; Nadeem, Muhammad F; Humbert, Nicolas; Sharma, Kamal K; Grytsyk, Natalia; Tisné, Carine; Boutant, Emmanuel; Lequeu, Thiebault; Réal, Eleonore; Boudier, Christian; de Rocquigny, Hugues; Mély, Yves",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797159/,59

The understanding of the key role of functional brain alterations in the generation of chronic pain has led researchers to focus on pain treatments that target brain activity. Electroencephalographic neurofeedback attempts to modulate the power of maladaptive electroencephalography frequency powers to decrease chronic pain. Although several studies have provided promising evidence, the effect of electroencephalographic neurofeedback on chronic pain is uncertain. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence from randomized controlled trials to evaluate the analgesic effect of electroencephalographic neurofeedback. In addition, we will synthesize the findings of nonrandomized studies in a narrative review. METHODS We will apply the search strategy in 5 electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL) for published studies and in clinical trial registries for completed unpublished studies. We will include studies that used electroencephalographic neurofeedback as an intervention for people with chronic pain. Risk-of-bias tools will be used to assess methodological quality of the included studies. We will include randomized controlled trials if they have compared electroencephalographic neurofeedback with any other intervention or placebo control. The data from randomized controlled trials will be aggregated to perform a meta-analysis for quantitative synthesis. The primary outcome measure is pain intensity assessed by self-report scales. Secondary outcome measures include depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep quality measured by self-reported questionnaires. We will investigate the studies for additional outcomes addressing adverse effects and resting-state electroencephalography analysis. Additionally, all types of nonrandomized studies will be included for a narrative synthesis. The intended and unintended effects of nonrandomized studies will be extracted and summarized in a descriptive table. RESULTS Ethics approval is not required for a systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in July 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021.

Although 3-tesla (3T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the gold-standard modality for structural and functional imaging, most centers refrain from 3T imaging in patients with DBS devices in place because of safety concerns. 3T MRI could be used not only for structural imaging, but also for functional MRI to study the effects of DBS on neurocircuitry and optimize programming. OBJECTIVE To use an anthropomorphic phantom design to perform temperature and voltage safety testing on an activated DBS device during 3T imaging. METHODS An anthropomorphic 3D-printed human phantom was constructed and used to perform temperature and voltage testing on a DBS device during 3T MRI. Based on the phantom assessment, a cohort study was conducted in which 6 human patients underwent MRI with their DBS device in an activated (ON) state. RESULTS During the phantom study, temperature rises were under 2°C during all sequences, with the DBS in both the deactivated and activated states. Radiofrequency pulses from the MRI appeared to modulate the electrical discharge from the DBS, resulting in slight fluctuations of voltage amplitude. Six human subjects underwent MRI with their DBS in an activated state without any serious adverse events. One patient experienced stimulation-related side effects during T1-MPRAGE scanning with the DBS in an ON state because of radiofrequency-induced modulation of voltage amplitude. CONCLUSION Following careful phantom-based safety testing, 3T structural and functional MRI can be safely performed in subjects with activated deep brain stimulators.","Davidson, Benjamin; Tam, Fred; Yang, Benson; Meng, Ying; Hamani, Clement; Graham, Simon J; Lipsman, Nir",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyaa439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045736/,59

Methods Pregnant and non-pregnant mice were injected with endotoxin or saline on 16.5 days post coitum (n=8-11 per group). The uterus, cervix, liver, adrenal gland, kidney, lung, and brain were collected 12 h after injection and transcriptomes were measured using microarrays. Heatmaps and principal component analysis were used for visualization. Differentially expressed genes between groups were assessed using linear models that included interaction terms to determine whether the effect of infection differed with pregnancy status. Pathway analysis was conducted to interpret gene expression changes. Results We report herein a multi-organ atlas of the transcript perturbations in pregnant and non-pregnant mice in response to endotoxin. Pregnancy strongly modified the host responses to endotoxin in the uterus, cervix, and liver. In contrast, pregnancy had a milder effect on the host response to endotoxin in the adrenal gland, lung, and kidney. However, pregnancy did not drastically affect the host response to endotoxin in the brain. Conclusions Pregnancy imprints organ-specific host immune responses upon endotoxin exposure. These findings provide insight into the host-response against microbes during pregnancy.","Motomura, Kenichiro; Romero, Roberto; Tarca, Adi L; Galaz, Jose; Bhatti, Gaurav; Done, Bogdan; Arenas-Hernandez, Marcia; Levenson, Dustyn; Slutsky, Rebecca; Hsu, Chaur-Dong; Gomez-Lopez, Nardhy",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866128/,59

To address this issue, we previously reported our MIE technique with Ivor-Lewis anastomosis. Here we present the video to introduce our TLE-chest operation procedures. METHODS TLE-chest with a combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic technique was performed by one group of surgeons. From October 2011 to September 2013, 80 esophageal cancer patients were treated with TLE-chest using this improved anastomotic technique. RESULTS The surgery was successful for all patients, although the anastomosis in one patient required intraoperative manual repair. No patients required open conversion. In this video, dissociation of stomach, and dissection of lymph nodes, creation of gastric tube and staple line embedding, jejunostomy were carried out by laparoscopic surgery. Dissection of esophageal cancer and mediastinal lymph nodes were done through rib 3 or 4 by a 3-4 cm video-assisted right anterior minithoracotomy, then esophago-gastric anastomosis was performed in right thoracic cavity This video shows the R0 resection of T3N0M0 esophageal cancer. Totally, 36 lymph nodes were dissected, including 21 mediastinal lymph nodes and 15 abdominal lymph nodes.

Study quality was found to be highly variable, ranging from 38% to 90% based on scores from a purpose-designed quality assessment tool. In general, relatively high consistency and clarity was observed in the reporting of the research question, reasons for using this methodology and justifying the need for the study. However, weaknesses were observed in other areas including justifying stakeholders, reporting sample sizes, undertaking sensitivity analysis and reporting unexpected or negative outcomes. Most papers cited links to additional materials to aid in reporting. There was little evidence that academics had innovated or advanced the methodology beyond that outlined in a much-cited SROI guide. CONCLUSION Academics have thus far been slow to adopt SROI methodology in the evaluation of health and social care interventions, and there is little evidence of innovation and development of the methodology. The word count requirements of peer-reviewed journals may make it difficult for authors to be fully transparent about the details of their studies, potentially impacting the quality of reporting in those studies published in these journals.

128084,Effectiveness of a Delirium Prevention Initiative on an Inpatient Neuroscience Unit.,2021-02-17,"Packaging is necessary for preserving and delivering products and has significant impacts on human health and the environment. Particle matter (PM) may be released from packages and transferred to the air during a typical peeling process, but little is known about this package-to-air migration route of particles. Here, we investigated the emission profiles of total and biological particles, and the horizontal and vertical dispersion abilities and community structure of viable microbes released from packaging to the air by peeling. The results revealed that a lot of inhalable particles and viable microbes were released from package to the air in different migration directions, and this migration can be regulated by several factors including package material, effective peeling area, peeling speed and angles, as well as the characteristics of the migrant itself. Dispersal of package-borne viable microbes provides direct evidence that viable microbes, including pathogens, can survive the aerosolization caused by peeling and be transferred to air over different distances while remaining alive. Based on the experimental data and visual proof in movies, we speculate that nonbiological particles are package fibers fractured and released to air by the external peeling force exerted on the package and that microbe dispersal is attributed to surface-borne microbe suspension by vibration caused by the peeling force. This investigation provides new information that aerosolized particles can deliver package-borne substances and viable microbes from packaging to the ambient environment, motivating further studies to characterize the health effects of such aerosolized particles and the geographic migration of microbes via packaging.","Han, Ruining; Yu, Chenglin; Tang, Xuening; Yu, Song; Song, Min; Shen, Fangxia; Fu, Pingqing; Hu, Wei; Du, Lin; Wang, Xinfeng; Herrmann, Hartmut; Wu, Yan",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34051562/,59

Studies on large and small cohorts of IEI reported a huge variability clinical manifestations associated to SARS-Cov-2, ranging from asymptomatic, mild, moderate/severe to death. A great impulse to improve remote assistance programs and to switch to home-based treatment to reduce mobility and face to face contacts has been implemented. Areas covered: The authors completed a comprehensive review of the literature by searching the PubMed database for studies on large and small cohorts and case reports of IEI patients with COVID-19, with the aim to provide useful information for their clinical management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Expert opinion: Surprisingly, a low number of IEI patients affected by SARS-Cov-2 were reported with a risk to die for COVID-19 overlapping that of the general population. The low number might be explained by the choice of most physicians to inform early in the pandemic about safety measures, to switch most of the IEI patients to home therapy and to remote assistance. The guidelines issued by the scientific societies and periodically updated, represent the best tool for the clinical management of IEI patients.","Quinti, Isabella; Mezzaroma, Ivano; Milito, Cinzia",Expert review of clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1744666x.2021.1873767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412960/,59

PURPOSE Using resource dependency theory, Porter's Five Forces of Competition framework, and Altman's Z-score model, this study examines the relationship between market factors and nursing home financial distress. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH This study utilizes Medicare Cost Reports, LTCFocus, Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, Online Survey Certification and Reporting, and the Area Health Resource File to examine an average of 10,454 nursing homes per year from 2000 to 2015. Using Porter's framework, market factors were conceptualized as the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, threat of substitutes and new entrants, and industry rivalry. Organizational control variables include occupancy, payer mix, size, and chain affiliation. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression with robust clustering, year, and state fixed effects. RESULTS Distressed nursing homes (Relative Risk Ratios [RRR] = 0.991) were less likely to be in counties with higher Medicaid concentration. Distressed (RRR = 0.717) and at-risk-of-distress nursing homes (RRR = 0.807) were less likely to be in markets with home health agencies, and nursing homes at risk of distress (RRR = 1.005) were more likely to be in markets with a higher number of hospital-based skilled nursing facility beds compared to healthy organizations. The organizational-level variables, occupancy, payer mix, size, and chain affiliation had a significant impact on nursing home financial distress. CONCLUSIONS The effects of external market forces on nursing home financial distress were limited; however, organizational-level variables had a significant impact on nursing home financial distress. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS Study findings can inform policy makers on specific factors associated with nursing home financial distress and provide greater insight as it relates to designing new policies and interventions.","Lord, Justin; Weech-Maldonado, Robert; Blackburn, Justin; Carroll, Nathaniel",Health care management review,https://doi.org/10.1097/hmr.0000000000000297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181555/,59
128426,Predictive value of the morphology of proximal tibiofibular joint for total knee replacement in patients with knee osteoarthritis.,2020-09-17,"PURPOSE Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) refers to coronavirus disease secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection mainly affecting the human respiratory system. The SARS-CoV2 has been reported to have neurotropic and neuroinvasive features and neurological sequalae with wide range of reported neurological manifestations, including cerebrovascular disease, skeletal muscle injury, meningitis, encephalitis, and demyelination, as well as seizures and focal status epilepticus. In this case series, we analyzed the continuous video-EEGs of patients with COVID-19 infection to determine the presence of specific EEG features or epileptogenicity. METHODS All continuous video-EEG tracings done on SARS-CoV2-positive patients during a 2-week period from April 5, 2020, to April 19, 2020, were reviewed. The demographics, clinical characteristics, imaging, and EEG features were analyzed and presented. RESULTS Of 23 patients undergoing continuous video-EEG, 16 were COVID positive and were included. Continuous video-EEG monitoring was ordered for ""altered mental status"" in 11 of 16 patients and for ""clinical seizure"" in 5 of 16 patients. None of the patients had seizures or status epilepticus as a presenting symptom of COVID-19 infection. Instead, witnessed clinical seizures developed as results of COVID-19-related medical illness(es): anoxic brain injury, stroke/hemorrhage, lithium (Li) toxicity (because of kidney failure), hypertension, and renal disease. Three patients required therapeutic burst suppression because of focal nonconvulsive status epilepticus, status epilepticus/myoclonus secondary to anoxic injury from cardiac arrest, and one for sedation (and with concomitant EEG abnormalities secondary to Li toxicity). CONCLUSIONS In this observational case series of 16 patients with COVID-19 who were monitored with continuous video-EEG, most patients experienced a nonspecific encephalopathy. Clinical seizures and electrographic status epilepticus were the second most commonly observed neurological problem.","Zafar, Saman; Aydemir, Seyhmus; Karceski, Steve; Doria, Joseph W; Schaefer, Candace; Swarnkar, Rohit; Afra, Pegah",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnp.0000000000000832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606430/,59

129245,Five reasons why COVID herd immunity is probably impossible.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Neurosurgical emergencies are an important cause of disability and mortality. OBJECTIVE To examine the nationwide burden of neurological conditions requiring emergency neurosurgery. METHODS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2002-2011) was queried to identify adult patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of a neurosurgical condition who were admitted urgently/emergently or through a trauma center and underwent surgical intervention within 2 days of admission. Diagnostic groups were ranked based on their inpatient complication and mortality burden, and their contribution to total complications, deaths, hospital charges, and length of stay (LOS) was assessed. All analyses were weighted to produce national estimates. RESULTS After application of discharge weights, 810 404 patients who underwent emergency neurosurgery were identified. The average complication rate for the entire sample was 8.8%, the mortality rate was 11.2%, average charges were $106 802, and average LOS was 9.0 days. The top 4 diagnostic groups ranked by complication/mortality burden accounted for 76% of all complications, 96% of all deaths, 81% of all charges, and 82% of all days in the hospital for the entire study sample. This was equal to 62 648 complications, 86 683 deaths, $69 billion in charges, and 5962 932 days. These 4 diagnostic groups included (1) acute cerebrovascular disease, (2) intracranial injury, (3) spinal cord injury, and (4) occlusion or stenosis of precerebral arteries. CONCLUSION Acute cerebrovascular disease, intracranial injury, spinal cord injury, and occlusion/stenosis of precerebral arteries requiring emergency neurosurgery carry an important nationwide burden in terms of complications, deaths, charges, and LOS. Efforts in prevention and/or treatment of these conditions should continue.","De la Garza Ramos, Rafael; Goodwin, C Rory; Nakhla, Jonathan; Nasser, Rani; Yassari, Reza; Flamm, Eugene S; Bydon, Ali; Colby, Geoffrey; Sciubba, Daniel M",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyx055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327940/,59
129293,Covid-19: control measures must be equitable and inclusive.,2020-03-20,"From 1997 through 2007, human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses resulted in rare, sporadic, severe and fatal cases among persons in 14 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa. Of 369 reported human H5N1 cases that occurred from 1997 through 2007, overall mortality was 60%. Ten antigenically and genetically distinct clades of H5N1 viruses have been identified to date, and strains from four clades have infected humans. Surveillance has focused upon hospitalized cases of febrile acute lower respiratory tract disease among persons with exposure to sick or dead poultry, or to a human H5N1 case. Detection of H5N1 virus infection is based primarily upon collection of respiratory tract specimens from suspected cases for RT-PCR testing. Most human H5N1 cases were previously healthy children or young adults who developed severe acute pulmonary or multi-organ disease following direct or close contact with sick or dead H5N1 virus-infected poultry. Occasional clusters of H5N1 cases have occurred, predominantly among blood-related family members. Limited human-to-human H5N1 virus transmission has been reported or could not be excluded in some clusters. The frequency of asymptomatic or clinically mild H5N1 virus infection is unknown, but limited investigations suggest that such infections have been rare since 2003. There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human H5N1 virus spread. However, H5N1 viruses continue to circulate and evolve among poultry in many countries, and there are many unanswered questions about human infection with H5N1 viruses. Thus, the pandemic influenza threat presented by H5N1 viruses persists.","Uyeki, Timothy M",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01246.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18366524/,59
129471,Are we ready for a new era of high-impact and high-frequency epidemics?,2020-04-01,"Following T cell encounter with Ag, multiple signals are integrated to collectively induce distinct differentiation programs within Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell populations. Several factors contribute to these cell fate decisions, including the amount and duration of Ag, exposure to inflammatory cytokines, and degree of ligation of cosignaling molecules. The ICOS is not expressed on resting T cells but is rapidly upregulated upon encounter with Ag. However, the impact of ICOS signaling on programmed differentiation is not well understood. In this study, we therefore sought to determine the role of ICOS signaling on CD8(+) T cell programmed differentiation. Through the creation of novel ICOS retrogenic Ag-specific TCR-transgenic CD8(+) T cells, we interrogated the phenotype, functionality, and recall potential of CD8(+) T cells that receive early and sustained ICOS signaling during Ag exposure. Our results reveal that these ICOS signals critically impacted cell fate decisions of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells, resulting in increased frequencies of KLRG-1(hi)CD127(lo) cells, altered BLIMP-1, T-bet, and eomesodermin expression, and increased cytolytic capacity as compared with empty vector controls. Interestingly, however, ICOS retrogenic CD8(+) T cells also preferentially homed to nonlymphoid organs and exhibited reduced multicytokine functionality and reduced ability to mount secondary recall responses upon challenge in vivo. In sum, our results suggest that an altered differentiation program is induced following early and sustained ICOS expression, resulting in the generation of more cytolyticly potent, terminally differentiated effectors that possess limited capacity for recall response.","Liu, Danya; Burd, Eileen M; Coopersmith, Craig M; Ford, Mandy L",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1500218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26729800/,59

130310,Preclinical development of artificial tears based on an extract of Artemia salina containing dinucleotides in rabbits.,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND Several pharmacokinetic models are available for dexmedetomidine, but these have been shown to underestimate plasma concentrations. Most were developed with data from patients during the postoperative phase and/or in intensive care, making them susceptible to errors due to drug interactions. The aim of this study is to improve on existing models using data from healthy volunteers. METHODS After local ethics committee approval, the authors recruited 18 volunteers, who received a dexmedetomidine target-controlled infusion with increasing target concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 ng/ml, repeated in two sessions, at least 1 week apart. Each level was maintained for 30 min. If one of the predefined safety criteria was breached, the infusion was terminated and the recovery period began. Arterial blood samples were collected at preset times, and NONMEM (Icon plc, Ireland) was used for model development. RESULTS The age, weight, and body mass index ranges of the 18 volunteers (9 male and 9 female) were 20 to 70 yr, 51 to 110 kg, and 20.6 to 29.3 kg/m, respectively. A three-compartment allometric model was developed, with the following estimated parameters for an individual of 70 kg: V1 = 1.78 l, V2 = 30.3 l, V3 = 52.0 l, CL = 0.686 l/min, Q2 = 2.98 l/min, and Q3 = 0.602 l/min. The predictive performance as calculated by the median absolute performance error and median performance error was better than that of existing models. CONCLUSIONS Using target-controlled infusion in healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine were best described by a three-compartment allometric model. Apart from weight, no other covariates were identified.","Hannivoort, Laura N; Eleveld, Douglas J; Proost, Johannes H; Reyntjens, Koen M E M; Absalom, Anthony R; Vereecke, Hugo E M; Struys, Michel M R F",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000000740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26068206/,59
130444,COVID19 and the city; from the short term to the long term.,2020-08-13,"Type I interferons (IFNs) IFN-α/β play an important role in innate immunity against viral infections by inducing antiviral responses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) inhibits the synthesis of type I IFNs. However, whether PRRSV can inhibit IFN signaling is less well understood. In the present study, we found that PRRSV interferes with the IFN signaling pathway. The transcript levels of IFN-stimulated genes ISG15 and ISG56 and protein level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) in PRRSV VR2385-infected MARC-145 cells were significantly lower than those in mock-infected cells after IFN-α treatment. IFN-induced phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 and their heterodimer formation in the PRRSV-infected cells were not affected. However, the majority of the STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 (IFN regulatory factor 9) heterotrimers remained in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected cells, which indicates that the nuclear translocation of the heterotrimers was blocked. Overexpression of NSP1β of PRRSV VR2385 inhibited expression of ISG15 and ISG56 and blocked nuclear translocation of STAT1, which suggests that NSP1β might be the viral protein responsible for the inhibition of IFN signaling. PRRSV infection in primary porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) also inhibited IFN-α-stimulated expression of the ISGs and the STAT2 protein. In contrast, a licensed low-virulence vaccine strain, Ingelvac PRRS modified live virus (MLV), activated expression of IFN-inducible genes, including those of chemokines and antiviral proteins, in PAMs without the addition of external IFN and had no detectable effect on IFN signaling. These findings suggest that PRRSV interferes with the activation and signaling pathway of type I IFNs by blocking ISG factor 3 (ISGF3) nuclear translocation.","Patel, Deendayal; Nan, Yuchen; Shen, Meiyan; Ritthipichai, Krit; Zhu, Xiaoping; Zhang, Yan-Jin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00655-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739522/,59

However, there is no established gold standard for its treatment. Bupropion is a norepinephrine and a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and has been implicated as a potential treatment for POTS. We performed a non-randomized retrospective chart review on 47 patients with POTS with statistical analysis evaluating for significant findings including reduced orthostasis and improvement of symptoms with the use of bupropion. Bupropion was not associated with a statistically significant improvement in orthostatic vitals but there was an overall reduction in reported syncope. While the use of bupropion does not show a statistically significant impact on orthostatic vitals in patients with POTS, it did show a degree of improvement in syncope and as such might be useful in patients with syncope-predominant POTS.","Vyas, Rohit; Nesheiwat, Zeid; Ruzieh, Mohammed; Ammari, Zaid; Al-Sarie, Mohammad; Grubb, Blair",Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-001272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32606041/,59

Previous work has explored the benefits of effective veterinary teamwork for multiple stakeholders. In this teaching tip article, we outline the underlying educational theories and tips for developing inter-professional teaching to foster students' appreciation of the different roles and responsibilities of veterinarians and veterinary nurses/vet techs. Inter-professional education (IPE) requires students to learn with, about, and from each other and implies recognition of social learning as an underpinning approach. It involves developing learning opportunities to address students' potential misunderstandings of each other's motivations, to allow them to explore issues present in the other profession's practice, and to clarify sometimes overlapping roles and responsibilities. Students are given opportunities to explore the complexity of inter-professional teamwork in a safe environment using real-life topics as context for their collaboration. Two veterinary examples of IPE at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) are provided to explore different teaching methods and topics that have proved successful in our context: dentistry and directed learning scenarios. We describe how RVC has developed an IPE team consisting of faculty members who champion IPE, which has, in turn, inspired students to create a student-led IPE club, hosting extracurricular educational events. This is an example of an effective student-teacher partnership. A number of challenges exist in embedding IPE, but the benefits it offers in integrating clinical and professional elements of the curricula make it worthy of consideration.","Lumbis, Rachel; Langridge, Alison; Serlin, Ruth; Kinnison, Tierney",Journal of veterinary medical education,https://doi.org/10.3138/jvme.2019-0038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594955/,59

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of physical self-efficacy on the psychological well-being and organizational citizenship behavior among hotel employees and the moderating effects of leisure-time physical activity on the relationships between the previously mentioned variables. To achieve the research purpose, 346 hotel employees working at the room, food, beverage, and kitchen departments of 10 hotels located in Seoul, South Korea, participated in the study. The researchers visited their department meetings and provided a brief description of the present study and informed consent forms to participate in the study. After obtaining written informed consent forms, the researchers distributed the surveys and asked participants to complete them. Several statistical analyses, including descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for examining the hypothesized model's psychometric properties, and structural equation modeling (SEM) for testing the hypotheses were conducted using SPSS Ver. 23.0 and AMOS 23.0. Results revealed that perceived physical ability and self-presentation confidence, and psychological well-being positively affected organizational citizenship behavior. Perceived physical ability also had a positive effect on psychological well-being. Lastly, leisure-time physical activity had a partial moderating role in the relationships between the variables mentioned above. This study suggests that promoting employees' participation in leisure-time physical activity is needed to improve service workers' organizational citizenship behavior via physical self-efficacy and psychological well-being enhancement.","Kang, Ji-Hoon; Ji, Yun-Ho; Baek, Woo-Yeul; Byon, Kevin K",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17238856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260502/,59

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between selenium status in the body and incidence and mortality of CVD by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials. Methods: A systematic search for articles in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and Cochrane library (Wiley) was conducted. Thirteen of the 1811 articles obtained from the databases met our inclusion criteria and were considered in the final analysis. The effect sizes were presented as weighted relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects model. To detect dose-response relationships, we used meta-regression. Results: Overall, there was a reduced risk of CVD incidence (RR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.40-1.09) and mortality (RR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.84) in physiologically high selenium status compared to low selenium status in the body. There was a 15% (RR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.94) decreased risk of CVD incidence per 10 µg increment in blood selenium concentration. In addition, a statistically significantly nonlinear dose-response relationship was found between CVD mortality and increased blood selenium concentration with the lowest risk at the 30-35 µg increment in blood selenium. Conclusions: Physiologically high selenium levels in the body are associated with decreased risk for CVD incidence and mortality, however, people should be cautious about the potential harmful effects from excessive intake of selenium.","Kuria, Angelica; Tian, Hongdou; Li, Mei; Wang, Yinhe; Aaseth, Jan Olav; Zang, Jiajie; Cao, Yang",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2020.1803200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799545/,59

This study aimed to estimate the excess deaths and their differences in adults 20 years and older in Manaus (Amazonas State), Fortaleza (Ceará State), Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo, according to place of death, demographic characteristics, and trajectory over time. The data were obtained from the Mortality Information System and the Central Information Office of the National Civil Registry. The estimates of expected deaths were obtained from quasi-Poisson generalized additive models, adjusting for overdispersion. From February 23 to June 13, 2020, 74,410 natural deaths were recorded in the four cities, with 46% excess deaths (95%CI: 44-47). The largest amount of excess deaths was in Manaus, with 112% (95%CI: 103-121), followed by Fortaleza with 72% (95%CI: 67-78), Rio de Janeiro with 42% (95%CI: 40-45), and São Paulo with 34% (95%CI: 32-36). Excess deaths were greater in males and non-significant in Epidemiologic Weeks (EW) 9-12, except in São Paulo, 10% (95%CI: 6-14). The peak in excess deaths generally occurred in EW 17-20.

The high percentages of excess deaths, deaths not explained directly by COVID-19, and deaths outside the hospital suggest high underreporting of deaths from COVID-19 and reinforce the extensive spread of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the need for epidemiological surveillance services to review all causes of deaths associated with respiratory symptoms.","Orellana, Jesem Douglas Yamall; Cunha, Geraldo Marcelo da; Marrero, Lihsieh; Moreira, Ronaldo Ismerio; Leite, Iuri da Costa; Horta, Bernardo Lessa",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00259120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566992/,59

Cochlear implant (CI) surgery is routinely performed under general anaesthesia (GA), precluding patients who have higher risk associated with GA. Recent literature describes the safety and efficacy of performing unilateral CI surgery under local anaesthesia (LA). We report the first simultaneous bilateral CI under LA in the UK in an adult patient with profound sensorineural deafness and visual impairment. Case study: A 46-year-old gentleman, registered blind, presented with a 20-year history of bilateral progressive hearing loss. He was assessed as unfit for surgery under GA due to significant cardiac comorbidities. We performed simultaneous bilateral CI surgery under LA on the patient; he was discharged home the following day. Postoperative free field audiometry showed a significant improvement; speech discrimination using Bamford, Kowal and Bench sentences presented in quiet, increased from 0% pre-operatively to 100% four months post-operatively. Conclusion: Simultaneous bilateral CI surgery under LA is a safe and feasible procedure for eligible patients who may otherwise have been denied surgery due to their GA risk.","Abrar, Rohma; Mawman, Deborah; Martinez de Estibariz, Unai; Datta, Devjay; Stapleton, Emma",Cochlear implants international,https://doi.org/10.1080/14670100.2020.1851498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33272141/,59
134103,Gallbladder needle decompression during radiofrequency ablation of an adjacent liver tumour.,2012,"BACKGROUND The burden and impact of secondary superadded infections in critically ill coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients is widely acknowledged. However, there is a dearth of information regarding the impact of COVID-19 in patients with tuberculosis, HIV, chronic hepatitis, and other concurrent infections. This review was conducted to evaluate the consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with concurrent co-infections based on the publications reported to date. METHODS An extensive comprehensive screening was conducted using electronic databases up to 3rd September 2020 after obtaining registration with PROSPERO (CRD420202064800). The observational studies or interventional studies in English, evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with concurrent infections are included for the meta-analyses. RESULTS Our search retrieved 20 studies, with a total of 205,702 patients. Patients with Tuberculosis (RR =2.10, 95% CI: 1.75 to 2.51, I2 =0%), Influenza (RR =2.04, 95% CI: 0.15 to 28.25, I2 =99%) have an increased risk of mortality during a co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. No significant impact is found in people living with HIV (RR =0.99, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.19, I2 =30%), Chronic hepatitis (RR =1.15, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.81, I2 =10%). Several countries (Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Singapore) are on the verge of a Dengue co epidemic (cumulative 878496 and 5028380 cases of Dengue and Covid-19 respectively) CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 in patients of concurrent infections with either Tuberculosis or Influenza is detrimental.

There is limited data on the influence of demographics, risk factors, and hematologic function on outcomes in COVID-19 stroke patients. Methods All patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke tested for COVID-19 and treated from March 13 through May 19, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. COVID+ patients were compared to COVID- patients and a historical cohort from 2019. Results 84 patients with radiographic acute stroke from the 2020 study period and 152 patients in the historical cohort were included. Stroke incidence in COVID+ patients was 1.5%, with a significant decline in total stroke presentations during this period compared to 2019. 37 patients were COVID+ and 47 patients were COVID-. 32% of COVID+ stroke patients were Hispanic compared to 15% and 18% in the COVID- and 2019 cohorts respectively (p = 0.069 and 0.07). COVID+ stroke patients were younger, had higher rates of hemorrhagic conversion (p = 0.034), higher initial NIHSS (p < 0.001), increased cryptogenic stroke mechanism (p = 0.02), and higher mortality independent of COVID-19 severity. COVID+ patients had higher rates of thrombocytopenia (p = 0.02), and were less likely to be on antiplatelet therapy (p = 0.025). In multivariable analysis, only COVID-19 status independently predicted mortality. Conclusions COVID status, independent of severity, was significantly associated with higher mortality in stroke patients. COVID+ stroke patients were younger and less likely to be on antiplatelets, with higher rates of thrombocytopenia, suggesting a possible role for antiplatelet use in this population.","Ramos, Alexander D; Koyfman, Feliks; Byrns, Kory; Wu, Alan; Yasen, Jay; Elreda, Lauren; Boddu, Srikanth; Pishanidar, Sammy; Allen, Baxter; Juthani, Rupa G",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941874421990545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567389/,59
134504,"COMPARE Analysis, a Bioinformatic Approach to Accelerate Drug Repurposing against Covid-19 and Other Emerging Epidemics.",2020-12-02,"INTRODUCTION Arachnoid cysts are benign cerebrospinal fluid collection within a duplication of arachnoid membrane and, when found in the retrocerebellar site, they may be associated with tonsils herniation. This rare situation of coexisting retrocerebellar arachnoid cyst (AC) and Chiari malformation type 1 (CM-1) have been previously reported in few cases (10 patients) with syringomyelia and hydrocephalus described to be the most relevant issues. The aim of this paper is to describe 3 pediatric cases of this condition with a systematic review of the literature, underlining the importance of surgical management tailored to the pathogenic mechanism. RESULTS A case of a 10 months-old baby with coexisting AC and CM-1 with tri-ventricular hydrocephalus treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy, a case of 1 a year-old baby with a huge retrocerebellar AC and CM-1 treated with a cysto-peritoneal shunt and a case of a 15 years old with retrocerebellar AC causing symptomatic CM-1 treated with C0-C2 decompression, AC fenestration and duraplasty have been described. A long-term follow-up have been reported. CONCLUSION Surgical management of coexisting ACs and CM-1 should not aim at the complete resolution of the cyst or of tonsils herniation, especially when pediatric patients are treated. Rather, the purpose of neurosurgeon should be to understand the underlying pathogenic mechanism and, then, restoring both the CSF flow in the posterior fossa and the dynamic equilibrium between ventricles, cyst and subarachnoid space.","Di Perna, Giuseppe; Piatelli, Gianluca; Rossi, Andrea; Consales, Alessandro; Fiaschi, Pietro; Castaldo, Margherita; Pavanello, Marco",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.12.094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385608/,59

Although continuous renal replacement therapy is the standard of care for critically ill patients, prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy (PIRRT) may be a feasible option. We aimed to describe the tolerability and security of PIRRT treatments in COVID-19 patients with ARDS who required mechanical ventilation and developed severe AKI. METHODS We prospectively analyzed patients who underwent PIRRT treatments at a COVID-19 reference hospital in Mexico City. Intradialytic hypotension was defined as a systolic blood pressure decrease of ≥20 mm Hg or an increase of 100% in vasopressor dose. RESULTS We identified 136 AKI cases (60.7%) in 224 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Among them, 21 (15%) underwent PIRRT (130 sessions) due to stage 3 AKI. The median age of the cohort was 49 (range 36-73) years, 17 (81%) were male, 7 (33%) had diabetes, and the median time between symptoms onset and PIRRT initiation was 12 (interquartile range [IQR] 7-14) days. The median of PIRRT procedures for each patient was 5 (IQR 4-9) sessions. In 108 (83%) PIRRT sessions, the total ultrafiltration goal was achieved. In 84 (65%) PIRRT procedures, there was a median increase in norepinephrine dose of +0.031 mcg/kg/min during PIRRT (IQR 0.00 to +0.07). Intradialytic hypotensive events occurred in 56 (43%) procedures. Fifteen (12%) PIRRT treatments were discontinued due to severe hypotension. Vasopressor treatment at PIRRT session onset (OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.4-28.0, p: 0.02) and a pre-PIRRT lactate ≥3.0 mmol/L (OR 4.63, 95% CI 1.3-12.8, p: 0.003) were independently and significantly associated with the risk of hypotension during PIRRT. During follow-up, 11 patients (52%) recovered from AKI and respiratory failure and 9 (43%) died. Several adaptations to our PIRRT protocol during the COVID-19 outbreak are presented. CONCLUSIONS PIRRT was feasible in the majority of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and severe AKI, despite frequent transitory intradialytic hypotensive episodes. PIRRT may represent an acceptable alternative of renal replacement therapy during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ramirez-Sandoval, Juan C; Gaytan-Arocha, Jorge E; Xolalpa-Chávez, Pedro; Mejia-Vilet, Juan M; Arvizu-Hernandez, Mauricio; Rivero-Sigarroa, Eduardo; Torruco-Sotelo, Carlos; Correa-Rotter, Ricardo; Vega-Vega, Olynka",Blood purification,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33105136/,59

There were issues of poor communication among human, domestic animal, and wildlife health agencies that delayed diagnosis; a lack of diagnostic capacity of wildlife agencies at the state level; the exclusion of captive wildlife from any surveillance efforts; an inability to visualize the geospatial relationship between the human and avian outbreaks in a timely manner; and marked disparities of funding levels across agencies. Wildlife has played an important role in recent emerging infectious diseases, and it is clear that a One Health approach will be necessary to respond to future threats.

135872,Endoscopic electronic medical record systems.,2016,"BACKGROUND Bullying is destructive and pervasive. Although the literature suggests children with chronic health conditions are at higher risk of being bullied, there is minimal research regarding the prevalence of bullying among children with orthopaedic conditions. Our study aimed to assess the prevalence of bullying among pediatric orthopaedic outpatients and evaluate the association of orthopaedic conditions and use of orthopaedic devices with perceptions of bullying. METHODS Patients in outpatient pediatric orthopaedic clinics, ages 10 to 17 and their parents were surveyed using the Child-Adolescent Bullying Scale-9. Basic demographic, information about the child's orthopaedic condition, and parent's perception of their child being subject to bullying were also collected. Children were asked if they had used any orthopaedic devices in the last 3 months, whether they were bullied because of their device, and if bullying affected their compliance with device use. The analysis utilized a t test or analysis of variance to compare mean Child-Adolescent Bullying Scale-9 scores across different groups. RESULTS Among the 198 patients surveyed, 61% (N=121) perceived no-to-minimal exposure to bullying, 36% (N=72) moderate exposure, and 3% (N=5) severe exposure. Children ages 10 to 13 (N=100) and children ages 14 to 17 (N=98) reported similar rates of bullying (P=0.97). Higher rates of moderate to severe bullying were reported by patients with foot deformity (80%), multiple orthopaedic diagnoses (55%), chronic pain (39%), fracture/acute injury (37%), and scoliosis (33%). Moderate to severe bullying was reported by 37% of patients who wore a cast, 40% who wore a brace/orthotic, and 52% who used multiple orthopaedic devices. Parental concern that their child was being bullied was highly correlated with their child's bullying score (P=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS More than one third of our pediatric orthopaedic outpatients (39%) experience moderate to severe levels of bullying, which is higher than the general population's reported rates of 20% to 35%. Exposure to bullying may be higher in certain diagnoses or with use of certain orthopaedic devices. Further research is needed to delineate who is at highest risk.

135923,Continuous topical oxygen for the treatment of chronic wounds: a pilot study.,2012,"BACKGROUND The COVID pandemic and subsequent lockdown has disrupted food supplies across large parts of India, where even prior to the pandemic, food insecurity and malnutrition were widely prevalent. Tribal populations in southern Rajasthan, India, live in extreme scarcity, rely mainly on outward migration for sustenance, and have been significantly affected by the pandemic. In this study, we assess the availability of foodstuffs at the household level and community experiences about satiety and hunger during lockdown. METHODOLOGY We conducted a rapid assessment of food security in rural southern Rajasthan, India, using a structured questionnaire. Trained interviewers conducted telephonic interviews using KoBoToolbox, an open-source tool. A total of 211 respondents including community volunteers, family members of tuberculosis patients and malnourished children, pregnant women, and influential members in the villages participated in the study. RESULTS A cereal was reported to be present by 97% of the respondents, two-thirds had pulses, and nearly half had milk. The amount of cereals available was adequate for about 5 months and that of pulses, oil/ ghee, and sugar for about 1 to 2 weeks. Two-thirds of the respondents reported that food in their households was sometimes not sufficient for the amount they wanted to eat, and 97% of these mentioned not having money to buy food as the reason for not having sufficient food. CONCLUSION The study highlights widespread food insecurity among tribal communities in southern Rajasthan, and the scenario is likely to be similar in other tribal migration dependent areas of the country.","Saxena, Anupriya; Amin, Arpita; Mohan, Sanjana Brahmawar; Mohan, Pavitra",Food and nutrition bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1177/0379572120967163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143470/,59

Different cut angles and cut depths of barbs were prepared and tested in vitro for their tensile and tissue anchoring properties by means of a novel suture/tissue pullout test. Experiments were also performed using bovine tendon and porcine skin tissues. The experimental results revealed that since tendon tissue has a higher modulus than skin it needs a more rigid barb to penetrate and anchor the surrounding tissue. A cut angle of 150 degrees and a cut depth of 0.18 mm are therefore recommended. On the other hand, for the softer skin tissue, a cut angle of 170 degrees and a cut depth of 0.18 mm provides a more flexible barb that gives superior skin tissue anchoring. These findings confirm that the future development of barbed suture technology requires a detailed understanding of the biomechanical properties of the tissue in which they are to be used. This will lead to the future development of a range of tissue-specific barbed sutures.","Ingle, N P; King, M W",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.08.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883915/,59

However, little information is available on their effects on viruses. In this study, we report the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of GO against pseudorabies virus (PRV, a DNA virus) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV, an RNA virus). Our results showed that GO significantly suppressed the infection of PRV and PEDV for a 2 log reduction in virus titers at noncytotoxic concentrations. The potent antiviral activity of both GO and rGO can be attributed to the unique single-layer structure and negative charge. First, GO exhibited potent antiviral activity when conjugated with PVP, a nonionic polymer, but not when conjugated with PDDA, a cationic polymer. Additionally, the precursors Gt and GtO showed much weaker antiviral activity than monolayer GO and rGO, suggesting that the nanosheet structure is important for antiviral properties. Furthermore, GO inactivated both viruses by structural destruction prior to viral entry. The overall results suggest the potential of graphene oxide as a novel promising antiviral agent with a broad and potent antiviral activity.","Ye, Shiyi; Shao, Kang; Li, Zhonghua; Guo, Nan; Zuo, Yunpeng; Li, Qin; Lu, Zhicheng; Chen, Lu; He, Qigai; Han, Heyou",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.5b06876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26370151/,59
136556,Fresh evidence of the scale and scope of long covid.,2021-04-01,"Plants trigger appropriate defense responses notably through intracellular nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) containing receptor genes (NLRs) that detect secreted pathogen effector proteins. In NLR resistance genes, the toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-NB-LRRs (TNLs) are an important subfamily out of which approximately half members carry a post-LRR (PL) domain of unknown role. We first investigated the requirement of the PL domain for TNL-mediated immune response by mutating the most conserved amino acids across PL domains of Arabidopsis thaliana TNLs. We identified several amino acids in the PL domain of RPS4 required for its ability to trigger a hypersensitive response to AvrRps4 in N. tabacum transient assay. Mutating the corresponding amino acids within the PL domain of the tobacco TNL gene N also affected its function. Consequently, our results indicate that the integrity of the PL domain at conserved positions is crucial for at least two unrelated TNLs. We then tested the PL domain specificity for function by swapping PL domains between the paralogs RPS4 and RPS4B. Our results suggest that the PL domain is involved in their TNL pair specificity, 'off state' stability and NLR complex activation. Considering genetically paired Arabidopsis TNLs, we finally compared the PL and TIR domains of their sensor and executor sequences, respectively. While TIR and PL domains from executors present complete motifs, sensors showed a lack of conservation with degenerated motifs. We provide here a first contribution to the functional analysis of the PL domain in order to decipher its role for TNLs' function.","Saucet, Simon Bernard; Esmenjaud, Daniel; Van Ghelder, Cyril",Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,https://doi.org/10.1094/mpmi-06-20-0156-r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197377/,59

These newer imaging techniques are not more effective in standard surveillance of patients with BO because the prevalence of early neoplasia is low and HD-WLE with random biopsy analysis detects most cases of neoplasia. The evaluation and treatment of patients with BO and early-stage neoplasia should be centralized in tertiary referral centers, where procedures are performed under optimal conditions, by expert endoscopists. Lesions that require resection are almost always detected by HD-WLE, although advanced imaging techniques can detect additional flat lesions. However, these are of limited clinical significance because they are effectively eradicated by ablation therapy. No endoscopic imaging technique can reliably assess submucosal or lymphangio-invasion. Endoscopic resection of early-stage neoplasia in patients with BO is important for staging and management. Optical chromoendoscopy can also be used to evaluate lesions before endoscopic resection and in follow-up after successful ablation therapy.","Swager, A; Curvers, W L; Bergman, J J",Best practice & research.

137106,Questioning the New Drug Enforcement Administration Proposed Rule to Facilitate the Cultivation of Cannabis for Research Purposes.,2020,"Countries around the world introduced strict restrictions on movement and activities known as 'lockdowns' to restrict the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the end of 2019. A sudden improvement in air quality was observed globally as a result of these lockdowns. To provide insight into the changes in air pollution levels in response to the COVID-19 restrictions we have compared surface air quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase of the restriction easing period (25 March to 30 June 2020) with data from a baseline period (2018-2019). Simultaneously, short-term exposure of PM2.5 and O3 attributed premature mortality were calculated to understand the health benefit of the change in air quality. Ground-level observations in Delhi showed that concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 dropped substantially in 2020 during the overall study period compared with the same period in previous years, with average reductions of ~49%, ~39%, and ~39%, respectively. An overall lower reduction in O3 of ~19% was observed for Delhi. A slight increase in O3 was found in Delhi's industrial and traffic regions. The highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased substantially for all the pollutants at every phase. The decrease in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in 2020, prevented 904 total premature deaths, a 60% improvement when compared to the figures for 2018-2019. The restrictions on human activities during the lockdown have reduced anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality and human health in one of the most polluted cities in the world. Implication StatementI am submitting herewith the manuscript entitled ""Unprecedented Reduction in Air Pollution and Corresponding Short-term Premature Mortality Associated with COVID-19 Forced Confinement in Delhi, India"" for potential publishing in your journal.The novelty of this research lies in: (1) we utilized ground-level air quality data in Delhi during four phases of lockdown and the first phase of unlocking period (25th March to 30th June) for 2020 as well as data from the baseline period (2018-2019) to provide an early insight into the changes in air pollution levels in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) Chatarize the change of diurnal variation of the pollutants and (3) we assess the health risk due to PM2.5 and O3. Results from ground-level observations in Delhi showed that concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 substantially dropped in 2020 during the overall study period compared to the similar period in previous years, with an average reduction of ~49%, ~39%, and ~39%, respectively. In the case of O3, the overall reduction was observed as ~19% in Delhi, while a slight increase was found in industrial and traffic regions. And consequently, the highest peak of the diurnal variation decreased substantially for all the pollutants. The health impact assessment of the changes in air quality indicated that 904 short-term premature deaths (~60%) were prevented due to the decline in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the study period.

Outcomes among the public of pregnant women with COVID-19 are still unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze whether COVID-19 in pregnant women is related to premature birth and birth weight, and to summarize the diagnostic results of neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 for investigating the possibility of vertical transmission. Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, LILACS, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Preprints, bioRxiv, and medRxiv. We used the odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) as measure of analysis. Summary estimates were calculated using random effects models. 38 studies were included; data from 279 women were analyzed; 60 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The meta-analysis showed no significant association between COVID-19 and preterm delivery (OR = 2.25; 95%CI: 0.96, 5.31; p = 0.06; I² = 0%). No significant relationship was found between birth weight and COVID-19 (MD = -124.16; 95%CI: -260.54, 12.22; p = 0.07; I² = 0%). Among 432 newborns, 10 were reported with positive results for early SARS-CoV-2. Due to the characteristics of the studies, the level of evidence of this meta-analysis was considered very low. COVID-19 in pregnant women may not be associated with the occurrence of preterm deliveries or the birth weight of the newborn children, however the evidence to date is very uncertain. A few reports suggest vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to newborn is possible, but evidence is still uncertain.","Melo, Géssyca Cavalcante de; Araújo, Karina Conceição Gomes Machado de",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00087320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696830/,59

138474,Exogenous BMP7 corrects plasma iron overload and bone loss in Bmp6-/- mice.,2015,"BACKGROUND The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) is at risk during thyroid surgery. Despite meticulous dissection and visualization, the EBSLN can be mistaken for other structures. The nerve integrity monitor (NIM) allows EBSLN confirmation with cricothyroid twitch on stimulation. AIMS The aim of this study was to assess any difference in identification of EBSLN and its anatomical sub-types by dissection alone compared to NIM-aided dissection. METHODS Routine intra-operative nerve monitoring (IONM) was used, when available, for 228 consecutive thyroid operations (129 total thyroidectomies, 99 hemi-thyroidectomies) over a 10-month period. EBSLN identification by dissection alone (with NIM confirmation of cricothyroid twitch) and by NIM-assisted dissection was recorded prospectively. Anatomical sub-types were defined by the Cernea classification. RESULTS Of 357 nerves at risk, 97.2 % EBSLNs (95 % confidence interval [CI], 95.5-98.9) were identified by visualization and NIM-aided dissection compared to 85.7 % (95 % CI, 82.1-89.3) identified by dissection alone (<0.001). EBSLN frequency was 34 % for type 1, 55 % for type 2a, and 11 % for type 2b. All identified EBSLNs were stimulated to confirm a cricothyroid twitch after superior thyroid vessel ligation. CONCLUSION Using the NIM and meticulous dissection of the upper thyroid pole improves EBSLN identification. As the EBSLN is at risk during thyroidectomy and can lead to voice morbidity, the NIM can aid identification of the EBSLN and provide a functional assessment of the EBSLN after thyroid resection.","Glover, Anthony R; Norlén, Olov; Gundara, Justin S; Morris, Michael; Sidhu, Stan B",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-014-4142-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25319580/,59

The many scaling exponents, α, reported in the literature usually require detailed interpretations concerning each particular system under study. Here, we critically evaluate the predictive power of scaling exponents by analyzing conductance measurements in four biological channels with contrasting architectures. We show that scaling behavior depends on several interconnected effects whose contributions change with concentration so that the use of oversimplified models missing critical factors could be misleading. In fact, the presence of interfacial effects could give rise to an apparent universal scaling that hides the channel distinctive features. We complement our study with 3D structure-based Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) calculations, giving results in line with experiments and validating scaling arguments. Our findings not only provide a unified framework for the study of ion transport in confined geometries but also highlight that scaling arguments are powerful and simple tools with which to offer a comprehensive perspective of complex systems, especially those in which the actual structure is unknown.","Queralt-Martín, María; López, M Lidón; Aguilella-Arzo, Marcel; Aguilella, Vicente M; Alcaraz, Antonio",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b03235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178677/,59
141060,Academy News - July 2020 pm&R.,2020-07-01,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a pathogen closely associated with periodontal and systemic infections. Recently, lysine acetylation (Kac) and lysine succinylation (Ksuc) have been identified in bacterial proteins with diverse biological and pathological functions. The Ksuc of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 has been characterized in our previous work, and here, we report the systematic analysis of Kac and its crosstalk with Ksuc in this bacterium. A combination of the affinity enrichment by the acetyl-lysine antibody with highly sensitive LC-MS was used to identify the lysine acetylated proteins and sites in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. A total of 1112 lysine acetylated sites matching 438 proteins were identified. These proteins involved in several cellular processes, especially those proteins related to protein biosynthesis and central metabolism had a high tendency to be lysine acetylated. Moreover, lysine sites flanked by tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine in the +1 position, as well as residue lysine in position +4 to +5, were the targets of Kac. Additionally, proteins involved in adhesins, gingipains, black pigmentation, and oxidative stress resistance were identified as substrates of Kac. Collectively, these results suggest Kac may play a critical role in the regulation of physiology and virulence of P. gingivalis. Furthermore, we discovered that, Ksuc and Kac were extensively overlapped in P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, especially in proteins related to ribosomes and metabolism. This study provides a significant beginning for further investigating the role of Kac and Ksuc in the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis.","Zeng, Jumei; Wu, Leng; Chen, Qiushi; Wang, Lingyun; Qiu, Wei; Zheng, Xin; Yin, Xiaoming; Liu, Jie; Ren, Yan; Li, Yuqing",Molecular oral microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/omi.12312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939976/,59

Nevertheless, studies on the difference in postoperative pain between SILC and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy are lacking in the literature. PATIENT AND METHODS From August 2009 to July 2010, 20 consecutive patients who underwent SILC (SILC group) were compared with a prospective cohort of 20 patients who underwent conventional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC group) during the same period. Standard postoperative analgesic protocol was applied to all patients. Pain scores were registered before operation and one day after operation using visual analog scale. Satisfactory score was self-assessed by all patients one month after surgery using visual analog scale. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics, preoperative pain score, and intraoperative opioid usage between the 2 groups. The postoperative pain score was significantly lower in the SILC group (2.9±1.6 in SILC group vs. 4.8±1.5 in LC group, P<0.01). There was also a lower analgesic consumption and a higher satisfactory score in the SILC group although the results did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS SILC resulted in significantly less postoperative pain than conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It is a safe alternative to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Wong, Jeff Siu-Wang; Cheung, Yue-Sun; Fong, Kwong-Wai; Chong, Charing Ching-Ning; Lee, Kit-Fai; Wong, John; Lai, Paul Bo-San","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e318242ea44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318055/,59

141559,Neck muscle responses of driver and front seat passenger during frontal-oblique collisions.,2018,"An infectious disease named ""coronavirus disease 2019"" (COVID-19) currently has brought a threat to global health security and trends to be more and more severe in many countries. It also has introduced great challenges to the diagnosis and management of children with hepatoblastoma (HB). During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric surgeons should not only develop personalized treatment plans for HB therapy, but also emphasize the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of this virus. Children with both HB and COVID-19 are recommended to undertake multidisciplinary assessment. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy may be a preferred treatment for the infected without presenting a surgical emergency. However, emergent operation may be necessary for HB children with concurrent COVID-19 who developed a life-threatening surgical emergency condition. Otherwise, for children with negative virus examination results, treatment advice should be based on the impact of the epidemic and regional economic considerations. A ""wait and see"" strategy is recommended for children with resectable tumors after new adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (NACT). Assessment of liver transplantation is recommended for children with HB whose tumors cannot be resected after NACT. Children with HB with pulmonary metastasis may have abnormal findings on chest imaging due to COVID-19. Besides, the detailed therapeutic regimens may vary for children with HB with or without an emergency presentation. Based on previous consensus, current research, and the experiences of our hospital, we aim to offer available management plans for the above-mentioned concerns.","Xu, Hang; Zhou, Yan; Sun, Rui; Liu, Xuelai; Diao, Mei; Ren, Xianghai; Li, Long",Translational pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.21037/tp-20-143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33457307/,59
141639,Overcoming the Market Dominance of Hospitals.,2021-02-19,"OBJECTIVES To present the technique and long-term results of retroperitoneal laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN), focusing on the impact of an ergonomic platform. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2000 and May 2016, 287 patients (193 men, 94 women) underwent LPN performed by four surgeons. The median (range) patient age was 59 (19-85) years, tumour size 3.1 (1-9) cm and PADUA score 7.3 (6-12). Access was retroperitoneal in 235 cases (82%). Since October 2010, we have used the ETHOS™ chair (ETHOS™ , Seattle, WA, USA) during excision of the tumour in 130 patients (45.3%). A total of 51 tumours (17.7%) were excised without ischaemia and 226 (78.7%) under warm ischaemia, with clamping of the renal artery using an enucleo-resection technique. We suture the resection bed and perform renorrhaphy using a barbed-suture pre-loaded with absorbable LAPRA-TY™ clips (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA). The impact of the ETHOS chair was examined using a matched-pair analysis (66 with ETHOS chair vs 67 without ETHOS chair). RESULTS The median (range) operating time was 146 (60-325) min, the median (range) estimated blood loss was 99 (10-3 000) mL and the mean (range) warm ischaemia time (WIT) was 17.1 (7-47) min. Histology showed 240 (83.6%) renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) and 46 (15.9%) benign tumours. The cumulative overall disease-free survival rate after a median (range) follow-up of 84 (3-155) months was 100% for 203 pT1 RCCs and local recurrence was observed in one patient (0.4%), who was managed by radical nephrectomy. There were two conversions (0.7%) to open surgery, both to hand-assisted laparoscopy. Perirenal haematoma was observed in 13 patients (4.5%). A total of 20 patients (6.9%) required transfusions (2-11 units). We observed five urine leaks (1.7%) requiring prolonged drainage. The median (range) length of hospital stay was 5 (3-24) days. Three patients developed arteriovenous fistulas, which were successfully occluded by superselective embolization (1.0%). Use of the ETHOS chair resulted in shorter operating time (134.7 vs 168.5 min; P = 0.04), including WIT (13.1 vs 15.9 min; P = 0.01), and a lower complication rate (15 vs 29.8%; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is technically difficult but oncologically effective. Standardization and simplification of endoscopic suturing using the ETHOS chair significantly improved the outcomes of the surgical procedure.","Rassweiler, Jens J; Klein, Jan; Tschada, Alexandra; Gözen, Ali Serdar",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.13627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27514504/,59

For patients with NRASmutant advanced stage melanoma refractory to immunotherapy or with contraindications to immune-based regimens, there are few therapeutic options including low-efficacy chemotherapy regimens and binimetinib monotherapy. Here, we review recent advances in preclinical studies of molecular targets for NRAS mutant melanoma as well as the failures and successes of early-phase clinical trials. While there are no targeted therapies for NRAS-driven melanoma, there is great promise in approaches combining MEK inhibition with inhibitors of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), inhibitors of autophagy pathways, and pan-RAF inhibitors. Areas Covered This review surveys new developments in all aspects of disease pathogenesis and potential treatment - including those that have failed, stalled, or progressed through various phases of preclinical and clinical development. Expert Opinion There are no currently approved targeted therapies for BRAF wild-type melanoma patients harboring NRAS driver mutations though an array of agents are in early phase clinical trials. The diverse strategies taken exploit combined MAP kinase signaling blockade with inhibition of cell cycle mediators, inhibition of the autophagy pathway, and alteration of kinases involved in actin cytoskeleton signaling. Future advances of developmental therapeutics into late stage trials may yield new options beyond immunotherapy for patients with advanced stage disease and NRAS mutation status.","Zhao, Jeffrey; Galvez, Carlos; Beckermann, Kathryn Eby; Johnson, Douglas B; Sosman, Jeffrey A",Expert review of precision medicine and drug development,https://doi.org/10.1080/23808993.2021.1938545; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485698/,59
142635,"Evaluation of Cell-Penetrating Peptides as Versatile, Effective Absorption Enhancers: Relation to Molecular Weight and Inherent Epithelial Drug Permeability.",2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19 is a global priority. Anova Health Institute (Anova) is the PEPFAR (US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) District Support Partner for the Johannesburg, Cape Town, Sedibeng, Capricorn and Mopani districts in South Africa, operating in public sector primary healthcare facilities. At the time of the emergence of COVID-19, Anova employed close to 4 000 people: 41% community health workers (CHWs), 23% data staff, 20% nurses and doctors, 12% management/support and 5% allied HCWs. OBJECTIVES To describe rates of COVID-19 diagnosis in Anova-employed HCWs in five districts. METHODS Employees exposed to, tested for or diagnosed with COVID-19 were required to report the event. These reports were compiled into a database to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the workforce. We kept a timeline of key events occurring at national and district level, including Anova's policies and their implementation, that was used to describe organisational response. We described the number of confirmed cases, cumulative incidence rates and testing rates, broken down by district and job category. We estimated expected deaths and the effect on time off work. RESULTS Of Anova employees, 14% (n=562) were diagnosed with COVID-19 by the end of September 2020. Cumulative incidence was highest in Sedibeng (29%) and lowest in Mopani (5%). All HCWs experienced high incidences: data staff 17%, allied HCWs 16%, CHWs 14%, nurses and doctors 13%, and management/support 11%. At the peak of the epidemic, for 5 weeks, >5% of employees were unable to work owing to exposure or infection, significantly disrupting service delivery. The additional administrative burden on managers was substantial. CONCLUSIONS It is critical that all cadres of HCWs are protected in the workplace, including in primary care settings, where better structuresare needed to perform risk assessments and conduct outbreak investigations. CHWs and data staff may be at higher risk owing to poor infrastructure, limited power to negotiate working conditions, and limited experience of infection prevention and control. Their working conditions must be improved to reduce their risk.","Rees, K; Dunlop, J L; Patel-Abrahams, S; Struthers, H; McIntyre, J A",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,https://doi.org/10.7196/samj.2021.v111i4.15434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944762/,59
143204,Opinion: Population risk factor control in the 21st century.,2020-06-17,"Background In the last decades, nosocomial infections caused by drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa became a common problem in healthcare facilities. Antibiotics are becoming less effective as new resistant strains appear. Therefore, the development of novel enhanced activity antibacterial agents becomes very significant. A combination of nanomaterials with different physical and chemical properties enables us to generate novel multi-functional derivatives. In this study, graphene oxide and polyvinylpyrrolidone-stabilized silver nanoparticles hybrid nanocomposite (GO-Ag HN) were synthesized. The relation between antibiotic resistance and GO-Ag HN potential toxicity to clinical P. aeruginosa strains, their antibiotic resistance, and molecular mechanisms were assessed. Methods Chemical state, particle size distribution, and morphology of synthesized GO-Ag NH were investigated using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques (UV-Vis, FTIR, XPS, TEM, SEM, AFM). Broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa strains was determined using E-test. Antibiotic resistance genes were identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results In this study, the toxicity of the GO-Ag NH to the isolated clinical P. aeruginosa strains has been investigated. A high antibiotic resistance level (92%) was found among P. aeruginosa strains. The most prevalent antibiotic resistance gene among tested strains was the AMPC beta-lactamase gene (65.6%). UV-vis, FTIR, and XPS studies confirmed the formation of the silver nanoparticles on the GO nanosheets. The functionalization process occurred through the interaction between Ag nanoparticles, GO, and polyvinylpyrrolidone used for nanoparticle stabilization. SEM analysis revealed that GO nanosheets undergo partial fragmentation during hybrid nanocomposite preparation, which remarkably increases the number of sharp edges and their mediated cutting effect. TEM analysis showed that GO-Ag HN spherical Ag nanoparticles mainly 9-12 nm in size were irregularly precipitated on the GO nanosheet surface. A higher density of Ag NPs was observed in the sheets' wrinkles, corrugations, and sharp edges. This hybrid nanocomposite poses enhanced antibacterial activity against carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains through a possible synergy between toxicity mechanisms of GO nanosheets and Ag nanoparticles. With incubation time increasing up to 10 minutes, the survival of P. aeruginosa decreased significantly. Conclusion A graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles hybrid composite has been shown to be a promising material to control nosocomial infections caused by bacteria strains resistant to most antibiotics.","Lozovskis, Povilas; Jankauskaitė, Virginija; Guobienė, Asta; Kareivienė, Violeta; Vitkauskienė, Astra",International journal of nanomedicine,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s235748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764942/,59

Vitamin A deficiency in K14E7HPV expressing transgenic mice facilitates the formation of malignant cervical lesions. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer (CC), but viral infection alone does not guarantee the development of this malignancy. Indeed, deficiencies of dietary micronutrients could favor cervical cancer development in individuals that harbor HR-HPV infections. The status of retinoid levels, natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, is important in maintaining cellular differentiation of the cervical epithelium. Moreover, many studies show a link between deficient intake of retinoids or alteration of the retinoid receptors and CC development. In spite of this, the effect of Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in presence of HR-HPV oncoproteins on cervical carcinogenesis in vivo has not been reported. Transgenic mice expressing E6 or E7 oncoproteins (K14E6 or K14E7 mice, respectively) were used to evaluate the possible role of VAD in the development of malignant cervical lesions. The survival of the mice in VAD condition was studied and histopathological analysis and immunohistochemical detection of molecular cancer markers such as the tumor suppressor Retinoic Acid Receptor beta (RARβ), Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), Cleaved Caspase 3 and the tumor suppressor protein p16INK4A (inhibitor of CDK4) were performed. Our results show that K14E6/VAD mice showed moderate cervical dysplasia; notably, K14E7/VAD mice developed severe cervical dysplasia and cervical in situ carcinoma at an early age.

143624,[Our Children].,2020-05-01,"The antibacterial properties of sodium bicarbonate have been known for years, yet the molecular understanding of its mechanism of action is still lacking. Utilizing chemical-chemical combinations, we first explored the effect of bicarbonate on the activity of conventional antibiotics to infer on the mechanism. Remarkably, the activity of 8 classes of antibiotics differed in the presence of this ubiquitous buffer. These interactions and a study of mechanism of action revealed that, at physiological concentrations, bicarbonate is a selective dissipater of the pH gradient of the proton motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Further, while components that make up innate immunity have been extensively studied, a link to bicarbonate, the dominant buffer in the extracellular fluid, has never been made. Here, we also explored the effects of bicarbonate on components of innate immunity. Although the immune response and the buffering system have distinct functions in the body, we posit there is interplay between these, as the antimicrobial properties of several components of innate immunity were enhanced by a physiological concentration of bicarbonate. Our findings implicate bicarbonate as an overlooked potentiator of host immunity in the defense against pathogens. Overall, the unique mechanism of action of bicarbonate has far-reaching and predictable effects on the activity of innate immune components and antibiotics. We conclude that bicarbonate has remarkable power as an antibiotic adjuvant and suggest that there is great potential to exploit this activity in the discovery and development of new antibacterial drugs by leveraging testing paradigms that better reflect the physiological concentration of bicarbonate.","Farha, Maya A; French, Shawn; Stokes, Jonathan M; Brown, Eric D",ACS infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsinfecdis.7b00194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29264917/,59

144082,A new era of pressure ulcer accountability in acute care.,2008,"Air quality in cities is influenced not only by emissions and chemical transformations but also by the physical state of the atmosphere which varies both temporally and spatially. Increasingly, tall buildings (TB) are common features of the urban landscape, yet their impact on urban air flow and dispersion is not well understood, and their effects are not appropriately captured in parameterisation schemes. Here, hardware models of areas within two global mega-cities (London and Beijing) are used to analyse the impact of TB on flow and transport in isolated and cluster settings. Results show that TB generate strong updrafts and downdrafts that affect street-level flow fields. Velocity differences do not decay monotonically with distance from the TB, especially in the near-wake region where the flow is characterised by recirculating winds and jets. Lateral distance from an isolated TB centreline is crucial, and flow is still strongly impacted at longitudinal distances of several TB heights. Evaluation of a wake-flow scheme (ADMS-Build) in the isolated TB case indicates important characteristics are not captured. There is better agreement for a slender, shorter TB than a taller non-cuboidal TB. Better prediction of flow occurs horizontally further away and vertically further from the surface. TB clusters modify the shape of pollutant plumes. Strong updrafts generated by the overlapping wakes of TB clusters lift pollutants out of the canopy, causing a much deeper tracer plume in the lee of the cluster, and an elevated plume centreline with maximum concentrations around the TB mean height. Enhanced vertical spread of the pollutants in the near-wake of the cluster results in overall lower maximum concentrations, but higher concentrations above the mean TB height. These results have important implications for interpreting observations in areas with TB. Using real world ceilometer observations in two mega-cities (Beijing and Paris), we assess the diurnal seasonal variability of the urban boundary layer and evaluate a mixed layer height (MLH) empirical model with parameters derived from a third mega-city (London). The MLH model works well in central Beijing but less well in suburban Paris. The variability of the physical meteorology across different vertical scales discussed in this paper provides additional context for interpreting air quality observations.","Hertwig, Denise; Grimmond, Sue; Kotthaus, Simone; Vanderwel, Christina; Gough, Hannah; Haeffelin, Martial; Robins, Alan",Faraday discussions,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fd00098a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346283/,59

Even if there exist dedicated devices able to track patients' movements to evaluate the performed rehabilitation exercises, they require specific settings necessary for a correct and simple use at the patient's home. If we consider the recent pandemic situation and the lockdown condition, which made difficult the access to these products, post stroke patients may be not able to perform home rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES the goal of this work is the design of a specific method to develop a tele-rehabilitation platform for post-stroke patients using consumer technologies without involving ad-hoc devices. METHOD Open-source tools have been investigated for speeding up the development starting with the medical knowledge. RESULTS a group of four healthcare technologies engineering students with no specific skills about computer science has developed a platform in four months using the design method.

146311,State-of-the-art fluid management in the operating room.,2014,"Background and study aims Endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT) has been developed to treat gastrointestinal leakages. Up to now, ENPT has usually been performed with open-pore polyurethane foam drains (OPD). A big disadvantage of the OPDs is their large diameter. We have developed a new, small-bore open-pore film drainage (OFD). Herein we report our first experience in a case series of 16 patients. Patients and methods OFD is constructed with a drainage tube and a very thin double-layered open-pore drainage film (Suprasorb CNP, Drainage Film, Lohmann & Rauscher International, Germany). The distal end of the tube is wrapped with only one layer of film. OFD is placed into the gastrointestinal leakage site with common endoscopic techniques. The tube is connected to an electronic vacuum device and continuous negative pressure of -125 mmHg applied. Results From 2013 to 2016, 16 patients were treated with the new OFD device. In 10 patients, transmural intestinal defects (4 esophageal, 4 rectum/colon, 1 duodenal, 1 pancreatic cyst) were closed with ENPT in median time of 12 days (range 3 - 34 days). Five of the 10 patients were treated solely with OFD devices. In five patients ENPT started with ODP and changed to OFD when the cavity was shrunken to a channel with a small opening. In four patients postoperative gastric reflux was eliminated for 5 to 16 days. Conclusions Small-bore OFD opens up promising new treatment options within ENPT. OFD can be used in endoscopic closure management of intestinal leakages in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Gastric reflux can be eliminated in an active manner. OFD can be inserted nasally. OFD may be an adequate substitute for OPD, especially when placement of the larger OPD is difficult.","Loske, Gunnar; Schorsch, Tobias; Rucktaeschel, Frank; Schulze, Wolfgang; Riefel, Burkhard; van Ackeren, Vera; Mueller, Christian Theodor",Endoscopy international open,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-0599-5886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29978007/,59

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer and accounts for ~90% of cases. Infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are the main risk factors for HCC development, although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming a more frequent risk factor in the West. Moreover, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated HCC has a unique molecular pathogenesis. Approximately 25% of all HCCs present with potentially actionable mutations, which are yet to be translated into the clinical practice. Diagnosis based upon non-invasive criteria is currently challenged by the need for molecular information that requires tissue or liquid biopsies. The current major advancements have impacted the management of patients with advanced HCC. Six systemic therapies have been approved based on phase III trials (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab) and three additional therapies have obtained accelerated FDA approval owing to evidence of efficacy. New trials are exploring combination therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors or anti-VEGF therapies, or even combinations of two immunotherapy regimens. The outcomes of these trials are expected to change the landscape of HCC management at all evolutionary stages.","Llovet, Josep M; Kelley, Robin Kate; Villanueva, Augusto; Singal, Amit G; Pikarsky, Eli; Roayaie, Sasan; Lencioni, Riccardo; Koike, Kazuhiko; Zucman-Rossi, Jessica; Finn, Richard S",Nature reviews.

By contrast, it was already recognized a century ago that healthy plants tissues contain abundant endogenous microbes ('endophytes'). Taking endophytes as an informative precedent, we overview the nature, prevalence, and role of endozoites in mammalian tissues, centrally focusing on the brain, concluding that endozoites are ubiquitous in diverse tissues. These passengers often remain subclinical, but they are not silent. We address their routes of entry, mechanisms of persistence, tissue specificity, and potential to cause long-term behavioral changes and/or immunosuppression in mammals, where rabies virus is the exemplar. We extend the discussion to Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, and Toxoplasma, as well as to diverse bacteria and yeasts, and debate the advantages and disadvantages that endozoite infection might afford to the host and to the ecosystem. We provide a clinical perspective in which endozoites are implicated in neurodegenerative disease, anxiety/depression, and schizophrenia.

Hand hygiene effectiveness may be produce-commodity specific, which could influence implementation strategies. This study's goal was to determine if produce commodity influences the ability of handwashing with soap and water or Two-Step ABHS interventions to reduce soil and bacteria on farmworker hands. Farmworkers (n = 326) harvested produce for 30-90 minutes before engaging in handwashing (cantaloupe, jalapeño, and tomato), Two-Step ABHS (jalapeño and cantaloupe), or no hand hygiene. Hands were rinsed to measure amounts of soil (absorbance at 600 nm) and indicator bacteria (coliforms, Enterococccus, generic Escherichia coli, and Bacteroidales universal [AllBac] and human-specific [BFD] 16S rDNA markers). Without hand hygiene, bacterial concentrations (0.88 to 5.1 log10 CFU/hand) on hands significantly differed by the produce commodity harvested. Moderate significant correlations (ρ = -0.41 to 0.56) between soil load and bacterial concentrations were observed. There were significant produce-commodity specific differences in the ability of handwashing and Two-Step ABHS interventions to reduce soil (P < 0.0001), coliforms (P = 0.002), and Enterococcus (P = 0.003), but not the Bacteroidales markers AllBac (P = 0.4) or BFD (P = 0.3). Contamination was more difficult to remove from cantaloupe farmworker hands. Overall, we found that a Two-Step ABHS intervention was similar to handwashing with soap and water at reducing bacteria on farmworker hands. In sum, produce commodity type should be considered when developing hand hygiene interventions on farms.IMPORTANCE This study demonstrated that the type of produce commodity handled influences the ability of handwashing with soap and water or a Two-Step alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) intervention to reduce soil and bacterial hand contamination. Handwashing with soap and water, as recommended by the FDA's Produce Safety Rule, when tested in three agricultural environments, does not always reduce bacterial loads. Consistent with past results, we found that the Two-Step ABHS method performed similarly to handwashing with soap and water, but also does not always reduce bacterial loads in these contexts. Given the ease of use of the Two-Step ABHS method, which may increase compliance, the Two-Step ABHS method should be further evaluated and possibly considered for implementation in the agricultural environment. Taken together, this study provides important information on hand hygiene effectiveness in three agricultural contexts.","Prince-Guerra, Jessica L; Nace, Molly E; Lyles, Robert H; Fabiszewski de Aceituno, Anna M; Bartz, Faith E; Arbogast, James W; Gentry-Shields, Jennifer; Jaykus, Lee-Ann; Heredia, Norma; García, Santos; Leon, Juan S",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00780-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680869/,59

148142,Author commentary on Srivathsan Ravindran et al.,2020-10-01,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an important part of the cell's defenses against viruses and other foreign genes. Moreover, the biotechnological exploitation of RNAi offers therapeutic potential for a range of diseases for which drugs are currently unavailable. Unfortunately, the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are central to RNAi in the cytoplasm are readily degradable by ubiquitous nucleases, are inefficiently targeted to desired organs and cell types, and are excreted quickly upon systemic injection. As a result, local administration techniques have been favored over the past few years, resulting in great success in the treatment of viral infections and other respiratory disorders. Because there are several advantages of pulmonary delivery over systemic administration, two of the four siRNA drugs currently in phase II clinical trials are delivered intranasally or by inhalation. The air-blood barrier, however, has only limited permeability toward large, hydrophilic biopharmaceuticals such as nucleic acids; in addition, the lung imposes intrinsic hurdles to efficient siRNA delivery. Thus, appropriate formulations and delivery devices are very much needed. Although many different formulations have been optimized for in vitro siRNA delivery to lung cells, only a few have been reported successful in vivo. In this Account, we discuss both obstacles to pulmonary siRNA delivery and the success stories that have been achieved thus far. The optimal pulmonary delivery vehicle should be neither cytotoxic nor immunogenic, should protect the payload from degradation by nucleases during the delivery process, and should mediate the intracellular uptake of siRNA. Further requirements include the improvement of the pharmacokinetics and lung distribution profiles of siRNA, the extension of lung retention times (through reduced recognition by macrophages), and the incorporation of reversible or stimuli-responsive binding of siRNA to allow for efficient release of the siRNAs at the target site. In addition, the ideal carrier would be biodegradable (to address difficulties with repeated administration for the treatment of chronic diseases) and would contain targeting moieties to enhance uptake by specific cell types. None of the currently available polymer- and lipid-based formulations meet every one of these requirements, but we introduce here several promising new approaches, including a biodegradable, nonimmunogenic polyester. We also discuss imaging techniques for following the biodistribution according to the administration route. This tracking is crucial for better understanding the translocation and clearance of nanoformulated siRNA subsequent to pulmonary delivery. In the literature, the success of pulmonary siRNA delivery is evaluated solely by relief from or prophylaxis against a disease; side effects are not studied in detail. It also remains unclear which cell types in the lung eventually take up siRNA. These are critical issues for the translational use of pulmonary siRNA formulations; accordingly, we present a flow cytometry technique that can be utilized to differentiate transfected cell populations in a mouse model that expresses transgenic enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). This technique, in which different cell types are identified on the basis of their surface antigen expression, may eventually help in the development of safer carriers with minimized side effects in nontargeted tissues.","Merkel, Olivia M; Kissel, Thomas",Accounts of chemical research,https://doi.org/10.1021/ar200110p; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21905687/,59

149492,Reflections on 'needlestuck'.,2008,"Obesity is a metabolic disease characterized by a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation and dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the kynurenine pathway by transforming l-tryptophan (Trp) into l-kynurenine (Kyn), a metabolite endowed with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. In dendritic cells, IL-6 induces IDO1 proteasomal degradation and shuts down IDO1-mediated immunosuppressive effects. In tumor cells, IL-6 upregulates IDO1 expression and favors tumor immune escape mechanisms. To investigate the role of IDO1 and its possible relationship with IL-6 in obesity, we induced the disease by feeding mice with a high fat diet (HFD). Mice on a standard diet were used as control. Experimental obesity was associated with high IDO1 expression and Kyn levels in the stromal vascular fraction of visceral white adipose tissue (SVF WAT). IDO1-deficient mice on HFD gained less weight and were less insulin resistant as compared to wild type counterparts. Administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist, to mice on HFD significantly reduced weight gain, controlled adipose tissue hypertrophy, increased insulin sensitivity, and induced a better glucose tolerance. TCZ also induced a dramatic inhibition of IDO1 expression and Kyn production in the SVF WAT. Thus our data indicated that the IL-6/IDO1 axis may play a pathogenetic role in a chronic, low-grade inflammation condition, and, perhaps most importantly, IL-6R blockade may be considered a valid option for obesity treatment.","Mondanelli, Giada; Albini, Elisa; Orecchini, Elena; Pallotta, Maria Teresa; Belladonna, Maria Laura; Ricci, Giovanni; Grohmann, Ursula; Orabona, Ciriana",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.713989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394118/,59

This morphological hip condition can cause joint pain, stiffness, impaired function, and eventually hip osteoarthritis. This exploratory study compared coordination of deep hip muscles between people with and without symptomatic FAI using analysis of muscle synergies (i.e., patterns of activity of groups of muscles activated in synchrony) during gait. Fifteen individuals (11 males) with symptomatic FAI (clinical examination and imaging) and 14 age- and sex-comparable controls without morphological FAI underwent testing. Intramuscular fine-wire and surface electrodes recorded electromyographic activity of selected deep and superficial hip muscles. A non-negative matrix factorization algorithm extracted three synergies which were compared between groups. Information regarding which muscles were activated together in the FAI group (FAI group synergy vector) was used to reconstruct individual electromyography patterns and compare groups. Variance accounted for (VAF) by three synergies was less for the control (94.8 [1.4]%) than FAI (96.0 [1.0]%) group (p = 0.03). VAF of obturator internus was significantly higher in the FAI group (p = 0.02). VAF of the reconstructed individual electromyography patterns with the FAI or control group vector were significantly higher for the FAI group (p < 0.01). Following reconstruction, VAF of quadratus femoris was significantly more reduced in controls (p = 0.04), indicating greater between-subject variability. Coordination of deep hip muscles in the synergy related to hip joint control during early swing differed between groups. This phase involves movement towards the impingement position, which has relevance for the interpretation of synergy differences and potential clinical importance. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

151400,A long-term perspective on immunity to COVID.,2021-06-14,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in neonatal piglets can cause up to 100% mortality, resulting in significant economic loss in the swine industry. Like other coronaviruses, PEDV N protein is a nucleocapsid protein and abundantly presents at all stages of infection. Previously, we reported that the N protein of trypsin-independent PEDV 8aa is cleaved during virus replication. In this study, we further investigated the nature of N protein cleavage using various methods including protease cleavage assays with or without various inhibitors and mutagenesis study. We found that PEDV 8aa infection in Vero cells leads to apoptotic cell death, and caspase 6 or 7 can cleave PEDV 8aa N protein at the late stage of the replication. The caspase-mediated cleavage occurs between D424 and G425 near the C-terminal of N protein. We also report that both cleaved and uncleaved N proteins are exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of PEDV infected cells.","Oh, Changin; Kim, Yunjeong; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482590/,59
151791,"A Viral Pandemic, Vaccine Safety, and Compensation for Adverse Events.",2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND A gastric pouch in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery can be created after transection of the perigastric neurovascular bundle or by preserving these structures. Some surgeons choose to transect the neurovascular bundle (NBT), containing branches of the vagus nerve, because this might be related to additional weight loss, whereas others advocate preservation (NBP) to reduce postoperative complications. OBJECTIVES This study assessed the effect of both techniques after primary RYGB. SETTING All patients undergoing primary RYGB in a large bariatric center in the Netherlands between January 2010 and December 2013 were included. METHODS Patient demographic characteristics, operative details, postoperative complications and weight loss after 1 year were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS A total of 773 consecutive patients were included (85.5% female). NBT was performed in 407 patients (52.7%), whereas NBP was performed in 366 patients. There were no missing data and 81.2% of patients completed the 1-year follow-up. Postoperative complications were found in 66 patients (8.5%). A total of 49 patients (6.3%) either had an anastomotic leakage, postoperative bleeding, or intraabdominal abscess (NBT 8.8% versus NBP 3.6%, P = .003). Percentage total weight loss (NBT 34.5%±6.9% versus NBP 33.4%±6.9%; P = .011) differed to a lesser extent between groups, although this was significant. Neurovascular bundle transection was identified as independent factor among others for occurrence of leakage, bleeding, and abscess development (OR 2.886; 95% CI [1.466-5.683]; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS Transection of the neurovascular bundle in RYGB is associated with more complications. Furthermore, weight loss is not relevantly increased. Further research is necessitated to substantiate these findings.","van Wezenbeek, Martin R; van Oudheusden, Thijs R; Smulders, J Frans; Nienhuijs, Simon W; Luyer, Misha D",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2015.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26686306/,59
152393,Use of topical local anaesthetics for paediatric facial lacerations.,2020-12-06,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of comprehensive on-site coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) using stenosis and plaque measures and subtended myocardial mass (Vsub) for fractional flow reserve (FFR) defined hemodynamically obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, the incremental diagnostic value of off-site CT-derived FFR (FFRCT) was assessed. METHODS Prospectively enrolled patients underwent CCTA followed by invasive FFR interrogation of all major coronary arteries. Vessels with ≥30% stenosis were included for analysis. On-site CCTA assessment included qualitative and quantitative stenosis (visual grading and minimal lumen area, MLA) and plaque measures (characteristics and volumes), and Vsub. Diagnostic value of comprehensive on-site CCTA assessment was tested by comparing area under the curves (AUC). In vessels with available FFRCT, the incremental value of off-site FFRCT was tested. RESULTS In 236 vessels (132 patients), MLA, positive remodeling, non-calcified plaque volume, and Vsub were independent on-site CCTA predictors for hemodynamically obstructive CAD (p < 0.05 for all). Vsub/MLA2 outperformed all these on-site CCTA parameters (AUC = 0.85) and Vsub was incremental to all other CCTA predictors (p = 0.02). In subgroup analysis (n = 194 vessels), diagnostic performance of FFRCT and Vsub/MLA2 was similar (AUC 0.89 and 0.85 respectively, p = 0.25). Furthermore, diagnostic performance significantly albeit minimally increased when FFRCT was added to on-site CCTA assessment (ΔAUC = 0.03, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS In comprehensive on-site CCTA assessment, Vsub/MLA2 demonstrated greatest diagnostic value for hemodynamically obstructive CAD and Vsub was incremental to all evaluated CCTA indices. Additionally, adding FFRCT only minimally increased diagnostic performance, demonstrating that on-site CCTA assessment is a reasonable alternative to FFRCT.","Bom, Michiel J; Driessen, Roel S; Kurata, Akira; van Diemen, Pepijn A; Everaars, Henk; Schumacher, Stefan P; de Winter, Ruben W; van de Ven, Peter M; van Rossum, Albert C; Taylor, Charles A; Min, James K; Leipsic, Jonathon A; Danad, Ibrahim; Knaapen, Paul",Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcct.2020.05.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32540206/,59

PATIENTS AND METHODS Of a total of 1269 patients who underwent LRP during a 109 month period, 374 (30%) had a PLND; 253 men had a sPLND (2000 to March 2008) and 121 had an extended PLND (ePLND; after April 2008) for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. An extraperitoneal approach was used in all patients having sPLND and a transperitoneal approach in patients having ePLND. RESULTS Patient age, body mass index, gland weight, prostate-specific antigen level and Gleason grade were similar in the two groups. The ePLND group had a greater proportion of patients with cT3 disease (9.9% vs 4.2%, P = 0.046) and was associated with a longer operating time of 206.5 vs 180.0 min (P < 0.001) and a higher node count of 17.5 vs 6.1 (P = 0.002). Blood loss, hospital stay, transfusion and complication rates were similar in the two groups. Lymph node positivity was significantly greater (P = 0.018) in patients with pathological Gleason grade 7 tumours who had ePLND (9.6% vs 1.0%) but was similar for other grades of tumour. CONCLUSION Based on these findings, and the results of other studies which show a reduction of prostate cancer-specific mortality of 23% if lymph nodes are positive and 15% if they are negative after ePLND, and the correlation between surgical experience, lymph node yield and positivity, we recommend that all patients undergo ePLND if they are being treated with curative intent for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer; ePLND should replace sPLND and surgeons performing <35 cases of RP a year should stop performing RP.","Eden, Christopher G; Arora, Avanish; Rouse, Paul",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2009.09161.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20132202/,59

Chest radiography and CT are the imaging tools used to diagnose and monitor patients with COVID-19. Lung ultrasound (LUS) during COVID-19 is being used in some areas to aid decision-making and improve patient care. However, its increased use could help improve existing practice for patients with suspected COVID-19, or other lung disease. A limitation of LUS is that it requires practitioners with sufficient competence to ensure timely, safe, and diagnostic clinical/imaging assessments. This commentary discusses the role and governance of LUS during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and how increased education and training in this discipline can be undertaken given the restrictions in imaging highly infectious patients. The use of simulation, although numerical methods or dedicated scan trainers, and machine learning algorithms could further improve the accuracy of LUS, whilst helping to reduce its learning curve for greater uptake in clinical practice.","Wolstenhulme, Stephen; McLaughlan, James Ross",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353379/,59

METHODS Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %). RESULTS The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","Kennedy, Deanna M; Zambrano, Gustavo José; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470888/,59
154094,Short term and long term results after open vs. laparoscopic appendectomy in childhood and adolescence: a subgroup analysis.,2013,"BACKGROUND The purse-string suture (PSS) is a simple and rapid wound closure method that results in minimal scarring. It has been used to treat circular or oval skin defects caused by tumor excision or trauma. However, due to obscurity, it is not widely used, especially for the head and neck. This study aimed to modify the PSS to obtain predictable and acceptable results. METHODS A total of 45 sites in 39 patients with various types of skin and soft tissue defects in the head and neck were treated with PSS. We used PDS II (2-0 to 5-0), which is an absorbable suture. Minimal dissection of the subcutaneous layer was performed. The suture knot was hidden by placing it in the dissection layer. Depending on the characteristics of the skin and soft tissue defects, additional surgical interventions such as side-to-side advancement sutures, double PSS, or split-thickness skin graft were applied. RESULTS All wounds healed completely without any serious complications. Large defects up to 45 mm in diameter were successfully reconstructed using only PSS. Postoperative radiating folds were almost flattened after approximately 1-2 months. CONCLUSION PSS is simple, rapid, and relatively free from surgical design. Owing to the circumferential advancement of the surrounding tissue, PSS always results in a smaller scar than the initial lesion and less distortion of the body structures around the wound in the completely healed defect. If the operator can predict the process of healing and immediate radiating folds, PSS could be a favorable option for round skin defects in the head and neck.","Park, Hyochun; Lee, Yunjae; Yeo, Hyeonjung; Park, Hannara",Archives of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.7181/acfs.2021.00297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34474541/,59

157066,Aerosol generation through phacoemulsification.,2020-06-18,"PA-X is a non-structural protein of influenza A virus (IAV), which is encoded by the polymerase acidic (PA) N-terminal region that contains a C-terminal +1 frameshifted sequence. IAV PA-X protein modulates virus-induced host innate immune responses and viral pathogenicity via suppression of host gene expression or cellular shutoff, through cellular mRNA cleavage. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype naturally infect different avian species, they have an enormous economic impact in the poultry farming, and they also have zoonotic and pandemic potential, representing a risk to human public health. In the present study, we describe a novel bacteria-based approach to identify amino acid residues in the PA-X protein of the HPAIV A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 H5N1 that are important for its ability to inhibit host protein expression or cellular shutoff activity. Identified PA-X mutants displayed a reduced shutoff activity as compared to that of the wild-type (WT) A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 H5N1 PA-X protein. Notably, this new bacteria-based screening allowed us to identify amino acid residues widely distributed over the entire N-terminal region of PA-X. Furthermore, we found that some of the residues affecting A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 H5N1 PA-X host shutoff activity also affect PA polymerase activity in a minigenome assay. This information could be used for the rational design of new and more effective compounds with antiviral activity against IAV. Moreover, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using this bacteria-based approach to identify amino acid residues important for the activity of viral proteins to inhibit host gene expression.IMPORTANCEHighly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) continue to pose a huge threat to global animal and human health. Despite of the limited genome size of Influenza A virus (IAV), the virus encodes eight main viral structural proteins and multiple accessory non-structural proteins, depending on the IAV type, subtype or strain. One of the IAV accessory proteins, PA-X, is encoded by the polymerase acidic (PA) protein and is involved in pathogenicity through the modulation of IAV-induced host inflammatory and innate immune responses. However, the molecular mechanism(s) of IAV PA-X regulation of the host immune response is not well understood. In this work, we used, for the first time, a bacteria-based approach for the identification of amino acids important for the ability of IAV PA-X to induce host shutoff activity and describe novel residues relevant for its ability to inhibit host gene expression, and their contribution in PA polymerase activity.","Chiem, Kevin; López-García, Darío; Ortego, Javier; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; DeDiego, Marta L; Nogales, Aitor",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00408-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853954/,59

PURPOSE The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of the system and to compress standard intravenous chemotherapy into 4 weeks of targeted intra-arterial delivery. METHODS An arterial access system was implanted to the axillary artery via an anastomosis. Infusions of oxaliplatin were performed biweekly for 4 weeks, using balloon catheters to achieve hepatic isolation and segmental selectivity for 20-25 min. Fifty-seven treatments under general anesthetic were performed in ten patients with inoperable chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Systemic, intrahepatic, and hepatic venous pressures were recorded to assess vascular isolation, and platinum levels were measured to assess chemotherapy distribution. RESULTS Pressure verified, multiple day-only hepatic vascular isolation infusions were achieved in nine of ten patients, with a single patient receiving multiple hepatic arterial infusions. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging confirmed partial response in three of ten patients and stable disease in three of ten patients. Systemic toxicity was minimal as all treatment-related gastrointestinal and neuropathic symptoms reported throughout the 4 weeks were grades 1-2. CONCLUSIONS Intra-arterial chemotherapy infusions with hepatic vascular isolation can be achieved repeatedly with targeted selectivity and minimal complications using an implantable multicatheter access system. Oxaliplatin infusions over a 4-week period may achieve tumor response in selected patients in the salvage setting. The technique should be further assessed in a phase Ib/II study.","Lane, Rodney J; Khin, Nyan Y; Rogan, Chris M; Magnussen, John; Pavlakis, Nick; Lane, David M; Clarke, Stephen",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-016-5198-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27016294/,59

Data on the toll of the pandemic on children and young adults with kidney disease is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and severity of COVID-19, as well as the serological response, in this population. METHODS Study population included all patients with CKD stage 3-5, glomerular disease treated with immunosuppression and kidney transplant recipients followed-up at a tertiary medical center, between 1.12.2020 and 15.2.2021. Data collected included PCR testing, symptoms, exposure, and socio-demographic data. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested. RESULTS A total of 197 children and 63 young adults were included, 57% were Jewish, 43% were Arab. PCR-confirmed COVID-19 incidence was 20.8%, 37% of cases were asymptomatic, three patients were hospitalized for observation, and the remainder had mild symptoms. Kidney function remained stable without treatment modification. Risk factors for infection included exposure at home (OR 15.4, 95% CI 6.9-34.2) and number of household members (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.21-1.73). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 61% of cases and were not associated with COVID-19 severity or immunosuppressive therapy.

The majority of physicians and nurses report that they have been victims of workplace violence at least once throughout their careers. Such violent attacks negatively affect the delivery, quality, and accessibility of health care. Certain factors such as substance abuse and intense emotions increase an individual's risk of committing an act of workplace violence against a health care worker. Encountering violent individuals has legal implications and can compromise the moral framework of physicians. With action from institution administrations, advocates, leaders, and government, this issue that detrimentally affects health care can be combatted and reduced. By implementing required staff training, increasing security, strengthening the doctor-patient relationship, using medical chaperones, and reforming policy, positive changes can be made to protect health care workers and the health care system.","Watson, Ashleigh; Jafari, Mohammad; Seifi, Ali",The American journal of managed care,https://doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2020.88543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315330/,59

Conservative therapy including chemotherapy in this age group might be challenging because one of the criteria for its indication is the appropriate functional status, and in the elderly this is more difficult to ascertain. Checkpoint inhibitors are recent therapies found to be effective alone or in combinations in patients with advanced NSCLC, but little is known about their efficacy and their safety in such patients. Areas covered: We review clinical studies of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with advanced NSCLC in an attempt to identify peculiarities related to their use in the elderly. The clinical studies discussed enrolled a significant proportion of elderly patients and for some compounds, post-hoc analysis in the elderly was performed. Efficacy data supports the use of such compounds in the elderly and the safety profile is acceptable for all molecules discussed. Expert opinion: In the elderly with advanced NSCLC, checkpoint inhibitors are efficacious and well tolerated and may be appropriate for use in patients with an increased impaired functional status. Furthermore, in this category of patients this therapy may be used as a neoadjuvant therapy in order to improve the resectability of the tumor.","Alexa, Teodora; Antoniu, Sabina A; Alexa, Ioana; Ilie, Adina; Marinca, Mihai; Gafton, Bogdan; Stefaniu, Ramona",Expert review of anticancer therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737140.2021.1852933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244997/,59

Therefore, this work reports the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models to predict some biological properties of new 2-iminobenzimidazoline candidates for the treatment of the flu. A series of 2-iminobenzimidazoline derivatives with experimentally available values for cytotoxicity (pCC50) and anti-influenza activity (pIC50) was used for multivariate image analysis applied to QSAR (MIA-QSAR). The models were vigorously validated according to the best practices in QSAR and the chemical features responsible for the response variables were analysed based on MIA-plots, which assess the PLS regression coefficients and variable importance in projection scores. MIA descriptors encoding atomic properties (van der Waals radius and electronegativity) were capable of properly modelling the pCC50 and pIC50 data. The internally and externally validated models were used to predict the selectivity indexes (SI = pCC50/pIC50) of unprecedented analogues, which were designed upon analysis of the MIA-plots that show the substituent groups most affecting the biological data and by the combination of substructures of selected molecules. At least three promising anti-influenza candidates could be proposed from the predictive MIA-QSAR models.","Pereira, I V; de Freitas, M P",SAR and QSAR in environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1080/1062936x.2021.1950832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282674/,59

The goal of this study is to review our institution's experience with TLG for the treatment of gastric cancer. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted to examine the short-term outcomes of TLG using intracorporeally stapler or hand-sewn anastomosis performed at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital between March 2007 and June 2015. The details of intracorporeal anastomosis were described, and the clinicopathological data, surgical outcomes, and postoperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS Four hundred seventy-eight patients were included in the study. Generally speaking, the patients could be divided into stapler or hand-sewn groups according to whether intracorporeal anastomosis was performed by only hand-sewn technique (n = 97) or only stapling devices (n = 381). For overall patients, the mean operation time and anastomotic time were 225.7 and 30.0 min, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 65 patients. All of the patients recovered well without perioperative death by conservative or surgical management. CONCLUSIONS TLG using intracorporeally stapler or hand-sewn anastomosis is a reasonable option for the treatment of gastric cancer, with early data showing acceptable perioperative outcomes.","Chen, Ke; Wu, Di; Pan, Yu; Cai, Jia-Qin; Yan, Jia-Fei; Chen, Ding-Wei; Maher, Hendi; Mou, Yi-Ping",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-016-0868-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27094509/,59

PATIENTS AND METHODS From March 9th to May 9th 2020 we performed colorectal cancer elective surgery on 25 patients: a pre-hospital screening was carried out in order to avoid hospitalization of patients suspected of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS All patients (median age=76 years; range=37-88 years) were considered suitable for admission after telephone triage; the median interval between primary diagnosis and hospital admission was 23.1 days (range=1-55 days). The median hospitalization was 7.8 days (range=4-18 days). One COVID-19-associated death was reported. CONCLUSION Our experience demonstrates that safe colorectal cancer elective surgery can be performed during the pandemic COVID-19.

161165,"What's happening in Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.",2020-08-04,"Context. Point-of-care testing (POCT), diagnostic testing at or near the site of patient care, is inherently spatial, that is, performed at points of need, and also intrinsically temporal, because it produces fast actionable results. Outbreaks generate geospatial ""hotspots."" POC strategies help control hotspots, detect spread, and speed treatment of highly infectious diseases. Objectives. To stop outbreaks, accelerate detection, facilitate emergency response for epidemics, mobilize public health practitioners, enhance community resilience, and improve crisis standards of care. Data Sources. PubMed, WWW, newsprint, others were searched until COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, the US, a national emergency, and Europe, the epicenter. Coverage comprised interviews in Asia, email to/from Wuhan, papers, articles, chapters, documents, maps, flowcharts, schematics, and geospatial-associated concepts. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated literature as abstracts, ULRs, and PDFs, recovering 136 hotspot articles. More than 500 geospatial science articles were assessed for relevance to point-of-care testing. Conclusions POCT can interrupt spirals of dysfunction and delay by enhancing disease detection, decision making, contagion containment, and safe spacing, thereby softening outbreak surges and diminishing risk before human, economic, and cultural losses mount. Point-of-care tests results identify where infected individuals spread COVID-19, when delays cause death, and how to deploy resources. Results in national cloud databases help optimize outbreak control, mitigation, emergency response, and community resilience. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates unequivocally that governments must support POCT and multidisciplinary healthcare personnel must learn its principles, then adopt POC geospatial strategies, so that onsite diagnostic testing can ramp up to meet needs in times of crisis.","Kost, Gerald J",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0172-ra; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32298139/,59
161309,Association of Compensation From the Surgical and Medical Device Industry to Physicians and Self-declared Conflict of Interest.,2018,"Delirium is a common presentation in older inpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and a risk factor for cognitive decline at discharge. The glaring gaps in the service provision in delirium care, regardless of aetiology, after a hospital admission pre-existed the pandemic, but the pandemic arguably offers an opportunity now to address them. Whilst a delirium episode in itself is not a long-term condition, the context of it may well be, and therefore patients might benefit from personalised care and support planning. There is no reason to believe that the delirium following COVID-19 is fundamentally different from any other delirium. We propose that the needs of older patients who have experienced delirium including from COVID-19 could be addressed through a new model of post-acute delirium care that combines early supported discharge, including discharge-to-assess, with community-based follow-up to assess for persistent delirium and early new long-term cognitive impairment. Such a drive could be structurally integrated with existing memory clinic services. To succeed, such an ambition has to be flexible, adaptable and person-centred. To understand the impact on resource and service utilisation, techniques of quality improvement should be implemented, and appropriate metrics reflecting both process and outcome will be essential to underpin robust and sustainable business cases to support implementation of delirium care as a long-term solution.","Rahman, Shibley; Byatt, Kit",Age and ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951153/,59
161801,Modified Contact Lens Sandwich Technique of Glue for Management of Medium to Large Corneal Perforations in the COVID Era.,2021-01-29,"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exhibit frequent acute exacerbations (AE). The objectives of this study were first to evaluate the prevalence of pathogens associated to these episodes by combining conventional bacteriology and multiplex viral and bacterial PCR assays in sputum specimens, and second to determine whether C-reactive protein (CRP) value and clinical outcome could be influenced by the type of microbial agent(s) recovered from these samples. A cohort of 84 Tunisian patients hospitalized at the emergency room for AECOPD was investigated prospectively for the semi-quantitative detection of bacteria by conventional culture (the threshold of positivity was of 107 CFU/ml) and for the detection of viral genome and DNA of atypical bacteria by quantitative PCR using two commercial multiplex respiratory kits (Seegene and Fast-track). The two kits exhibited very similar performances although the Seegene assay was a bit more sensitive. A large number and variety of pathogens were recovered from the sputum samples of these 84 patients, including 15 conventional bacteria, one Chlamydia pneumoniae and 63 respiratory viruses, the most prevalent being rhinoviruses (n = 33) and influenza viruses (n = 13). From complete results available for 74 patients, the presence of bacteria was significantly associated with risk of recurrence at 6 and 12 months post-infection. The combination of these different markers appears useful for delineating correctly the antimicrobial treatment and for initiating a long-term surveillance in those patients with high risk of recurrent exacerbation episodes. A prospective study is required for confirming the benefits of this strategy aimed at improving the stewardship of antibiotics.","Messous, Salma; Elargoubi, Aida; Pillet, Sylvie; Rajoharison, Alain; Hoffmann, Jonathan; Trabelsi, Imen; Grissa, Mohamed Habib; Boukef, Riadh; Beltaief, Kaouther; Mastouri, Maha; Paranhos-Baccalà, Gláucia; Nouira, Semir; Pozzetto, Bruno",COPD,https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2020.1854210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33353408/,59

A bivariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test, linear trend chi-square, and Student's t-test, and a multivariate analysis of stepwise binary logistic regression was performed to predict the perception of cycle abnormality. In total, 77.4% of participants displayed normality; however, in self-reporting of menstrual characteristics, 67.4% identified alterations. Young women suffering from menstrual dizziness were 1.997 (CI95% = 1.010-3.950; p = 0.047) more likely to manifest abnormal menstruation, 4.518 (CI95% = 1.239-16.477; p = 0.022) more likely if they suffered from Grade 3 menstrual pain, and 2.851 (CI95% = 1.399-5.809; p = 0.004) more likely if they perceived that menstruation interfered with their daily lives.

It examines how art market participants employ fictional expectations of the future to stabilize valuations during uncertain times. A total of 86 forecasts originating from both the center and periphery of the global art market were analyzed. Taking a meta-analytic approach, focus was placed on what each analysis predicts, how it constructs the future it purports to know, and how the expected value of artworks and methods for their purchase are justified. This uncovered the paradoxical reality of art market forecasts—their authors are convinced that the power of crisis could reformulate the art market, but their conclusions do not assume the possibility of real change. Further, the argument is made that speculation about the future is at the core of today’s art economy. Therefore, in a crisis, market participants conservatively orient themselves toward artworks that already have established value.","Tuszko, Feliks",Arts,https://doi.org/10.3390/arts10030050,59

163437,Erratum,2021,"The spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health crisis. The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 (in particular the receptor binding domain, RBD) to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the antibodies is of great importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19 and evaluating the candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose a new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol, which agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol, respectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational alanine scanning method. The present study offers a computationally efficient and numerically reliable method to evaluate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 binding to other proteins, which may stimulate the development of the therapeutics against the COVID-19 disease in real applications.","Ding, Hong-ming; Yin, Yue-wen; Ni, Song-di; Sheng, Yan-jing; Ma, Yu-qiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03305v1.pdf,59

Different classifiers based on the optimization of the decision tree have been proposed, however, it is still evolving over time. This paper presents a novel and robust classifier based on a decision tree and tabu search algorithms, respectively. In the aim of improving performance, our proposed algorithm constructs multiple decision trees while employing a tabu search algorithm to consistently monitor the leaf and decision nodes in the corresponding decision trees. Additionally, the used tabu search algorithm is responsible to balance the entropy of the corresponding decision trees. For training the model, we used the clinical data of COVID-19 patients to predict whether a patient is suffering. The experimental results were obtained using our proposed classifier based on the built-in sci-kit learn library in Python. The extensive analysis for the performance comparison was presented using Big O and statistical analysis for conventional supervised machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the performance comparison to optimized state-of-the-art classifiers is also presented. The achieved accuracy of 98%, the required execution time of 55.6 ms and the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for proposed method of 0.95 reveals that the proposed classifier algorithm is convenient for large datasets. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we estimate the reduction in relative risk for confirmed infection and severe COVID-19 provided by the booster dose. Methods: 1,144,690 individuals aged 60y and older who were eligible for a booster dose were followed between July 30 and August 22, 2021. We defined dynamic cohorts where individuals initially belong to the 'non-booster' cohort, leave it when receiving the booster dose and join the 'booster' cohort 12 days later. Rates of infection and severe COVID-19 outcomes per person-days at risk were compared between the cohorts using Poisson regression, adjusting for possible confounding factors. Results: Twelve days or more after the booster dose we found an 11.4-fold (95% CI: [10.0, 12.9]) decrease in the relative risk of confirmed infection, and a >10-fold decrease in the relative risk of severe illness. Under a conservative sensitivity analysis, we find {approx}5-fold protection against confirmed infection. Conclusions: In conjunction with safety reports, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a third vaccine dose in both reducing transmission and severe disease and indicates the great potential of curtailing the Delta variant resurgence by administering booster shots.","Bar-On, Y.

167756,Influenza and schizophrenia: How can we shed a light in the new virus from an old association?,2021,"Background: A substantial proportion of primary care osteoarthritis (OA) consultations are associated with an X-ray request (1,2). Uncertainty exists regarding the ability of radiography to improve a clinical OA diagnosis, and the over-use of radiography may lead to inappropriate referrals due to severe radiographic features that do not correlate with patients' symptoms. Additionally, there are cost implications of unnecessarily imaging such a prevalent disease. As evidence questions the utility of routine radiography in OA, the extent to which radiography is supported by international guidelines is unknown. Objectives: To undertake a systematic review and narrative synthesis of UK and international guideline recommendations on the role of radiography in the diagnosis of OA. Methods: A systematic search of eleven electronic databases (including EMBASE, MEDLINE CINAHL, Epistemonikos and Guideline Central) and the websites of nine professional organisations (including NICE, Royal College of Radiologists (RCR), EULAR, and the American College of Radiology (ACR)) identified the most recent evidence-based guidelines produced by professional organisations on the role of imaging in OA. Guidelines not addressing the role of radiography in the diagnosis of OA were excluded, as were non-English and spinal OA guidelines. Each title was screened by one reviewer whilst each abstract and full text underwent dual screening. A single reviewer, using a standard proforma, undertook data extraction. Each guideline was independently appraised by two reviewers using the AGREE II tool. A narrative synthesis of the nature and consistency of OA radiographic recommendations was performed. Results: 18 evidence-based OA guidelines published between 1998-2019 were included. These guidelines considered OA at any joint (n=8), or at the knee (n=3), hip (n=2), hand (n=2), wrist (n=1), foot (n=1), and ankle (n=1). Seven guidelines were produced by European organisations;four guidelines were produced by EULAR. Guidelines were targeted at general practitioners (n=11), radiologists (n=7), rheumatologist (n=4) and orthopaedic surgeons (n=3). Using the AGREE II tool, the identified guidelines scored highly on rigour of development (mean score 69%) but poorly on applicability (32%). All 18 guidelines recommended X-rays as the first-line modality, where imaging was indicated. A clinical diagnosis of OA without radiographic confirmation was recommended by all eleven guidelines produced by organisations represented general practitioners, with seven guidelines justifying this due to a poor correlation between radiographic features and clinical symptoms. Only three guidelines explicitly discouraged the routine use of radiography for the diagnosis of OA and only two guidelines reassured practitioners of a low probability of missing serious pathology when not routinely requesting radiographs. Guidelines produced by organisations representing radiologists were more supportive of radiography. The ACR recommended radiographic confirmation in patients suspected to have OA at the hand, wrist, hip, knee, ankle, and foot. Conversely, the RCR recommended radiographic confirmation in patients suspected to have OA at the hand, feet, and hip, but not the knee. Conclusion: Differences in guideline recommendations on the utility of radiography in OA appear related to country/region, professional organisation, and joint. The use and utility of radiography in OA may need to be reviewed in light of a shift towards remote consultations, a change that has been accelerated by COVID-19 in many countries.","Henry-Blake, C.; Treadwell, K.; Parmar, S.; Higgs, J.; Marshall, M.; Edwards, J.; Peat, G.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.3117,59
167786,Leprosy in wild chimpanzees,2020-11-11,"Abstract Introduction: On August 13, 2021, India completed 30 weeks of vaccination against COVID-19 for its eligible citizens. While the vaccination has made progress, there has been no study analyzing the federal/union vaccine policy and its effect on vaccination coverage across Indian states. In this context, this study analyses the federal vaccination policy and its effect on interstate variation in vaccine coverage and the correlation of state economy with vaccination coverage. Methods: The study analyses vaccine policy documents, secondary data on vaccination coverage and state gross domestic product (GDP) available in public domain. ANOVA test has been used to assess the effect of vaccine policy on interstate vaccine coverage and correlation-regression analysis has been conducted to assess the type and strength of association between gross state domestic product and vaccination coverage. Results: Interstate variation in vaccination coverage in the first 15 weeks was the least (F=3.5), when vaccine procurement and supply was entirely provided by the union/federal government and vaccination was limited to priority groups. However, with the extension of vaccine policy to other groups and reduction in federal government involvement in vaccine procurement, the interstate variation in vaccination coverage increased significantly (F=10.74) by the end of 30 weeks. The highest interstate variation was observed in the period between 23-30 weeks (F=25.31). State GDP was positively and strongly correlated with state vaccination coverage with a high coefficient of correlation (R=0.94) and high coefficient of determination (Rsqaure= 0.88). Conclusions: The study finds that federal procurement and supply of vaccination among prioritized groups has been the best strategy till date to address the inequity in vaccination coverage across the states of India.","Mukherjee, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.16.21262113v1?rss=1,59

168737,Bayesian modeling for the detection of adverse events underreporting in clinical trials,2020-12-22,"Background: Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are uniquely susceptible to viral and bacterial illnesses. In addition, MM and its treatments lead to immune deficiency, putting patients at a high risk for infection, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The emotional impact of COVID-19 on high-risk groups, such as MM patients, remains unclear. The purpose of this project was to understand psychosocial distress and unmet needs among patients with active MM during the acute and chronic phase of COVID-19 and its impact in the United States. Methods: We utilized the HealthTree Cure Hub (healthtree.org) and invited patients with active MM cancer or precursor conditions to participate in an online CancerSupportSource distress screening questionnaire by the Cancer Support Community. Participants were asked to rate their level of concern (Not at All to Very Seriously) on 12 items assessing physical, psychosocial, and practical needs during the acute and chronic phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. De-identified responses were aggregated and reviewed. Results: 1,079 MM patients analyzed during the acute phase of the pandemic (April 15, 2020, to June 8, 2020) and 246 were analyzed during the chronic phase (January 8, 2021, to February 12, 2021). The percent of patients responding moderately to very seriously concerned are reported here. While eating and nutrition increased 3% from acute (71%) to chronic (74%) phases, physical needs overall decreased 2%. Psychosocial needs (worrying about the future, family concerns, feeling irritable, sad, nervous, or lonely, and relationship concerns) decreased 4% between the two phases, despite the 2% increase in problems with your spouse/partner. Additionally, practical needs (health insurance or money worries) decreased 4% between the acute and chronic phases of the pandemic. Conclusions: Respondents to our survey maintain a concern for eating and nutrition during the acute and chronic phases of the pandemic. Between the three types of needs examined in this survey, physical needs had the smallest change over time. This information can inform patients and medical professionals of the type of distress experienced by patients and help investigators assess the needs of the patient community to enhance patient outcomes.","Ahlstrom, J.; Molina, T.

Notwithstanding, saliva also could be applied as a noninvasive method to COVID-19 diagnosis and disease evolution monitoring. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize the main findings regarding to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection repercussion in saliva and/or salivary glands, addressing the following questions: What has been published regarding to the presence and implications of COVID-19 in saliva or salivary glands? and What are the researchers' main results and conclusions?. Materials and Methods: A total of 31 published articles were included (27 research articles and 4 case reports). PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched till August 2020. The terms COVID-19, novel coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 were combined with the keywords salivary gland, saliva, sialadenitis, parotid gland, sublingual gland submandibular gland, salivary gland disease, and minor salivary gland using the Boolean operator 'AND.' Results: In this study, researchers' main results and conclusions were exposed in tables. The main subjects of the articles were detection and viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, the influence of mouthwashes in SARS-CoV-2, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. Conclusion: Although deep throat saliva may be used as a diagnostic tool to SAR-CoV-2 diagnosis, researchers found that the viral load in saliva is lower than in respiratory secretions. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

However, next-generation vaccine design efforts have been complicated by challenges including the genetic plasticity of the virus and the immunodominance of certain epitopes in its glycoprotein antigens. Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens display 20 hemagglutinin (HA) trimers in a highly immunogenic array, and their assembly in vitro enables precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct HAs in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens displaying the four HAs of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) elicited hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibody responses to vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent or superior to commercial QIV in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates. The nanoparticle immunogens—but not QIV—simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses, including H5N1 and H7N9, by targeting the subdominant yet conserved HA stem. Unlike previously reported influenza vaccine candidates, our nanoparticle immunogens can alter the intrinsic immunodominance hierarchy of HA to induce both potent receptor-blocking and broadly cross-reactive stem-directed antibody responses and are attractive candidates for a next-generation influenza vaccine that could replace current seasonal vaccines. One Sentence Summary Nanoparticle immunogens displaying four seasonal influenza hemagglutinins elicit neutralizing antibodies directed at both the immunodominant head and the conserved stem and confer broad protective immunity.","Boyoglu-Barnum, Seyhan; Ellis, Daniel; Gillespie, Rebecca A.; Hutchinson, Geoffrey B.; Park, Young-Jun; Moin, Syed M.; Acton, Oliver; Ravichandran, Rashmi; Murphy, Mike; Pettie, Deleah; Matheson, Nick; Carter, Lauren; Creanga, Adrian; Watson, Michael J.; Kephart, Sally; Vaile, John R.; Ueda, George; Crank, Michelle C.; Stewart, Lance; Lee, Kelly K.; Guttman, Miklos; Baker, David; Mascola, John R.; Veesler, David; Graham, Barney S.; King, Neil P.; Kanekiyo, Masaru",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.30.125179,59

Malicious intruders have been responsible for most of the cybercrimes committed recently and are the cause for a growing number of cyber threats, including identity and IP thefts, financial crimes, and cyber-attacks to critical infrastructures. Machine learning (ML) has proven itself as a prominent field of study over the past decade due to solving highly complex and sophisticated real-world problems. This paper proposes an ML-based classification technique to detect the growing number of malicious URLs, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently considered a threat to IT users. We have used a large volume of Open Source data and preprocessed it using our developed tool to generate feature vectors and trained the ML model using an apprehensive malicious threat weight. Our ML model has been tested, with and without entropy to forecast the threatening factors of COVID-19 URLs. The empirical evidence proves our methods to be a promising mechanism to mitigate COVID-19 related threats early in the attack lifecycle.","Ispahany, J.; Islam, R.; Ieee,",19th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (IEEE PerCom),https://doi.org/10.1109/percomworkshops51409.2021.9431064,59

Whilst the BHRS recommended remote device follow-up wherever possible, this is not always feasible. In addition, continuing diagnostic services including Holter monitoring was necessary to support the telephone- clinic based outpatient Cardiology service operating at the height of the pandemic. The physiology service at our district general hospital carried out 3494 device checks and 2762 ambulatory Holter monitors last year. We describe a novel model implemented here to continue providing essential cardiac investigations and device follow-up whilst minimising risk of COVID transmission. A drive-by unit was set up within the hospital car park and specifically delineated parking spaces were allocated for patients to park with the patient remaining in the vehicle at all times. At the appointment time, they are called forward. To fit ambulatory Holter monitors, a PPE-donned physiologist passes over the Holter pack containing both the monitor and visual instructions on applying it. Assistance is provided via telephone if necessary. Return of the monitor is performed in a similar manner. For device checks, the header is passed over to the patient suitably protected. The patient places the header over the site of the device for the duration of the check following which it is returned via the window. The device site is inspected visually where appropriate through the window. Our experience suggests that the diagnostic value of self-applied Holter monitors have been comparable to that of physiologist-applied monitors. To the end of August 2020, 850 device checks had been carried out and 557 Holter monitors had been dispensed. Dispensing the Holter monitors in this manner has resulted in a very high diagnostic accuracy with very few non diagnostic recordings on patient-applied Holters. Patient feedback in comparing experiences to the in-hospital pacing clinic have been very positive. This demonstrates that such a model is feasible without compromising clinical care whilst reducing face to face patient contact and subsequent likelihood of COVID-19 transmission.","Xavier, R.; Montalbano, N.; Chua, T.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.99,59

We studied from a multimodal perspective the Instagram accounts of the presidential candidates of four Latin American countries which held elections in 2021 to identify how much of the discourse was related to controlling the pandemic. The discourse was analyzed using different taxonomies. In the correlation between the discourse and following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), Chile stood out with the highest level of pandemic compliance;Peru and Ecuador were placed in the middle, while Honduras showed little if any interest. The conclusion was that politicians focused primarily on their campaigns and marginally on the pandemic. The omission of COVID-19 from most publications reflected a misinformative discourse which could potentially confuse the public. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.","Cabrera-Méndez, M.; Osorio, R.

This study aimed at developing artificial intelligence-based models to predict the risk of mucormycosis among the patients at the time of discharge from the hospital. Methods: The dataset included 1229 COVID-19 positive patients, and additional 214 inpatients, COVID-19 positive as well as infected with mucormycosis. We used logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, and the extreme gradient boosting algorithm. All our models were evaluated with 5-fold validation to derive a reliable estimate of the model error. Results: The logistic regression, XGBoost, and random forest performed equally well with AUROC 95.0, 94.0, and 94.0 respectively. This study also determined the top five variables namely obesity, anosmia, de novo diabetes, myalgia, and nasal discharge, which showed a positive impact on the risk of mucormycosis. Conclusion: The developed model has the potential to predict the patients at high risk and thus, consequently initiating preventive care or aiding in early detection of mucormycosis infection. Thus, this study holds potential for early treatment and better management of patients suffering from COVID-19 associated mucormycosis.","Syed-Abdul, S.; Babu, A. S.; Bellamkonda, R.

The education sector is no exception. Due to physical restrictions in accessing campus infrastructures, students and instructors at academic institutions have forcibly adapted to the new norm of virtual learning with mixed expectations and outcomes. There have been several studies conducted by educational practitioners since the pandemic began, which mostly focused on how academic constituents quickly adapt to virtual learning in a general sense. The main objective of this study is to examine the effects of virtual learning infrastructure and environment on student learning, specific to the civil engineering program at Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd University (PMU). A survey was distributed to civil engineering students at PMU at the end of the fall 2020 term to gather perceptions about virtual learning and check the adequacy of online learning tools and associated environments. Student performance during virtual learning in terms of grade achievement was also investigated and compared with a normal situation. In general, it was found that students are satisfied with the current technology used to facilitate virtual learning.

However, little is known about the limits of what constitutes a public clonotype. Here, we characterize the sequence and functional properties of antibodies from a public HIV-specific clonotype comprising sequences from 3 individuals. Our results showed that antigen specificity for the public antibodies was modulated by the VH, but not VL, germline gene. Non-native pairing of public heavy and light chains from different donors resulted in antibodies with consistent antigen specificity, suggesting functional complementation of sequences within the public antibody clonotype. The strength of antigen recognition appeared to be dependent on the specific antibody light chain used, but not on other sequence features such as germline or native-antibody sequence identity. Understanding the determinants of antibody clonotype “publicness” can provide insights into the fundamental rules of host-pathogen interactions at the population level, with implications for clonotype-specific vaccine development.","Murji, Amyn A.; Raju, Nagarajan; Qin, Juliana S; Kaldine, Haajira; Janowska, Katarzyna; Fechter, Emilee Friedman; Mapengo, Rutendo; Scheepers, Cathrine; Setliff, Ian; Acharya, Priyamvada; Morris, Lynn; Georgiev, Ivelin S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.444191,59

While in the case of uniform lockdown a simple compartmental model would indicate instantaneous transition to decay of the epidemic, this is not the case when partially isolated active clusters remain with the potential to create a series of small outbreaks. We model this using a connected set of stochastic susceptible-infected-removed/recovered (SIR) models representing the locked-down majority population (where the reproduction number is less than one) weakly coupled to a large set of small clusters where the infection may propagate. We find that the presence of such active clusters can lead to slower than expected decay of the epidemic and significantly delayed onset of the decay phase. We study the relative contributions of these changes to the additional total infections caused by the active clusters within the locked-down population. We also demonstrate that limiting the size of the inevitable active clusters can be efficient in reducing their impact on the overall size of the epidemic outbreak.","Khataee, H.; Kibble, J.; Scheuring, I.; Czirok, A.; Neufeld, Z.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248154v1?rss=1,59

In France, while the vaccination campaign is progressing, the French government has decided to remove many public health restrictions such as business closure, lockdowns and curfews. Nonetheless, social distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing (also called barrier gestures) are still recommended. We utilize an age-structured compartmental SEIR model that takes into account SARS-CoV-2 waning immunity, vaccination, and increased transmissibility from variants of concern, to estimate if barrier gestures can be relaxed without causing a resurgence of severe infections. This model assumes that susceptibility to infection is a function of immunity status, which depends on initial infection severity and vaccination status. It is calibrated on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the French surveillance database, and accounts for changes in contact behaviors due to implementation of nation-wide public health policies. We study partial and full relaxation of barrier gestures occurring from August to December 2021 under various immunity duration assumptions. Maintaining application of barrier gestures appears essential to avoid a resurgence of severe infections that would exceed health care capacities, while surmounting vaccine hesitancy represents the key to consider their relaxation. Immunity duration assumptions significantly influence the short-term dynamic of the epidemic which should be considered for further modelling.","Vignals, C.; Dick, D.

The spontaneous shape of the axoneme and the resting shape of the paraflagellar rod are incompatible. The complex non-planar configurations of the coupled system emerge as the energetically optimal compromise between the two antagonistic components.

Study Design: Longitudinal observational cohort study using individual-level linked data. Setting: Care home residents in Wales (United Kingdom) between 1st September 2020 and 1st May 2021. Participants: 14,786 older care home residents (aged 65+). Our dataset consisted of 2,613,341 individual-level daily observations within 697 care homes. Methods: We estimated odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) using multilevel logistic regression models. Our outcome of interest was a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We included time dependent covariates for the estimated community positive test rate of COVID-19, hospital admissions, and vaccination status. Additional covariates were included for age, positive PCR tests prior to the study, sex, frailty (using the hospital frailty risk score), and specialist care home services. Results: The multivariable logistic regression model indicated an increase in age (OR 1.01 [1.00,1.01] per year of age), community positive test rate (OR 1.13 [1.12,1.13] per percent increase in positive test rate), hospital inpatients (OR 7.40 [6.54,8.36]), and residents in care homes with non-specialist dementia care (OR 1.42 [1.01,1.99]) had an increased odds of a positive test. Having a positive test prior to the observation period (OR 0.58 [0.49,0.68]) and either one or two doses of a vaccine (0.21 [0.17,0.25] and 0.05 [0.02,0.09] respectively) were associated with a decreased odds of a positive test. Conclusions: Our findings suggest care providers need to stay vigilant despite the vaccination rollout, and extra precautions should be taken when caring for the most vulnerable. Furthermore, minimising potential COVID-19 infection for care home residents admitted to hospital should be prioritised.","Hollinghurst, J.; Hollinghurst, R.; North, L.; Mizen, A.; Akbari, A.; Long, S.; Lyons, R.

176557,Skill-less Tricks: A score for moving through walls,2020,"High frequency oscillations (HFO) are receiving increased attention for their role in health and disease. Ketamine-dependent HFO have been identified in cortical and subcortical regions in rodents, however, the mechanisms underlying their generation and whether they occur in higher mammals is unclear. Here, we show under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, classical gamma oscillations diminish and a prominent > 80 Hz oscillation emerges in the olfactory bulb of rats and cats. In cats negligible HFO was observed in the thamalus and visual cortex indicating the OB was a suitable site for further investigation. Simultaneous local field potential and thermocouple recordings demonstrated HFO was dependent on nasal airflow. Silicon probe mapping studies spanning almost the entire dorsal ventral aspect of the OB revealed this rhythm was strongest in ventral areas of the bulb and associated with microcurrent sources about the mitral layer. Pharmacological microinfusion studies revealed HFO was dependent on excitatory-inhibitory synaptic activity, but not gap junctions. Finally, we showed HFO was preserved despite surgical removal of the piriform cortex. We conclude that ketamine-dependent HFO in the OB are driven by nasal airflow and local dendrodendritic interactions. The relevance of our findings to ketamine’s model of psychosis in awake state are also discussed.","Średniawa, Władysław; Wróbel, Jacek; Kublik, Ewa; Wójcik, Daniel Krzysztof; Whittington, Miles Adrian; Hunt, Mark Jeremy",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.217604,59

Lymphopenia is a common feature in severe cases of COVID-19; however, the role of T cell responses during infection is unclear. Here, we inoculated six cynomolgus monkeys, divided into two groups according to the CD3+ T cell population in peripheral blood, with two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2: one of East Asian lineage and one of European lineage. After initial infection with the isolate of East Asian lineage, all three monkeys in the CD3+ low group showed clinical symptoms, including loss of appetite, lethargy, and transient severe anemia with/without short-term fever, within 14 days post-infection (p.i.). By contrast, all three monkeys in the CD3+ high group showed mild clinical symptoms such as mild fever and loss of appetite within 4 days p.i. and then recovered. After a second inoculation with the isolate of European lineage, three of four animals in both groups showed mild clinical symptoms but recovered quickly. Hematological, immunological, and serological tests suggested that the CD3+ high and low groups mounted different immune responses during the initial and second infection stages. In both groups, anti-viral and innate immune responses were activated during the early phase of infection and re-infection. However, in the CD3+ low group, inflammatory responses, such as increased production of monocytes and neutrophils, were stronger than those in the CD3+ high group, leading to more severe immunopathology and failure to eliminate the virus. Taken together, the data suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population is associated with pneumonia severity in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2. Author summary SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an illness with clinical manifestations that vary from asymptomatic or mild to severe; examples include severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lymphopenia, which is common in severe COVID-19 cases, is characterized by markedly reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Here, we showed that cynomolgus monkeys selected according to the T cell populations in peripheral blood have different outcomes after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and may facilitate the development of animal models for vaccine evaluation.","Nagata, Noriyo; Iwata-Yoshikawa, Naoko; Sano, Kaori; Ainai, Akira; Shiwa, Nozomi; Shirakura, Masayuki; Kishida, Noriko; Arita, Tomoko; Suzuki, Yasushi; Harada, Toshihiko; Kawai, Yasuhiro; Ami, Yasushi; Iida, Shun; Katano, Harutaka; Fujisaki, Seiichiro; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Shimizu, Hiroyuki; Suzuki, Tadaki; Hasegawa, Hideki",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.07.425698,59
177611,Oro över coronapandemin i det svenska samhället,2021,"Introduction: Lung US has been reported to be as useful as a chest CT scan and much better than a chest x-ray for the evaluation of pneumonia. Objective: This study aimed to compare the findings of lung ultrasound (US) and chest CT scan of patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia in the Emergency Department (ED). Methods: This retrospective observational pilot study was carried out on confirmed COVID-19 patients in the isolation corona ward of the Imam Hussein Hospital ED from March 15 to March 22, 2020. After obtaining demographic data, the patients underwent a pulmonary bedside US examination, with the patients in the sitting position, turning their back to the examiner. A 10-point lung US was performed. Each lung was divided into two areas: posterior (three zones) and lateral (two zones). The patients’ lung ultrasound and chest CT scan as the standard imaging were blindly reviewed and recorded. The clinical value of ultrasound was evaluated with different severity of lung involvement according to CT severity score. Results: Nineteen patients (38 zones), including 13 males, were evaluated with a mean age of 62.5±16.8 years. B2 lines and consolidation observed in the US examinations were significantly correlated with ground-glass opacity and consolidation observed in CT scan examinations, respectively (p <0.0001). US sensitivity and specificity of finding B2 lines were 90% and 100%, respectively. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of US in identifying consolidation were 82% and 100%, respectively. In the lungs with moderate and severe lobar involvement, US findings were significantly correlated (p <0.05) with CT scan findings. Conclusions: Ultrasound evaluation is a safe, fast, and rapid technique for the evaluation of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia. It is a reproducible procedure and can be implemented by the operator after a short course of training. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.","Hatamabadi, H.; Shojaee, M.; Bagheri, M.; Raoufi, M.",Frontiers in Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.18502/fem.v5i2.5612,59

Final year osteopathy students were assessed using a hybrid ten station OSCE, comprising both online and face-to-face components. The examination was led by a pre-recorded narrated PowerPoint video. The video contained instructions, case information for five cases and prompts for the practical stations. A student model stepped into the room as needed for practical stations. The examiner assessed students from another room via video streaming, with no interaction with student. The hybrid OSCE was conducted safely during Stage 4 restrictions adhering to COVID Safe guidelines, allowing robust competency assessment of final year students, enabling timely graduation and transition to practice. Institutional support, technology infrastructure, clear communication and stakeholder collaboration are key to successful implementation. The hybrid OSCE format offers a potential solution for institutions delivering high-stakes assessment in the continuing challenges of clinical assessment in the post COVID landscape.

179296,Deforestation projections imply range-wide population decline for critically endangered Bornean orangutan,2021-07-16,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and can lead to serious medical complications. Early detection of COVID-19 is important to control the spread of the disease and reduce the associated mortality rates. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is commonly used for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the RT-PCR is time consuming, requires special materials, and might have limited detection sensitivity in mild cases. One of the promising complementary modalities to improve the detection and tracking of COVID-19 is X-ray imaging of the chest, but the task of interpreting chest X-ray images is challenging. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide an effective computational tool for classifying chest X-ray images with the goal of achieving accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. This study investigates the application of two pre-trained CNN models, namely AlexNet and ResNet-50, using transfer learning to classify chest X-ray images as normal, pneumonia (non-COVID-19 pneumonia), and COVID-19. The transfer learning process was applied based on two classification approaches, which are the flat classification approach and the hierarchical classification approach. The performance of the proposed CNN-based classification schemes has been evaluated using a dataset that includes 8,703 chest X-ray images. The results indicate that the pre-trained CNN models combined with the hierarchical classification approach achieved effective classification of chest X-ray images. In particular, the pre-trained AlexNet model that is combined with the hierarchical classification approach obtained macro-averaged classification specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score of 98.3%, 89.1%, and 91.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the pre-trained ResNet-50 model that is combined with the hierarchical classification approach achieved macro-averaged specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score of 97.4%, 95.2%, and 94.9%, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.","Daoud, M.

Since this pandemic crisis elapses time, researchers worldwide are busy trying new solutions to overcome the heavy toll of the COVID-19 illness morbidity and mortality. One such drug with growing recognition is melatonin. Melatonin is a well-known anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecule which helps in promoting adaptive immunity. Melatonin improves sleep and anxiety and also can prevent fibrosis. It is a readily available over-the-counter medication that can be manufactured easily in bulk, hence inexpensive to a patient from a developing nation like India. It can be orally administered and has a wide margin of safety.

Scores on this measure were particularly volatile during 2019 and 2020, a period which included Trump's first impeachment, the beginning of the COVID pandemic, and the 2020 presidential campaign. In comparison with prior presidential election years, only MSNBC showed a drop in positive emotions in 2020, while both networks increased in the use of communal and analytic language.

180852,"World on fire: Humans, animals, and the future of the planet",2021,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate problems that emerged in indigenous community-based tourism during the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify the actors involved and to identify values that were exchanged between actors during the pandemic. This research is crucial given the limited studies around indigenous community-based tourism during the pandemic, especially within the perspectives of value exchange theory. Design/methodology/approach: This research used a constructionist paradigm with a qualitative case study design. Data collection included interviews with six participants, virtual observation, an open-ended questionnaire to 22 community members and 20 tourists, analysis of a book written by Sade’s customary chief and social media artifacts. This study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, where physical distancing measures were applied, therefore most data were collected remotely. Purposive sampling was used and research credibility was increased through detailed note taking, data sources triangulation and member checking. Data analysis was conducted with a coding process, which involved continuous iterations. Findings: Problems identified were decreased revenue and power disadvantage suffered by indigenous community-based tourism. The actors involved in value exchanges varied, including value supporter (i.e. government, private sector such as television, university), value creator (i.e. tourist) or secondary value provider (i.e. travel agent). Values emerged in the interaction between actors in the network. Changes in value exchanges were in terms of value types, relationship intensity between actors and ways of doing the exchange. Non-human factor (i.e. non-actor) was also involved. Research limitations/implications: Due to restrictive circumstances (i.e. COVID-19 pandemic), the data collection procedure was limited to online communications and letter correspondence. Therefore, opportunities to capture the full phenomenon might be missed as the researchers could not physically meet with the participant. Practical implications: It was possible for value exchange to alter due to situational factors, including a pandemic. Business diversification is needed by indigenous community-based tourism to achieve a power advantage. Values were found in the relationship between actors, hence, meeting channels or dialogue with other actors could be optimized. Originality/value: The context of this study, which was indigenous community-based tourism during a pandemic contributed to the study’s originality. Research in this context, which used a clear theoretical framework such as value exchange theory, is scarce. Thus, opportunities for transferability are broad. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Rembulan, C.

The strategy includes free access to Covid-19 testing and since 2021, compulsory documentation for negative test or vaccination for access to workplace, educational institutions, restaurants, and many other places. In the present study we analysed the effect of the Danish mass testing strategy throughout relevant stages of the pandemic. Mass testing was found not to have impact on the number of hospitalizations during the pandemic. Furthermore, during the highest level of testing in the spring 2021 the fraction of positive tests increased slightly on comparable days indicating that mass testing at best, did not reduce the prevalence of Covid-19. The relationship between positives in antigen testing and in PCR testing indicated that many patients are not tested early in their infection where the risk of transmission is highest. A likely explanation for the lack of impact of mass testing on hospitalizations and infections is that the testing increases risk-behaviour of the tested persons and that a high fraction of false negatives at low Covid-19 prevalence combined with increased risk-behaviour outweighs beneficial effects of mass testing.","Busk, P.

This study investigated ambulance clinicians’ experiences and use of decision support strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsForty-eight percent (16/33) of paramedics invited agreed to be interviewed. Telephone/video interviews were undertaken between September and December 2020. Framework analysis was undertaken. Data were indexed and charted by one researcher. A sample was then checked by two other researchers. Analytical interpretation was collectively undertaken by all three researchers to identify a higher-level conceptual understanding.ResultsFour key themes were identified:Impact on clinical decision making – Deciding whether to take a patient to an Emergency Department is often challenging. Paramedics reported that COVID-19 increased the complexity of this process.Decision Support – Enhanced decision support was perceived as unequally available across the ambulance service. Where present, several paramedics reported that it was highly valuable.Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – Routine use of extensive PPE was a very new experience for all participants. Some reported that the number of calls initially exceeded PPE availability.Personal impact of dealing with COVID-19 – Several paramedics stated that media reports combined with paramedics appearing in full PPE increased levels of anxiety among many patients they attended. Some participants were worried about catching COVID-19 and the possibility of taking the virus home to their families.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that COVID-19 has placed considerable stress on the ambulance service at both organisational and individual levels.

For reconstruction of the gastrointestinal passage, two stomach preserving PD variants exist: pylorus preservation (ppPD), or pylorus resection (prPD) with preservation of the stomach. In pancreatic surgery, delayed gastric emptying (DGE) remains a serious complication after PD with an incidence varying between 4.5% and 45%, potentially delaying hospital discharge or further treatment, e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy. Evidence is lacking to assess which variant of PD entails fewer postoperative DGE. Methods and analysis The protocol of a large-scale, multicentre, pragmatic, two-arm parallel-group, registry-based randomised controlled trial (rRCT) using a two-stage group-sequential design is presented. This patient-blind rRCT aims to demonstrate the superiority of prPD over ppPD with respect to the overall incidence of DGE within 30 days after index surgery in a German real-world setting. A total of 984 adults undergoing elective PD for any indication will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be recruited at about 30 hospitals being members of the StuDoQ|Pancreas registry established by the German Society of General and Visceral Surgery (DGAV). The postoperative follow-up for each patient will be 30 days. The primary analysis will follow an intention-to-treat approach and applies a binary logistic random intercepts model.

Nowadays, traditional classroom teaching methods, in which the learners passively participate and the teacher controls everything, are no longer relevant. The impact of information and technological change is also visible in the field of education. The meaning of such concepts as education, teachers, learner, learning process is changing. Therefore, it is necessary to diversify learning models. Key components such as face-to-face teaching, effective learning strategies, and the use of learning technologies are common to all practices. Given today's needs and the profile of 'learners', it is obvious that different teaching methods are needed than traditional ones. This is the time of digital students, and if teachers want to teach the younger generation, they should redesign their methods and materials according to the learning style of the learners. This article was designed to assess the impact of COVID 19 on learning through surveys, gathering the views of students and teachers at the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. The pandemic significantly increased the introduction of distance learning in all areas of training, both at schools and universities. The important point was that this transition took place instantly and a large number of students and teachers were not ready for it. It was seen that the quality of knowledge of a large number of students decreased, because in this situation the usual comfort zone changed. Isolation, the need to plan one's own time, individual work, lack of counselling, etc. played a role. These issues came to the fore among those students whose level of secondary school preparation was insufficient for the requirements of higher education. © 2021 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

Factors associated with poor mental health were: place of origin (54% from urban areas), sex (62.1% women), age (67.5% between 65 and 80 years old), period of self-isolation (81% in self-isolation for more than 14 days), comorbidities (75.6% with multiple comorbidities) and form of treatment for psoriasis (48.6% are systemically administered treatment for psoriasis). Conclusions: In this sample of patients with psoriasis from Braila County who isolate or socially distance themselves, urban patients, women, elderly, those with comorbidities and those who are systemically administered treatment for psoriasis were associated with a high score on the Hamilton anxiety assessment scale. However, we have to admit that our research has some limitations. First, the number of participants included in the study was small. Secondly, we used an online way to conduct the study. Thirdly, we used a self-assessment scale to assess the anxiety symptoms of psoriasis patients, which might have some deviation from the outcome. Looking beyond the current situation, it is essential to evaluate and restructure the way we think about patient's care.","Oltenacu, R. C.; Ciubara, A. B.; Nechifor, A.; Burlea, S.

183828,Laparoscopic Management of Heterotopic Interstitial Pregnancy with Subsequent Term Delivery.,2015,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact both the international economy and individual lives. A fast and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is required to limit the spread of this disease and reduce the number of infections and deaths. However, a time consuming biological test, Real-Time Reverse Transcription–Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), is used to diagnose COVID-19. Furthermore, sometimes the test produces ambiguous results, especially when samples are taken in the early stages of the disease. As a potential solution, machine learning algorithms could help enhance the process of detecting COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we have provided a study that compares the stand-alone CNN model and hybrid machine learning models in their ability to detect COVID-19 from chest X-Ray images. We presented four models to classify such kinds of images into COVID-19 and normal. Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) is the architecture used to develop the stand-alone CNN model. This hybrid model consists of two parts: the VGG-16 as a features extractor, and a conventional machine learning algorithm, such as support-vector-machines (SVM), Random-Forests (RF), and Extreme-Gradient-Boosting (XGBoost), as a classifier. Even though several studies have investigated this topic, the dataset used in this study is considered one of the largest because we have combined five existing datasets. The results illustrate that there is no noticeable improvement in the performance when hybrid models are used as an alternative to the stand-alone CNN model. VGG-16 and (VGG16+SVM) models provide the best performance with a 99.82% model accuracy and 100% model sensitivity. In general, all the four presented models are reliable, and the lowest accuracy obtained among them is 98.73%. © 2021.

However, increasingly lax policies saw rising cases starting in August. Italy currently sits with 423,578 cases and 36,616 deaths (October 20, 2020). This retrospective observational study aimed to assess stringency policies related to nation-wide containment and closure, as well as health system instruments, to determine their potency. The first nationally implemented policy was on January 31, followed by a battery of strong restrictions imposed on February 22-23. The Stringency Index peaked at 93.5 on April 12. However, policies were relaxed following a flattening of the curve on May 4 when the Stringency Index went from 93.5 to 63.0. Italy's policies were essential to contain the spread of the virus initially, but the lax policies since the end of spring, especially related to school reopening, no stay-at-home and domestic travel restrictions, and reduced contact tracing, have now resurrected the COVID-19 pandemic.","Teixeira da Silva, J.

Within the context of quantum hydrodynamics, we introduce a regularized nuclear Bohm potential admitting solutions comprising a train of $\delta$-functions which provide a finite-dimensional sampling of the hydrodynamic flow paths. The bohmion method inherits all the basic conservation laws from its underlying variational structure and captures electronic decoherence. After reviewing the general theory, the method is applied to the well-known Tully models, which are used here as benchmark problems. In the present case of study, we show that the new method accurately reproduces both electronic decoherence and nuclear population dynamics.","Holm, Darryl D.; Rawlinson, Jonathan I.; Tronci, Cesare",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03569v5.pdf,59

The dramatic changes in people’s lifestyle caused by the coronavirus (social distancing, limitation of contacts, new hygiene rules, disruption of the usual way of life, etc.) inevitably had to be reflected in such sources. We focused our attention on four Islamic legal institutions located in Arab countries (including Al-Azhar which is one of the most influential) and three institutions based in Western European states. The main research issue was related to how the Islamic legal institutions’ positions differ regarding the coronavirus situation and whether there is a dependence of these institutions’ attitudes on their geographic location. We gathered a collection of fatwas and other official and semi-official documents issued by these Islamic legal institutions, reviewed some of them, and applied manual content analysis to the other part of the sources. We also intended to find out which topics worried Muslim scholars most of all and in which way – religious or secular – they most often covered their positions on everything related to the coronavirus. In the course of the study, linguistic analysis of the sources was also carried out. It was interesting to see how often specific legal vocabulary was encountered in the analyzed sources – a sure sign that the text transmitted with its use has legal authority in the Muslim world. The study revealed a barely perceptible but intriguing difference between these Islamic institutions’ positions towards the “Corona Crisis”. © 2021 Universitatea de Vest Vasile Goldis din Arad.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design was used, which involved semi-structured interviews on five creative industry-based businesses in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A narrative inquiry approach was used to obtain an in-depth understanding of SMEs’ resilience. The data obtained were analyzed using thematic analysis via MaxQDA 2020. Findings: The Covid-19 pandemic triggered the emergence of both new opportunities and new constraints for SMEs. These, in turn, significantly interrupt their business model. SMEs are found to navigate survival, continuity and growth by drawing from their resourcefulness and firm-level strategies to cope with the new opportunities and constraints. Research limitations/implications: This study was conducted qualitatively based on five SMEs in the creative industry in Indonesia. This limits the ability to compare the findings across different economic sectors. Practical implications: SMEs facing emergent constraints may need to find new ways to recombine existing resources and simultaneously seek to innovate their business model. Business owners and entrepreneurs should adopt a positive mindset such as optimism, perseverance and efficacy, to cope with adversity. Growth-oriented SMEs may make use of a competitive mindset such as flexibility, speed and innovation, to spot and exploit opportunities that emerge from the crisis. Social implications: SMEs’ resilience should be understood not only in terms of economic survival and continuity but, more deeply, about their social contribution to the localities where they operate. Originality/value: This study illustrates the process of how adaptive resilience is adapted and executed by SMEs. It also contributes to entrepreneurial resilience and resourcefulness literature by explaining how entrepreneurs anticipate, respond to and leverage from the crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Purnomo, B.

185750,Dentistry.,1874,"Power line interference (“hum noise”) is a common source of noise in recorded biological data. It has a highly constant frequency with harmonics and little variation in amplitude and wave shape. In contrast to stochastic noise it is phasic, i.e., the phase relation remains constant across long intervals. In digital recordings, the measurement frequency is typically very close to a multiple of the hum frequency (50 or 60 Hz). Common filters introduce various kinds of distortions and errors. The here proposed subtraction method makes use of the specific properties of power line hum. For this, it computes a moving estimate of the hum noise by taking the periodic median of the high-pass filtered signal. The resulting periodic median subtraction (PMS) filter reliably removes hum of any harmonic composition, even if the ground frequency is lacking. The filter is completely free of border artifacts. It does not introduce distortions, even if around sharp transients such as in force plate recordings of jumping. The filter is validated on recorded and artificial data. The errors are quantified. The results also show that the errors of hum filters generally increase with the high-frequency content of the data. Thus, the removal of hum from a force plate recording generally gives better results than from an EMG recoding. Compared to other filters, the errors of the PMS filter are generally lower than the best hum filters currently known.","de Lussanet de la Sablonière, Marc H.

RESULTS A lack of scientific evidence exists through a large amount of manuscripts. The authors support prioritizing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Once priorities have been established, that will facilitate providing each patients the limited resources. Initial diagnostic procedures for testicular cancer such as scrotal US, orchiectomy, staging CT and adjuvant treatment (if required) are priority. Reducing the usage of chemotherapy with respiratory toxicity and increasing the usage ofgrowth factors during chemotherapy treatment are the main stakeholders of treatment. Besides, providing active surveillance on non-risk factor clinical stage I is alsoa priority. In case of positive COVID-19, it is important to high light that the vast majority of patients are tentatively cured.

Although this discrepancy is a well known problem, the prevalence of low automated platelet counts in feline blood samples has not been documented. We retrospectively compared the prevalence of low automated platelet counts with low blood smear-estimated platelet counts in feline blood samples. Results of blood sample analysis from 359 cats during a 1-year period at the University of Glasgow Veterinary Haematology Laboratory were examined. Smear estimates of platelet number were done in those cases in which records did not indicate adequate platelet numbers. Platelet counts obtained with an impedance counter (Minos Vet, Abx Hematologie) were <200X10(9) cells/L in 256 samples (71%) and <50X10(9) cells/L in 43 samples (12%). However, based on estimation of platelet numbers from blood smears, only 11 samples (3.1%) had platelet counts of <200X10(9) cells/L and 9 samples (2.5%) had counts of <50X10(9) cells/L. Four cats with thrombocytopenia estimated by blood smear evaluation had clinical signs of a bleeding disorder. Disorders associated with thrombocytopenia included neoplasia, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and infectious diseases. There was no evidence that delay due to mailing of samples was associated with lower automated platelet counts than would have been obtained on the day of sampling. The high prevalence of apparent thrombocytopenia in automated platelet counts was attributed to a combination of platelet aggregation and the impedance method of cell differentiation by size. Vigilance and careful examination of blood smears is required to identify the few cats with true thrombocytopenia.","Norman, Elizabeth J.; Barron, Ronnie C.

189615,A Nationwide Analysis of Kidney Autotransplantation.,2017,"Lung carcinoma is often incurable and remains the leading cancer killer in both men and women. Recent evidence indicates that tumors contain a small population of cancer stem cells that are responsible for tumor maintenance and spreading. The identification of the tumorigenic population that sustains lung cancer may contribute significantly to the development of effective therapies. Here, we found that the tumorigenic cells in small cell and non-small cell lung cancer are a rare population of undifferentiated cells expressing CD133, an antigen present in the cell membrane of normal and cancer-primitive cells of the hematopoietic, neural, endothelial and epithelial lineages. Lung cancer CD133(+) cells were able to grow indefinitely as tumor spheres in serum-free medium containing epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor. The injection of 10(4) lung cancer CD133(+) cells in immunocompromised mice readily generated tumor xenografts phenotypically identical to the original tumor. Upon differentiation, lung cancer CD133(+) cells acquired the specific lineage markers, while loosing the tumorigenic potential together with CD133 expression. Thus, lung cancer contains a rare population of CD133(+) cancer stem-like cells able to self-renew and generates an unlimited progeny of non-tumorigenic cells. Molecular and functional characterization of such a tumorigenic population may provide valuable information to be exploited in the clinical setting.","Eramo, A; Lotti, F; Sette, G; Pilozzi, E; Biffoni, M; Di Virgilio, A; Conticello, C; Ruco, L; Peschle, C; De Maria, R",Cell death and differentiation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18049477/,59

189889,Theatre nursing in post-SARS Hong Kong.,2005,"BACKGROUND The COVID pandemic has impacted almost every aspect of human interaction, causing global changes in financial, health care, and social environments for the foreseeable future. More than 1.3 million of the 4 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed globally as of May 2020 have been identified in the United States, testing the capacity and resilience of our hospitals and health care workers. The impacts of the ongoing pandemic, caused by a novel strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have far-reaching implications for the future of our health care system and how we deliver routine care to patients. The adoption of social distancing during this pandemic has demonstrated efficacy in controlling the spread of this virus and has been the only proven means of infection control thus far. Social distancing has prompted hospital closures and the reduction of all non-COVID clinical visits, causing widespread financial despair to many outpatient centers. However, the need to treat patients for non-COVID problems remains important despite this pandemic, as care must continue to be delivered to patients despite their ability or desire to report to outpatient centers for their general care. Our national health care system has realized this need and has incentivized providers to adopt distance-based care in the form of telemedicine and video medicine visits. Many institutions have since incorporated these into their practices without financial penalty because of Medicare's 1135 waiver, which currently reimburses telemedicine at the same rate as evaluation and management codes (E/M Codes). Although the financial burden has been alleviated by this policy, the practitioner remains accountable for providing proper assessment with this new modality of health care delivery. This is a challenge for most physicians, so our team of national experts has created a reference guide for musculoskeletal and neurologic examination selection to retrofit into the telemedicine experience. OBJECTIVES To describe and illustrate musculoskeletal and neurologic examination techniques that can be used effectively in telemedicine. STUDY DESIGN Consensus-based multispecialty guidelines. SETTING Tertiary care center. METHODS Literature review of the neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, lumbar, hip, and knee physical examinations were performed. A multidisciplinary team comprised of physical medicine and rehabilitation, orthopedics, rheumatology, neurology, and anesthesia experts evaluated each examination and provided consensus opinion to select the examinations most appropriate for telemedicine evaluation. The team also provided consensus opinion on how to modify some examinations to incorporate into a nonhealth care office setting. RESULTS Sixty-nine examinations were selected by the consensus team. Household objects were identified that modified standard and validated examinations, which could facilitate the examinations.The consensus review team did not believe that the modified tests altered the validity of the standardized tests. LIMITATIONS Examinations selected are not validated for telemedicine. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were not performed. CONCLUSIONS The physical examination is an essential component for sound clinical judgment and patient care planning. The physical examinations described in this manuscript provide a comprehensive framework for the musculoskeletal and neurologic examination, which has been vetted by a committee of national experts for incorporation into the telemedicine evaluation.","Wahezi, Sayed E; Duarte, Rui V; Yerra, Sandeep; Thomas, Mark A; Pujar, Beendu; Sehgal, Nalini; Argoff, Charles; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Gonzalez, David; Jain, Ruchi; Kim, Chong H; Hossack, Michael; Senthelal, Shayan; Jain, Ankush; Leo, Nathaniel; Shaparin, Naum; Wong, Daniel; Wong, Ashley; Nguyen, Kim; Singh, Jaspal R; Grieco, Giacinto; Patel, Arpan; Kinon, Merritt D; Kaye, Alan D",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942812/,59

However, the development process is not yet well established and there are various limitations depending on the printing materials, the technology and the printer resolution. Patient-specific neuro-vascular anatomy was acquired from computed tomography angiography and rotational digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The volumes were imported into a Vitrea 3D workstation (Vital Images Inc.) and the vascular lumen of various vessels and pathologies were segmented using a ""marching cubes"" algorithm. The results were exported as Stereo Lithographic (STL) files and were further processed by smoothing, trimming, and wall extrusion (to add a custom wall to the model). The models were printed using a Polyjet printer, Eden 260V (Objet-Stratasys). To verify the phantom geometry accuracy, the phantom was reimaged using rotational DSA, and the new data was compared with the initial patient data. The most challenging part of the phantom manufacturing was removal of support material. This aspect could be a serious hurdle in building very tortuous phantoms or small vessels. The accuracy of the printed models was very good: distance analysis showed average differences of 120 μm between the patient and the phantom reconstructed volume dimensions. Most errors were due to residual support material left in the lumen of the phantom. Despite the post-printing challenges experienced during the support cleaning, this technology could be a tremendous benefit to medical research such as in device development and testing.","Ionita, Ciprian N; Mokin, Maxim; Varble, Nicole; Bednarek, Daniel R; Xiang, Jianping; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Meng, Hui; Rudin, Stephen",Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25300886/,59

Rota-, corona- and parvoviruses are of particular interest. These pathogens have a marked predilection for intestinal epithelium. Rotavirus destroys the epithelial cells of the upper parts of the villi. Coronavirus penetrates to the base of the small intestinal villi and the superficial and crypt colonic epithelium is frequently affected. Infection of the small intestinal crypt epithelium is characteristic of parvovirus; loss of epithelium at the villus tip is also observed. Damage of the mucosa results in a reduction in digestive and absorbing capacity. It is not possible to treat these virus strains specifically. Great importance is therefore attached to the vaccination of dams as immune prophylaxis. Consumption of sufficient colostrum and milk from vaccinated dams affords the calves good protection.

The remaining three sg mRNAs, 3 to 5, are colinear with the 3' end of the genome and are made via non-discontinuous RNA synthesis. Their synthesis is supposedly regulated by short conserved sequence motifs, 5'-ACN3-4CUUUAGA-3', within the noncoding intergenic regions that precede the M, HE, and N genes (A. L. van Vliet, S. L. Smits, P. J. Rottier, and R. J. de Groot, EMBO J. 21:6571-6580, 2002). We have now studied the--for nidoviruses unusual--non-discontinuous transcription mechanism in further detail by probing the role of the postulated transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs). To this end, we constructed a synthetic defective interfering (DI) RNA, carrying a 24-nucleotide segment of the intergenic region between the HE and N genes. We demonstrate that this DI RNA, when introduced into BEV-infected cells, directs the synthesis of a sg DI RNA species; in fact, a 16-nucleotide cassette containing the TRS already proved sufficient. Synthesis of this sg DI RNA, like that of mRNAs 3 to 5 of the standard virus, initiated at the 5'-most adenylate of the TRS. An extensive mutational analysis of the TRS is presented. Our results provide first and formal experimental evidence that the conserved motifs within the BEV intergenic sequences indeed drive sg RNA synthesis.","Smits, Saskia L; van Vliet, Arno L W; Segeren, Katja; el Azzouzi, Hamid; van Essen, Maarten; de Groot, Raoul J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15956573/,59

In 2008, the Utah Department of Health added 12 questions to the state's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey to better understand how state residents obtain and use prescription pain medication. Findings from the survey indicated that an estimated 20.8% of Utah adults aged >or=18 years had been prescribed an opioid pain medication during the preceding 12 months. Of those prescribed an opioid pain medication, 3.2% reported using their medication more frequently or in higher doses than had been directed by their doctor; 72.0% reported having leftover medication, and 71.0% of those with leftover medication reported that they had kept the medication. Approximately 1.8% of all adults reported using prescription opioids that had not been prescribed to them. In 2009, the Utah Department of Health published a set of guidelines to reduce morbidity, mortality, and disability associated with misuse or abuse of prescription drugs, especially narcotics. The guidelines include recommendations that providers 1) counsel patients to dispose of unused medication properly once the pain has resolved and 2) prescribe no more than the number of doses needed based on the usual duration of pain severe enough to require opioids for that condition.",,MMWR.

Occurence of acute respiratory illness was ascertained weekly by telephone and calculated as an annual rate. Persons with chronic bronchitis not only experienced more acute lower respiratory illness than healthy comparison subjects, but total illness rates were somewhat higher as well. Infection rates were determined from blood samples taken 3 times from each participant during the surveillance year. Antibody tests were performed for respiratory syncytial virus, para-influenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza types A and B, coronavirus OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Differences in serologic infection rates among the subgroups of the population were similar to those seen in the clinical data, with more frequent infection among those with bronchitis than among the comparison subjects. This finding indicates that some degree of increased susceptibility to actual infection existed among those individuals with bronchitis. Influence of smoking on illness and infection rates was also examined. Infections were, in general, more frequent in smokers than in nonsmokers, but illness rates were reversed, suggesting that perception of disease differed in the 2 groups. Rates of illness and infection of other adults in the families of the index individuals with bronchitis were not influenced by the higher rates seen in the index individuals; however, it was of interest that children of persons with bronchitis did have somewhat higher rates of infection than children of comparison subjects.","Monto, A S; Higgins, M W; Ross, H W",The American review of respiratory disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/163065/,59

192499,Anesthesia Considerations in Laryngeal Surgery.,2017,"Gene 1 of the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) encodes replicase polyproteins that are predicted to be processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps 1 to 16) by two viral proteases, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro). Here, we identify SARS coronavirus amino-terminal replicase products nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 and describe trans-cleavage assays that characterize the protease activity required to generate these products. We generated polyclonal antisera to glutathione S-transferase-replicase fusion proteins and used the antisera to detect replicase intermediates and products in pulse-chase experiments. We found that nsp1 (p20) is rapidly processed from the replicase polyprotein. In contrast, processing at the nsp2/3 site is less efficient, since a approximately 300-kDa intermediate (NSP2-3) is detected, but ultimately nsp2 (p71) and nsp3 (p213) are generated. We found that SARS coronavirus replicase products can be detected by 4 h postinfection in the cytoplasm of infected cells and that nsps 1 to 3 colocalize with newly synthesized viral RNA in punctate, perinuclear sites consistent with their predicted role in viral RNA synthesis. To determine if PLpro is responsible for processing these products, we cloned and expressed the PLpro domain and the predicted substrates and established PLpro trans-cleavage assays. We found that the PLpro domain is sufficient for processing the predicted nsp1/2 and nsp2/3 sites. Interestingly, expression of an extended region of PLpro that includes the downstream hydrophobic domain was required for processing at the predicted nsp3/4 site. We found that the hydrophobic domain is inserted into membranes and that the lumenal domain is glycosylated at asparagine residues 2249 and 2252. Thus, the hydrophobic domain may anchor the replication complex to intracellular membranes. These studies revealed that PLpro can cleave in trans at the three predicted cleavage sites and that it requires membrane association to process the nsp3/4 cleavage site.","Harcourt, Brian H; Jukneliene, Dalia; Kanjanahaluethai, Amornrat; Bechill, John; Severson, Kari M; Smith, Catherine M; Rota, Paul A; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15564471/,59

OBJECTIVES To describe the epidemiological and clinical profile of children < 5 years old consulting for ARTI, comparing cases of HBoV monoinfection and coinfection with other known respiratory viruses. Furthermore, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of viral shedding in asymptomatic children and perform phylogenetic analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS We investigated the presence of HBoV in nasopharyngeal secretions from children consulting for AlRTI and among asymptomatic controls, between 2007 and 2008, by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS HBoV was detected in 79 (21.8%) of 362 nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from children with ARTI. In 60/79 (76%), coinfection with other respiratory viruses was confirmed. Most common symptoms were cough, fever and rhinorrhea. Children infected only with HBoV showed significantly lower frequencies of respiratory distress, oxygen requirements and hospital admission than those with coinfection. HBoV was detected in 6/16 (37.5%) samples from asymptomatic children. The phylogenetic analysis of viruses from Chilean patients revealed that circulating HBoV was closely related to original strains. CONCLUSIONS HBoV was found either in symptomatic and asymptomatic children. The severity of the disease was greater when HBoV was associated to other respiratory viruses.","Flores C, Juan C; Vizcaya A, Cecilia; Araos B, Rafael; Montecinos P, Luisa; Godoy M, Paula; Valiente-Echeverría, Fernando; Perret P, Cecilia; Valenzuela C, Patricia; Hirsch B, Tamara; Ferrés G, Marcela",Revista chilena de infectologia : organo oficial de la Sociedad Chilena de Infectologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22286672/,59

A coordinated sequence of relevant Official Information Act 1982 (OIA) requests was lodged with the New Zealand Ministry of Health (MoH), which is responsible for determining the readiness of district health boards (DHBs) to join the NBSP. However, the MoH OIA process was obfuscating, unduly long and responded only after they anticipated imminent intervention by the Office of the Ombudsman. The amount of information provided was massive, partly irrelevant and presented in an inconvenient format. It revealed that the MoH readiness process was incomplete, and permission for the SDHB to join the NBSP was given prematurely without following due process and despite concerns expressed by some MoH staff. Subsequently, the MoH has failed to admit that they made errors in this case or have any weaknesses in their readiness assessment process. The MoH readiness process failed to determine that the SDHB was not ready to join the NBSP in 2018. Concerns have been expressed in the public media that such failures have occurred with the assessment of other DHBs. The process needs to be overhauled or replaced before further permissions are granted to DHBs. Requests for information under the OIA from the MoH, and similar public entities and agencies subject to the OIA, are too easily deferred, derailed or declined.

Hematological changes in patients with SARS were common, including notably lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. While the former is the result of decreases in CD4+ or CD8+ T-lymphocytes related to the onset of disease or use of glucocorticoids, the latter may involve a number of potential mechanisms. Although the development of autoimmune antibodies or immune complexes triggered by viral infection may play a significant role in inducing thrombocytopenia, SARS-CoV may also directly infect hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, megakaryocytes and platelets inducing their growth inhibition and apoptosis. Moreover, the increased consumption of platelets and/or the decreased production of platelets in the damaged lungs are a potential alternative mechanism that can contribute to thrombocytopenia in severe critical pulmonary conditions, which has been rarely revealed and will be discussed.","Yang, Mo; Ng, Margaret H L; Li, Chi Kong",Hematology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16019455/,59

Advances in clinical therapies have reduced, but not eliminated, the incidence of coronary artery abnormalities in affected children. Pathophysiology seems to include an intense elaboration of cytokines, endothelin, and other vasoactive mediators resulting in the development of vascular endothelial changes that may leave a permanent impact on vascular integrity. Treatment with intravenous immune globulin and aspirin remains the primary management strategy and steroid therapy remains contoversial. In severe circumstances, coronary reperfusion strategies are required, and coronary artery surgery in children with KD has been required, albeit infrequently. KD may be a harbinger for early onset coronary artery disease in adults.

A database with liver cancer mortality data for 1971-1973, 1990-1992, and 2004-2005, including geographic locations and climate conditions, was constructed, and the appropriate associations were investigated. It was found that the regions with the highest mortality rates were central Guangxi with Guigang City at the center, and southwest Guangxi centered in Fusui County. Regions with the lowest mortality rates were eastern Guangxi with Pingnan County at the center, and northern Guangxi centered in Sanjiang and Rongshui counties.

METHODS All medical staff of the paediatric ED in a tertiary medical centre completed a written questionnaire near the onset of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Level of concern regarding SARS, and perceptions of effectiveness and use of infection control measures were assessed on a 5 point scale. Statistical analysis was performed using chi2 test and one way analysis of variance with significance at p<0.05. RESULTS Response rate was 97% (116/120). All scores were given out of 5 possible points. Using isolation rooms (mean score 4.6), wearing a mask when examining patients (4.5), and handwashing (4.5) were considered most effective. Staff physicians reported handwashing more than nurses and trainees (4.9 v 4.5 and 4.5, respectively; p<0.05) while other measures were reported equally. Respondents considering SARS a high public health threat reported higher compliance with handwashing (4.8 v 4.4), always wearing a mask (3.9 vs 3.2) and gloves (3.6 v 2.9) in the ED (p<0.05), but not eye protection (3.4 v 3.0), gown use (4.9 v 4.7), or wearing a mask when examining patients (5.0 v 4.8). Staff who considered combined infection control measures effective in protecting patients and healthcare workers did not report increased compliance. CONCLUSIONS Eye protection was perceived as only moderately effective in protecting against the spread of SARS, and reported compliance was relatively poor among ED staff. Concern of SARS as a public health threat rather than perceived effectiveness of infection control measures appears to have a greater impact on compliance.","Parker, M J; Goldman, R D",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16627834/,59

The search for a causal relationship between a vascular event or a vascular cerebral lesion and dementia has led to new classification schemes which no longer consider vascular dementia a homogeneous entity but acknowledge the diversity of the clinical and morphological substrates of this syndrome. Deviation from the term ""multi-infarct dementia"" is only one but many consequencies of these recent developments. Etiologically, vascular dementia may result from cerebral small vessel disease leading to extensive leucencephalopathy or lacunes or may be the consequence of strategically located infarcts or multiple infarcts in large vessel territories. It may also be the consequence of global cerebral hypoperfusion, intracerebral hemorrhage or other mechanisms such as vasculitis. There is no definitive medical or surgical treatment for vascular dementia. Thus, it appears that stroke prevention offers the most immediate and substantial solution to reduce the morbidity and mortality. This is best substantiated for treatment of arterial hypertension. Once vascular dementia occurs control of vascular risk factors may be useful but this contention will require larger scale studies to provide more definite proof. A number of metabolically active drugs has been used for the treatment of cognitive symptoms in vascular dementia. Yet, the data are conflicting und the effects described modest at most. There is epidemiological evidence for a more than incidental co-existence between vascular and primary degenerative dementia which suggests that therapies found to be effective in Alzheimer's disease may also prove beneficial at least in subgroups of vascular dementia. Lately, this concept is tested by several studies on the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in vascular dementia.","Schmidt, R",Wiener medizinische Wochenschrift,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11925778/,59

However, a role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) as mediators of virus-induced lung damage is supported by studies and antioxidants can thus be expected to act at many different levels. The aim of the present pilot study was to test an antioxidant nutraceutical approach on some relevant immunological parameters known to be affected in common seasonal respiratory tract infection. The study population consisted of 90 sedentary healthy patients, previously selected as being GSTM1-positive, divided into three groups: A) 20-40 years; B) 41-65 years; B) over 65 years. Each patients was administered a life style and dietary questionnaire. Subjects were supplemented for 6 weeks with either 9g/day (4.5g twice a day sublingually) of a fermented papaya preparation (Osato Research Institute, Gifu, Japan) or placebo. After a further month period of wash out, subjects were treated again in a crossover manner. Parameters checked were as follows: routine blood tests with WBC formula, saliva flow rate and secretary IgA and lysozyme production and redox gene expression of Phase II enzyme and SOD from upper airways cells (from nasal lavage). Salivary secretion rate showed an age-related decline and was significantly increased by FPP supplementation only in the youngest age-group (p less than 0.05). Subjects treated with FPP showed a significantly higher lever of IgA and lisozyme production., irrespective of age group while their baseline production was significantly lower in the oldest age-group as compared to the youngest one (C vs A, p less than 0.05). FPP treatment brought about a significant upregulation of all phase II enzyme and SOD gene expression tested in nasal lavage cells. In conclusion, FPP supplementation during 1 month resulted in higher salivary IgA and increase in phase II and SOD enzyme expression, i.e the most important antioxidant in the respiratory tract. The biological significance of these effects i.e., whether it will help reducing the whole respiratory oxidative stress in the human airway and, hopefully, the incidence and/or severity of URTI remains to be demonstrated in longer clinical trials.","Marotta, F; Naito, Y; Jain, S; Lorenzetti, A; Soresi, V; Kumari, A; Carrera Bastos, P; Tomella, C; Yadav, H",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22824755/,59

We have observed that mature oligodendrocytes isolated from adult animals remain as round cells that lack processes for the first 3-4 days in culture. At the end of this lag period, however, the majority of the adult oligodendrocytes show a remarkable recovery, rapidly growing complex and extensive cell processes. Interestingly, the end of this lag period is accompanied by a dramatic upregulation in the expression of thyroid hormone (T(3)) receptor (TR). The functional importance of this increase in TR levels is supported by the observation that the majority of the cells cultured in the presence of T(3) show significantly more extensive and complex process outgrowth than the control cells in cultures lacking this hormone. In addition, this reactivation of the adult cells was also preceded by an increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB), two transcription factors that together with TR appear to play important roles in the control of neonatal oligodendrocyte development. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that upregulation of these proteins may be part of the metabolic changes that occur during the lag period required for recovery of the adult oligodendrocytes. These observations raise the question of whether these transcription factors may play any significant role during remyelination after demyelinating lesions of adult CNS.","Afshari, Fatemah S; Chu, Annie K; Sato-Bigbee, Carmen",Journal of neuroscience research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11782961/,59

The clinical data for these patients were correlated to identify risk factors that might increase the likelihood of the development of CT abnormalities. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The study involved an extended 12-month thin-section CT follow-up of 16 of 47 pediatrics patients with SARS coronavirus-associated pneumonia proven serologically (21 girls and 26 boys; age range, 1.5-17 years; median age, 13.6 years). Patients' clinical information, the extent of radiographic opacification during the acute phase of illness, and conventional pulmonary function test results on follow-up were obtained for correlation. The clinical parameters were compared with other pediatric SARS patients who had normal CT findings at the 6-month follow-up. RESULTS Fifteen patients still had abnormal CT findings 12 months after diagnosis, all of whom were older than 10 years (age range, 10-17 years). In seven patients with previous residual ground-glass opacification at the 6-month follow-up, two showed persistent changes and three had a reticular pattern in the area of the previously detected abnormality, whereas two showed complete resolution. The extent of air trapping remained similar to that at the 6-month follow-up in nine of 11 patients while two showed a slight increase in the same segments. Parenchymal scars remained unchanged from the 6- to 12-month follow-up in all six patients with that finding. None of our patients showed any evidence of bronchiectasis or bronchial wall thickening. Lymphopenia (p = 0.03), extent of radiographic opacification at acute illness (p = 0.047), and duration of use of ribavirin (p = 0.03) were significant risk factors in predicting whether abnormal CT features persisted 12 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION We found that 32% of the children (15/47) affected with SARS showed thin-section CT abnormalities up to 12 months after diagnosis despite clinical remission and unremarkable pulmonary function assessment. Persistent CT abnormalities are more likely to develop in patients who are older and who present with more severe disease. The CT changes in children with SARS are, however, minor.","Chu, Winnie C W; Li, Albert M; Ng, Alex W H; So, Hung-kwan; Lam, Wynnie W M; Lo, Kitty L; Yeung, Man-chiu Au; Yau, Yat-sun; Chiu, Wa-keung; Leung, Chi-wai; Ng, Pak-cheung; Hon, Kam-lun; Mo, Kit-wah; Fok, Tai-fai; Ahuja, Anil T",AJR.

Fear of infection, exposure to updated data on death figures, social isolation, adaptation to new restricting rules, existential crisis, reduction of health care availability poses dangers for mental health. Currently published papers focus on the acute effect of first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, however, further studies on long-term consequences can make this picture more complex and sophisticated. In this review a summary is provided on the most important results concerning frequency of psychiatric symptoms during the first lockdown of COVID-19. In light of the results it can be stated that psychiatric patients showed more common and more intensive symptoms, the number of relapses is increased and the adherence is reduced. Notably, more than the half of the general population produced measurable psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, a worrying portion of frontline healthcare workers started manifesting mental symptoms. The overall picture suggests that the mental health state shows a global decline on the level of the general society which highlights the urgent need for targeted and complex mental support programs.","Lazary, Judit",Neuropsychopharmacologia Hungarica : a Magyar Pszichofarmakologiai Egyesulet lapja = official journal of the Hungarian Association of Psychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257595/,59

Another important concern is related to the known hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 positive patients and associated organ dysfunction that may alter the metabolism of anticoagulants. The safety of the providers performing the EBP, the position of the patient and choices for image guidance (blind, fluoroscopic) are also key considerations to review. It is also important to explore the current state of knowledge about using allogenic instead of autologous blood as well as emerging techniques to eliminate the coronavirus from the blood. OBJECTIVES In this article we pose the questions of how to manage PDPH in the COVID-19 positive patient and more specifically, the use of epidural blood patch (EBP). METHODS Literature review. RESULTS EBP is usually considered after the failure of conservative and pharmacological treatments. Because of the additional risks of EBP in COVID-19 patients it is important to also consider less traditional pharmacological treatments such as theophylinnes and cosyntropin that may offer some additional benefit for COVID-19 patient. Finally, other interventions other than EBP should also be considered including occipital nerve blocks, sphenopalatine ganglion blocks (infratemporal or transnasal). LIMITATIONS A narrative review with paucity of literature. CONCLUSION Going forward, an effective treatment for COVID-19 or a safe vaccine and a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of the virus will certainly change the risk calculus involved in performing an EBP in a COVID-19 patient.","Scemama, Pascal; Farah, Fadi; Mann, Glen; Margulis, Roman; Gritsenko, Karina; Shaparin, Naum",Pain physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942790/,59

Cardiovascular molecular imaging can be used for the detection of rupture-prone plaques. Imaging with radiolabeled bevacizumab, a monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, can depict VEGF levels corresponding to the angiogenic status in tumors. We determined the feasibility of 89Zr-bevacizumab imaging for the detection of VEGF in carotid endarterectomy (CEA) specimens. Five CEA specimens were coincubated with 89Zr-bevacizumab and aspecific 111In-labeled IgG to determine the specificity of bevacizumab accumulation. In 11 CEA specimens, 89Zr-bevacizumab micro-positron emission tomography (PET) was performed following 2 hours of incubation. Specimens were cut in 4 mm wide segments and were stained for VEGF and CD68. In each segment, the mean percent incubation dose per gram of tissue (%Inc/g) and tissue to background ratio were determined. A 10-fold higher accumulation of 89Zr-bevacizumab compared to 111In-IgG uptake was demonstrated by gamma counting. The mean %Inc/ghot spot was 2.2 ± 0.9 with a hot spot to background ratio of 3.6 ± 0.8. There was a significant correlation between the segmental tissue to background uptake ratio and the VEGF score (ρ = .74, p < .001). It is feasible to detect VEGF tissue concentration within CEA specimens using 89Zr-bevacizumab PET. 89Zr-bevacizumab accumulation in plaques is specific and correlates with immunohistochemistry scores.","Golestani, Reza; Zeebregts, Clark J; Terwisscha van Scheltinga, Anton G T; Lub-de Hooge, Marjolijn N; van Dam, Gooitzen M; Glaudemans, Andor W J M; Dierckx, Rudi A J O; Tio, René A; Suurmeijer, Albert J H; Boersma, Hendrikus H; Nagengast, Wouter B; Slart, Riemer H J A",Molecular imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651501/,59

Yet there are few validated interventions specifically designed to address executive functions, and, to our knowledge, none validated in a healthy aging sample. As part of a large-scale cognitive rehabilitation randomized trial in 49 healthy older adults, a modified Goal Management Training program was included to address the real-life deficits caused by executive dysfunction. This program emphasized periodic suspension of ongoing activity to establish goal hierarchies and monitor behavioral output. Tabletop simulated real-life tasks (SRLTs) were developed to measure the processes targeted by this intervention. Participants were randomized to two groups, one of which received the intervention immediately and the other of which was wait-listed prior to rehabilitation. Results indicated improvements in SRLT performance and self-rated executive deficits coinciding with the training in both groups. These gains were maintained at long-term follow-up.

We hypothesized that ACE2 polymorphisms could confer a high risk of hypertension and have an impact on the antihypertensive response to ACE inhibitors. The hypothesis was tested in two casecontrol studies and a clinical trial of 3,408 untreated hypertensive patients randomized to Atenolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, Captopril, or Nifedipine treatments for 4 weeks. ACE2 rs2106809 T allele was found to confer a 1.6-fold risk for hypertension in women (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.132.06), whereas when combined with the effect of the ACE DD genotype, the risk was 2.34-fold (95% CI, 1.754.85) in two independent samples. The adjusted diastolic blood pressure response to Captopril was 3.3 mm Hg lower in ACE2 T allele carriers than in CC genotype carriers (P=0.019) in women.

They were asked about their perceived health threats, efficacy beliefs, and the practice of SARS preventive behaviors. RESULTS Only 40.7% of the elderly participants practiced the recommended SARS preventive behaviors. Elderly participants who perceived greater personal vulnerability to the disease, who possessed greater self-efficacy, who had greater confidence in local health authorities, and who had lower educational attainment were more likely to adopt the suggested SARS preventive behaviors. DISCUSSION This study supported the conceptual framework that specified perceived health threats and efficacy beliefs as the two core dimensions of motivating factors in adopting SARS preventive behaviors.","Tang, Catherine So-Kum; Wong, Chi-Yan",Journal of aging and health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16020576/,59

203856,"Precision Nutrition-the Answer to ""What to Eat to Stay Healthy""",2020,"The efficiency of RNA interference (RNAi) varies substantially among different insect species. Rapid degradation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by dsRNA-degrading nucleases (dsRNases) has been implicated to cause low RNAi efficiency in several insect species. In this study, we identified four dsRNase genes (OfdsRNase1, OfdsRNase2, OfdsRNase3 and OfdsRNase4) from the Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) transcriptome database. Bioinformatic analyses showed that each deduced protein sequence contained endonuclease NS domains and signal peptides. Gene expression analysis revealed that OfdsRNase2 was exclusively expressed in the midgut of larvae. RNAi efficiency was investigated in 2-d-old fifth-instar larvae (high expression of dsRNase2) and 2-d-old pupae (low expression of dsRNase2) by feeding or injecting dsRNA targeting a marker gene that encodes the lethal giant larvae protein (OfLgl). Our results showed that OfLgl only partially silenced the expression of OfLgl in pupae, but not in larvae, suggesting that OfdsRNase2 could contribute to lower RNAi efficiency in larval stages. This hypothesis was supported by our RNAi-of-RNAi experiment using a tissue culture technique where the silencing efficiency against the reporter gene, OfHex1, was significantly improved after knockdown of OfdsRNase2. When double luciferase assays were performed to evaluate the role of the four dsRNases in vitro, only OfdsRNase2 expressed in S2 cells significantly affected RNAi efficiency by degrading dsRNA. Taken together, our results suggested that the degradation of dsRNA by OfdsRNase2 in the midgut contributed to low RNAi efficiency in O. furnacalis larvae.","Fan, Yun-He; Song, Hui-Fang; Abbas, Mureed; Wang, Yan-Li; Li, Tao; Ma, En-Bo; Cooper, Anastasia M W; Silver, Kristopher; Zhu, Kun Yan; Zhang, Jian-Zhen",Insect sci.

Asymptomatic subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 often remain undiagnosed and it is still debated whether they develop immunoglobulins (Ig) and how long they persist. The aim of this study was to investigate the development and persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic subjects infected by the virus. This follow-up study was performed on the 31 asymptomatic subjects who presented a positive nasal swab or serology against SARS-CoV-2 (Ig against Spike-RBD) in the first part of the UNICORN study (March 2020) aimed at attesting previous or current contacts with the virus in the personnel of the University of Milan. Eight weeks after the first Ig measure, these subjects were invited to donate a second blood sample for testing serum antibodies (IgM, IgG and total antibodies) and to fill-in a structured questionnaire. About 80% of asymptomatic subjects did not present circulating immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks from a positive nasal swab against the virus. Moreover, in more than 40% of these subjects, no Ig against SARS-CoV-2 were detected at any time. Finally, about two third of subjects with immunoglobulins at baseline did not present IgG against SARS-CoV-2 after 8 weeks. The majority of subjects who developed an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection do not present antibodies against the RBD-spike protein after 8 weeks of follow-up. These data should be taken into account for the interpretation of the serological evidences on SARS-CoV-2 that are emerging nowadays.","Milani, Gregorio Paolo; Dioni, Laura; Favero, Chiara; Cantone, Laura; Macchi, Chiara; Delbue, Serena; Bonzini, Matteo; Montomoli, Emanuele; Bollati, Valentina",Sci Rep,,59
204355,Automatic Denoising of Single-Trial Event-Related Potentials : A MATLAB Application,2021,"Suicide is a major public health concern. In 2015, it was the 10th leading cause of death in the US. The number of suicides increased by 30% in the US from 1999 to 2016, and a greater uptick in suicides is predicted to occur as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, for which the primary public-health strategy is physical distancing and during which alcohol sales have soared. Thus, current strategies for identifying at-risk individuals and preventing suicides, such as relying on self-reported suicidal ideation, are insufficient, especially under conditions of physical distancing, which exacerbate isolation, loneliness, economic stress, and possibly alcohol consumption. New strategies are urgent now and into the future. To that aim, here, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (an instrumental variables technique using public genome-wide association study data as data sources) was performed to determine whether alcohol-associated changes in DNA methylation mediate risk for suicidal behavior. The results suggest that higher alcohol-associated DNA methylation levels at cg18120259 confer a weak causal effect. Replication and triangulation of the results, both experimentally and with designs other than Mendelian randomization, are needed. If the findings replicate, the information might be utilized to raise awareness about the biological links between alcohol and suicide and possibly explored as a biomarker of risk, perhaps especially for early detection of those who may not self-report suicidal intent.

204837,Multi-omics data integration and network-based analysis drives a multiplex drug repurposing approach to a shortlist of candidate drugs against COVID-19,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus like many other viruses has transformed in a continual manner to give rise to new variants by means of mutations commonly through substitutions and indels. These mutations in some cases can give the virus a survival advantage making the mutants dangerous. In general, laboratory investigation must be carried to determine whether the new variants have any characteristics that can make them more lethal and contagious. Therefore, complex and time-consuming analyses are required in order to delve deeper into the exact impact of a particular mutation. The time required for these analyses makes it difficult to understand the variants of concern and thereby limiting the preventive action that can be taken against them spreading rapidly. In this analysis, we have deployed a statistical technique Shannon Entropy, to identify positions in the spike protein of SARS Cov-2 viral sequence which are most susceptible to mutations. Subsequently, we also use machine learning based clustering techniques to cluster known dangerous mutations based on similarities in properties. This work utilizes embeddings generated using language modeling, the ProtBERT model, to identify mutations of a similar nature and to pick out regions of interest based on proneness to change. Our entropy-based analysis successfully predicted the fifteen hotspot regions, among which we were able to validate ten known variants of interest. As the situation of SARS-COV-2 virus rapidly evolves we believe that the remaining nine mutational hotspots may contain variants that can emerge in the future. We believe that this may be promising in helping the research community to devise therapeutics based on probable new mutation zones in the viral sequence and resemblance in properties of various mutations","Mullick, Baishali Magar Rishikesh Jhunjhunwala Aastha Farimani Amir Barati",Computers in biology and medicine,,59

This study aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative potential of Andean Berry Juice (ABJ) in combination with Aspirin in human SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells. ABJ primarily contained 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic and chlorogenic acids. The combined treatment of ABJ (IC50 : 30.0 ± 0.11%) and Aspirin (IC50 : 20.0 ± 0.57) exhibited a higher (p < .01) antiproliferative effect than each counterpart. Moreover the same mixture displayed a lower reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) than the untreated cells. ABJ-Aspirin combination induced late apoptosis stage without stimulating mitochondrial depolarization and prompted phosphatidylserine relocalization. These results emphasize the antiproliferative potential of bioactive compounds from ABJ and Aspirin combinations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Natural products such as Andean Berry (V. meridionale Sw.) juice (ABJ) contains antioxidant polyphenols that could reduce the need to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, currently employed in cancer treatment, to prevent its side effects. The high abundance of polyphenols from this underutilized berry could stimulate the standardization of its production and industrial exploitation to be transformed into suitable food products delivering natural bioactive compounds with potential anti-cancer effects in vitro.","Arango-Varela, Sandra S; Luzardo-Ocampo, Ivan; Reyes-Dieck, Camilo; Yahia, Elhadi M; Maldonado-Celis, Maria E",J Food Biochem,,59

206078,Commentary from the Editor,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US, highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent future outbreaks. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five homeless shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing, and universal mask wearing. RESULTS: The proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed outbreaks ranged from 2.6 to 51.6%, which translated to the basic reproduction number (R0) estimates of 2.9-6.2. With moderate community incidence (~ 30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day), the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0 = 1.5), moderate-risk (R0 = 2.9), and high-risk (R0 = 6.2) shelter were respectively 0.35, 0.13, and 0.04 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.53, 0.20, and 0.09 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.62, 0.27, and 0.08 for universal masking; and 0.74, 0.42, and 0.19 for these strategies in combination. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom screening, frequent PCR testing, and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce outbreak risk.","Chapman, Lloyd A C; Kushel, Margot; Cox, Sarah N; Scarborough, Ashley; Cawley, Caroline; Nguyen, Trang Q; Rodriguez-Barraquer, Isabel; Greenhouse, Bryan; Imbert, Elizabeth; Lo, Nathan C",BMC Med,,59

209829,Phenolic-Enriched Collagen Fibrillar Coatings on Titanium Alloy to Promote Osteogenic Differentiation and Reduce Inflammation,2020,"Introduction: Long term sequelae of SARS-CoV2 infections are currently being investigated. Previously described long term sequelae include cerebral vascular accidents, liver and kidney disease, and psychological disease, albeit without a consistent pattern of presentation. Recently, several cases have been published regarding multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children following known SARS-CoV2 infection. There has been one reported case of post-infectious Kawasaki-like illness in an adult. We present a patient with a similar multisystem inflammatory reaction, giving support for a Kawasaki-like disease in adults post-SARS-CoV2. Case description: A 27-year-old male with history of mild SARS-CoV2 infection one month prior without respiratory distress presented with fevers, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache. Physical exam revealed injected bilateral conjunctiva, cheilitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, nuchal rigidity, a morbilliform rash on chest and hands, bilateral hand edema, and suprapubic tenderness. An abdominal CT scan suggested pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Hepatocellular and cholestatic markers were elevated without serological evidence of viral hepatitis. ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH, d-dimer, and IL-6 were all elevated. SARS-CoV2 PCR was negative but IgG was positive. Blood, urine, and lumbar puncture studies were negative for bacterial, fungal, viral, and tick-borne evidence of infection. Rheumatologic workup was unremarkable. He developed hypotension requiring vasopressor support. ECG was notable for new-onset atrial fibrillation and echocardiogram showed systolic dysfunction with global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 45-50%. Cardiac MRI did not show evidence of myocarditis or infiltrative disease. Morning cortisol was low consistent with adrenal insufficiency and started on hydrocortisone. All his symptoms began to resolve with steroid therapy. One month after discharge, he was found to be in normal sinus rhythm. He experienced full resolution of his symptoms other than visual field disturbances with occasional floaters deemed to be of unknown etiology following complete neurologic and ophthalmologic workup. Repeat echocardiogram continued to show global systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40-45%. The patient continued on goal directed medical therapy and hydrocortisone therapy. Discussion: Post inflammatory conditions secondary to SARS-CoV2 have not been well described in adults. We present a patient whose post SARS-CoV2 inflammatory syndrome mimics the known pediatric post-inflammatory state, including characteristic timing, exam and laboratory findings, and resolution with steroid therapy. Further description of similar presentations is needed to better gauge the incidence of this inflammatory syndrome in young adults.","Willard, P.; Montalvo, M.; Kapoor, K.; Grinnan, D.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,59

However, one of the issues is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of PDLSCs for clinical application because very few PDLSCs can be isolated from PDL tissue of donors. Therefore, we aimed to identify a specific factor that converts human PDL cells into stem-like cells. In this study, microarray analysis comparing the gene profiles of human PDLSC lines (2-14 and 2-23) with those of a cell line with a low differentiation potential (2-52) identified the imprinted gene mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST). MEST was expressed in the cytoplasm of 2-23 cells. Knockdown of MEST by siRNA in 2-23 cells inhibited the expression of stem cell markers, such as CD105, CD146, p75NTR, N-cadherin, and NANOG; the proliferative potential; and multidifferentiation capacity for osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. On the other hand, overexpression of MEST in 2-52 cells enhanced the expression of stem cell markers and PDL-related markers and the multidifferentiation capacity. In addition, MEST-overexpressing 2-52 cells exhibited a change in morphology from a spindle shape to a stem cell-like round shape that was similar to 2-14 and 2-23 cell morphologies. These results suggest that MEST plays a critical role in the maintenance of stemness in PDLSCs and converts PDL cells into PDLSC-like cells. Therefore, this study indicates that MEST may be a therapeutic factor for periodontal tissue regeneration by inducing PDLSCs.","Hasegawa, Daigaku; Hasegawa, Kana; Kaneko, Hiroshi; Yoshida, Shinichiro; Mitarai, Hiromi; Arima, Mai; Tomokiyo, Atsushi; Hamano, Sayuri; Sugii, Hideki; Wada, Naohisa; Kiyoshima, Tamotsu; Maeda, Hidefumi",Stem Cells Int,,59

211823,Highlights from the literature,2021,"This study was carried out to find out the burnout levels of judo coaches in COVID-19 period and to show how they will approach their profession and athletes in the period after the pandemic. 136 judo coaches from different coaching levels participated in the study. Maslach Burnout Inventory was used in the study. In addition, 3 qualitative questions were prepared by the researchers to find out the emotions of coaches during and after the pandemic and how they approached their athletes. IBM SPSS 22 statistical program was used to analyze the data in the study. Since the data were not normally distributed, non-parametric Mann Whitney U was used in paired group comparisons, while Kruskal Wallis H test was used for the comparison of more than two groups and significance level was taken as p < 0.05. Content analysis method was used to analyze the 3 qualitative questions. As a result, burnout levels of the judo coaches in the study were found to be low. No significant difference was found between the variables of gender, age and coaching level and burnout level. In addition, while coaches stated that they missed their profession and were waiting excitedly for trainings to start, more than half of them stated that their approaches to athletes will change after the pandemic.","Aktas, Özgür Karakoç Berna Karakoç Önder",Journal of Educational Issues,,59
211883,Year 2020 in review – Anaesthesiology in obstetrics,2020,"The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic causes a large number of patients to simultaneously be in need of specialized care. In the Netherlands, hospitals scaled up their ICU and clinical admission capacity at an early stage of the pandemic. The importance of coordinating resources during a pandemic has already been emphasized in the literature. Therefore, in order to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 admissions, national and regional task forces were established for the purpose of coordinating patient transfers. This review describes the experience of ROAZ region Noord-Holland Flevoland, in coordinating patient transfers in the Amsterdam region. In total, 130 patient transfers were coordinated by our region, of which 73% patients were transferred to a hospital within the region. Over a two-month period, similarities regarding days with increased patient transfers were seen between our region and the national task force. In parallel, an increased incidence in hospital admissions in the Netherlands was observed. During a pandemic, an early upscale (an increase in surge spaces) of hospital admission capacity is imperative. Furthermore, it is preferred to establish national and regional task forces, coordinated by physicians experienced and trained in handling crisis situations, adhering full transparency regarding hospital admission capacity.","Berkeveld, E; Mikdad, S; Zandbergen, H R; Kraal, A; Terra, M; Kramer, M H H; Bloemers, F W",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,59

212789,Preparing for the next pandemic: It is more than just about numbers,2021,"Research on traumatic events often emphasizes the importance of posttraumatic growth (PTG) and resilience, yet few studies have explored their trends and their relationship throughout the progression of traumatic events. This paper explores the longitudinal relationship between resilience and PTG, as well as the role of job burnout in this relationship, among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, who have been exposed to high-risk work environments over extraordinarily long workdays. In Study 1, 134 Chinese frontline healthcare workers completed a three-wave survey (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3) in February-May 2020. In Study 2, 401 frontline healthcare workers completed a cross-sectional survey. The cross-lagged analysis suggested that resilience at Time 1 positively predicted PTG at Time 2, which in turn positively predicted resilience at Time 3. PTG at Time 1 also positively predicted resilience at Time 2 (Study 1). However, job burnout was negatively related to both resilience and PTG; in particular, emotional exhaustion moderated the link between PTG and resilience (Study 2). Our findings support a cycle of reinforcement between resilience and PTG over time. The positive effect of PTG on resilience, however, is undermined by emotional exhaustion. Implications for future intervention research and workplace support are discussed.","Lyu, Yizhi; Yu, Yongju; Chen, Shuquan; Lu, Shuang; Ni, Shiguang",Applied psychology.

212819,Increasing handwashing in young children: A brief review,2020,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of computed tomography (CT)-based residual lung volume (RLV) on mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study of a prospectively maintained database was performed. In total, 138 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Baseline chest CT scan was performed in all patients. CT-based automated and semi-automated lung segmentation was performed using the Alma Medical workstation to calculate normal lung volume, lung opacities volume, total lung volume, and RLV. The primary end point of the study was mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 84 men (61%) and 54 women (39%) with a mean age of 47.3 years (±14.3 y) were included in the study. Overall mortality rate was 21% (29 patients) at a median time of 7 days (interquartile range, 4 to 11 d). Univariate analysis demonstrated that age, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with death (P<0.01). Similarly, patients who died had lower normal lung volume and RLV than patients who survived (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that low RLV was the only independent predictor of death (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 10.2-10.65). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that a RLV &#8804;64% significantly increased the risk of death (odds ratio, 4.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-11.7). CONCLUSION: Overall mortality of patients with COVID-19 may reach 21%. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that reduced RLV was the principal independent predictor of death. Furthermore, RLV &#8804;64% is associated with a 4-fold increase on the risk of death.","Timaran-Montenegro, David Ernesto; Torres-Ramírez, Christian Alexander; Morales-Jaramillo, Leonardo Mauricio; Mateo-Camacho, Yohana Sarahi; Tapia-Rangel, Edgar Alonso; Fuentes-Badillo, Karla Daniela; Hernández-Rojas, Ana Milena; Morales-Domínguez, Valeria; Saenz-Castillo, Pedro Fernando; Parra-Guerrero, Lina Marcela; Jacome-Portilla, Katherine Isamara; Obrando-Bravo, Daniel Ernesto; Contla-Trejo, Giovanni Saul; Falla-Trujillo, Manuel Gerardo; Punzo-Alcaraz, Gerardo Rafael; Feria-Arroyo, Gustavo Adolfo; Chávez-Sastre, Alberto Joshua; Govea-Palma, Jovani; Carrillo-Álvarez, Santiago; Orozco-Vázquez, Julita Del Socorro",J Thorac Imaging,,59

In particular, health workers have been forced to change their activities both for the different needs of patients and for preventive measures against the spread of the virus. This study is aimed at comparing the urgent psychiatric consultations (UPC) performed at the outpatient Mental Health Center (MHC) of Modena during the coronavirus outbreak period, from 1 March to 31 August 2020, with the same period in 2019. We retrospectively collected in a database the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who required UPC in the MHC during the 6-month observation periods in both 2019 and 2020. Data were statistically analyzed. We analyzed 656 urgent psychiatric consultations in 2019 and 811 in 2020, requested by 425 patients in 2019 and 488 in 2020, respectively. In the pandemic period, we observed an increase in the total and daily number of UPC which were more frequently required by patients in care at local outpatient services in comparison with the previous period. During 2020, an increased number of UPC was carried out remotely and the outcome was more frequently represented by discharge at home, avoiding hospitalization as much as possible. In the course of the coronavirus pandemic, MHC had to face an increased demand for clinical activity especially from the most clinically and socially vulnerable patients, who more frequently required UPC in outpatient psychiatric services.","Di Lorenzo, Rosaria; Fiore, Gianluca; Bruno, Alessandra; Pinelli, Margherita; Bertani, Davide; Falcone, Patrizia; Marrama, Donatella; Starace, Fabrizio; Ferri, Paola",Psychiatr. q,,59

Наборы материально-технических средств для борьбы с болезнями,2020,"BACKGROUND: The province of British Columbia (BC), Canada is amid dual public health emergencies in which the overdose epidemic declared in 2016 has been exacerbated by restrictions imposed by the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Experiential workers, commonly known as 'peers' (workers with past or present drug use experience) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives and are essential in creating safe spaces for people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction. Working in overdose response environments can be stressful, with lasting emotional and mental health effects. There is limited knowledge about the personal meaning that experiential workers derive from their work, which serve as motivators for them to take on these often-stressful roles. METHODS: This project used a community-based qualitative research design. The research was based at two organizations in BC. Eight experiential worker-led focus groups were conducted (n = 31) where participants spoke about their roles, positive aspects of their jobs, challenges they face, and support needs in harm reduction work. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using interpretative description to uncover the meaning derived from experiential work. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from focus group data that describe the meanings which serve as motivators for experiential workers to continue working in overdose response environments: (1) A sense of purpose from helping others; (2) Being an inspiration for others, and; (3) A sense of belonging. CONCLUSION: Despite the frequent hardships and loss that accompany overdose response work, experiential workers identified important aspects that give their work meaning. These aspects of their work may help to protect workers from the emotional harms associated with stressful work as well as the stigma of substance use. Recognizing the importance of experiential work and its role in the lives of PWUD can help inform and strengthen organizational supports.","Pauly, Bernadette Bernie; Mamdani, Zahra; Mesley, Lacey; McKenzie, Sophie; Cameron, Fred; Edwards, Denice; Howell, Amy; Knott, Michael; Scott, Tracy; Seguin, Ryan; Greer, Alissa M; Buxton, Jane A",Int J Drug Policy,,59

217299,Comparing Speech Recognition for Listeners With Normal and Impaired Hearing: Simulations for Controlling Differences in Speech Levels and Spectral Shape,2020,"BACKGROUND: The first case of COVID-19 detected in Mexico was on the 27th of February 2020. On the 30th of April, 64 days after this first diagnosis, the number of patients had increased exponentially, reaching 19 224 confirmed cases and 1859 (9.67%) deaths. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the current state of our understanding regarding COVID-19 in Mexico. METHODS: We obtained the data from the official website of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The study period was between the 27th of February and the 30th of April 2020. The cases were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and we analysed epidemiological, demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: In Mexico, most cases of COVID-19 were located in Mexico City. The mean age of the patients was 46 years. Of the 12 656 confirmed cases, most infected individuals were between the ages of 30 and 59 years (65.85%), and there was a higher incidence rate in men (58.18%) than in women (41.82%). The patients who died had one or more comorbidities, mainly hypertension (45.53%), diabetes (39.39%) and obesity (30.4%). In the first 64 days of the epidemic, China had reported 80 304 cases with a mortality rate of 3.66%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an early transmission of COVID-19 in Mexico. The descriptive epidemiology shows similarities between the cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and those in China. In the same period of the epidemic curve, we observed a reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico and a higher mortality rate compared with that of China.","Suárez, V; Suarez Quezada, M; Oros Ruiz, S; Ronquillo De Jesús, E",Rev Clin Esp (Barc),,59

219306,"Utilizing drug repurposing against COVID-19 - Efficacy, limitations, and challenges",2020,"BACKGROUND: Besides throat-nose swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR), unenhanced chest computed tomography (CT) is a recommended diagnostic tool for early detection and quantification of pulmonary changes in COVID-19 pneumonia caused by the novel corona virus. Demographic factors, especially age and comorbidities, are major determinants of the outcome in COVID-19 infection. This study examines the extra pulmonary parameter of bone mineral density (BMD) from an initial chest computed tomography as an associated variable of pre-existing comorbidities like chronic lung disease or demographic factors to determine the later patient's outcome, in particular whether treatment on an intensive care unit (ICU) was necessary in infected patients. METHODS: We analyzed 58 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infections that received an unenhanced CT at admission at one of the included centers. In addition to the extent of pulmonary involvement, we performed a phantomless assessment of bone mineral density of thoracic vertebra 9 - 12. RESULTS: In a univariate regression analysis BMD was found to be a significant predictor of the necessity for intensive care unit treatment of COVID-19 patients. In the subgroup requiring intensive care treatment within the follow-up period a significantly lower BMD was found. In a multivariate logistic regression model considering gender, age and CT measurements of bone mineral density, BMD was eliminated from the regression analysis as a significant predictor. CONCLUSION: Phantomless assessed BMD provides prognostic information on the necessity for ICU treatment in course of COVID-19 pneomonia. We recommend using the measurement of BMD in an initial CT image to facilitate a potentially better prediction of severe patient outcomes within the 22 days after an initial CT scan. Consequently, in the present sample, additional bone density analysis did not result in a prognostic advantage over simply considering age. Significantly larger patient cohorts with a more homogenous patient age should be performed in the future to illustrate potential effects. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While clinical capacities such as ICU beds and ventilators are more crucial than ever to help manage the current global corona pandemic, this work introduces an approach that can be used in a cost-effective way to help determine the amount of these rare clinical resources required in the near future.","Kottlors, Jonathan; Große Hokamp, Nils; Fervers, Philipp; Bremm, Johannes; Fichter, Florian; Persigehl, Thorsten; Safarov, Orkhan; Maintz, David; Tritt, Stephanie; Abdullayev, Nuran",Bone,,59

Cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, but baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in particular has not been evaluated thoroughly in this context. We analyzed patients in our state's largest health system who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 20 and May 15, 2020. Inclusion required an available echocardiogram within 1 year prior to diagnosis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. LVEF was analyzed both as a continuous variable and using a cutoff of 40%.

223152,A global association between Covid-19 cases and airborne particulate matter at regional level,2021,"BACKGROUND: Calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel inhibitors stabilize the pulmonary endothelium and block proinflammatory cytokine release, potentially mitigating respiratory complications observed in patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Auxora, a novel, intravenously administered CRAC channel inhibitor, in adults with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, open-label study of Auxora was conducted in adults with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive three doses of once-daily Auxora versus standard of care (SOC) alone. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of Auxora. Following FDA guidance, study enrollment was halted early to allow for transition to a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study. RESULTS: In total, 17 patients with severe and three with critical COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized to Auxora and nine with severe and one with critical COVID-19 pneumonia to SOC. Similar proportions of patients receiving Auxora and SOC experienced &#8805; 1 adverse event (75% versus 80%, respectively). Fewer patients receiving Auxora experienced serious adverse events versus SOC (30% versus 50%, respectively). Two patients (10%) receiving Auxora and two (20%) receiving SOC died during the 30 days after randomization. Among patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the median time to recovery with Auxora was 5 days versus 12 days with SOC; the recovery rate ratio was 1.87 (95% CI, 0.72, 4.89). Invasive mechanical ventilation was needed in 18% of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving Auxora versus 50% receiving SOC (absolute risk reduction = 32%; 95% CI, - 0.07, 0.71). Outcomes measured by an 8-point ordinal scale were significantly improved for patients receiving Auxora, especially for patients with a baseline PaO2/FiO2 = 101-200. CONCLUSIONS: Auxora demonstrated a favorable safety profile in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia and improved outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. These results, however, are limited by the open-label study design and small patient population resulting from the early cessation of enrollment in response to regulatory guidance. The impact of Auxora on respiratory complications in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia will be further assessed in a planned randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study.

METHODS: A single-institution retrospective chart review was conducted of men treated with pelvic external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and SBRT boost (21Gy/19Gy in 2 fractions) to the prostate for prostate cancer. A cohort treated at the same institution with high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost (19Gy in 2 fractions) was compared. Propensity-score (PS) matching and multivariable Cox regression were used for analysis. Outcomes were biochemical-recurrence-freedom (BCRF) and metastasis-freedom (MF). RESULTS: 131 men were treated with SBRT boost and 101 with HDR boost with median follow-up of 73.4 and 186.0 months, respectively. 68.8% of men had high-risk and 26.0% had unfavorable-intermediate disease, and 94.3% received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Five- and 10-year unadjusted BCRF was 88.8%/85.3% for SBRT and 91.8%/74.6% for HDR boost (Log-Rank P=0.3), and 5- and 10-year unadjusted MF was 91.7%/84.3% for SBRT and 95.8%/82.0% for HDR (Log-Rank P=0.8). After adjusting for covariates, there was no statistically significant difference in BCRF (HR 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-1.79, P=0.6) or MF (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.44-2.57, P=0.9) between SBRT and HDR boost. Similarly, after PS matching, there was no statistically significant difference between SBRT and HDR (BCRF: HR 0.66, 0.27-1.62, P=0.4; MF: HR 0.84, 0.31-2.26, P=0.7). Grade 3+ genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity in the SBRT cohort were 4.6% and 1.5%, and 3.0% and 0.0% in the HDR cohorts (P=0.4, Fisher test). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT boost plus pelvic EBRT for prostate cancer resulted in similar BCRF and MF to HDR boost in this single institution, PS matched retrospective analysis. Toxicity was modest. Prospective evaluation of SBRT boost for the treatment of unfavorable-intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer is warranted.","Chen, William C; Li, Yun; Lazar, Ann; Altan, Aysu; Descovich, Martina; Nano, Tomi; Ziemer, Benjamin; Sudhyadhom, Atchar; Cunha, Adam; Thomas, Horatio; Gottschalk, Alexander; Hsu, I-Chow; Roach, Mack",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,59

The abnormal production of type I interferon (IFN-1) and upregulation of multiple cytokines induced strong inflammation and thus lead to shock and organ failure. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, tripartite motif-containing 37 (TRIM37) regulates the ubiquitination of multiple proteins including TRAFs. RNA sequencing was performed to investigated the alteration of transcriptional profile of H1N1-infected patients. qRT-PCR assay was performed to investigate the RNA levels of certain genes. The group of immune cells was examined by the Flow cytometry analysis. H&E staining was applied to evaluate lung inflammation of WT and TRIM37-KO mice. ELISA assay was performed to demonstrate the alteration of multiple cytokines. The protein levels in NF-kB signaling was estimated by western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays were applied to demonstrate the direct interaction between TRIM37 and TRAF-6. The RNA level of TRIM37 decreased in CD11b+ cells of Flu-infected patients. Knockout of TRIM37 inhibited the immune responses of H1N1-infected mice. TRIM37 deficiency reduced the levels of virous proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). Mechanically, TRIM37 promoted the K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6. TRIM37 negatively regulated inflammatory responses induced by virus infection via promoting TRAF6 ubiquitination at K63.","Zhao, Lifen; Hao, Yanyan; Song, Zhuohui; Fan, Yimin; Li, Shufen",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,59

229521,Memento Mori,2020,"With the wide spread of COVID-19 and the corresponding negative impact on different life aspects, it becomes important to understand ways to deal with the pandemic as a part of daily routine. After a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become obvious that different factors, including meteorological factors, influence the speed at which the disease is spread and the potential fatalities. However, the impact of each factor on the speed at which COVID-19 is spreading remains controversial. Accurate forecasting of potential positive cases may lead to better management of healthcare resources and provide guidelines for government policies in terms of the action required within an effective timeframe. Recently, Google Cloud has provided online COVID-19 forecasting data for the United States and Japan, which would help in predicting future situations on a state/prefecture scale and are updated on a day-by-day basis. In this study, we propose a deep learning architecture to predict the spread of COVID-19 considering various factors, such as meteorological data and public mobility estimates, and applied it to data collected in Japan to demonstrate its effectiveness. The proposed model was constructed using a neural network architecture based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The model consists of multi-path LSTM layers that are trained using time-series meteorological data and public mobility data obtained from open-source data. The model was tested using different time frames, and the results were compared to Google Cloud forecasts. Public mobility is a dominant factor in estimating new positive cases, whereas meteorological data improve their accuracy. The average relative error of the proposed model ranged from 16.1% to 22.6% in major regions, which is a significant improvement compared with Google Cloud forecasting. This model can be used to provide public awareness regarding the morbidity risk of the COVID-19 pandemic in a feasible manner.","Rashed, Essam A; Hirata, Akimasa",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,59

We developed a suitable search query to retrieve the relevant literature covered by the Web of Science (WoS) as complete as possible and to exclude irrelevant literature (n = 8,011 papers). The time-evolution of the publications shows that research dealing with heat waves is a highly dynamic research topic, doubling within about 5 years. An analysis of the thematic content reveals the most severe heat wave events within the recent decades (1995 and 2003), the cities and countries/regions affected (United States, Europe, and Australia), and the ecological and medical impacts (drought, urban heat islands, excess hospital admissions, and mortality). Risk estimation and future strategies for adaptation to hot weather are major political issues.

The two main aims of this study were (1) to examine changes in food waste behaviors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and Italy; and (2) to investigate potential predictors of food waste behavior, including avoidance of supermarkets, increased home cooking, and increased role of health concerns in food choices. A sample of n = 478 (79% female) individuals from the U.S., mean (SD) age = 30.51 (10.85), and n = 476 individuals from Italy, (78% female), mean (SD) age = 33.84 (12.86), completed an online survey between April 8th and April 28th 2020. Just under half of respondents (49%) reported decreased food waste since the start of the pandemic. Rates were significantly higher among the U.S. sample (61.5%, n = 294) compared to the Italian sample (38%, n = 180). Controlling for the time since restrictions were introduced, age, gender, and perceived financial security, logistic regression revealed greater reduction in food waste since the beginning of the pandemic for U.S. individuals relative to participants from Italy (OR = 0.47, p < .001). In addition, increased importance of health concerns when making food choices (OR = 1.34, p < .005) as well as more frequent cooking (OR = 1.35, p < .001), and greater avoidance of supermarkets (OR = 1.15, p = .049) were associated with greater probability of less food waste. Scarcity and greater reliance on cooking may encourage individuals to reflect on food waste practices. Further research should explore how these factors may be targeted to reduce food waste beyond the pandemic.","Rodgers, Rachel F; Lombardo, Caterina; Cerolini, Silvia; Franko, Debra L; Omori, Mika; Linardon, Jake; Guillaume, Sebastien; Fischer, Laura; Tyszkiewicz, Matthew Fuller-",Appetite,,59

233271,"Comment on ""Minimally Invasive Surgery and the Novel Coronavirus Outbreak: Lessons Learned in China and Italy""",2020,"Following successful non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) aiming to control COVID-19, many jurisdictions reopened their economies and borders. As little immunity had developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact carried substantial risks, and therefore many locations began to see resurgence in COVID-19 cases. We present a Bayesian method to estimate the leeway to reopen, or alternatively the strength of change required to re-establish COVID-19 control, in a range of jurisdictions experiencing different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimated the timing and strength of initial control measures such as widespread distancing and compared the leeway jurisdictions had to reopen immediately after NPI measures to later estimates of leeway. Finally, we quantified risks associated with reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We found widely varying leeway to reopen. After initial NPI measures took effect, some jurisdictions had substantial leeway (e.g., Japan, New Zealand, Germany) with > 0.99 probability that contact rates were below 80% of the threshold for epidemic growth. Others had little leeway (e.g., the United Kingdom, Washington State) and some had none (e.g., Sweden, California). For most such regions, increases in contact rate of 1.5-2 fold would have had high (> 0.7) probability of exceeding past peak sizes. Most jurisdictions experienced June-August trajectories consistent with our projections of contact rate increases of 1-2-fold. Under such relaxation scenarios for some regions, we projected up to â¼100 additional cases if just one case were imported per week over six weeks, even between jurisdictions with comparable COVID-19 risk. We provide an R package covidseir to enable jurisdictions to estimate leeway and forecast cases under different future contact patterns. Estimates of leeway can establish a quantitative basis for decisions about reopening. We recommend a cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong monitoring for changes in transmission.","Anderson, Sean C; Mulberry, Nicola; Edwards, Andrew M; Stockdale, Jessica E; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A; Falcao, Rebeca C; Otterstatter, Michael C; Janjua, Naveed Z; Coombs, Daniel; Colijn, Caroline",Epidemics,,59

Motivating potential travelers to take precautions is critical, especially for those at higher risk for severe illness. To provide an evidence base for communication efforts, we examined the experiences and views of travelers during the summer of 2020 through a telephone survey of 1,968 US adults, conducted in English and Spanish, July 2 through July 16, 2020. The survey found that more than one-quarter (28%) of adults had traveled domestically in the prior 30 days, most commonly for ""vacation"" (43%), and less than half wore masks (46%) or practiced social distancing (47%) ""all of the time."" Although high-risk adults were significantly less likely to travel than non-high-risk adults (23% vs 31%; P < .001), they were no more likely to take precautions. Many travelers did not wear a mask or practice social distancing because they felt such actions were unnecessary (eg, they were outside or with friends and family). Although a substantial share of travelers (43% to 53%) trusted public health agencies ""a great deal"" for information about reducing risks while traveling, more travelers (73%) trusted their own healthcare providers. Findings suggest that outreach may be improved by partnering with providers to emphasize the benefits of layering precautions and provide targeted education to high-risk individuals.

Our aim was to compare the short-term impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and first lockdown on the employment and financial security of working age adults with and without disabilities in the UK. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data collected in Wave 9 and the special April, May and June COVID-19 monthly surveys of 'Understanding Society', the UK's main annual household panel study. RESULTS: During the first 3 months of the introduction of the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK, respondents with disability were more likely than their peers to be working reduced hours and experience higher levels of financial stress. These differences were attenuated, but not eliminated, when estimates were adjusted to take account of pre-lockdown financial status. CONCLUSIONS: Working age adults with disability were particularly disadvantaged by the financial impact of the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres has stated the need for a disability-inclusive COVID-19 government response. The results of our analysis suggest that these pleas have either not been heeded, or if measures have been implemented, they have so far been ineffectual in the UK.","Emerson, Eric; Stancliffe, Roger; Hatton, Chris; Llewellyn, Gwynnyth; King, Tania; Totsika, Vaso; Aitken, Zoe; Kavanagh, Anne",J. public health (Oxf),,59

241114,Is withdrawing treatment really more problematic than withholding treatment?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the practice of medicine. Dermatologic laser and energy-based device (EBD) treatments carry a potential risk for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 both for the patient and the practitioner. These risks include close practitioner to patient proximity, the treatment of higher viral load areas such as the face, the potential for infective bioparticles being carried by generated plumes and aerosols, and the direct contact between device, practitioner and patient. OBJECTIVES: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infective respiratory pathogen transmitted by respiratory droplets, respiratory/mucosal secretions, medically generated aerosols and via its transfer from contaminated fomites. This requires a review of the appropriateness of infection control protocols in regard to dermatologic laser and energy-based device treatments. METHODS: A critical evaluation of patient skin preparation including skin asepsis, device disinfection, laser and electrosurgical plume management and PPE in regard to SARS-CoV-2 was performed. RESULTS: The adherence to a high standard of skin preparation and asepsis, device disinfection, laser and electrosurgical plume and aerosol management and appropriate PPE should help mitigate or reduce some of the inherent treatment risks. Head and neck treatments along with aerosol and laser plume generating treatments likely carry greater risk. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 needs to be considered in the clinic set-up along with the planning, treatment and post-treatment care of patients utilising EBD procedures. Some of these treatment precautions are COVID-19 specific; however, most represent adherence to good infectious disease and established laser and EBD safety precautions.","Sullivan, John R; Rademaker, Marius; Goodman, Greg; Bekhor, Philip; Al-Niaimi, Firas",Australas. j. dermatol,,59

The immunosuppressive properties of MSCs are important for downregulating inflammatory responses. Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) is the etiological agent of a poult mortality syndrome that affects intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, poult MSCs were isolated, characterized, and infected with TCoV after in vitro culture. The poult-derived MSCs showed fibroblast-like morphology and the ability to undergo differentiation into mesodermal-derived cells and to support virus replication. Infection with TCoV resulted in cytopathic effects and the loss of cell viability. TCoV antigens and new viral progeny were detected at high levels, as were transcripts of the pro-inflammatory factors INFÎ³, IL-6, and IL-8. These findings suggest that the cytokine storm phenomenon is not restricted to one genus of the family Coronaviridae and that MSCs cannot always balance the process.","Cardoso, Tereza Cristina; Panegossi, Letícia Colin; Gameiro, Roberto",Arch. virol,,59

COVID-19 is not a nudge; it is a tidal wave. Engaging with and understanding complexity science allows us to examine the internal rules of our health care system and recognize our own role as agents that can systematically and deliberately disrupt the status quo. The intertwined and interdependent complex relationships that exist in health care between persons, business, academia, and government buffer the system from rapid and drastic change. COVID-19, however, swiftly disrupted many of the rules keeping the system in its previous state. Some would describe this sudden and dramatic systems change as a Black Swan. This column will examine the role of the Black Swan, as it relates to this pandemic. The Black Swan is a term coined in the 2nd century by Roman poet Juvenal's description of something being rara avis in terries nigroque simillima cygno, Latin for ""a bird as rare as the black swan"" (Taleb, 2007, p. xxxi). At this time, reference to a black swan was meant as a statement of impossibility, because all historical records of swans had been white. In 1697, Dutch explorers discovered black swans living in the wild in Western Australia (Taleb, 2007, p. xxi), and the black swan became a metaphor for events that come as a surprise, have major implications, and can often be understood only with the benefit of hindsight. This theory of the black swan was further articulated by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his books Fooled by Randomness (Taleb, 2001) and The Black Swan (Taleb, 2007).

241449,Prediction and mitigation of mutation threats to COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Anesthesia machines have evolved over the years to excel in delivering low-flow anesthesia (<1 L fresh gas flow) in a closed-circuit system, with the obvious benefits being decreased costs and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. At a pediatric hospital that provides over 25 000 anesthetics a year, a quality improvement project was initiated with the aim of decreasing the amount of sevoflurane used per anesthetic by 20% over the course of a year. METHODS: Three Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles involving gathering comparative data, departmental education, improvement updates on our huddle board, and intraoperative confirmation rounds were completed. The bottles of sevoflurane used and the total number of anesthetics performed were collected each month. To account for the fluctuation of anesthetic cases per month, a metric of ""Anesthetics Performed per Bottle of Sevoflurane Used"" was created. RESULTS: Compared to a prior twelve-month period, the Anesthetics Performed per Bottle of Sevoflurane Used were higher with a mean increase of 25%. The bottles of sevoflurane used per month was lower with a mean decrease of 20%. The carbon footprint of our sevoflurane use was also decreased and extrapolated over a year, and the decrease was equivalent to 70 000 miles driven, over 3,200 gallons of gasoline consumed, or over 31000 pounds of coal burned. CONCLUSION: A QI initiative aimed at changing the practice of delivering at least 2L fresh gas flow to delivering a low-flow anesthetic has been a successful value-added enhancement to our pediatric anesthesia practice.","Glenski, Todd A; Levine, Laura",Paediatr. anaesth,,59

We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, treatment features of the psoriasis patients during the pandemic period. We conducted a study in dermatology clinics of seven different tertiary centers. All adult psoriasis patients who were followed up between 11 March 2020 and 28 June 2020, were phone called or questioned in their visit to their follow-up clinics. A semistructured questionnaire was applied and patients' demographics and disease characteristics were recorded. Of 1322 patients, 52.4% were male, and 47.6% were female. According to the questionnaire responses, 964 (72.9%) of these patients could not communicate with their physician during this period, remained 358 (27.1%) patients contacted the physician by phone, email, or hospital visit. From the patients diagnosed as probable/confirmed COVID-19, 14 were female, and 9 were male. Nine of 23 (39.1%) patients were using biologic treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of hospitalization from COVID-19 between the patients using biologics (n = 9) and those who did not (n = 14) (P = 1.00). No mortality was observed among them. Obesity, smoking, age, and accompanying psoriatic arthritis were not among the risk factors affecting the frequency of COVID-19. We only encountered an increased risk in diabetic patients. Also, an exacerbation of psoriasis was observed with the infection.

244709,"Vaccine Development Against COVID-19 Prior to Pandemic Outbreaks, Using in vitro Evolution and Reverse Genetics",2020,"In December 2019, all nations learnt about the emergence of a pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a member of the ß-coronavirus group. As SARS-CoV-2 has the potentiality of leading to life-threatening respiratory failure, its transmission routes need to be characterized. Yet, the possibility of airborne transmission is still debated. This study was performed to evaluate potential hospital indoor air viral quality in order to detect SARS-COV-2. For this purpose, an impinger method was used to monitor the SARS-COV-2 virus in the air. Thus, 33 samples were collected from 8 different hospital locations. The sampling time was between 50 and 60 min with a sampling flow rate of 28 L/min. Air samples were taken from 2 to 5 m away from the patients' beds. Temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration were 28, 37, and 438 ppm, respectively. The results indicated that air samples which were 2 to 5 m away from the patients' beds were negative for the presence of the virus. According to the obtained results, it is suggested that airborne transmission may not have much effect on this pandemic. However, as the patients with SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized in rooms with negative air pressure, the results might have been negatively affected.

We tested the psychometric properties of a new instrument designed to assess the extent and types of pandemic-related stress experienced by pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 4,451 pregnant women from across the U.S. were recruited via social media and completed an online questionnaire in April-May 2020. The questionnaire included measures of psychological, sociodemographic, and obstetric factors and the new Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS). RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses of the PREPS showed excellent model fit. Three factors - Perinatal Infection Stress (5 items), Preparedness Stress (7 items), and Positive Appraisal (3 items) - converged and diverged with expected psychological factors, and scales created from these factors demonstrated acceptable to good reliability (&#945;'s 0.68-0.86). In addition, mean PREPS scores were associated with perceived risk of infection, and with financial and vocational COVID-19 related burdens. CONCLUSION: The PREPS is a robust instrument to assess multidimensional COVID-19 pandemic prenatal stress. It is a valuable tool for future research to examine vulnerability to pandemic stress and how this stress may affect women and their offspring.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Lobel, Marci",J Psychosom Obstet Gynaecol,,59

For this reason, nursing students were requested to collaborate voluntarily as auxiliary health staff. This emergency has led to mental health problems in health professionals, hence the relevance of coping techniques. The objectives of this study were to explore the experiences and emotional responses of final-year nursing students who volunteered to carry out healthcare relief tasks during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify the coping strategies they adopted to deal with this situation. A qualitative study was conducted in the constructivist paradigm. Purposive sampling was used, and twenty-two students participated in semi-structured interviews, which were then content-analysed. The study is reported using the COREQ checklist. Five themes emerged in the 'Experiences and emotional response' dimension (context, patients, emotions and feelings, risk of contagion, and personal satisfaction), and three themes emerged in the 'Coping strategies' dimension strategies in the work environment, in daily life and personal life. Although the students expressed negative emotions due to the highly complex context and lack of professional experience, they evaluated the experience positively in terms of learning and usefulness. Most notably, the students employed adaptive coping strategies to deal with the pandemic.","Roca, Judith; Canet-Vélez, Olga; Cemeli, Tània; Lavedán, Ana; Masot, Olga; Botigué, Teresa",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,59

METHODS: Parents (N = 584) in the US completed a single online survey, reporting on food security, home food availability, and feeding practices both retrospectively (considering before COVID-19) and currently (during COVID-19). &#967;2 and univariate regressions examined associations by food security status. RESULTS: The percent of families reporting very low food security increased by 20% from before to during COVID-19 (P < 0.01). About one-third of families increased the amount of high-calorie snack foods, desserts/sweets, and fresh foods in their home; 47% increased nonperishable processed foods. Concern about child overweight increased during COVID-19, with a greater increase for food-insecure versus food-secure parents (P < 0.01). Use of restriction, pressure to eat, and monitoring increased, with a greater increase in pressure to eat for parents with food insecurity compared with food-secure parents (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, increases in very low food security and changes in the home food environment and parent feeding practices were observed.

251484,Is contagion having the last word?,2020,"As the world confronts coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an illness caused by yet another emerging pathogen (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]), obstetric care providers are asking what this means for pregnant women. The global spread has been swift, and many key questions remain. The case-fatality rate for persons cared for in the United States and whether asymptomatic persons transmit the virus are examples of questions that need to be answered to inform public health control measures. There are also unanswered questions specific to pregnant women, such as whether pregnant women are more severely affected and whether intrauterine transmission occurs. Although guidelines for pregnant women from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been rapidly developed based on the best available evidence, additional information is critically needed to inform key decisions, such as whether pregnant health care workers should receive special consideration, whether to temporarily separate infected mothers and their newborns, and whether it is safe for infected women to breastfeed. Some current recommendations are well supported, based largely on what we know from seasonal influenza: patients should avoid contact with ill persons, avoid touching their face, cover coughs and sneezes, wash hands frequently, disinfect contaminated surfaces, and stay home when sick. Prenatal clinics should ensure all pregnant women and their visitors are screened for fever and respiratory symptoms, and symptomatic women should be isolated from well women and required to wear a mask.

METHODS: Besides the routine examination, nasopharyngeal and eye swab were continuously measured by polymerase chain reaction assay and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Gene detection was performed for drug use guidance, and flow cytometry was performed to analyse the lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for 22 days, but eye swabs were still continuously positive for 2 weeks after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative. The low level of lymphocyte and the high level IL-6 lasted for almost 4 weeks, then became near normal. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) confirmed the existing of SARS-CoV-2, HSV1 and HHV6B virus nucleic acid. The gene detection for drug use guidance showed the genetic locus ABCB1 (3435T>C) rs1045642 belonged to type CC and it mean the efficiency of lopinavir-ritonavir would be significantly decreased. The flow cytometry of lymphocyte subsets showed PD-1+ CD95+ cells was accounting for 94.8% in CD3+ CD8+ T subset and for 94.8% in CD3+ TCRÎ³Î´+ T subset. CONCLUSIONS: As obstruction of common lacrimal duct, positively detection in one eye for 2 weeks more after nasopharyngeal swab became negative. More eye swabs should be collected from COVID-19 patients, especially from those immunocompromised, those with eye symptoms and those had a history of ocular diseases.","Hu, Yaguang; Chen, Tianyan; Liu, Miaomiao; Zhang, Li; Wang, Fang; Zhao, Shuo; Liu, Hui; Xia, Han; Wang, Yawen; Li, Li",Acta Ophthalmol,,59

In a very short period of time, this pandemic virus has become drastic across the country. A fast detection of corona spread is necessary for both the infected and uninfected person for the further spreading. The preexisting techniques used methods like Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes are not producing better results. Our aim is to bring out better outcomes and to produce good accuracy. Instead of machine learning we opt for deep learning approaches in our work. Image preprocessing will be done by Histogram Equalization algorithm and further the image classification is done by Convolution Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as VGG-16 and ResNet-50 by using 350 images of X-ray datasets. From the comparison, VGG-16 produce better train and test accuracy of 92% and 98.4% .Hence the accuracy of VGG-16 was further tuned using Hyper Parameter Optimization using Tensor Board which produces better outcomes. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

We review the evidence on how estimates of potential output, which are at the heart of essential control indicators in EU fiscal surveillance, were revised in the ten years running up to the COVID-19 pandemic, and how these revisions affected the fiscal stance of EU countries. We provide first evidence for downward revisions in the European Commission’s potential output estimates against the background of the COVID-19 shock across the EU27 countries, and we assess the potential consequences in terms of fiscal space. According to our results, one additional percentage point in predicted losses of actual output is associated with a loss in potential output of about 0.6 percentage points. Given the importance of model-based estimates in the EU’s fiscal rules, avoiding pro-cyclical fiscal tightening will require that policymakers’ hands are not tied by overly pessimistic views on the development of potential output.","Heimberger, Philipp",Intereconomics,,59

SARS-CoV- 2 infection has so far caused more than one million deaths, with the only measures capable of containing the spread of the virus being social distancing, frequent hand washing, and the wearing of masks. Vaccine development was urgently needed and there are now more than 90 candidate vaccines being developed using different technologies. The European Medicines Agency has recently approved a second mRNA-based vaccine, but the introduction of vaccines has raised some doubts about patients with rheumatic disease, who are at high risk of infection because of disease activity and the therapies used to treat it. The aim of this study was to investigate how vaccines may interact with the immune system and treatment of such patients, and how to monitor the post-vaccine antibody titres and T cell responses in order to assess their efficacy and safety.","Benucci, Maurizio; Infantino, Maria; Marotto, Daniela; Ardizzone, Sandro; Manfredi, Mariangela; Sarzi-Puttini, Piercarlo",Clin Exp Rheumatol,,59

Coronaviruses are known to affect the cardiovascular system. We review the basics of coronaviruses, with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system. Observations: Coronavirus disease 2019 can cause a viral pneumonia with additional extrapulmonary manifestations and complications. A large proportion of patients have underlying cardiovascular disease and/or cardiac risk factors. Factors associated with mortality include male sex, advanced age, and presence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and cerebrovascular diseases. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is also strongly associated with mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: Coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a high inflammatory burden that can induce vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Extensive efforts are underway to find specific vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and conditions should be judiciously controlled per evidence-based guidelines.","Madjid, Mohammad; Safavi-Naeini, Payam; Solomon, Scott D; Vardeny, Orly",JAMA Cardiol,,59

258327,Classification of endometriosis,2020,"The purpose of this study was to examine the physiological mechanisms of persistent dyspnoea in COVID-19 survivors. Non-critical patients (nâ¯=â¯186) with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity reported persistent symptoms using a standardized questionnaire and underwent pulmonary function and 6-minute walk testing between 30 and 90 days following the onset of acute COVID-19 symptoms. Patients were divided into those with (nâ¯=â¯70) and without (nâ¯=â¯116) persistent dyspnoea. Patients with persistent dyspnoea had significantly lower FVC (pâ¯=â¯0.03), FEV1 (pâ¯=â¯0.04), DLCO (pâ¯=â¯0.01), 6-minute walk distance (% predicted, pâ¯=â¯0.03), and end-exercise oxygen saturation (pâ¯<â¯0.001), and higher Borg 0-10 ratings of dyspnoea and fatigue (both pâ¯<â¯0.001) compared to patients without persistent dyspnoea. We have shown that dyspnoea is a common persistent symptom across varying degrees of initial COVID-19 severity. Patients with persistent dyspnoea had greater restriction on spirometry, lower DLCO, reduced functional capacity, and increased exertional desaturation and symptoms. This suggests that there is a true physiological mechanism that may explain persistent dyspnoea after COVID-19.","Cortés-Telles, Arturo; López-Romero, Stephanie; Figueroa-Hurtado, Esperanza; Pou-Aguilar, Yuri Noemi; Wong, Alyson W; Milne, Kathryn M; Ryerson, Christopher J; Guenette, Jordan A",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,,59

However, empirical research on how Agile test artifacts are eventually designed in practice and which quality factors make them useful for software testing remains sparse. Aims: Our objective is two-fold. First, we identify current challenges in using test artifacts to understand why certain quality factors are considered good or bad. Second, we build an Activity-Based Artifact Quality Model that describes what Agile test artifacts should look like. Method: We conduct an industrial survey with 18 practitioners from 12 companies operating in seven different domains. Results: Our analysis reveals nine challenges and 16 factors describing the quality of six test artifacts from the perspective of Agile testers. Interestingly, we observed mostly challenges regarding language and traceability, which are well-known to occur in non-Agile projects. Conclusions: Although Agile software testing is becoming the norm, we still have little confidence about general do's and don'ts going beyond conventional wisdom. This study is the first to distill a list of quality factors deemed important to what can be considered as useful test artifacts.","Fischbach, Jannik; Femmer, Henning; Mendez, Daniel; Fucci, Davide; Vogelsang, Andreas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01722v1.pdf,59

This study aimed to analyze the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 to better differentiate the suspected patients in Beijing, China. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective, single-center study. Clinical and epidemiologic data were collected from suspected patients with COVID-19 admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 29 to February 21, 2020. RESULTS: One hundred and six patients (60 males and 46 females, median age 36 years) were enrolled. Thirty-six patients were ultimately laboratory confirmed. Fifty-three were excluded from the diagnosis of COVID-19. The remaining 17 patients were highly suspected, although their nucleic acid tests were repeatedly negative. The confirmed patients and highly suspected patients had a significantly higher proportion of epidemiologic history than the excluded patients (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in clinical symptoms or the underlying diseases among the three groups. The confirmed patients had a higher frequency of lymphopenia and eosinopenia than the highly suspected and excluded patients. Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral lung involvement, and ground-glass opacity was more likely observed in the confirmed patients. CONCLUSION: The clinical features of the confirmed patients with COVID-19 were insufficient for early diagnosis of COVID-19. The epidemiologic history was of great significance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19. More sensitive diagnostic methods are needed to aid the differential diagnosis of suspected patients with COVID-19.","Gao, Xuesong; Yang, Di; Yuan, Zheng; Zhang, Yijin; Li, Hongjie; Gao, Ping; Liu, Xiaomin; Zhao, Wenshan; Xiao, Te; Guan, Yanlin; Gao, Guiju; Duan, Xuefei",J Infect Dev Ctries,,59

Results: : Attendance significantly improved after the transition to telehealth, as indicated by fewer cancellations and more appointments attended. Patients showed significant improvement and decreases in symptoms. The quality of care was maintained, as indicated by consistent evidence-based intervention use over time. Limitations: : This study was limited by the fact that it took place in an academicallyaffiliated primary care clinic, which may not be representative of all community settings. In addition, analyses related to clinical symptoms were only conducted with a small subset of participants and there was no comparison group. Conclusions: : Telehealth through integrated primary care might be a viable option to improve accessibility of services for low-income, racial/ethnic minority adults and children while also leading to improvements in symptoms.","Frank, Hannah E; Grumbach, Nicholas M; Conrad, Selby M; Wheele, Julia; Wolff, Jennifer",J Affect Disord Rep,,59

262931,Author's response,2020,"Clinical trials provide essential guidance for practicing Evidence-Based Medicine, though often accompanying with unendurable costs and risks. To optimize the design of clinical trials, we introduce a novel Clinical Trial Result Prediction (CTRP) task. In the CTRP framework, a model takes a PICO-formatted clinical trial proposal with its background as input and predicts the result, i.e. how the Intervention group compares with the Comparison group in terms of the measured Outcome in the studied Population. While structured clinical evidence is prohibitively expensive for manual collection, we exploit large-scale unstructured sentences from medical literature that implicitly contain PICOs and results as evidence. Specifically, we pre-train a model to predict the disentangled results from such implicit evidence and fine-tune the model with limited data on the downstream datasets. Experiments on the benchmark Evidence Integration dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the baselines by large margins, e.g., with a 10.7% relative gain over BioBERT in macro-F1. Moreover, the performance improvement is also validated on another dataset composed of clinical trials related to COVID-19.","Jin, Qiao; Tan, Chuanqi; Chen, Mosha; Liu, Xiaozhong; Huang, Songfang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05639v1.pdf,59

269894,"Two Decades Since To Err Is Human: Progress, but Still a ""Chasm""",2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), although most commonly demonstrates respiratory symptoms, but there is a growing set of evidence reporting its correlation with the digestive tract and faeces. Interestingly, recent studies have shown the association of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with gastrointestinal symptoms in infected patients but any sign of respiratory issues. Moreover, some studies have also shown that the presence of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in the faeces of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, the pathophysiology of digestive symptoms associated with COVID-19 has raised a critical need for comprehensive investigative efforts. To address this issue we have developed a bioinformatics pipeline involving a system biological framework to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA expression on deciphering its association with digestive symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients. Using two RNA-seq datasets derived from COVID-19 positive patients with celiac (CEL), Crohn's (CRO) and ulcerative colitis (ULC) as digestive disorders, we have found a significant overlap between the sets of differentially expressed genes from SARS-CoV-2 exposed tissue and digestive tract disordered tissues, reporting 7, 22 and 13 such overlapping genes, respectively. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis, comprehensive analyses of protein-protein interaction network, gene regulatory network, protein-chemical agent interaction network revealed some critical association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the presence of digestive disorders. The infectome, diseasome and comorbidity analyses also discover the influences of the identified signature genes in other risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection to human health. We hope the findings from this pathogenetic analysis may reveal important insights in deciphering the complex interplay between COVID-19 and digestive disorders and underpins its significance in therapeutic development strategy to combat against COVID-19 pandemic.","Nashiry, Md Asif; Sumi, Shauli Sarmin; Sharif Shohan, Mohammad Umer; Alyami, Salem A; Azad, A K M; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Brief. bioinform,,59

An increasing use of technology, both in care and dementia clinical trials, depends upon caregivers' abilities as a user. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to verify the current technology (smartphone and computer) use and acceptance in care, regarding socio-demographic variables; (2) Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to 102 dementia caregivers, mostly of patients with moderate dementia; (3) Results: The majority of participants were women (63%), and large number of them used technological devices such as a smartphone (91%) or computer (81%). Results revealed differences between age, gender, and education level on technology acceptance. Interestingly, smartphone use and acceptance seemed to be feasible, regardless of age, whereas computer use was negatively correlated with age. Technology was perceived by respondents as most useful for patients' activities including locomotion, toileting, and meals; (4) Conclusions: The future of technology use in dementia care should indicate solutions tailored to individual characteristics such as new technology solutions (GPS trackers, smartphone apps, dietary intervention, and meal planning apps).","Wójcik, Daniel; Szczechowiak, Katarzyna; Konopka, Patrycja; Owczarek, Mateusz; Kuzia, Agata; Rydlewska-Liszkowska, Izabela; Pikala, Malgorzata",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,59

Progress in TB care and prevention has been very slow. In 2019, TB remained the most common cause of death from a single infectious pathogen. Globally, an estimated 10.0 million people developed TB disease in 2019, and there were an estimated 1.2 million TB deaths among HIV-negative people and an additional 208, 000 deaths among people living with HIV. Adults accounted for 88% and children for 12% of people with TB. The WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (25%), and the Western Pacific (18%) had the most people with TB. Eight countries accounted for two thirds of the global total: India (26%), Indonesia (8.5%), China (8.4%), the Philippines (6.0%), Pakistan (5.7%), Nigeria (4.4%), Bangladesh (3.6%) and South Africa (3.6%). Only 30% of the 3.5 million five-year target for children treated for TB was met. Major advances have been development of new all oral regimens for MDRTB and new regimens for preventive therapy. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic dislodged TB from the top infectious disease cause of mortality globally. Notably, global TB control efforts were not on track even before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many challenges remain to improve sub-optimal TB treatment and prevention services. Tuberculosis screening and diagnostic test services need to be ramped up. The major drivers of TB remain undernutrition, poverty, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and household air pollution and these need be addressed to achieve the WHO 2035 TB care and prevention targets. National programs need to include interventions for post-tuberculosis holistic wellbeing. From first detection of COVID-19 global coordination and political will with huge financial investments have led to the development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV2 infection. The world now needs to similarly focus on development of new vaccines for TB utilizing new technological methods.","Chakaya, Jeremiah; Khan, Mishal; Ntoumi, Francine; Aklillu, Eleni; Fatima, Razia; Mwaba, Peter; Kapata, Nathan; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Hasnain, Seyed Ehtesham; Katoto, Patrick D M C; Bulabula, André N H; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Nachega, Jean B; Tiberi, Simon; McHugh, Timothy D; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int. j. infect. dis,,59
270633,A predictive internet-based model for COVID-19 hospitalization census,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors of in-hospital mortality related to COVID-19 in older patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized for a diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: Data from hospital admission were collected from the electronic medical records. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict mortality, our primary outcome. Variables at hospital admission were categorized according to the following domains: demographics, clinical history, comorbidities, previous treatment, clinical status, vital signs, clinical scales and scores, routine laboratory analysis, and imaging results. RESULTS: Of a total of 235 Caucasian patients, 43% were male, with a mean age of 86 ± 6.5 years. Seventy-six patients (32%) died. Nonsurvivors had a shorter number of days from initial symptoms to hospitalization (P = .007) and the length of stay in acute wards than survivors (P < .001). Similarly, they had a higher prevalence of heart failure (P = .044), peripheral artery disease (P = .009), crackles at clinical status (P < .001), respiratory rate (P = .005), oxygen support needs (P < .001), C-reactive protein (P < .001), bilateral and peripheral infiltrates on chest radiographs (P = .001), and a lower prevalence of headache (P = .009). Furthermore, nonsurvivors were more often frail (P < .001), with worse functional status (P < .001), higher comorbidity burden (P < .001), and delirium at admission (P = .007). A multivariable Cox model showed that male sex (HR 4.00, 95% CI 2.08-7.71, P < .001), increased fraction of inspired oxygen (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09, P < .001), and crackles (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.15-6.06, P = .019) were the best predictors of mortality, while better functional status was protective (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99, P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, male sex, crackles, a higher fraction of inspired oxygen, and functionality were independent risk factors of mortality. These routine parameters, and not differences in age, should be used to evaluate prognosis in older patients.","Mendes, Aline; Serratrice, Christine; Herrmann, François R; Genton, Laurence; Périvier, Samuel; Scheffler, Max; Fassier, Thomas; Huber, Philippe; Jacques, Marie-Claire; Prendki, Virginie; Roux, Xavier; Di Silvestro, Katharine; Trombert, Véronique; Harbarth, Stephan; Gold, Gabriel; Graf, Christophe E; Zekry, Dina",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,59
270655,Robustness Gym: Unifying the NLP Evaluation Landscape,2021-01-13,"The paper proposes a Product-Service System (PSS) methodology for customizing solutions to different patterns of use while achieving a better environmental performance than a stand-alone product. The approach is based on combining the Quality Function Deployment for Product-Service Systems (QFDforPSS) and the Screening Life Cycle Modeling (SLCM) tools. QFDforPSS is augmented by the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to reduce service-related ambiguities and uncertainties on the one hand and better define the product and service characteristics of the solution on the other. The SLCM evaluates the possible outcomes by determining the environmental impact and comparing it with the manufacturer’s current solution. A case study at a manufacturer of medical diagnostic equipment illustrates the use of the approach depicting the possible benefits that can arise: the PSS solution can be customized to fit customers who intensively use the product and consumers with a more moderate use. This offers flexibility and an optimized life cycle through easier maintenance, upgrades, and end-of-life schemes. Concretely, it shows how the PSS approach can enhance the development of sustainable solutions that can be adapted to varying and future customer needs, such as adjusting current solutions to new requirements, i.e., adapting existing products to COVID-19 detection and different levels of use.","Haber, Nicolas",Sustainability,,59

In the absence of data this review utilizes the Ring Theory of Personhood (RToP) to evaluate how a physician's concept of personhood is affected caring for terminally ill children in order to better support them holistically. METHODS: Using PRISMA Guidelines, 14 researchers carried out independent searches of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and gray literature databases for articles published between 2000 to 2019. Concurrent and independent employment of content and thematic analysis (Split Approach) was used to enhance the trustworthiness of the analysis. RESULTS: 13,424 titles and abstracts were retrieved, 188 full texts were evaluated, and 39 articles were included and analyzed. Identical categories and themes identified using the Split Approach suggest that caring for dying children in PPC impacts the physician's professional identity, clinical decision making, personal well-being and relationships. The data also suggests that the magnitude of these effects depends on the presence of protective and risk factors. CONCLUSION: Aside from providing a novel insight into the upon the physician, this review proffers a unique approach to accounting for the presence, magnitude and influence of incoming catalysts, resultant conflicts, and protective and risk factors upon the physician's personhood. Further studies into the changes in personhood are required. Design of a personalized assessment tool based on the RToP will help direct timely, appropriate and personalized support to these physicians.","Ngiam, Lisa Xin Ling; Ong, Yun Ting; Ng, Jun Xuan; Kuek, Joshua Tze Yin; Chia, Jeng Long; Chan, Natalie Pei Xin; Ho, Chong Yao; Abdurrahman, Ahmad Bin Hanifah Marican; Kamal, Nur Haidah Ahmad; Cheong, Clarissa Wei Shuen; Ng, Cheng Han; Tan, Xiu Hui; Tan, Lorraine Hui En; Chin, Annelissa Mien Chew; Mason, Stephen; Jumat, Muhammad Raihan; Chiam, Min; Krishna, Lalit Kumar Radha",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,59

Advanced age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been found to be the risk factors for severe disease. Fever lasting for >five days with tachypnoea, tachycardia or hypotension are indications for urgent attention and hospitalization in a patient with suspected COVID-19. At present, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from the upper respiratory tract samples is the diagnostic test of choice. While many drugs have shown in vitro activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are insufficient clinical data to promote or dissuade their usage.

Identifying and describing the prevalence of these conditions at the local level can help guide decision-making and efforts to prevent or control severe COVID-19-associated illness. Below state-level estimates, there is a lack of standardized publicly available data on underlying medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. A small area estimation approach was used to estimate county-level prevalence of selected conditions associated with severe COVID-19 disease among U.S. adults aged &#8805;18 years (5,6) using self-reported data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and U.S. Census population data.

Whereas the estimated number of persons with any underlying medical condition was higher in population-dense metropolitan areas, overall prevalence was higher in rural nonmetropolitan areas. These data can provide important local-level information about the estimated number and proportion of persons with certain underlying medical conditions to help guide decisions regarding additional resource investment, and mitigation and prevention measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.","Razzaghi, Hilda; Wang, Yan; Lu, Hua; Marshall, Katherine E; Dowling, Nicole F; Paz-Bailey, Gabriela; Twentyman, Evelyn R; Peacock, Georgina; Greenlund, Kurt J",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,59

FACT: There is currently no direct evidence to suggest that a corticosteroid injection before or after the administration of an adenovirus vector-based COVID-19 vaccine decreases the efficacy of the vaccine. However, based on the known timeline of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression following epidural and intraarticular corticosteroid injections, and the timeline of the reported peak efficacy of the Janssen and AstraZeneca vaccines, physicians should consider timing an elective corticosteroid injection such that it is administered no less than 2 weeks prior to and no less than 2 weeks following a COVID-19 adenovirus vector-based vaccine dose, whenever possible. We emphasize the importance of risk/benefit analysis and shared decision making in determining the timing of corticosteroid injections for pain indications in relation to receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine given that patient-specific factors will vary.","Lee, Haewon; Punt, Jennifer A; Patel, Jaymin; Stojanovic, Milan P; Duszynski, Belinda; McCormick, Zachary L",Pain Med,,59

Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease. Thus, the viral antigens were persistent in early stages of infection when virus was in highly replicating status, and viral antigen detection promises to rapidly screen positive patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lv, Ying; Ma, Yuanyuan; Si, Yanhui; Zhu, Xiaoyi; Zhang, Lin; Feng, Haiyan; Tian, Di; Liao, Yixin; Liu, Tiefu; Lu, Hongzhou; Ling, Yun",Biosci Trends,,59

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest CT images of pediatric patients with suspected COVID-19 were retrospectively evaluated. Computed tomography findings were divided into 3 groups: normal, consistent, and inconsistent with COVID-19. The sensitivity and specificity of CT were calculated by reference to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The study included patients with a mean age of 11.1 years (1 month-17 years). Of the patients, 43 (40.19%) had normal CT, 34 (31.77%) had CT findings consistent with COVID-19, and 30 (28.04%) had CT findings inconsistent with COVID-19. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CT were 47.92%, 81.36%, 67.65%, and 65.75%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Because the sensitivity of CT in the pediatric age group is low, it should be used cautiously for the evaluation of COVID-19 in the pediatric age group.","Rona, Günay; Voyvoda, Nuray; Arifoglu, Meral; Karaaslan, Ayse; Çetin, Ceren",J. comput. assist. tomography,,59

It originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly throughout the world, causing over 5,569,679 global cases and 351,866 deaths in almost every country in the world, including Europe, particularly Italy. In general, based on existing data published to date, 80.9% of patients infected with the virus develop mild infection; 13.8% severe pneumonia; 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure; 3% of these cases are fatal. Critical patients have been shown to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospitalization in intensive care units. The average age of patients admitted to hospital is 57-79 years, with one third half with an underlying disease. Asymptomatic infections have also been described, but their frequency is not known. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne from one person to another via droplets. The data available so far seem to indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of producing an excessive immune reaction in the host. The virus attacks type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi through the binding of the Spike protein (S protein) to viral receptors, of which the angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (ACE2) receptor is the most important. ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in numerous tissues, including the oropharynx and conjunctiva, but mostly distributed in ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes in the lower bronchi. The arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia that can lead to the ""cytokine storm syndrome"", a deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6), whose effect is extensive lung tissue damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), that are life-threatening for patients with COVID-19. In the absence of a therapy of proven efficacy, current management consists of off-label or compassionate use therapies based on antivirals, antiparasitic agents in both oral and parenteral formulation, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy and heparin support and convalescent plasma. Like most respiratory viruses can function and replicate at low temperatures (i.e. 34-35 °C) and assuming viral thermolability of SARS-CoV-2, local instillation or aerosol of antiviral (i.e. remdesivir) in humid heat vaporization (40°-41 °C) in the first phase of infection (phenotype I, before admission), both in asymptomatic but nasopharyngeal swab positive patients, together with antiseptic-antiviral oral gargles and povidone-iodine eye drops for conjunctiva (0,8-5% conjunctival congestion), would attack the virus directly through the receptors to which it binds, significantly decreasing viral replication, risk of evolution to phenotypes IV and V, reducing hospitalization and therefore death.","Contini, Carlo; Enrica Gallenga, Carla; Neri, Giampiero; Maritati, Martina; Conti, Pio",Med Hypotheses,,59

282638,PDA Responds to the Novel Coronavirus Situation,2020,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy associated with numerous viral infections. Recently, there have been many case reports describing the association between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and GBS, but much remains unknown about the strength of the association and the features of GBS in this setting. We reviewed 37 published cases of GBS associated with COVID-19 to summarize this information for clinicians and to determine whether a specific clinical or electrodiagnostic (EDx) pattern is emerging. The mean age (59 years), gender (65% male), and COVID-19 features appeared to reflect those of hospitalized COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic. The mean time from COVID-19 symptoms to GBS symptoms was 11 days. The clinical presentation and severity of these GBS cases was similar to those with non-COVID-19 GBS. The EDx pattern was considered demyelinating in approximately half of the cases. Cerebrospinal fluid, when assessed, demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation in 76% of patients and was negative for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all cases. Serum antiganglioside antibodies were absent in 15 of 17 patients tested. Most patients were treated with a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement was noted within 8 weeks in most cases. GBS-associated COVID-19 appears to be an uncommon condition with similar clinical and EDx patterns to GBS before the pandemic. Future studies should compare patients with COVID-19-associated GBS to those with contemporaneous non-COVID-19 GBS and determine whether the incidence of GBS is elevated in those with COVID-19.","Caress, James B; Castoro, Ryan J; Simmons, Zachary; Scelsa, Stephen N; Lewis, Richard A; Ahlawat, Aditi; Narayanaswami, Pushpa",Muscle Nerve,,59

Objective: To identify which clinical characteristics are related to COVID-19 severity and to determine whether age acts a modifier of the relationship between cardio-metabolic comorbidities (CMC) and COVID-19 progression. Method: Data on &#8805; 20-year-old confirmed cases (n = 159,017) were analyzed. Hospitalization, development of pneumonia, intubation requirement, intensive care unit admission and death were the dependent variables in Poisson regression models estimation, whereas the interaction between age and different CMCs were the independent variables. Results: Having CMCs, as well as other comorbidities, was directly related to COVID-19 progression, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was only related to an increase in the risk of dying. The risk for COVID-19 severity was lower as age was more advanced. Asthma and smoking were not risk factors for the progression of COVID-19. Conclusion: In the Mexican population, the risk of COVID-19 progression associated with comorbidities was higher in young adults.","Pérez-Sastré, Miguel A; Valdés, Jesús; Ortiz-Hernández, Luis",Gac Med Mex,,59

A comic drama,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many shutdowns in different industries around the world. Sectors such as infrastructure construction and maintenance projects have not been suspended due to their significant effect on people's routine life. In such projects, workers work close together that makes a high risk of infection. The World Health Organization recommends wearing a face mask and practicing physical distancing to mitigate the virus's spread. This paper developed a computer vision system to automatically detect the violation of face mask wearing and physical distancing among construction workers to assure their safety on infrastructure projects during the pandemic. For the face mask detection, the paper collected and annotated 1,000 images, including different types of face mask wearing, and added them to a pre-existing face mask dataset to develop a dataset of 1,853 images. Then trained and tested multiple Tensorflow state-of-the-art object detection models on the face mask dataset and chose the Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 network that yielded the accuracy of 99.8%. For physical distance detection, the paper employed the Faster R-CNN Inception V2 to detect people. A transformation matrix was used to eliminate the camera angle's effect on the object distances on the image. The Euclidian distance used the pixels of the transformed image to compute the actual distance between people. A threshold of six feet was considered to capture physical distance violation. The paper also used transfer learning for training the model. The final model was applied on four videos of road maintenance projects in Houston, TX, that effectively detected the face mask and physical distance. We recommend that construction owners use the proposed system to enhance construction workers' safety in the pandemic situation.","Razavi, Moein; Alikhani, Hamed; Janfaza, Vahid; Sadeghi, Benyamin; Alikhani, Ehsan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01373v3.pdf,59

285012,Supercomputer-Based Ensemble Docking Drug Discovery Pipeline with Application to Covid-19,2020,"The dynamic signal encoding paradigm suggests that information flows from the extracellular environment into specific signaling patterns (encoding) that are then read by downstream effectors to control cellular behavior. Previous work empirically quantified the information content of dynamic signaling patterns. However, whether this information can be faithfully transmitted to the gene expression level is unclear. Here we used NFkB signaling as a model to understand the accuracy of information transmission from signaling dynamics into gene expression. Using a detailed mathematical model, we simulated realistic NFkB signaling patterns with different degrees of variability. The NFkB patterns were used as an input to a simple gene expression model. Analysis of information transmission between ligand and NFkB and ligand and gene expression allows us to determine information loss in transmission between receptors to dynamic signaling patterns and between signaling dynamics to gene expression. Information loss could occur due to biochemical noise or due to a lack of specificity. We found that noise-free gene expression has very little information loss suggesting that gene expression can preserve specificity in NFkB patterns. As expected, the addition of noise to the gene expression model results in information loss. Interestingly, this effect can be mitigated by a specific choice of parameters that can substantially reduce information loss due to biochemical noise during gene expression. Overall our results show that the cellular capacity for information transmission from dynamic signaling patterns to gene expression can be high enough to preserve ligand specificity and thereby the accuracy of cellular response to environmental cues.","Maity, Alok; Wollman, Roy",PLoS Comput Biol,,59

289951,Relevance analysis using revision identifier in MS word,2020,"BackgroundDuring 2021 several new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus appeared with both increased levels of transmissibility and virulence with respect to the original wild variant. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variation, first seen in India, dominates COVID-19 infections in several large countries including the United States and India. Most recently, the Lambda variant of interest with increased resistance to vaccines has spread through much of South America. ObjectiveThis research explores the degree to which new variants of concern 1) generate spikes and waves of fluctuations in the daily case fatality rates (CFR) across countries in several regions in the face of increasing levels of vaccination of national populations and 2) may increase the vulnerability of persons with certain comorbidities. MethodsThis study uses new, openly available, epidemiological statistics reported to the relevant national and international authorities for countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Daily CFRs and correlations of fatal COVID-19 infections with potential cofactors are computed for the first half of 2021 that has been dominated by the wide spread of several ""variants of concern"" as denoted by the World Health Organization. ResultsThe analysis yields a new quantitative measure of the temporal dynamics of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infections in the form of variations of a proxy case fatality rate compared on a country to-country basis in the same region. It also finds minimal variation of correlation between the cofactors based on WHO data and on the average apparent case fatality rate.","Barletta, William A.",,,59

During the quarantine the virus spread rapidly throughout the ship. By February 20, there were 651 cases. We model this quarantine with a SEIR model including asymptomatic infections with differentiated shipboard roles for crew and passengers. The study includes the derivation of the basic reproduction number and simulation studies showing the effect of quarantine with COVID-19 or influenza on the total infection numbers. We show that quarantine on a ship with COVID-19 will lead to significant disease spread if asymptomatic infections are not identified. However, if the majority of the crew and passengers are immune or vaccinated to COVID-19, then quarantine would slow the spread. We also show that a disease similar to influenza, even with a ship with a fully susceptible crew and passengers, could be contained through quarantine measures.","Batista, Berlinda; Dickenson, Drew; Gurski, Katharine; Kebe, Malick; Rankin, Naomi",Math Biosci,,59

METHODS: Care-home residency was identified via a national primary care registration database linked to mortality data. Life expectancy was estimated using Makeham-Gompertz models to (i) describe yearly life expectancy from November 2015 to October 2020 (ii) compare life expectancy (during 2016-18) between care-home residents and the wider population and (iii) apply care-home life expectancy estimates to COVID-19 death counts to estimate years of life lost (YLL). RESULTS: Among care-home residents, life expectancy in 2015/16 to 2019/20 ranged from 2.7 to 2.3 years for women and 2.3 to 1.8 years for men.

Mediation analyses were performed to examine the impacts of meaning in life on the outcomes across the two waves of data. Findings from these analyses revealed that meaning in life before the pandemic had a significant predictive effect on resilience and mental well-being of young adults during the coronavirus disease. Resilience also mediated the impacts of meaning in life on mental well-being indicators at the second time.

However, the issue as to whether routine blood tests could be used to monitor and predict the severity and prognosis of COVID­19 has not been comprehensively investigated so far. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide an overview of the association of markers in the routine blood test with the severity of COVID­19. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched to identify studies reporting data on markers in the routine blood test and the severity of COVID­19, published until March 20, 2020. The STATA software was used for meta­analysis. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies with 3090 patients with COVID­19 were included in this analysis. Patients in the nonsevere group, compared with those in the severe group, had lower counts of white blood cells (weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.85 [×109/l]; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.16; P = 0.02) and neutrophils (WMD, -1.57 [×109/l]; 95% CI, -2.6 to -0.54; P = 0.003), greater counts of lymphocytes (WMD, 0.29 [×109/l]; 95% CI, 0.22-0.36; P <0.001) and platelets (WMD, 19.05 [×109/l]; 95% CI, 3.04-35.06; P = 0.02), and a lower neutrophil­to­lymphocyte (NLR) ratio (WMD, -2.48; 95% CI, -3.81 to -1.15; P <0.001). There was no difference in the monocyte count (WMD, 0.01 [×109/l]; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.03; P = 0.029) between these 2 groups. Sensitivity analysis and meta­analysis based on standard mean difference did not change the conclusions regarding neutrophils, lymphocytes, and NLR, but yielded inconsistent results for white blood cells and platelets. CONCLUSIONS: Severe patients had more neutrophils, higher NLR level, and fewer lymphocytes than non-severe patients with COVID-19. Measurement of these markers might assist clinicians to monitor and predict the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.","Zeng, Furong; Li, Linfeng; Zeng, Jiling; Deng, Yuhao; Huang, Huining; Chen, Bin; Deng, Guangtong",Pol Arch Intern Med,,59

Publicly available repositories, such as ClinicalTrials.gov (CTG), provide access to a vast collection of clinical trial characteristics including primary and secondary outcomes, which can be analyzed using a comprehensive set of tools. With growing number of COVID-19 clinical trials, COS development may provide crucial means to standardize, aggregate, share, and analyze diverse research results in a harmonized way. This study was aimed at initial assessment of utility of CTG analytics for identifying COVID-19 COS. At the time of this study, January, 2021, we analyzed 120 ongoing NIH-funded COVID-19 clinical trials initiated in 2020 to inform COVID-19 COS development by evaluating and ranking clinical trial outcomes based on their structured representation in CTG. Using this approach, COS comprised of 25 major clinical outcomes has been identified with mortality, mental health status, and COVID-19 antibodies at the top of the list. We concluded that CTG analytics can be instrumental for COVID-19 COS development and that further analysis is warranted including broader number of international trials combined with more granular approach and ontology-driven pipelines for outcome extraction and curation.","Parvanova, Irena; Finkelstein, Joseph",Stud Health Technol Inform,,59

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been shown to improve the survival in metastatic NSCLC, but are far from being accepted as an induction therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of all patients who received induction ICI (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (carboplatin with paclitaxel) for stage IIIA-B NSCLC followed by surgery in our unit between January 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: Of the 12 patients (9 males, 3 females) 6 had a squamous cell carcinoma, 3 had adenocarcinoma, 1 had an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and 1 had adeno-squamous carcinoma. Seven patients had stage IIIA disease and 5 had stage IIIB. After induction therapy, 6 patients had stable disease and 6 had a partial response. The median tumor reduction was 3.05 cm (range 2.30-8.70). All patients, but one due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak, had no delay in surgery. Two patients experienced myelosuppression after induction therapy, two had minor adverse effects. Three patients had postoperative complications not related to the induction therapy. All patients had a pathological response: 5 complete, 4 major and 3 partial. Eleven patients are alive (mean months of follow-up 18.17±4.97) and free of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Induction ICI-chemotherapy may be a valid treatment in patients with locally advanced NSCLC, providing important tumor downstaging and rendering patients operable. In our experience patients had few side effects and a good pathological response.","Chen, Tianxiang; Ning, Junwei; Campisi, Alessio; Dell039,; Amore, Andrea; Ciarrocchi, Angelo Paolo; Li, Ziming; Song, Liwei; Huang, Jia; Yang, Yunhai; Stella, Franco; Luo, Qingquan",Ann. thorac. surg,,59

Evaluating the possible impact on the invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence associated with a decline in childhood pneumococcal vaccination is important to advocate the PCV programs. Using a deterministic, dynamic transmission model, the differential incidence and burden of IPD in children younger than 5 years in Japan were estimated between the rapid vaccination recovery (January 2021) and the delayed vaccination recovery (April 2022) scenarios for the next 10 years. In our model, the IPD incidence was reduced from 11.9/100,000 in 2019 to 6.3/100,000 in 2020, caused by a reduced transmission rate due to the COVID-19 mitigation measures. Assuming a recovery in the transmission rate in 2022 April, the incidence of IPD was estimated to increase with maximal incidence of 12.1 and 13.1/100,000 children under 5 years in the rapid and the delayed vaccination recovery scenarios. The difference in the total IPD incidence between these two scenarios was primarily driven by vaccine serotypes IPD incidence. The difference of incidence was not observed between the two scenarios after 2025. The persistent decline in childhood pneumococcal vaccination rates due to the impact of COVID-19 might lead to an increased IPD incidence and an incremental disease burden.","Kitano, Taito; Aoki, Hirosato",Comput Biol Med,,59

We aimed to identify and rank clinical and immunological features associated with progression to severe COVID-19. We sought to use tests available in an on-site diagnostic hospital laboratory to identify an immunological signature for severe disease development which could be detected prior to peak severity thereby allowing initiation of therapeutic interventions. We used univariate and multivariate analysis, including unbiased machine learning, to investigate the relationships between clinical and demographic characteristics, inflammatory markers, and leukocyte immunophenotypes with progression to severe disease in 108 patients and to rank these in importance.

A retrospective cohort comprised of all adult inpatient admissions to our centre with COVID-19 was analysed. Data concerning all antecedent prescriptions were collected and agents brought forward for analysis if prescribed to at least 20 patients in our cohort. Forty-two medications and 22 classes of medication were examined. Groups were propensity score matched and analysed by logistic and linear regression. The majority of medications did not show a statistically significant relationship with altered disease outcomes. Lower mortality was associated with use of pregabalin (p = 0.049, HR = 0.10 [0.01-0.92]), inhalers of any type (p = 0.015, HR = 0.33 [0.14-0.80]) and specifically beclomethasone (p = 0.032, HR = 0.10 [0.01-0.82]), tiotropium (p = 0.035, HR = 0.07 [0.01-0.83]) and steroid containing inhalers (p = 0.013, HR = 0.35 [0.15-0.79]). Gliclazide (p = 0.020, HR = 4.37 [1.26-15.18]) and proton pump inhibitor (p = 0.028, HR = 1.72 [1.06-2.79]) use was associated with greater mortality. Diuretic (p = 0.002, HR = 0.07 [0.01-0.37]) and statin (p = 0.006, HR = 0.35 [0.17-0.73]) use was associated with lower rates of critical care admission. Our data lends confidence to observing usual practice in COVID-19 patients by continuing antecedent prescriptions in the absence of an alternative acute contraindication. We highlight potential benefits in investigation of diuretics, inhalers, pregabalin and statins as therapeutic agents for COVID-19 and support further assessment of the safety of gliclazide and PPIs in the acute illness.

303288,Effects on cancer in Africa,2021,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for coatings that reduce infection from SARS-CoV-2 via surfaces. Such a coating could be used on common touch surfaces (e.g., door handles and railings) to reduce both disease transmission and fear of touching objects. Herein, we describe the design, fabrication, and testing of a cupric oxide anti-SARS-CoV-2 coating. Rapid loss of infectivity is an important design criterion, so a porous hydrophilic coating was created to allow rapid infiltration of aqueous solutions into the coating where diffusion distances to the cupric oxide surface are short and the surface area is large. The coating was deposited onto glass from a dispersion of cuprous oxide in ethanol and then thermally treated at 700 °C for 2 h to produce a CuO coating that is &#8776;30 µm thick. The heat treatment oxidized the cuprous oxide to cupric oxide and sintered the particles into a robust film. The SARS-CoV-2 infectivity from the CuO film was reduced by 99.8% in 30 min and 99.9% in 1 h compared to that from glass. The coating remained hydrophilic for at least 5 months, and there was no significant change in the cross-hatch test of robustness after exposure to 70% ethanol or 3 wt % bleach.","Hosseini, Mohsen; Chin, Alex W H; Behzadinasab, Saeed; Poon, Leo L M; Ducker, William A",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,,59

304269,Modelling the Economic Impact and Ripple Effects of Disease Outbreaks,2020,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a novel infection that sets off a pandemic in a short period. Research has been going on to develop safe and effective vaccines and around 150 are in the process of development. In India, two vaccines have been given emergency approval. There has been a rise in hesitancy toward vaccination not only in India but also worldwide. Materials and Methodology: The study included 697 participants who were not vaccinated. The study questionnaire was administered through online Google Forms and included informed consent, sociodemographic details, questions related to COVID-19 infection and vaccine, and vaccine attitude examination (VAX) scale. Results: Among the 697 participants, 216 (31%) were not willing to get vaccinated. Those with prevailing mental (P = 0.011) or physical health (P &lt; 0.001) problems were of negative opinion toward vaccination because of unforeseen complications. Participants with lower education (P = 0.041), skilled to semi-skilled job (P = 0.028), and joint family (P = 0.006) opined that vaccination was more of commercial profiteering for manufacturing companies. Participants who were married (P = 0.010) and living in a joint family (P = 0.009) setting were more inclined toward a preference for natural immunity. Conclusion: The study highlights that 69% of participants were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Various measures can be taken by different stakeholders to improve the positive attitude. As medical professions, we can improve the positive attitude by actively taking the vaccine and educating the local people about the benefits. © 2021 Archives of Mental Health ;Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Godasi, G.

Therefore, we compared the efficacy of candidate vaccines in inducing neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the peak levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies across candidate vaccines. Data were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) since the outcome was assessed via different metrics and methods across the studies. Results: Data obtained from 836 healthy adult vaccine recipients were extracted from 11 studies. BBIBP-CorV, AZD1222, BNT162b2, New Crown COVID-19, and Sputnik V induced a very large effect on the level of neutralizing antibodies (SMD > 1.3); CoVLP, CoronaVac, NVX-CoV2373, and Ad5-nCoV induced a large effect (SMD > 0.8 to &#8804;1.3); and Ad26.COV2.S induced a medium effect (SMD > 0.5 to &#8804;0.8). BBIBP-CorV and AZD122 were more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S, Ad5-nCoV, mRNA-1237, CoronaVac, NVX-CoV2373, CoVLP, and New Crown COVID-19; New Crown COVID-19 was more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S, Ad5-nCoV, and mRNA-1237; CoronaVac was more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S and Ad5-nCoV; and Sputnik V and BNT162b2 were more effective (p < 0.05) than Ad26.COV2.S. In recipients aged &#8804;60 years, AZD1222, BBIBP-CorV, and mRNA-1237 were the most effective candidate vaccines. Conclusion: All the candidate vaccines induced significant levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, but only AZD1222 and mRNA-1237 were certainly tested in patients aged &#8805;70 years. Compared with AZD1222, BNT162b and mRNA-1237 have the advantage that they can be quickly re-engineered to mimic new mutations of SARS-CoV-2.","Rogliani, Paola; Chetta, Alfredo; Cazzola, Mario; Calzetta, Luigino",,,59
307295,Protracted abstinence from extended cocaine self-administration is associated with hypodopaminergic activity in the VTA but not in the SNc,2020,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, health care personnel (HCP) have been at high risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through patient interactions and community exposure (1). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended prioritization of HCP for COVID-19 vaccination to maintain provision of critical services and reduce spread of infection in health care settings (2). Early distribution of two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to HCP allowed assessment of the effectiveness of these vaccines in a real-world setting. A test-negative case-control study is underway to evaluate mRNA COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic illness among HCP at 33 U.S. sites across 25 U.S. states. Interim analyses indicated that the VE of a single dose (measured 14 days after the first dose through 6 days after the second dose) was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74%-87%), adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. The adjusted VE of 2 doses (measured &#8805;7 days after the second dose) was 94% (95% CI = 87%-97%). VE of partial (1-dose) and complete (2-dose) vaccination in this population is comparable to that reported from clinical trials and recent observational studies, supporting the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines against symptomatic disease in adults, with strong 2-dose protection.","Pilishvili, Tamara; Fleming-Dutra, Katherine E; Farrar, Jennifer L; Gierke, Ryan; Mohr, Nicholas M; Talan, David A; Krishnadasan, Anusha; Harland, Karisa K; Smithline, Howard A; Hou, Peter C; Lee, Lilly C; Lim, Stephen C; Moran, Gregory J; Krebs, Elizabeth; Steele, Mark; Beiser, David G; Faine, Brett; Haran, John P; Nandi, Utsav; Schrading, Walter A; Chinnock, Brian; Henning, Daniel J; LoVecchio, Frank; Nadle, Joelle; Barter, Devra; Brackney, Monica; Britton, Amber; Marceaux-Galli, Kaytlynn; Lim, Sarah; Phipps, Erin C; Dumyati, Ghinwa; Pierce, Rebecca; Markus, Tiffanie M; Anderson, Deverick J; Debes, Amanda K; Lin, Michael; Mayer, Jeanmarie; Babcock, Hilary M; Safdar, Nasia; Fischer, Marc; Singleton, Rosalyn; Chea, Nora; Magill, Shelley S; Verani, Jennifer; Schrag, Stephanie",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,59

The virally encoded 3C-like protease (3CLpro ), which is named after picornaviral 3C protease (3Cpro ) due to their similarities in substrate recognition and enzymatic activity, is essential for viral replication and has been considered as the primary drug target. However, information regarding the cellular substrates of 3CLpro and its interaction with the host remains scarce, though recent work has begun to shape our understanding more clearly. Here we summarized and compared the mechanisms by which picornaviruses and coronaviruses have evolved to evade innate immune surveillance, with a focus on the established role of 3Cpro in this process. Through this comparison, we hope to highlight the potential action and mechanisms that are conserved and shared between 3Cpro and 3CLpro . In this review, we also briefly discussed current advances in the development of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting both 3Cpro and 3CLpro .","Ng, Chen Seng; Stobart, Christopher C; Luo, Honglin",Rev Med Virol,,59

311769,Offline: Facts are not enough,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted immunization services critical to the prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases in many low- and middle- income countries around the world. These services will need to be modified in order to minimize COVID-19 transmission and ensure the safety of health workers and the community. Additional budget will be required to implement these modifications that ensure safe delivery. METHODS: Using a simple modeling analysis, we estimated the additional resource requirements associated with modifications to supplementary immunization activities (campaigns) and routine immunization services via fixed sites and outreach in 2020 US dollars. We considered the following four categories of costs: (1) personal protective equipment (PPE) & infection prevention and control (IPC) measures for immunization sessions; (2) physical distancing and screening during immunization sessions; (3) delivery strategy changes, such as changes in session sizes and frequency; and (4) other operational cost increases, including additional social mobilization, training, and hazard pay to compensate health workers. RESULTS: We found that implementing a range of measures to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 transmission could result in a per-facility start-up cost of $466-799 for routine fixed-site delivery and $12-220 for routine outreach delivery, and $12-108 per immunization campaign site. A recurrent monthly cost of $137-1,024 for fixed-site delivery and $152-848 for outreach delivery per facility could be incurred, and a $0.32-0.85 increase in the cost per dose during campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: By illustrating potential cost implications of providing immunization services through a range of strategies in a safe manner, these estimates can provide a benchmark for program managers and policy makers on the additional budget required. These findings can help country practitioners and global development partners planning the continuation of immunization services in the context of COVID-19.","Banks, Christina; Portnoy, Allison; Moi, Flavia; Boonstoppel, Laura; Brenzel, Logan; Resch, Stephen C",Vaccine,,59

314278,TaNTIN: Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Integrated Networks-A collaborative technologies perspective for beyond 5G and 6G,2021-01-20,"Hypertension has been listed in several case series and retrospective cohorts as a potential risk factor for the incidence and severity of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-associated disease (COVID-19). The debate is noteworthy because almost one billion people around the globe are estimated to have hypertensive diseases, according to the Global Burden of Disease study. Considering the SARS-CoV-2's high infectivity rates, a possible interaction between COVID-19 and hypertension is worrisome. Additionally, antihypertensive drugs, especially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, could also influence the natural course of COVID-19 infection. Not only can these associations hold from an epidemiologic standpoint, a mechanistic scenario possibly exists. Hypertension and antihypertensive drugs can increase the expression of transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors, the entry target of the viruses, thus facilitating infectivity. On the other hand, an increase in ACE-2 could be protective considering the anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic effects of the ACE-2-angiotensin 1-7/Mas pathway. So far, little is known about the whole picture. Observational studies appear to indicate at least a twofold increased risk of mortality for hypertensive patients with COVID-19; however, the previous and continued use of RAAS inhibitors may be protective in this subgroup of patients. The scarcity of randomized clinical trials precludes evidence-based decision-making. At least one randomized study in a non-specified sub-analysis demonstrated no relationship between an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and incidence or severity of the disease. It is reflected mainly by observational studies and, therefore, by international cardiology societies' guidelines, which state that antihypertensive drugs, particularly RAAS inhibitors, should not be discontinued unless necessary on a case-by-case basis.","Quinaglia, Thiago; Shabani, Mahsima; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,59

An early identification of this novel coronavirus by molecular tools is critical for surveillance and control of the epidemic outbreak. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish a simple method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV. STUDY DESIGN: Primers of our in-house RT-PCR assays were designed to target conserved regions of the RdRP gene and E gene, selected restriction enzymes EcoRI, Tsp45I and AluI to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS: In this report, a 396 bp fragment of the RdRp gene and 345 bp fragment of the E gene were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Enzyme Tsp45I cuts the RdRP amplified product of SARS-CoV-2 generating 3 fragments of 45, 154 and 197 bp, but it did not cut the amplicon of SARS-CoV. In contrast, the amplified product of SARS-CoV was digested with EcoRI producing 2 fragments of 76 and 320 bp, whereas, the amplicon of SARS-CoV-2 was undigested by Tsp45I help to distinguish clearly SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV on gel electrophoresis. In addition, AluI cut the amplicon of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 generating 2 fragments of 248 and 97 bp without cutting to SARS-CoV. Accuracy of assay was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. When evaluated on clinical samples showed a high sensitivity of 95%, specificity of our assay was 100% and clinical performance for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other reference assays. In conclusion, the present study, we successfully developed a simple method for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV. This article is protected by copyright.

314504,"Pandemic vaccine trials: expedite, but don’t rush",2020,"The claim that anti-malaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, can cure COVID-19 became a focus of fierce political battles that pitted promoters of these pharmaceuticals, Presidents Bolsonaro and Trump among them, against ""medical elites."" At the center of these battles are different meanings of effectiveness in medicine, the complex role of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in proving such effectiveness, the task of medical experts and the state in regulating pharmaceuticals, patients' activism, and the collective production of medical knowledge. This article follows the trajectory of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as anti-COVID-19 drugs, focusing on the reception of views of their main scientific promoter, the French infectious disease specialist, Didier Raoult. The surprising career of these drugs, our text proposes, is fundamentally a political event, not in the narrow sense of engaging specific political fractions, but in the much broader sense of the politics of public participation in science.","Berlivet, Luc; Löwy, Ilana",Med. anthropol. q,,59

The main limitation to widespread use is its dependence on the operator training and experience. COVID-19 lung ultrasound findings predominantly reflect a pneumonitis pattern, with pleural effusion being infrequent. However, pleural effusion is easy to detect and to quantify, therefore it was selected as the subject of this study, which aims to develop an automated system for the interpretation of LUS of pleural effusion. A LUS dataset was collected at the Royal Melbourne Hospital which consisted of 623 videos containing 99,209 2D ultrasound images of 70 patients using a phased array transducer. A standardized protocol was followed that involved scanning six anatomical regions providing complete coverage of the lungs for diagnosis of respiratory pathology. This protocol combined with a deep learning algorithm using a Spatial Transformer Network provides a basis for automatic pathology classification on an image-based level. In this work, the deep learning model was trained using supervised and weakly supervised approaches which used frame- and video-based ground truth labels respectively. The reference was expert clinician image interpretation. Both approaches show comparable accuracy scores on the test set of 92.4% and 91.1%, respectively, not statistically significantly different. However, the video-based labelling approach requires significantly less effort from clinical experts for ground truth labelling.","Tsai, Chung-Han; van der Burgt, Jeroen; Vukovic, Damjan; Kaur, Nancy; Demi, Libertario; Canty, David; Wang, Andrew; Royse, Alistair; Royse, Colin; Haji, Kavi; Dowling, Jason; Chetty, Girija; Fontanarosa, Davide",Phys Med,,59

319713,Why are you reading about study design in Climacteric?,2020,"The interleukin (IL)-1 family member IL-1&#945; is a ubiquitous and pivotal pro-inflammatory cytokine. The IL-1&#945; precursor is constitutively present in nearly all cell types in health, but is released upon necrotic cell death as a bioactive mediator. IL-1&#945; is also expressed by infiltrating myeloid cells within injured tissues. The cytokine binds the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1), as does IL-1ß, and induces the same pro-inflammatory effects. Being a bioactive precursor released upon tissue damage and necrotic cell death, IL-1&#945; is central to the pathogenesis of numerous conditions characterized by organ or tissue inflammation. These include conditions affecting the lung and respiratory tract, dermatoses and inflammatory skin disorders, systemic sclerosis, myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, inflammatory thrombosis, as well as complex multifactorial conditions such as COVID-19, vasculitis and Kawasaki disease, Behcet's syndrome, Sjogren Syndrome, and cancer. This review illustrates the clinical relevance of IL-1&#945; to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, as well as the rationale for the targeted inhibition of this cytokine for treatment of these conditions. Three biologics are available to reduce the activities of IL-1&#945;; the monoclonal antibody bermekimab, the IL-1 soluble receptor rilonacept, and the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. These advances in mechanistic understanding and therapeutic management make it incumbent on physicians to be aware of IL-1&#945; and of the opportunity for therapeutic inhibition of this cytokine in a broad spectrum of diseases.","Cavalli, Giulio; Colafrancesco, Serena; Emmi, Giacomo; Imazio, Massimo; Lopalco, Giuseppe; Maggio, Maria Cristina; Sota, Jurgen; Dinarello, Charles A",Autoimmun Rev,,59

Secondary analysis was undertaken of an online mixed-methods survey open to all mental health care staff in the UK involving 363 staff working with women in the perinatal period. Staff perceived the mental health of perinatal women to be particularly vulnerable to the impact of stressors associated with the pandemic such as social isolation (rated by 79.3% as relevant or extremely relevant; 288/363) and domestic violence and abuse (53.3%; 192/360). As a result of changes to mental health and other health and social care services, staff reported feeling less able to assess women, particularly their relationship with their baby (43.3%; 90/208), and to mobilise safeguarding procedures (29.4%; 62/211). While 42% of staff reported that some women engaged poorly with virtual appointments, they also found flexible remote consulting to be beneficial for some women and helped time management due to reductions in travel time. Delivery of perinatal care needs to be tailored to women's needs; virtual appointments are perceived not to be appropriate for assessments but may be helpful for some women in subsequent interactions. Safeguarding and other risk assessment procedures must remain robust in spite of modifications made to service delivery during pandemics.","Wilson, C A; Dalton-Locke, C; Johnson, S; Simpson, A; Oram, S; Howard, L M",,,59

I merged 2018 US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) national employment and wage data with measures ranking the importance of computer use at work and the importance of working with or performing for the public from the BLS O*NET survey.Results. Approximately 25% (35.6 million) of US workers are employed in occupations (such as technology, administrative, financial, and engineering) that could be done from home; the remaining 75% work in occupations (including health care, manufacturing, retail, and food services) that are challenging to do from home.Conclusions. Most US workers are employed in occupations that cannot be done at home, putting 108.4 million workers at increased risk for adverse health outcomes related to working during a pandemic. These workers tend to be lower paid. The stress experienced by lower-income groups, coupled with job insecurity, could result in a large burden of mental health disorders in the United States in addition to increased cases of COVID-19 from workplace transmission.","Baker, Marissa G",Am J Public Health,,59

We present and explore a case study at an assisted living facility addressing the ethical issues in balancing the management of the community versus the resident's right to autonomy and self-determination. A team of palliative care experts was brought into assisted living facilities to manage patients, care for well residents, and provide input in advance care planning and symptom management. The principles of self-determination and autonomy, stewardship, and distributive justice were explored. The use of nursing skills in triage and assessment, principles in public health, and the 8 domains of palliative care provided a comprehensive framework for structuring emergency operations. Palliative interventions and the role of palliative care nurses played an integral part in addressing ethical challenges in the containment of the virus and the deleterious effects of social isolation among the elderly.","Parekh de Campos, Amisha; Daniels, Susan",J. hosp. palliat. nurs,,59

Cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases. The discourse around the current epidemic makes use of war-related metaphors too, not only in public discourse and in the media, but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a large corpus tweets posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative frames WAR, a highly conventional one, is the frame used most frequently. Yet, this frame does not seem to be apt to elaborate the discourse around some aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options-or a metaphor menu-may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings, opinions and beliefs during the current pandemic.","Wicke, Philipp; Bolognesi, Marianna M",PLoS One,,59

328085,Paving the translational ageing research pathway-training the next generation of researchers,2021,"Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is proven to be effective in protecting against severe tuberculosis. It has been suggested to be able to exert a non-specific beneficial effect as protection against other infectious diseases. The duration of protection against tuberculosis is estimated to be from 10 to 15 years, but the duration of the protection against other infections is not known, maybe up to 20 years, maybe much shorter than that. We don't know it for sure. BCG induced trained immunity paradigm is based on experimental models, cohort studies with low number of individuals, and some epidemiological data in which other possible interfering factors are not controlled. The titles and scopes of scientific articles should be cautiously considered as they can promote indications of getting vaccinated or revaccinated with BCG, before its effectiveness is confirmed and recommendations are published. Besides, revaccination with BCG can put at serious risk patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. Maybe BCG vaccine is effective in preventing COVID-19 deaths or reducing its severity, but may the effect of this vaccine be relevant even with poor health politics and assistance? It is very difficult to compare the epidemiologic data about COVID-19 in different countries. There are countless factors, mainly social and related to the healthcare system, which can be more decisive than the hypothesis of trained immunity induced by BCG. Until now, we can say that BCG's protective role is, at least, insufficient, given many other factors that corroborate SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or its severity.","Sarinho, Emanuel; Goudouris, Ekaterini; Solé, Dirceu",Vaccine,,59

Most existing academic or industrial Algos focus on how to""slice""a big parent order into smaller child orders over a given time horizon. Few models rigorously tackle the actual placement of these child orders. Instead, placement is mostly done with a combination of empirical signals and heuristic decision processes. A self-contained, realistic, and fully functional Child Order Placement (COP) model may never exist due to all the inherent complexities, e.g., fragmentation due to multiple venues, dynamics of limit order books, lit vs. dark liquidity, different trading sessions and rules. In this paper, we propose a reductionism COP model that focuses exclusively on the interplay between placing passive limit orders and sniping using aggressive takeout orders. The dynamic programming model assumes the form of a stochastic linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and allows closed-form solutions under the backward Bellman equations. Explored in detail are model assumptions and general settings, the choice of state and control variables and the cost functions, and the derivation of the closed-form solutions.","Shen, Jackie Jianhong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13797v1.pdf,59

The Quebec Lung Cancer Network, which oversees thoracic oncology services in the province of Quebec under the direction of the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, convened to develop recommendations to deal with the potential disruption of services in thoracic oncology in the province of Quebec. The summary provided here has been adapted from the original document posted on the Programme québécois du cancer Web site at: https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/professionnels/documents/coronavirus-2019-ncov/PJ1_Recommandations_oncologie-thoracique-200415.pdf. Methods: Plans to optimize the health care system and potentially to prioritize services were discussed with respect to various levels of activity. For each level-of-activity scenario, suggestions were made for the services and treatments to prioritize and for those that might have to be postponed, as well as for potential alternatives to care. Results: The principal recommendation is that the cancer centre executive committee and the multidisciplinary tumour board always try to find a solution to maintain standard-of-care therapy for all patients with thoracic tumours, using novel approaches to treatment and the adoption of a network approach to care, as needed. Conclusions: The effect of the covid-19 pandemic on the health care system remains unpredictable and requires that cancer teams unite and offer the most efficient and innovative therapies to all patients under the various conditions that might be forced upon them.","Blais, N; Bouchard, M; Chinas, M; Lizotte, H; Morneau, M; Spicer, J; Martel, S",Curr Oncol,,59

We use the situation in Zimbabwe to build an argument that the epidemic is likely to be attenuated in some countries with similar socioeconomic and cultural structures. However, even an attenuated epidemic may overwhelm weak health systems, emphasizing the importance of prevention. These prevention strategies should be tailored to the unique social and cultural networks of individual countries, which may facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is also equally important to maintain services for the major infectious diseases in the region, such as tuberculosis and malaria. A breakdown of treatment and prevention services for these conditions may even overshadow the projected morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Katsidzira, Leolin; Gwaunza, Lenon; Hakim, James G",Clin Infect Dis,,59
330475,Rejoinder,2021,"BACKGROUND: Waning immunity occurs in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether true re-infection occurs. METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was performed directly on respiratory specimens collected during two episodes of COVID-19 in a patient. Comparative genome analysis was conducted to differentiate re-infection from persistent viral shedding. Laboratory results, including RT-PCR Ct values and serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG, were analyzed. RESULTS: The second episode of asymptomatic infection occurred 142 days after the first symptomatic episode in an apparently immunocompetent patient. During the second episode, there was serological evidence of elevated C-reactive protein and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. Viral genomes from first and second episodes belong to different clades/lineages. Compared to viral genomes in GISAID, the first virus genome has a stop codon at position 64 of orf8 leading to a truncation of 58 amino acids, and was phylogenetically closely related to strains collected in March/April 2020, while the second virus genome was closely related to strains collected in July/August 2020. Another 23 nucleotide and 13 amino acid differences located in 9 different proteins, including positions of B and T cell epitopes, were found between viruses from the first and second episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological, clinical, serological and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had re-infection instead of persistent viral shedding from first infection. Our results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among the human populations despite herd immunity due to natural infection or vaccination. Further studies of patients with re-infection will shed light on protective correlates important for vaccine design.","To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Ip, Jonathan Daniel; Chu, Allen Wing-Ho; Chan, Wan-Mui; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Fong, Carol Ho-Yan; Yuan, Shuofeng; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Ng, Anthony Chin-Ki; Lee, Larry Lap-Yip; Wan, Polk; Tso, Eugene; To, Wing-Kin; Tsang, Dominic; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Huang, Jian-Dong; Kok, Kin-Hang; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Clin. infect. dis,,59

Epicenter of the spread of the disease is in big cities that have been designated as local transmission, including the city of Jakarta. In addition to the ability of virus transmission, the spread of infectious diseases directly is also influenced by the characteristics of the population and human mobility as a breeding ground for viruses. Based on the results of the correlation test, it was found that mobility within the city and external mobility, had an intermediate effect on the spread of COVID-19 disease. While the human development index, population growth, poor population, and vulnerable age variables also have a low impact on the spread of this disease.

Previous studies suggest that obesity is a possible risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the association between obesity and COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 hospitalized patients tested between March 10 and April 13, 2020. SETTING: SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, a COVID-only hospital in New York. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 684 patients were tested for COVID-19 and 504 were analyzed. Patients were categorized into three groups by BMI: normal (BMI 18.50-24.99), overweight (BMI 25.00-29.99), and obese (BMI &#8805; 30.00). MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were intubation, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute cardiac injury (ACI). RESULTS: There were 139 patients (27%) with normal BMI, 150 patients who were overweight (30%), and 215 patients with obesity (43%). After controlling for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, and qSOFA score, there was a significantly increased risk of mortality in the overweight (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) and obese groups (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.7) compared with those with normal BMI. Similarly, there was a significantly increased relative risk for intubation in the overweight (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3) and obese groups (RR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-4.0) compared with those with normal BMI. Obesity did not affect rates of AKI, ACI, or ARDS. Furthermore, obesity appears to significantly increase the risk of mortality in males (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0, P = 0.03), but not in females (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.77-1.9, P = 0.40). CONCLUSION: This study reveals that patients with overweight and obesity who have COVID-19 are at increased risk for mortality and intubation compared to those with normal BMI. These findings support the hypothesis that obesity is a risk factor for COVID-19 complications and should be a consideration in management of COVID-19.","Nakeshbandi, Mohamed; Maini, Rohan; Daniel, Pia; Rosengarten, Sabrina; Parmar, Priyanka; Wilson, Clara; Kim, Julie Minjae; Oommen, Alvin; Mecklenburg, Max; Salvani, Jerome; Joseph, Michael A; Breitman, Igal",Int J Obes (Lond),,59

Our results indicate that statistically significant asymmetries with respect to COVID19 are observed in both wholesale unleaded petrol and diesel prices in all seven markets. When crude oil prices are falling substantially, the number of active COVID19 cases is highly significant in a negative relationship with petrol prices. However, when oil prices are rising (or not falling substantially), the negative effects of such a pandemic on fuel prices perplexingly disappear or become smaller. We find that the negative effects of COVID19 on diesel prices are more pronounced in more population-dense capital cities (i.e. Sydney and Melbourne). It is surprising to observe that the effects of COVID19 pandemic are driven by changes in oil prices: rising oil prices can substantially reduce the negative effect of this health pandemic on fuel prices. Our findings complement concerns from the national competition commission that while fuel prices have recently fallen to decades-long lows, fuel profit margins are at record high levels.","Valadkhani, Abbas Ghazanfari Arezoo Nguyen Jeremy Moradi-Motlagh Amir",Economic Analysis and Policy,,59

It is imperative to assess whether the impact of a pandemic is negative. Design/Approach/Methodology: For the set goals, the authors analyzed the literature on innovation. The analysis of the case study referred to the segment of graphics card manufacturers. Graphics cards were assessed based on selected criteria. These criteria are the technological process of producing graphics processors (photolithography), and the second element in the evaluation of graphics cards were the results of selected card models in a representative program for computer graphics performance tests. Findings: Thanks to this approach, it was possible to identify trends in graphics card performance in the pre-pandemic and pandemic period. The increase in graphics card performance is the result of the implementation of technological innovations. So far, the coronavirus pandemic has not significantly affected the development of the graphics card segment.

334866,Combined use of TDLAS and LIBS for reconstruction of temperature and concentration fields,2020,"We were glad to introduce you that the 2021 3rd International Conference on Applied Machine Learning and Data Science (ICAMLDS 2021), held on 14th-16th, May, 2021, Chengdu, China. This conference was sponsored by Chengdu University of Technology and Xiamen University. Affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of the government's isolation policy, the author was unable to arrive at Chengdu conference safely and on time. Considering the safety and health of the participants, ICAMLDS 2021 was held via online collaboration tool, Tencent meeting, which is different from the traditional way. The aim of ICAMLDS is to present the latest research and results of scientists (professors, students, PhD Students, engineers, and post-doc scientists) related to applied machine learning and data science topics. This conference provides opportunities for the delegates in different fields to exchange new ideas and experiences face to face, to establish business or research relations and to find global partners for future collaboration. We were greatly honored to have invited Prof. Xiaonan Xiao from Xiamen University to serve as our Conference Chairman. He is a professor, Ph.D. advisor, and the chair of Department of Information and Computational Science at Xiamen University Tan Kah Kee College. Professor Xiao is the executive director of Biological Mathematical Society & Mathematical Society of Fujian Province. His expertise mainly focuses on the studies of complex systems modeling and optimal control. During the conference, the conference model was divided into three sessions, including keynote speeches, oral presentations, and online Q&A discussion. In the first part, keynote speakers were each allocated 30-45 minutes to hold their speeches including 5min for Q&A. Then in the second part, some scholars were given about 5-10 minutes to perform their oral presentations one by one and their submissions were selected as the excellent papers. We were honored to invite three sophisticated keynote speakers to deliver keynote speeches during the conference. Our beloved Conference Chair, Prof. Xiaonan Xiao was alsoinvited to present his talk. He delivered a wonderful speech on “New breakthroughs of the 21st Century AI Computing Life Science and Mathematical Thinking in College Students' Innovation Project”. In addition, we had Asso. Prof. Yi Gu from Chengdu University of Technology, China to present his latest research, the title of his speech is “Advances in atmospheric radon monitoring technology”;and the last keynote speaker, Prof. Yanling Zhou, from Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany and her speech title is: Big data mining and analysis based on network messages. Each keynote speech lasted for 45min including 5min for Q&A, after keynote presentations, there are 12 orals presentations, oral speakers share their latest research results with the audience. Each orals presentations last for 15min including 5min for Q&A. The overall number of participants is 51. This format provided an opportunity to discuss the presented scientific results and was supplemented by Q&A sessions in common live chat and direct communication in local chats. There are some disadvantages of online conference, for example, 1) After statistics, we found that participants prefer face-to-face communication, and online meetings lack the awareness of participating in the exchange;2) Due to age differences, online meetings are rejected by older participants. Because they are not familiar with online conferences, they need the help of others to complete their participation in the conference;3) Speakers often interrupt their speeches because multiple authors ask questions online at the same time, making the speeches not reach the best results. In the last part of the conference, all participants were invited to discuss and explore the academic issues after the presentations. The discussion was lasted for about 30-60 minutes. The conference provided a forum for discussing applied machine learning and data science and in particular for prom ting the interchange of novel ideas and the presentations of the latest developments in this field. ICAMLDS-21 received more than 179 manuscripts, and 103 submissions have been accepted by our reviewers. By submitting a paper to ICAMLDS-21, the authors understood and agreed that papers would undergo a rigorous peer-review process. Manuscripts were reviewed by at least two independent, qualified experts in the field selected by the conference committee, who took detailed comments and the authors would submit a revised version in which these feedback taken into consideration. All papers were reviewed using a double-blind review process: authors declared their names and affiliations in the manuscript for the reviewers to see, but reviewers did not know each other's identities, nor did the authors receive information about who had reviewed their manuscript. On behalf of the organizing committee, I would like to especially thank all the editors from IOP Conference Series for their great support to ICAMLDS. Finally we wish all the authors and attendees of ICAMLDS a unique, rewarding and enjoyable memory at ICAMLDS in Chengdu, China. We are looking forward to your participation in the 4th ICAMLDS in 2022. With our warmest regards, ICAMLDS 2021 Organizing Committees, General Chairs, Program Chairs, International Technical Program Committees, Sponsors, Partners and this titles are available in this pdf.","Gu, Yi Xiao Xiaonan Zhou Yanling",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,,59

On Day 23 post-admission, he developed a second COVID-19 episode, now severe, and finally died. Initially, Case R COVID-19 recurrence was interpreted as a reinfection due to the exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive room-mate. However, whole-genome-sequencing indicated that case R recurrence corresponded to a reactivation of the strain involved in his first episode. Case R reactivation had major consequences, leading to a more severe episode, and causing a subsequent transmission to another two hospitalized patients, one of them with fatal outcome.","Pérez Lago, Laura; Martínez Lozano, Helena; Pajares Díaz, Jose Antonio; Díaz Gómez, Arantxa; Machado, Marina; Sola-Campoy, Pedro J; Herranz, Marta; Buenestado-Serrano, Sergio; Valerio, Maricela; Olmedo, María; Andrés Zayas, Cristina; Comas, Iñaki; González Candelas, Fernando; Bañares, Rafael; Catalán, Pilar; Muñoz, Patricia; García de Viedma, Darío",J. infect. dis,,59
335946,Usability evaluation of attitude control for a robotic wheelchair for tip mitigation in outdoor environments,2020,"Background and aims: During the COVID-19 lockdown, problematic Internet use (PIU) has become a serious issue among residential college students, who remain physically isolated from off-campus society. This study constructs an integrated model to investigate the influencing mechanisms of internal locus of control (LOC) and objective peer effects. Methods: Residential college students (n = 494) were surveyed from a single department of a Chinese university. An item from the World Value Survey was employed to measure internal LOC, while objective peer effects were assessed via friends' mutual nominations. Finally, PIU was measured using Young's Internet Addiction Tests, while a social network analysis and logit regression were combined to estimate various factors' effects on PIU. Results: In our sample, the prevalence rate of PIU was 30.6%, and while internal LOC was a protective factor for PIU, its protective role was diluted when exposed to a peer environment with high PIU prevalence. Furthermore, indegree performed contrasting roles on PIU under various network conditions. It acted as a protective factor when exposed to a low prevalence of PIU in a peer environment; however, it became a risk factor when PIU peers were prevalent. Lastly, the protective efficacy of betweenness was activated when individuals had more than one PIU friend. Discussion and conclusions: Further intervention studies focusing on individuals with a weak internal LOC are recommended during the lockdown. Additionally, interventions that consider the network structures carefully, may enhance the prevention of PIU.","Xia, Yiwei; Fan, Yanying; Liu, Tzu-Hsuan; Ma, Zhihao",J. behav. addict. (Online),,59

339422,Evaluating Fairness in the Presence of Spatial Autocorrelation,2021-01-05,"Background: COVID-19 has become a pandemic since December 2019, causing millions of deaths worldwide. It has a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild infection to severe illness requiring mechanical ventilation. In the middle of a pandemic, when medical resources (including mechanical ventilators) are scarce, there should be a scoring system to provide the clinicians with the information needed for clinical decision-making and resource allocation. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a scoring system based on the data obtained on admission, to predict the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This study included COVID-19 patients admitted to Sina Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences from February 20 to May 29, 2020. Patients’ data on admission were retrospectively recruited from Sina Hospital COVID-19 Registry (SHCo-19R). Mul-tivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to identify the predictive factors for mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 681 patients were included in the study;74 patients (10.9%) needed mechanical ventilation during hospitalization, while 607 (89.1%) did not. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that age (OR,1.049;95% CI:1.008-1.091), history of diabetes mellitus (OR,3.216;95% CI:1.134-9.120), respiratory rate (OR,1.051;95% CI:1.005-1.100), oxygen saturation (OR,0.928;95% CI:0.872-0.989), CRP (OR,1.013;95% CI:1.001-1.024) and bicarbonate level (OR,0.886;95% CI:0.790-0.995) were risk factors for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Conclusions: A risk score has been developed based on the available data within the first hours of hospital admission to predict the need for mechanical ventilation. This risk score should be further validated to determine its applicability in other populations. © 2021, Author(s).","Kafan, S.; Vajargah, K.

341568,Seniors on the Sidelines: A Call to Action,2020,"We have proposed a novel, accurate low-cost method to estimate the incubation-period distribution of COVID-19 by conducting a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study. We identified those presymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and followed them until the development of symptoms. The renewal process was adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptoms onset as a forward time. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and using the readily available data. The estimated median incubation period was 7.76 days [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.02 to 8.53], and the 90th percentile was 14.28 days (95% CI: 13.64 to 14.90). By including the possibility that a small portion of patients may contract the disease on their way out of Wuhan, the estimated probability that the incubation period is longer than 14 days was between 5 and 10%.","Qin, Jing; You, Chong; Lin, Qiushi; Hu, Taojun; Yu, Shicheng; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Sci Adv,,59

344435,The Study on Affecting Factors of Correctional Officers’Teleworking: Focused on the U.S. Bureau of Prisons,2020,"BACKGROUND: We previously summarized outcomes for 46 cladribine tablets (CladT)-treated patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and confirmed or suspected COVID-19, as reported to the Merck KGaA Global Patient Safety Database. This report updates on these findings, to 15 January 2021, for a total of 272 reported cases of COVID-19 among CladT recipients. METHODS: Case definitions: confirmed (COVID-19 diagnostic test was positive); suspected (no confirmatory test performed/reported). Cases fulfilling the criteria of hospitalized, medically significant, or fatal were designated as serious and outcomes were classified per usual pharmacovigilance practice. RESULTS: The evaluable cohort comprised 261 patients (confirmed COVID-19, n=160; suspected, n=101); an additional 11 patients had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 but were not evaluated further given their negative diagnostic tests. Median time to onset of COVID-19 from the most recent preceding CladT treatment course was 162 days (n=139). Outcomes were: recovered/recovering, n=133 (51%); not recovered/not resolved, n=19 (7%); died, n=1 (0.4%); and not reported/missing/pending, n=108 (41%). Of the total cohort, 40 (15%) experienced serious COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CladT-treated patients with MS are generally not at greater risk of serious disease and/or a severe outcome with COVID-19 compared with the general population and other patients with MS who acquired COVID-19.","Jack, Dominic; Damian, Doris; Nolting, Axel; Galazka, Andrew",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,59
344439,Lessons from the past,2020,"The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which started in Wuhan in December 2019, is a new infectious disease. The disease is highly contagious, and the correct selection of effective disinfectants is essential. This article analyzed the environmental resistance of coronavirus and its sensitivity to commonly used disinfectants by reviewing domestic and foreign literatures, and concluded that coronavirus has strong survivability in the environment, but it can be efficiently inactivated by most disinfectants. However, it should be noted that the commonly used concentration of chlorine-containing disinfectants (effective chlorine concentration of 500 mg/L) cannot quickly kill coronavirus, and a concentration of 1 000 mg/L or higher is required. Other biocidal agents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine digluconate, are less effective. This article aimed to provide references for selecting the appropriate disinfectants and disinfection methods to cut off the spread of the virus.","Xuelian, HU; Peng, GU; Tianyu, HU; WANG, Qiang; HUANG, Jingbin; ZHANG, Rong; CHEN, Yan",Chongqing Medicine,,59

Accurate, timely, rapid, and nondestructive approaches to predict leaf photosynthetic traits from hyperspectral reflectance are urgently needed for high-throughput crop monitoring. Therefore, this study thoroughly evaluated the state-of-the-art physically-based radiative transfer models (RTMs), data-driven partial-least-squares regression (PLSR), and generalized PLSR (gPLSR) models to estimate leaf traits from leaf-clip hyperspectral reflectance, which was collected from maize (Zea mays L.) plots with diverse genotypes, growth stages, treatments of nitrogen fertilizers and ozone stresses in three growing seasons. Results show that leaf RTMs considering bidirectional effects can give accurate estimates of chlorophyll content (Pearson correlation r = 0.95), while gPLSR enabled retrieval of leaf nitrogen concentration (r = 0.85). Using PLSR with field measurements for training, the cross-validation indicates that Vmax can be well predicted from spectra (r = 0.81). The integration of chlorophyll content (strongly related to visible spectra) and nitrogen concentration (linked to shortwave infrared signals) can provide better predictions of Vmax (r = 0.71) than only using either chlorophyll or nitrogen individually. This study highlights leaf chlorophyll content and nitrogen concentration have key and unique contributions to Vmax prediction.","Wang, Sheng; Guan, Kaiyu; Wang, Zhihui; Ainsworth, Elizabeth A; Zheng, Ting; Townsend, Philip A; Li, Kaiyuan; Moller, Christopher; Wu, Genghong; Jiang, Chongya",,,59

Temporal changes in the pandemic epidemiology and diversity in the clinical course require careful study to identify determinants of poor outcomes. We analyzed 6255 individuals admitted with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 to one of 5 hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania Health System between March 2020 and March 2021, using electronic health records to assess risk factors and outcomes through 8 weeks post-admission. Discharge, readmission and mortality outcomes were analyzed in a multi-state model with multivariable Cox models for each transition. Mortality varied markedly over time, with cumulative incidence (95% CI) 30 days post-admission of 19.1% (16.9, 21.3) in March-April 2020, 5.7% (4.2, 7.5) in July-October 2020 and 10.5% (9.1,12.0) in January-March 2021; 26% of deaths occurred after discharge. Average age (SD) at admission varied from 62.7 (17.6) to 54.8 (19.9) to 60.5 (18.1); mechanical ventilation use declined from 21.3% to 9-11%. Compared to Caucasian, Black race was associated with more severe disease at admission, higher rates of co-morbidities and low-income resident zip code. Between-race risk differences in mortality risk diminished in multivariable models; while admitting hospital, increasing age, admission early in the pandemic, and severe disease and low blood pressure at admission were associated with increased mortality hazard. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with fewer baseline co-morbidities and lower mortality hazard (0.57, 95% CI: 0.37, .087). Multi-state modeling allows for a unified framework to analyze multiple outcomes throughout the disease course. Morbidity and mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients varied over time but post-discharge mortality remained non-trivial. Black race was associated with more risk factors for morbidity and with treatment at hospitals with lower mortality. Multivariable models suggest there are not between-race differences in outcomes. Future work is needed to better understand the identified between-hospital differences in mortality.","Shaw, Pamela A; Yang, Jasper B; Mowery, Danielle L; Schriver, Emily R.; Mahoney, Kevin B; Bar, Katharine J; Ellenberg, Susan S",,,59

348656,"Approaching environmental human thermophysiological thresholds for the case of Ankara, Turkey",2020,"Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) is an edible, cost-effective and widely used derivative of cellulose. Under lyotropic conditions in water, HPC forms a photonic, liquid crystalline mesophase with an exceptional mechanochromic response. However, due to insufficient physical cross-linking photonic HPC can flow freely as a viscous liquid, preventing the exploitation of this mechanochromic material in the absence of any external encapsulation or structural confinement. Here this challenge is addressed by mixing HPC and gelatin in water to form a self-supporting, viscoelastic, and edible supramolecular photonic hydrogel. It is demonstrated that the structural coloration, mechanochromism and non-Newtonian shear-thinning behavior of the lyotropic HPC solutions can all be retained into the gel state. Moreover, the rigidity of the HPC-gel provides a 69% shorter mechanochromic relaxation time back to its initial color when compared to the liquid HPC-water only system, broadening the dynamic color range of HPC by approximately 2.5× in response to a compressive pressure. Finally, the ability to formulate the HPC-gels in a scalable fashion from only water and ""food-grade"" constituents unlocks a wide range of potential applications, from response-tunable mechanochromic materials and colorant-free food decoration, to short-term sensors in, for example, biodegradable ""smart labels"" for food packaging.","Barty-King, Charles H; Chan, Chun Lam Clement; Parker, Richard M; Bay, Mélanie M; Vadrucci, Roberto; De Volder, Michael; Vignolini, Silvia",Adv Mater,,59

Research data suggest bat (RaTG13) and pangolin carried CoV were the proximal source of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we used systematic phylogenetic analysis of Coronavirinae subfamily along with wild type human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains. The key residues of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and O-linked glycan were compared. SARS-CoV-2 strains were clustered with RaTG13 (97.41% identity), Pangolin-CoV (92.22% identity) and Bat-SL-CoV (80.36% identity), forms a new clade-2 in lineage B of beta-CoV. The alignments of RBD contact residues to ACE2 justified? Those SARS-CoV-2 strains sequences were 100% identical by each other, significantly varied in RaTG13 and pangolin-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic cleavage site with an inserted sequence of PRRA compared to RaTG13 and only PRR to pangolin. Only serine (Ser) in pangolin and both threonine (Thr) and serine (Ser) O-linked glycans were seen in RaTG13, suggesting that a detailed study needed in pangolin (Manis javanica) and bat (Rhinolophus affinis) related CoV.","Malaiyan, Jeevan; Arumugam, Suresh; Mohan, Kamalraj; Gomathi Radhakrishnan, Gokul",J. med. virol,,59

É um estudo ecológico de séries temporais com dados secundários obtidos pelo Portal Bi Saúde no painel de Violência Interpessoal/Suicídio. Foram coletadas as notificações de violência em indivíduos de 0 a 19 anos, nos meses de março e abril de cada ano, estratificadas por sexo, faixa etária, raça/cor e tipo de violência. Utilizou-se a regressão de Prais-Winsten para a análise de tendência temporal. Das 7.718 notificações analisadas, observou-se uma queda de 54% no ano de 2020 comparado com o mesmo período em 2019. A análise de tendência até 2019 indicou aumento nas taxas de notificações (2,04, IC95%: 1,01; 3,07, p = 0,002), porém, com a inclusão do ano de 2020 à série temporal, o direcionamento na tendência das taxas de notificações inverteu-se para negativo, perdendo a significância estatística (-0,39, IC95%: -1,16; 2,14, p = 0,632). Conclui-se que o distanciamento social devido à pandemia reduziu as taxas de notificações de violência contra crianças e adolescentes devido à subnotificação, exigindo estratégias que melhorem a identificação dos casos suspeitos de violência durante a pandemia. Ressalta-se a necessidade de planejamento e ações intersetoriais (como saúde, proteção social, justiça e segurança pública) rápidas e específicas com o objetivo da garantia dos direitos das crianças e dos adolescentes.","Levandowski, Mateus Luz; Stahnke, Douglas Nunes; Munhoz, Tiago N.; Hohendorff, Jean Von; Salvador-Silva, Roberta",Cad.

350641,Creative Approaches to Teaching French and Francophone Culture Remotely,2021,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 occurs in the majority of children as COVID-19, without symptoms or with a paucisymptomatic respiratory syndrome, but a small proportion of children develop the systemic Multi Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C), characterized by persistent fever and systemic hyperinflammation, with some clinical features resembling Kawasaki Disease (KD). Objective: With this study we aimed to shed new light on the pathogenesis of these two SARS-CoV-2-related clinical manifestations. Methods: We investigated lymphocyte and dendritic cells subsets, chemokine/cytokine profiles and evaluated the neutrophil activity mediators, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in 10 children with COVID-19 and 9 with MIS-C at the time of hospital admission. Results: Patients with MIS-C showed higher plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), MPO, IL-6, and of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2 than COVID-19 children. In addition, they displayed higher levels of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, mainly induced by IFN-Î³. By contrast, we detected IFN-&#945; in plasma of children with COVID-19, but not in patients with MIS-C. This observation was consistent with the increase of ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNAs in cells of COVID-19 patients, while ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNA were detected in MIS-C at levels comparable to healthy controls. Moreover, quantification of the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which constitute the main source of IFN-&#945;, showed profound depletion of this subset in MIS-C, but not in COVID-19. Conclusions: Our results show a pattern of immune response which is suggestive of type I interferon activation in COVID-19 children, probably related to a recent interaction with the virus, while in MIS-C the immune response is characterized by elevation of the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL8 and of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXL10, which are markers of an active Th1 type immune response. We believe that these immunological events, together with neutrophil activation, might be crucial in inducing the multisystem and cardiovascular damage observed in MIS-C.","Caldarale, Francesca; Giacomelli, Mauro; Garrafa, Emirena; Tamassia, Nicola; Morreale, Alessia; Poli, Piercarlo; Timpano, Silviana; Baresi, Giulia; Zunica, Fiammetta; Cattalini, Marco; Moratto, Daniele; Chiarini, Marco; Cannizzo, Elvira Stefania; Marchetti, Giulia; Cassatella, Marco Antonio; Taddio, Andrea; Tommasini, Alberto; Badolato, Raffaele",Front Immunol,,59

Aim: To describe an epidemiological surveillance strategy to detect symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection and early case detection among healthcare personnel at a university hospital. Patients and Methods: We assessed 209 healthcare workers reporting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in a telephone counseling system. After a structured evaluation, the suggestions ranged from having a SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR test, consulting in the emergency room or at outpatient clinic or returning to work. Results: In 61% of assessed workers a coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR was requested and 28 (22%) were positive. In a multivariate analysis, the clinical variables associated with a positive PCR test were the presence of fever, sudden loss of smell or taste, and a history of contact with a COVID-19 positive case.

METHODS: The 24-month primary and secondary patency rates after construction of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RC-AVF) and arteriovenous graft (AVG) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The 12-month post-PTA patency rate was also investigated. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify clinical parameters associated with the primary patency rate and the post-PTA patency rate. RESULTS: A total of 611 patients were enrolled in the study. The primary patency rate after VA construction was lower in hemodialysis (HD) patients with an AVG than in those with an AVF. Aging (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02 per 1 year; p < 0.001), female sex (HR, 1.41; p = 0.03), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.37; p = 0.03), low serum albumin (HR, 0.76 per 1-g/dL decrease; p = 0.02), and use of an erythropoietin-stimulating agent (HR, 1.62; p = 0.02) were risk factors for VA problems. The post-PTA patency rate was associated with aging (HR, 1.02; p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (HR, 1.49; p = 0.02), polycystic kidney disease (HR, 2.14; p = 0.01), temporary catheter use for initiation of HD (HR, 1.60; p = 0.02), and period from VA construction to use (HR, 0.99; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Although a poor patency rate is commonly associated with advanced age and diabetes, different risk factors affect patency between VA construction and the first PTA.","Yoshida, Mahoko; Doi, Shigehiro; Nakashima, Ayumu; Kyuden, Yasufumi; Kawai, Toru; Kawaoka, Koichiro; Takahashi, Shunsuke; Ueno, Toshinori; Nishizawa, Yoshiko; Masaki, Takao",J Vasc Access,,59

Design/methodology/approach To achieve this aim, the author reviewed peer-reviewed articles in English and Spanish (using, among other sources, Medline and ProQuest), the Ecuadorian Constitution, law projects on mental health and suicide and government reports. Findings The consensus seems to be that the Ecuadorian health-care system has failed in its constitutional mandate to provide essential care for mentally ill patients, such as those suffering from schizophrenia. The data supporting the use of the internet and smartphone technology for delivering health services during the pandemic are extremely clear, but substantive governmental responses have been lacking. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this study is the lack of data on schizophrenia in Ecuador and the use of technology. Originality/value This evaluation of the current literature on the effect of the pandemic on access to health care for patients suffering from mental illness is much-needed and should provide a welcome data source for research, practice and policymaking.","Castro, V.",Journal of Enabling Technologies,,59
353595,The third coronavirus epidemic in the third millennium: what's next?,2020,"The activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems by SARS-CoV-2 causes the release of several inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. The inflammatory hypercytokinemia causes immunopathological changes in the lungs including vascular leakage, and alveolar edema. As a result of these changes in the lungs, hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome occur in patients with COVID-19. Even though there are clinical trials on the development of therapeutics and vaccines, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19. Pharmacological approaches have shown poor results in sepsis-like syndromes caused by the hypercytokinemia. Suppressing the cytokine storm is an important way to prevent the organ damage in patients with COVID-19. Extracorporeal blood purification could be proposed as an adjunctive therapy for sepsis, aiming to control the associated dysregulation of the immune system, which is known to protect organ functions. Several extracorporeal blood purification therapies are now available, and most of them target endotoxins and/or the cytokines and aim improving the immune response. For this purpose, plasmapheresis and immunoadsorption may be an important adjunctive treatment option to manage the complications caused by cytokine storm in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Yigenoglu, Tugçe Nur; Ulas, Turgay; Dal, Mehmet Sinan; Korkmaz, Serdal; Erkurt, Mehmet Ali; Altuntas, Fevzi",Transfus Apher Sci,,59
353734,"Placing the Blame: What If ""They"" REALLY Are Responsible?",2021,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, skin reactions secondary to the use of medical devices (MD), such as allergic contact dermatitis have increasingly been observed (e.g. to continuous blood sugar monitoring systems, insulin pumps, wound dressings, medical gloves, etc.): this is regarded as a developing epidemic. Lack of labelling of the composition of MD, as well as frequent lack of cooperation of manufacturers to disclose this relevant information, even when contacted by the clinician for the individual case of an established adverse reaction, significantly impede patient care. OBJECTIVES: To advocate for full ingredient labelling in the implementation of EU regulation for MD. METHODS: This position paper reviews the scientific literature, the current regulatory framework adopted for MD to date, and the likely impact, including some costs data in case of the absence of such labelling. RESULTS: Efforts made by several scientific teams, who are trying to identify the culprit of such adverse effects, either via asking for cooperation from companies, or using costly chemical analyses of MD, can only partly, and with considerable delay, compensate for the absence of meaningful information on the composition of MD; hence, patient management is compromised. Indeed, without knowing the chemical substances present, physicians are unable to inform patients about which substances they should avoid, and which alternative MD may be suitable/tolerated. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for full and accurate labelling of the chemical composition of MD in contact with the human body.","Herman, A; Uter, W; Rustemeyer, T; Matura, M; Aalto-Korte, K; Duus Johansen, J; Gonçalo, M; White, I R; Balato, A; Giménez Arnau, A M; Brockow, K; Mortz, C G; Mahler, V; Goossens, A",J.

We implemented an online survey screening for socio-economic status, insecurity, prosocial behaviour, and resilience (using the Child Youth Resilience Measure, CYRM) with 119 Syrian refugees (14–18 years old;74 male, 45 female) living in Jordan. Responses were compared with in-person data, available for a separate cohort of 324 Syrian refugees, previously sampled in Jordan with the same survey instruments. The online CYRM produced reliable and valid responses, as shown by analyses of internal reliability, convergent and divergent validity, and 7-day test-retest consistency.

To evaluate the different tissues obtained by biopsy and autopsy from five patients who expired from severe COVID-19 in our medical center. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed five patients with severe COVID-19, confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and imaging, to determine the potential correlations between histologic findings with patient outcome. RESULTS: Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and micro-thrombosis were the most common histologic finding in the lung tissues (4 of 5 cases), and immunohistochemical (IHC) findings (3 of 4 cases) suggested perivascular aggregation and diffuse infiltration of alveolar walls by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Two of five cases had mild predominantly perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, single cell myocardial necrosis and variable interstitial edema in myocardial samples. Hypertrophic cardiac myocytes, representing hypertensive cardiomyopathy was seen in one patient and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were detected on IHC in two cases. In renal samples, acute tubular necrosis was observed in 3 of 5 cases, while chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, crescent formation and small vessel fibrin thrombi were observed in 1 of 5 samples. Sinusoidal dilation, mild to moderate chronic portal inflammation and mild mixed macro- and micro-vesicular steatosis were detected in all liver samples.

Por isso a racionalização do uso das rações é fundamental para o bom desempenho econômico dos sistemas produtivos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a adoção de planos de alimentação com restrição alimentar para tilápias. O experimento foi implantado no reservatório de Furnas- Brasil em 20 tanques-rede de 3,0 m³ com 300 peixes cada. O peso inicial dos peixes foi de 201 ± 10g e o período experimental foi de 98 dias com delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com cinco tratamentos e quatro repetições. Os tratamentos foram diferentes planos alimentares: 1- Alimentação contínua (controle); 2- Seis dias de alimentação consecutivos, seguido de um dia de restrição alimentar e realimentação controlada; 3- Seis dias de alimentação consecutivos, seguido de um dia de restrição alimentar e realimentação à vontade; 4- Cinco dias de alimentação consecutivos, seguido de dois dias de restrição alimentar e realimentação controlada; 5- Cinco dias de alimentação consecutivos, seguido de dois dias de restrição alimentar e realimentação à vontade. Foram mensurados o ganho de peso, conversão alimentar, perfil sérico bioquímico e viabilidade financeira durante um ciclo de engorda de tilápias. Ao final do período experimental todos os peixes foram pesados para avaliação do desempenho e três peixes por unidade experimental foram anestesiados para coleta de sangue e eutanasiados para a avaliação de composição corporal. Os tratamentos 3 e 5 apresentaram melhores resultados em ganho de peso e biomassa, porém foram os que apresentaram pior conversão alimentar e custo de produção. Os tratamentos 2 e 4 não diferenciaram em ganho de peso e biomassa do grupo controle, porém apresentaram menor consumo, conversão alimentar e maior retorno financeiro. Não houve diferença significativa do perfil sérico bioquímico e nem na composição corporal.

357771,Rapid Identification of Druggable Targets and the Power of the PHENotype SIMulator for Effective Drug Repurposing in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Although surgeons have argued that preserving motion at the level of the ankle joint may be crucial for the long-term success in the treatment of end-stage ankle osteoarthritis, there is little evidence regarding the potential of total ankle arthroplasty (TAA) to increase ankle range of motion (ROM). In addition, the effect of a percutaneous heel cord lengthening (HCL) during TAA on ankle motion is poorly understood. METHODS: A total of 357 primary TAAs treated with a 3-component device (336 patients, mean age 62.6 [24-85] years) performed between May 2003 and November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Sagittal ankle ROM was assessed according to a previously published protocol preoperatively (PreOP), 1 year postoperatively (PostOP), and at the last available follow-up (LastFU). Pain assessed on a visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed at the same time points. The effect of a percutaneous HCL on ankle ROM and VAS for pain was also evaluated. RESULTS: Preoperative ankle ROM increased from mean 31.3 (0-69) to 33.9 (5-65) degrees 1 year postoperatively (P = .0002) and decreased to 31.9 (5-70) degrees at the LastFU (P = .007). Percutaneous HCL showed no effect on ankle ROM development after TAA (P = .141). Ankle ROM improvement after TAA (PreOP to LastFU) was higher in ankles with lower preoperative ankle motion (P < .0001). A lower ankle ROM at the last follow-up tended to be associated with a higher pain level (P = .056). CONCLUSION: Although ankles with a lower preoperative sagittal ROM gained motion, the current data suggest that TAA has little potential to increase the preoperative available ankle motion. In some patients with a high preoperative ankle ROM, a slight decrease of ankle motion was observed postoperatively. Patients with limited ankle motion at long-term follow-up tended toward experiencing higher pain levels. The short- and long-term effect of a percutaneous HCL on ankle ROM following TAA was minimal.

The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics.","Reis, Ruy Freitas; de Melo Quintela, Bárbara; de Oliveira Campos, Joventino; Gomes, Johnny Moreira; Rocha, Bernardo Martins; Lobosco, Marcelo; Dos Santos, Rodrigo Weber",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,59
358242,Assessment of Risk Management and Control Measures against Coronavirus Disease,2021,"Ecological sensitivity is defined as the ecosystem's reaction to environmental change caused by internal and external factors. The degree of ecological sensitivity varies in spatial dimension depending on the natural and cultural features. Ecological sensitivity analysis is based on basis of mapping these differences. As a result of the analysis, an important data that can be a base for spatial plans at different scales is provided. In accordance with this aim, Denizli province was selected for the study area in this research. The factors affecting sensitivity were determined by the literature survey, which was conducted by considering the characteristics of the study area. In this context, elevation, slope, aspect, the proximity to water surface, land cover, and vegetation coverage were evaluated as natural factors, and the proximity to primary traffic roads and residential areas as cultural factors. Each factor was spatially grouped by means of geographic information systems (GIS) according to the degree of impact on ecological sensitivity. Scale 1 (lowest ecological sensitivity) to 5 (highest ecological sensitivity) was used for the spatial grouping. A analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to weight the factors. The overlay method was used in line with the weighted scores in order to determine the composite ecological sensitivity. As a result of the study, the area of 286.26 sq km (2.37%) as highly and more sensitive, 5267.47 sq km (43.50%) as moderately sensitive, and 6554.56 sq km (54.13%) as mildly and less sensitive was determined. In line with the results, suggestions for protection-utilization balance were developed.","Yilmaz, F C; Zengin, M; Tekin Cure, C",Environ Monit Assess,,59

359675,"""Challenges and opportunities in academic medicine"" APS racism series: at the intersection of equity, science, and social justice",2020,"OBJECTIVE: Delayed admission of myocardial infarction (MI) patients is an important prognostic factor. In the present nationwide registry (TURKMI-2), we evaluated the treatment delays and outcomes of patients with acute MI during the Covid-19 pandemic and compaired with a recentpre-pandemic registry (TURKMI-1). METHODS: The pandemic and pre-pandemic studies were conducted prospectively as 15-day snapshot registries in the same 48 centers. The inclusion criteria for both registries were aged &#8805;18 years and a final diagnosis of acute MI (AMI) with positive troponin levels. The only difference between the 2 registries was that the pre-pandemic (TURKMI-1) registry (n=1872) included only patients presenting within the first 48 hours after symptom-onset. TURKMI-2 enrolled all consecutive patients (n=1113) presenting with AMI during the pandemic period. RESULTS: A comparison of the patients with acute MI presenting within the 48-hour of symptom-onset in the pre-pandemic and pandemic registries revealed an overall 47.1% decrease in acute MI admissions during the pandemic. Median time from symptom-onset to hospital-arrival increased from 150 min to 185 min in patients with ST elevation MI (STEMI) and 295 min to 419 min in patients presenting with non-STEMI (NSTEMI) (p-values <0.001). Door-to-balloon time was similar in the two periods (37 vs. 40 min, p=0.448). In the pandemic period, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) decreased, especially in the NSTEMI group (60.3% vs. 47.4% in NSTEMI, p<0.001; 94.8% vs. 91.1% in STEMI, p=0.013) but the decrease was not significant in STEMI patients admitted within 12 hours of symptom-onset (94.9% vs. 92.1%; p=0.075). In-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were significantly increased during the pandemic period [4.8% vs. 8.9%; p<0.001; age- and sex-adjusted Odds ratio (95% CI) 1.96 (1.20-3.22) for NSTEMI, p=0.007; and 2.08 (1.38-3.13) for STEMI, p<0.001]. CONCLUSION: The present comparison of 2 nationwide registries showed a significant delay in treatment of patients presenting with acute MI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although PCI was performed in a timely fashion, an increase in treatment delay might be responsible for the increased risk of MACE. Public education and establishing COVID-free hospitals are necessary to overcome patients' fear of using healthcare services and mitigate the potential complications of AMI during the pandemic.

361340,An overview of vaccine development for COVID-19,2021,"Due to the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic there exists a strong desire to understand where the SARS-CoV-2 virus came from and how it jumped species boundaries to humans. Molecular evolutionary analyses can trace viral origins by establishing relatedness and divergence times of viruses and identifying past selective pressures. However, we must uphold rigorous standards of inference and interpretation on this topic because of the ramifications of being wrong. Here, we dispute the conclusions of Xia (2020. Extreme genomic CpG deficiency in SARS-CoV-2 and evasion of host antiviral defense. Mol Biol Evol. doi:10.1093/molbev/masa095) that dogs are a likely intermediate host of a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor. We highlight major flaws in Xia's inference process and his analysis of CpG deficiencies, and conclude that there is no direct evidence for the role of dogs as intermediate hosts. Bats and pangolins currently have the greatest support as ancestral hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with the strong caveat that sampling of wildlife species for coronaviruses has been limited.","Pollock, David D; Castoe, Todd A; Perry, Blair W; Lytras, Spyros; Wade, Kristen J; Robertson, David L; Holmes, Edward C; Boni, Maciej F; Kosakovsky Pond, Sergei L; Parry, Rhys; Carlton, Elizabeth J; Wood, James L N; Pennings, Pleuni S; Goldstein, Richard A",Mol Biol Evol,,59

362245,Pandemic vaccines: How are we going to be better prepared next time?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Quarantine has been adopted as a key public health measure to support the control of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in many countries Uganda adopted institutional quarantine for individuals suspected of exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to be placed in institutions like hotels and/or hostels of institutions for at least 14 days. This study explored experiences of individuals who underwent institutional quarantine in Uganda to inform measures to increase its effectiveness and reduce its associated negative impact. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative description study using in-depth interviews with 20 purposively selected individuals who had spent time in institutional quarantine facilities. These were mainly phone-based interviews that were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Electronic data coding was conducted using Atlas.ti 7 software. Thematic content analysis was used to synthesize the findings with similar codes grouped to form sub-themes and ultimately study themes. The findings are presented thematically with typical participant quotes. RESULTS: Study participants spent between 14 to 25 days in institutional quarantine. Four themes emerged describing the experiences of study participants during institutional quarantine, which determined whether participants' experiences were positive or negative. These themes were: quarantine environment including facility related factors and compliance with COVID-19 measures; quarantine management factors of entity paying the costs, communication and days spent in quarantine; individual factors comprising attitude towards quarantine, fears during and post-quarantine and coping mechanisms; and linkage to other services such as health care and post-quarantine follow-up. CONCLUSION: The planning, management and implementation of the quarantine process is a key determinant of the experiences of individuals who undergo the measure. To improve the experience of quarantined individuals and reduce its associated negative impact, the pre-quarantine process should be managed to comply with standards, quarantined persons should be provided as much information as possible, their quarantine duration should kept short and costs of the process ought to be minimised. Furthermore, quarantine facilities should be assessed for suitability and monitored to comply with guidelines while avenues for access to healthcare for the quarantined need to be arranged and any potential stigma associated with quarantine thoroughly addressed.","Ndejjo, Rawlance; Naggayi, Gloria; Tibiita, Ronald; Mugahi, Richard; Kibira, Simon P S",BMC Public Health,,59
364027,"Infections without borders: a new coronavirus in Wuhan, China",2020,"Background: Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have occurred in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) worldwide, but the reasons why some facilities are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks are poorly understood. We aimed to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks among staff and residents in LTCFs. Methods: We did a national cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults aged 65 years or older in England between May 26 and June 19, 2020. The survey collected data from managers of eligible LTCFs on LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, the use of disease control measures, and the number of confirmed cases of infection among staff and residents in each LTCF. Survey responses were linked to individual-level SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results obtained through the national testing programme in England between April 30 and June 13, 2020. The primary outcome was the weighted period prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents and staff reported via the survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with infection in staff and residents, an outbreak (defined as at least one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident or staff member), and a large outbreak (defined as LTCFs with more than a third of the total number of residents and staff combined testing positive, or with >20 residents and staff combined testing positive) using data from the survey and from the linked survey-test dataset. Findings: 9081 eligible wLTCFs were identified, of which 5126 (56·4%) participated in the survey, providing data on 160â033 residents and 248â594 staff members. The weighted period prevalence of infection was 10·5% (95% CI 9·9-11·1) in residents and 3·8% (3·4-4·2) in staff members. 2724 (53·1%) LTCFs reported outbreaks, and 469 (9·1%) LTCFs reported large outbreaks. The odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·80 [95% CI 0·75-0·86], p<0·0001) and staff (0·70 [0·65-0·77], p<0·0001), and of large outbreaks (0·59 [0·38-0·93], p=0·024) were significantly lower in LTCFs that paid staff statutory sick pay compared with those that did not. Each one unit increase in the staff-to-bed ratio was associated with a reduced odds of infection in residents (0·82 [0·78-0·87], p<0·0001) and staff (0·63 [0·59-0·68], p<0·0001. The odds of infection in residents (1·30 [1·23-1·37], p<0·0001) and staff (1·20 [1·13-1·29], p<0·0001), and of outbreaks (2·56 [1·94-3·49], p<0·0001) were significantly higher in LTCFs in which staff often or always cared for both infected or uninfected residents compared with those that cohorted staff with either infected or uninfected residents. Significantly increased odds of infection in residents (1·01 [1·01-1·01], p<0·0001) and staff (1·00 [1·00-1·01], p=0·0005), and of outbreaks (1·08 [1·05-1·10], p<0·0001) were associated with each one unit increase in the number of new admissions to the LTCF relative to baseline (March 1, 2020). The odds of infection in residents (1·19 [1·12-1·26], p<0·0001) and staff (1·19 [1·10-1·29], p<0·0001), and of large outbreaks (1·65 [1·07-2·54], p=0·024) were significantly higher in LTCFs that were for profit versus those that were not for profit. Frequent employment of agency nurses or carers was associated with a significantly increased odds of infection in residents (aOR 1·65 [1·56-1·74], p<0·0001) and staff (1·85 [1·72-1·98], p<0·0001), and of outbreaks (2·33 [1·72-3·16], p<0·0001) and large outbreaks (2·42 [1·67-3·51], p<0·0001) compared with no employment of agency nurses or carers. Compared with LTCFs that did not report difficulties in isolating residents, those that did had significantly higher odds of infection in residents (1·33 [1·28-1·38], p<0·0001) and staff (1·48 [1·41-1·56], p<0·0001), and of outbreaks (1·84 [1·48-2·30], p<0·0001) and large outbreaks (1·62 [1·24-2·11], p=0·0004). Interpretation: Half of LTCFs had no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first wave of the pandemic. Reduced transmission from staff is associated with adequate sick pay, minimal use of agency staff, an increased staff-to-bed ratio, and staff cohorting with either infected or uninfected residents. Increased transmission from residents is associated with an increased number of new admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation procedures.

365310,Long-term regulation of prolonged epidemic outbreaks in large populations via adaptive control: a singular perturbation approach,2021,"OBJECTIVES: CT findings of COVID-19 look similar to other atypical and viral (non-COVID-19) pneumonia diseases. This study proposes a clinical computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using CT features to automatically discriminate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: Overall, 612 patients (306 COVID-19 and 306 non-COVID-19 pneumonia) were recruited. Twenty radiological features were extracted from CT images to evaluate the pattern, location, and distribution of lesions of patients in both groups. All significant CT features were fed in five classifiers namely decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and ensemble to evaluate the best performing CAD system in classifying COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Location and distribution pattern of involvement, number of the lesion, ground-glass opacity (GGO) and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features to classify COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. Our proposed CAD system obtained the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.965, 93.54%, 90.32%, and 91.94%, respectively, using ensemble (COVIDiag) classifier. CONCLUSIONS: This study proposed a COVIDiag model obtained promising results using CT radiological routine features. It can be considered an adjunct tool by the radiologists during the current COVID-19 pandemic to make an accurate diagnosis. KEY POINTS: â¢ Location and distribution of involvement, number of lesions, GGO and crazy-paving, consolidation, reticular, bronchial wall thickening, nodule, air bronchogram, cavity, pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and lymphadenopathy are the significant features between COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups. â¢ The proposed CAD system, COVIDiag, could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia cases with an AUC of 0.965 (sensitivity = 93.54%; specificity = 90.32%; and accuracy = 91.94%). â¢ The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy obtained by radiologist diagnosis are 0.879, 87.10%, 88.71%, and 87.90%, respectively.","Abbasian Ardakani, Ali; Acharya, U Rajendra; Habibollahi, Sina; Mohammadi, Afshin",Eur. radiol,,59
365675,Ethics of controlled human infection to address COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: The study analyses how management control supports the organisation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Design/methodology/approach: Video interviews with top and middle-level managers who were directly involved in handling the response to the COVID-19 crisis in late winter and spring 2020 form the empirical base. The object-of-control framework and the distinction between organic and mechanistic management controls inform the exploratory case analysis of a large food retail cooperative in Italy. Findings: Both organic and mechanistic management control mechanisms enabled an immediate response and management of the crisis. The use of cultural, action and results controls supported employees' health and safety coordination, a tight monitoring of financial performance and social interventions in support of the local community. Originality/value: The study provides original exploratory insights on the use and role of management control in the context of an unprecedented emergency and an unplanned setting (i.e. a pandemic crisis), which is an under-investigated topic in the accounting literature.

365706,"We Saw It Coming-What Did We Get Right, and What Did We Miss?",2020,"This study focused on mussel-like surface adhesion and photoinduced cooperative deformation of a unique type of Janus particles (JPs), composed of an isosorbide-based molecular glass bearing push-pull type azo chromophore (IAC-4) and a 2,6-pyridinedicarboxamide-containing poly(dimethylsiloxane) oligomer (H2pdca-PDMS). The JPs were obtained by the solvent evaporation method in an aqueous medium with the dispersed phase of a solution of IAC-4 and H2pdca-PDMS in dichloromethane (DCM). The JP formation and its mechanism were investigated by electron microscopy, in situ optical microscopy, and theoretical analysis. The results showed that the Janus structures form through gradual segregation between the two components in the droplets induced by the evaporation of DCM, which follows the ternary phase diagrams calculated according to Flory-Huggins theory. In the following stage, the gradual coalescence of small domains in droplets is controlled by dynamic factors. After being deposited on a substrate, the JPs exhibit unidirectional adhesion with the H2pdca-PDMS parts spreading on the substrate, while the IAC-4 parts orientate away from the substrate. The mussel-like adhesion is caused by the interfacial interaction of H2pdca-PDMS with the hard surfaces (i.e., glass and silicon substrates) and its strong ability to spread and wet the surfaces to increase the contact area with the surfaces. Upon irradiation with linearly and circularly polarized laser beams at 488 nm, respectively, a series of unique surface morphologies are observed because of the photoinduced deformation of the IAC-4 parts along the electric vibration direction of the polarized light and the cooperative deformation of the H2pdca-PDMS parts of the JPs. The cooperative deformation reveals the strong interfacial interaction and cohesiveness between the IAC-4 and the H2pdca-PDMS phases in JPs. No peeling-off from the substrate is observed after the large-scale deformation, which also indicates the strong adhesion of the JPs on the substrate surfaces. This study not only demonstrates the mussel-like adhesion and unique cooperative deformation behavior but also supplies new insights into the interfacial interaction in JPs as well as that with hard surfaces, thus opening a new avenue for surface modification and functionalization.","Liao, Chuyi; Hsu, Chungen; Wang, Xiaogong",Langmuir,,59

Training activities, conferences, lectures, face-to-face workshops were suspended until the Health Situation was over. Alternatives to face-to-face training were needed to guarantee the continuity of these activities. Online training, teaching and evaluation emerged as a relatively fast, simple, operational and flexible solution. Universities and faculties promoted online teaching through virtual classes. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy supported this initiative by signing an agreement with the Board of Deans and Chancellors of Pharmacy to make it possible for undergraduate students to continue their studies and supervised practices in hospital pharmacy departments. Specialized training was affected. Pharmacy residency programs were significantly modified by hospital pharmacies to be able to provide the new clinical and research activities required, everyday, by the pandemic situation. Postgraduate and residency training were also negatively affected. Again, online activities made up for restrictions to face-to-face teaching and training. The Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy promoted continuing education and provided updated information on the SARS-CoV-2 virus through its website. Thus, numerous virtual sessions, lectures and webinars have been held, and high-quality material was offered to provide up-todate knowledge, on the pharmacological management of patients with COVID-19.

366261,Journal of Psychosomatic Research 2020 year in review,2021,"When the world went into lockdown (2020) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the streets and places of socialising became deserted – much like in the opening verse of Lamentations. This prompted a desire to re-read this book in light of the pandemic. The question was asked whether this book, set amidst the calamity of the Babylonian captivity and destruction of Jerusalem, can be helpful. Can this book help us make meaning and sense in the face of a new enemy that threatens the world? The article took note of all the necessary interpretations and introductions to the book of Lamentations and concluded that it can be read as lament and, in particular, communal lament. The language of lament, sometimes lost in a world of technology and positivity, can be helpful to verbalise loss and trauma. This elicited a discussion of trauma and biblical studies, and how they interact. Much of literature that originated in traumatic circumstances became ‘meaning-making literature’. It was the case with Lamentations back in the wake of 586 BCE and also in many other instances when the book was re-read. This article provided examples of these instances. The invitation was then accepted to read some of the verses in Lamentations through the lens of the trauma created by COVID-19, and many similarities were found. Contribution: Although Jerusalem was destroyed by an enemy that could be seen, and COVID-19 is caused by an enemy that cannot be seen, there are many similarities between the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation in Jerusalem as lamented by Lamentations. As ‘meaning-making literature’, lament is sometimes the only fitting response to the incomprehensible reality of pain and suffering. Lament defies the cheap answers so often given by religion when it is confronted with mystery, doubt and despair. This seemed to be the case in Lamentations. It was concluded that Lamentations can help readers through the process of trauma therapy as it opens the wound and helps the individual to connect with the bigger community in trying to make sense of it all and to involve others in the pain. The newness of the COVID-19 pandemic and a response from an Old Testament perspective, made the scope of this article relevant.","Serfontein, Johan L.",In die Skriflig,,59
367899,What’s the use? On the uses of use,2020,"Quick identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is central to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, this resource-intensive and relatively lengthy technique is not ideally suited for mass testing. While pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized testing remains elusive. To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying proportions of positive and negative samples. We observed that 5-sample pool testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one positive sample. We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive samples in 125 pools. With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively. Since the negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively. These observations led us to conclude that 4-sample pool testing offers the optimal blend of resource optimization and diagnostic performance across difference disease prevalence settings.","Singh, Anirudh K; Nema, Ram Kumar; Joshi, Ankur; Shankar, Prem; Gupta, Sudheer; Yadav, Ashvini Kumar; Nema, Shashwati; Mathew, Bijina J; Shrivas, Arti; Patankar, Chitra; Raghuwanshi, Arun; Pandey, Ritu; Tripathi, Ranu; Ansari, Kudsia; Singh, Kuldeep; Yadav, Jogender; Biswas, Debasis; Singh, Sarman",PLoS One,,59
368333,New coronavirus outbreak: Framing questions for pandemic prevention,2020,"RATIONALE: A genetic locus at chromosome-3 was recently identified as a risk factor for respiratory failure during COVID-19, and preliminary in-silico analyses demonstrate a strong association between this locus, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and respiratory failure. To understand if this locus may affect infection-mediated acute lung injury in other contexts, we tested whether serum LDH and the chromosome-3 locus were associated with ARDS risk and severity in critically ill adults with non-COVID infections. METHODS: We studied 553 critically ill adults with sepsis enrolled in the Validating biomarkers in Acute Lung Injury for Diagnosis (VALID) study. All patients were prospectively phenotyped for ARDS (Berlin Definition) during the first 4 ICU days by two physician investigators. For genetic analyses, we used a convenience sample of 289 septic VALID patients with genomewide genotyping from prior studies. We extracted data on the lead single nucleotide polymorphism in chromosome-3 (rs35081325;wild-type: A;risk variant: T) identified in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative's analysis A2 (COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure). We assessed severity of illness by APACHE-II scores and oxygenation impairment by SpO2:FiO2 ratio. Between-group comparisons were performed using linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for categorical outcomes. We report effect odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). An inverse normal quantile transformation was applied to clinically ascertained LDH values to account for skewness and non-normality;associations are reported per normalized standard deviation (SD) of the transformed LDH value. RESULTS: Serum LDH was higher among patients with ARDS than without ARDS when controlling for age, gender, and APACHE-II (OR=1.20;95%CI: 1.01-1.43;P=0.04). Serum LDH was also associated with oxygenation impairment, particularly among patients with ARDS (FIGURE). Among genotyped patients, the rs35081325 T-allele was associated with higher serum LDH levels (0.62 normalized SD higher LDH;95%CI: 0.16-1.08;P=0.009), and exhibited trends for higher severity of illness (2.10 higher APACHE-II score per T-allele;95%CI:-0.56 to 4.77;P=0.19), increased ARDS risk (OR=1.55 per T-allele;95%CI 0.70-3.44;P=0.28;FIGURE) and increased in-hospital mortality (OR=2.24 per T-allele;95%CI: 1.00-5.05;P=0.05). CONCLUSION: Serum LDH and rs35081325 on chromosome-3 were associated with ARDS risk and oxygenation impairment in a large cohort of septic adults, suggesting a shared host genetic risk for severe respiratory failure among COVID-19 and other etiologies of infection-mediated acute lung injury. As this SNP is near several genes involved in chemokine function, autophagy, and solute transport, further mechanistic investigation is necessary to identify the causative gene(s).","Kerchberger, V.

We aimed at describing COVID-19 infections in the French cohort of lung transplant (LT) patients. METHODS: Multicenter nationwide cohort study of all LT recipients with COVID-19 diagnosed from March 1 to May 19, 2020. Recipient main characteristics and their management were retrieved. Hospitalization characteristics, occurrence of complications and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five LT patients with a COVID-19 infection were included. Median age was 50.4 [40.6-62.9] years, 16 (45.7%) were female, and 80% were double-LT recipients. Infection was community-acquired in 25 (71.4%). Thirty-one (88.6%) required hospitalization, including 13 (41.9%) in the intensive care unit. The main symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and diarrhea, present in 71.4%, 54.3%, and 31.4% of cases, respectively. Extension of pneumonia on chest CT was moderate to severe in 51.4% of cases. Among the 13 critically ill patients, 7 (53.9%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. Thrombotic events occurred in 4 patients. Overall survival rate was 85.7% after a median follow-up of 50 days [41.0-56.5]. Four of 5 nonsurvivors had had bronchial complications or intensification of immunosuppression in the previous weeks. On univariate analysis, overweight was significantly associated with risk of death (odds ratio 16.0 [95% confidence interval1.5-170.6], p=0.02). CONCLUSION: For the 35 LT recipients with COVID-19, the presentation was severe, requiring hospitalization in most cases, with a survival rate of 85.7%.","Messika, Jonathan; Eloy, Philippine; Roux, Antoine; Hirschi, Sandrine; Nieves, Ana; Le Pavec, Jérôme; Sénéchal, Agathe; Saint Raymond, Christel; Carlier, Nicolas; Demant, Xavier; Le Borgne, Aurélie; Tissot, Adrien; Debray, Marie-Pierre; Beaumont, Laurence; Renaud-Picard, Benjamin; Reynaud-Gaubert, Martine; Mornex, Jean-François; Falque, Loïc; Boussaud, Véronique; Jougon, Jacques; Mussot, Sacha; Mal, Hervé",Transplantation,,59

METHOD: This study was carried out on a total of 53 confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients who were hospitalized in Namazi and Ali Asghar Hospitals, Shiraz, Iran. The patients were divided into two severe (n = 27) and non-severe (n = 28) groups as well as into other three groups in terms of their age: aged less than two years, aged 3-12 years and 13-17 years. It should be noted that CT scans, laboratory, and clinical features were taken from all patients at the admission time. Abnormal chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia was found to show one of the following findings: ground-glass opacities (GGO), bilateral involvement, peripheral and diffuse distribution. RESULT: Fever (79.2%) and dry cough (75.5%) were the most common clinical symptoms. Severe COVID-19 patients showed lymphocytosis, while the non-severe ones did not (P = 0.03). C-reactive protein (CRP) was shown to be significantly lower in patients aged less than two years than those aged 3-12 and 13-17 years (P = 0.01). It was shown also that O2 saturation experienced a significant increase as did patients' age (P = 0.01). Severe patients had significantly higher CT abnormalities than non-severe patients (48.0% compared to 17.9%, respectively) (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Lymphocytosis and abnormal CT findings are among the factors most associated with COVID-19 severity. It was, moreover, showed that the severity of COVID-19, O2 saturation, and respiratory distress were improved as the age of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients increased.","Hoseinyazdi, Meisam; Esmaeilian, Saeid; Jahankhah, Reza; Teimouri, Arash; Sherbaf, Farzaneh Ghazi; Rafiee, Faranak; Jalli, Reza; Hooshmandi, Sedighe",BMC Infect Dis,,59
369282,Willingness-to-pay for a COVID-19 vaccine and its associated determinants in Indonesia,2020,"Introduction: Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias referring to physicians' practices of prioritizing information and data that support their initial impressions, even when the first impressions are wrong. These errors often occur while inheriting patients from a different geography or a long history of medical illnesses. Keeping a broad differential diagnosis, understanding changes in health and illness over time with appropriate evaluation of available laboratory and imaging data is critical to creating and appraising interventions for individuals, families and populations. Initial errors in diagnostic and therapeutic plans can be detrimental to overall outcome in critically ill patients which is even more apparent in the elderly. Case Report: A 70-year-old woman presented with fever, shortness of breath, malaise and dry cough. She was noted to be hypoxemic requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). Her past history included recent diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) based on left sided acute vision loss for which she was on oral prednisone and methotrexate without pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. Her antibody panel was noted to be negative except for elevated ESR and CRP. She was found to be negative for Sars-CoV-2. Bilateral temporal artery biopsies did not reveal GCA (Figure 1). Her respiratory failure progressed into severe ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. BAL was positive for pneumocystis stain and pneumocystis culture. She was initiated on appropriate treatment for pneumocystis pneumonia and ARDS. Her ICU course was further complicated by new left sided hemiparesis and MRI showed temporal and occipital infarcts. TEE revealed immobile vegetation on all 3 aortic valve leaflets concerning for non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis. After initiation of anticoagulation, the patient developed spontaneous retroperitoneal bleeding and progressed to multi-organ failure. Her family decided to transition her care to comfort only, and the patient succumbed to her illness. Discussion: Acute vision loss in elderly requires a thorough work up including cerebrovascular events, autoimmune and local ocular causes. A significant anchoring bias towards GCA in the absence of American College of Rheumatology's qualifying criteria for GCA led to initiation of high dose steroids and immunosuppression. Further addition of F-flurodeoxyglucose PET with temporal artery biopsy is shown to increase diagnostic fidelity in doubtful cases. Early evaluation for embolic events with an echocardiogram could have avoided development of PCP ARDS and fulminant embolic strokes in this patient. In addition, it is recommended that all patients on prednisone ≥20 mg daily for more than 30 days should receive PCP prophylaxis.","Lal, A.; Fragola, A.; Roden, A.

369308,More monkey models for studying COVID-19,2021,"PB125® is a phytochemical composition providing potent Nrf2 activation as well as a number of direct actions that do not involve Nrf2. Nrf2 is a transcription actor that helps maintain metabolic balance by providing redox-sensitive expression of numerous genes controlling normal day-to-day metabolic pathways. When ordinary metabolism is upset by extraordinary events such as injury, pathogenic infection, air or water pollution, ingestion of toxins, or simply by the slow but incessant changes brought about by aging and genetic variations, Nrf2 may also be called into action by the redox changes resulting from these events, whether acute or chronic. A complicating factor in all of this is that Nrf2 levels decline with aging, leaving the elderly less able to maintain proper redox balance. The dysregulated gene expression that results can cause or exacerbate a wide variety of pathological conditions, including susceptibility to viral infections. This review examines the characteristics desirable in Nrf2 activators that have therapeutic potential, as well as some of the patterns of dysregulated gene expression commonly observed during pulmonary infections and the normalizing effects possible by judicious use of phytochemicals to increase the activation level of available Nrf2.","McCord, Joe M; Hybertson, Brooks M; Cota-Gomez, Adela; Gao, Bifeng",Free radic. biol. med,,59

370373,Vaccinating a Nation: Lessons from the Polio Epidemic,2021,"Background. A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been affecting almost all nations around the world. Most infected patients who have been admitted to intensive care units show SARS signs. In this study, we aimed to achieve a better understanding of pathological alterations that take place during the novel coronavirus infection in most presumed affected organs. Methods. We performed postmortem core needle biopsies from lung, heart, and liver on 7 deceased patients who had died of coronavirus disease 2019. Prepared tissue sections were observed by 2 expert pathologists. Results. Diffuse alveolar damage was the main pathologic finding in the lung tissue samples. Patients with hospitalization durations of more than 10 days showed evidence of organization. Multinucleated cells in alveolar spaces and alveolar walls, atypical enlarged cells, accumulation of macrophages in alveolar spaces, and congestion of vascular channels were the other histopathologic alteration of the lung. None of our heart biopsy samples met the criteria for myocarditis. Liver biopsies showed congestion, micro- and macro-vesicular changes, and minimal to mild portal inflammation, in the majority of cases. Conclusions. Similar to the previous coronavirus infection in 2003, the main pathologic finding in the lung was diffuse alveolar damage with a pattern of organization in prolonged cases. The SARS-CoV-2 infection does not cause myocarditis, and the ischemia of myocardium is the most probable justification of the observed pathologic changes in the heart. Liver tissue sections mostly showed nonspecific findings; however, ischemia of the liver can be identified in some cases.","Beigmohammadi, Mohammad Taghi; Jahanbin, Behnaz; Safaei, Masoomeh; Amoozadeh, Laya; Khoshavi, Meysam; Mehrtash, Vahid; Jafarzadeh, Bita; Abdollahi, Alireza",Int J Surg Pathol,,59
370737,A Call for Critical Analysis of Teledermatology,2020,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the risk factors for the death in patients with COVID-19 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled inpatients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between December 25, 2019, and March 3, 2020. The epidemiological and clinical data were compared between non-T2DM and T2DM or between survivors and non-survivors. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to explore the effect of T2DM and complications on in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 1105 inpatients with COVID-19, 967 subjects with without T2DM (n=522 male, 54.0%) and 138 subjects with pre-existing T2DM (n=82 male, 59.4%) were included for baseline characteristics analyses. The complications were also markedly increased in patients with pre-existing T2DM, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (48.6% vs 32.3%, p<0.001), acute cardiac injury (ACI) (36.2% vs 16.7%, p<0.001), acute kidney injury (AKI) (24.8% vs 9.5%, p<0.001), coagulopathy (24.8% vs 11.1%, p<0.001), and hypoproteinemia (21.2% vs 9.4%, p<0.001). The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with pre-existing T2DM compared with those without T2DM (35.3% vs 17.4%, p<0.001). Moreover, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with T2DM, ARDS and coagulopathy were the main causes of mortality, with an HR of 7.96 (95% CI 2.25 to 28.24, p=0.001) for ARDS and an HR of 2.37 (95% CI 1.08 to 5.21, p=0.032) for coagulopathy. This was different from inpatients with COVID-19 without T2DM, in whom ARDS and cardiac injury were the main causes of mortality, with an HR of 12.18 (95% CI 5.74 to 25.89, p<0.001) for ARDS and an HR of 4.42 (95% CI 2.73 to 7.15, p<0.001) for cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulopathy was a major extrapulmonary risk factor for death in inpatients with COVID-19 with T2DM rather than ACI and AKI, which were well associated with mortality in inpatients with COVID-19 without T2DM.","Chen, Xiaoyan; Chen, Ying; Wu, Chaomin; Wei, Ming; Xu, Jie; Chao, Yen-Cheng; Song, Juan; Hou, Dongni; Zhang, Yuye; Du, Chunling; Li, Xiaoying; Song, Yuanlin",,,59

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the mental health of university students in Sichuan Province, China. We conducted a cross-sectional study from April 2020 to May 2020. The participants responded to an online questionnaire that included informed consent, basic information, 20-item Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20), and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). We received 521 effective responses. The results included the following: 19.0% of respondents reported distress, and 31.5%, 8.1%, and 5.8% of them reported mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively; respondents aged &#8804; 22 years, medical students, and those who were in general health reported more distress than others; and medical students and those who paid more attention to pandemic information reported more anxiety than others. Findings suggest that the mental health of university students should be monitored during pandemic, especially for younger students, medical students, students in general health status, and those who paid too much attention to the news of the pandemic. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to other regions of China or other countries.","Yang, Kai-Han; Wang, Lei; Liu, Hui; Li, Lin-Xia; Jiang, Xiao-Lian",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,59

The exactly mechanism of such hypoxemia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well described. It has been suggested that microthrombosis contributes to this mechanism, increasing pulmonary dead space. However, dead spaces would not be sensible to oxygen supplementation, and also, enlargement of pulmonary vessels it has been evidenced. Shunt mechanism by vasodilatation, instead, could explain decubitus dependence in oxygenation by blood redistribution as observed in these patients, and moreover, would be more sensible to oxygen supplementation than dead spaces. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 causes an intrapulmonary vascular dilatation (IPVD), determining a shunt mechanism by vasodilatation. We performed contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography to search IPVD shunt in patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospitalized in an intensive care unit. Ten patients were recruited; one patient was excluded due to low quality of echocardiographic image, and nine patients were included. IPVD was found in seven (78%) patients, with different grades, including patient with normal compliance and the one without invasive ventilation. We demonstrated that shunt by IPVD is present among patients with COVID-19, and this mechanism is probably implicated in significant hypoxemia observed.","Brito-Azevedo, Anderson; Pinto, Eduardo Costa; de Cata Preta Corrêa, Gabriel Angelo; Bouskela, Eliete",J Med Virol,,59
372912,New Year's Resolutions - A Different Perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 outbreak is seriously affecting the lives and health of people across the globe. While gender remains a key determinant of health, attempts to address the gendered dimensions of health face complex challenges. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study 482 participants (men=237, women=245) completed questionnaires on precautionary behaviour, perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors, emotional reactions toward COVID-19 and perceived susceptibility. We examined gender differences in perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors, healthy behaviours, threat perceptions and emotional responses, as well as the role of gender as a moderating factor. RESULTS: Women reported higher levels of precautionary behaviour (t(475)=3.91, p<0.001) and more negative emotional reactions toward COVID-19 (t(475)=6.07, p<0.001). No gender differences emerged in perceived susceptibility or knowledge about COVID-19. The multiple regression model is significant and explains 30% of the variance in precautionary behaviour, which was found to be higher among women and older participants, those with higher perceived knowledge about COVID-19 risk factors and those with higher emotional reactions. Gender exhibited a significant moderating role in the relationship between perceived knowledge and precautionary behaviour (B=0.16, SE=0.07, ß=0.13, p=0.02, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.30). CONCLUSION: Women exhibited higher levels of precautionary behaviour and emotional responses.","Levkovich, Inbar; Shinan-Altman, Shiri",International health (Online),,59

METHODS: This study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee. A total of 82 patients with COVID-19 admitted from 10/1/2020â¼15/3/2020 were enrolled. RPA and perinephric fat stranding (PFS) were evaluated on NECT imaging. According to the presence of PFS, the patients were divided into two groups: Group A, 38 patients with PFS, and Group B, 44 patients without PFS. Clinical data, including age, gender, clinical classification, SCr levels, and RPA on NECT were analysed. The RPA and SCr of the two groups with COVID-19 were analysed to determine possible difference and correlation. Eighty subjects with no kidney diseases were randomly selected as control group to determine the RPA of normal kidney performed on the same CT scanner. RESULTS: Mean age, male to female ratio, number of severe and critical cases, and SCr of Group A were higher than those of Group B. Both mean RPA of Group A and Group B were lower than that of control. Mean RPA of Group A was even lower than that of Group B. A significant weak negative linear correlation between RPA on NECT and SCr in COVID-19 was indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Decrease in RPA on NECT was observed in patients with COVID-19 and a weak linear negative correlation with SCr levels was found. The presence of PFS suggested more severe renal impairment in COVID-19. RPA measurements and PFS could be useful in quantitative and qualitative evaluation of COVID-19 associated renal impairment on admission.","Huang, Qiang; Li, Jian; Lyu, Shuangzhi; Liang, Wenjie; Yang, Rong; Zhang, Rui; Xiao, Wenbo; Liu, Jinpeng; Yan, Senxiang; Zheng, Liangrong; Chen, Feng",Eur J Radiol,,59

374360,Verbena officinalis (Common Vervain) - A Review on the Investigations of This Medicinally Important Plant Species,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for the cause of global pandemic Covid-19 and to date, there is no effective treatment available. The spike 'S' protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 of the host cell are being targeted to design new drugs to control Covid-19. Similarly, a transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2 of the host cell plays a significant role in the proteolytic cleavage of viral 'S' protein helpful for the priming of ACE2 receptors and viral entry into human cells. However, three-dimensional structural information and the inhibition mechanism of TMPRSS2 is yet to be explored experimentally. Hence, we have used a molecular dynamics (MD) simulated homology model of TMPRSS2 to study the inhibition mechanism of experimentally known inhibitors Camostat mesylate, Nafamostat and Bromhexine hydrochloride (BHH) using molecular modeling techniques. Prior to docking, all three inhibitors were geometry optimized by semi-empirical quantum chemical RM1 method. Molecular docking analysis revealed that Camostat mesylate and its structural analogue Nafamostat interact strongly with residues His296 and Ser441 present in the catalytic triad of TMPRSS2, whereas BHH binds with Ala386 along with other residues. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations revealed the stable behavior of all the docked complexes. MM-PBSA calculations also revealed the stronger binding of Camostat mesylate to TMPRSS2 active site residues as compared to Nafamostat and BHH. Thus, this structural information could be useful to understand the mechanistic approach of TMPRSS2 inhibition, which may be helpful to design new lead compounds to prevent the entry of SARS-Coronavirus 2 in human cells.","Sonawane, Kailas D; Barale, Sagar S; Dhanavade, Maruti J; Waghmare, Shailesh R; Nadaf, Naiem H; Kamble, Subodh A; Mohammed, Ali Abdulmawjood; Makandar, Asiya M; Fandilolu, Prayagraj M; Dound, Ambika S; Naik, Nitin M; More, Vikramsinh B",Inform Med Unlocked,,59
374470,Next-Generation COVID-19 Vaccines Should Take Efficiency of Distribution into Consideration,2021,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1-4. Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5-7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor-angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)-as SARS-CoV.","Zhou, Peng; Yang, Xing-Lou; Wang, Xian-Guang; Hu, Ben; Zhang, Lei; Zhang, Wei; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Li, Bei; Huang, Chao-Lin; Chen, Hui-Dong; Chen, Jing; Luo, Yun; Guo, Hua; Jiang, Ren-Di; Liu, Mei-Qin; Chen, Ying; Shen, Xu-Rui; Wang, Xi; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Zhao, Kai; Chen, Quan-Jiao; Deng, Fei; Liu, Lin-Lin; Yan, Bing; Zhan, Fa-Xian; Wang, Yan-Yi; Xiao, Geng-Fu; Shi, Zheng-Li",Nature,,59

There is paucity of data on this in India. Aims: To study the effectiveness of home-based PR on lung function, health-related quality of life, exercise tolerance and dyspnea among patients with COPD. Setting: The Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Christian Medical College, Vellore. Subjects and Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study which included COPD patients who found hospital-based PR impractical. Those willing for home-based PR constituted the intervention group and those unwilling, constituted the control group. Both groups received standard of care otherwise. At 6 weeks, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), six-minute walk test distance (6MWD), COPD assessment test (CAT) score and modified Borg dyspnea scale were compared with their baseline values. Statistical Analysis: Student paired t-test. Results: A total of 42 patients completed the study, 21 in each arm. The baseline characteristics were comparable. The improvement in FEV1 was 90 ml in the intervention group and 4 ml in the control group (P = 0.01). There was no significant difference in 6MWD change. SGRQ score, Borg scale and CAT score improved significantly by 10.4, 2.4, and 3.4, respectively, in the intervention group when compared to the control group (P = 0.01). Conclusions: Home-based PR effectively provides tangible benefits in FEV1, QOL, exercise tolerance and dyspnea. It should be offered to those who are unable to avail institution-based PR, especially in this era of COVID pandemic.","Priya, N.; Isaac, B. T. J.; Thangakunam, B.; Christopher, D. J.",Lung India,,59

375858,Sick While Black: An Unhealthy Combination,2020,"AIM: To examine changes in smoking, drinking and quitting/reduction behaviour following the COVID-19 lockdown in England. DESIGN/SETTING: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019-February 2020) versus after (April 2020) lockdown. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 558 adults (&#8805; 16 years). MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown (before versus after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking, past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers), past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers) and use of evidence-based (e.g. prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support [telephone support/websites/applications (apps)] for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). FINDINGS: The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence [17.0% (after) versus 15.9% (before), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24], but was associated with increases in quit attempts [39.6 versus 29.1%, adjusted odds ratio (ORadj ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23-1.98], quit success (21.3 versus 13.9%, ORadj = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.33) and cessation (8.8 versus 4.1%, ORadj = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.69-4.09) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0 versus 51.5%, ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.72-1.68) but use of remote support increased (10.9 versus 2.7%, ORadj = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.56-8.23). Lockdown was associated with increases in high-risk drinking (38.3 versus 25.1%, OR = 1.85, CI = 1.67-2.06), but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5 versus 15.3%, ORadj = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.77-2.64). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2 versus 4.0%, ORadj = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.05-0.97) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9 versus 6.1%, ORadj = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.64-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: Following the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, smokers and high-risk drinkers in England were more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce alcohol consumption and rates of smoking cessation and use of remote cessation support were higher. However, high-risk drinking prevalence increased post-lockdown and use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers decreased with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","Jackson, Sarah E; Garnett, Claire; Shahab, Lion; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie",Addiction,,59

This report presents the discordant results of two widely used RT-PCR kits in Indonesia due to different CT-value cut-offs and highlights its potential consequence in SARS-CoV-2 containment. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swab samples with SARS-CoV-2 negative with a RT-PCR kit (manufacture pre-set CT-value cut-off was 35 amplification cycles) were retested with another RT-PCR kit with a higher pre-set CT-value of 40 amplification cycles. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer protocols. Results: In total, 30 samples with SARS-CoV-2 negative for the first kit were retested. We found that 25 out of 33 samples (75.5%) were positive using the second RT-PCR kit that had a higher manufacture pre-set CT-value cut-off. In addition, among 500 RT-PCR tests using the first RT-PCR kit, 103 of them (20.6%) were categorized as inconclusive results based on the second manufacturer' guideline. Discussion and conclusion: Our data suggest the possibility of discordant results of SARS-CoV-2 detection due to different pre-set cut-offs by the companies. As consequence, this could leave a fraction of individuals who were misclassified that could act as source of virus transmission within community.","Pranata, A; Zulkifli, B; Santosa, S F; Oktiviyari, A; Zulfitri, Z; Hayati, Z; Mudatsir, M; Ichsan, I; Harapan, H",Vacunas (Madrid),,59

378134,Machine learning based predictors for COVID-19 disease severity,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite concerns that patients with liver transplants might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 because of coexisting comorbidities and use of immunosuppressants, the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on this patient group remains unclear. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes in these patients. METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, we collected data on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were older than 18 years, who had previously received a liver transplant, and for whom data had been submitted by clinicians to one of two international registries (COVID-Hep and SECURE-Cirrhosis) at the end of the patient's disease course. Patients without a known hospitalisation status or mortality outcome were excluded. For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. We compared the cohorts with regard to several outcomes (including death, hospitalisation, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, requirement for intensive care, and need for invasive ventilation). A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death. FINDINGS: Between March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47-66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44-84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0·106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p=0·837). However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p<0·0001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p<0·0001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p=0·046). In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1·4% [95% CI -7·7 to 10·4]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1·06 [95% CI 1·01 to 1·11] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1·57 [1·05 to 2·36] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18·30 [1·96 to 170·75]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients. INTERPRETATION: Liver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were. Factors other than transplantation should be preferentially considered in relation to physical distancing and provision of medical care for patients with liver transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Data from 49 consecutive cases in 8 countries (cohort A) and 20 hospitalised patients with TB and COVID-19 (cohort B) were analysed and patients who died were described. Demographic and clinical variables were retrospectively collected, including co-morbidities and risk factors for TB and COVID-19 mortality. Overall, 8 out of 69 (11.6%) patients died, 7 from cohort A (14.3%) and one from cohort B (5%). Out of 69 patients 43 were migrants, 26/49 (53.1%) in cohort A and 17/20 (85.0%) in cohort B. Migrants: (1) were younger than natives; in cohort A the median (IQR) age was 40 (27-49) VS. 66 (46-70) years, whereas in cohort B 37 (27-46) VS. 48 (47-60) years; (2) had a lower mortality rate than natives (1/43, 2.3% versus 7/26, 26.9%; p-value: 0.002); (3) had fewer co-morbidities than natives (23/43, 53.5% versus 5/26-19.2%) natives; p-value: 0.005). The study findings show that: (1) mortality is likely to occur in elderly patients with co-morbidities; (2) TB might not be a major determinant of mortality and (3) migrants had lower mortality, probably because of their younger age and lower number of co-morbidities. However, in settings where advanced forms of TB frequently occur and are caused by drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, higher mortality rates can be expected in young individuals.","Motta, I; Centis, R; D039,; Ambrosio, L; García-García, J-M; Goletti, D; Gualano, G; Lipani, F; Palmieri, F; Sánchez-Montalvá, A; Pontali, E; Sotgiu, G; Spanevello, A; Stochino, C; Tabernero, E; Tadolini, M; van den Boom, M; Villa, S; Visca, D; Migliori, G B",Pulmonology,,59

Of those, 198 from March to April 2018, 220 from March till April 2019 and 123 in the COVID-19 era from March to April 2020. The primary endpoint occurred in 39 over 541 patients. In COVID-19 era, we reported a lower rate of global SSIs (3.3% vs. 8.4%; p 0.035), few patients developed a superficial SSIs (0.8% vs. 3.4%; p 0.018) and none experienced deep SSIs (0% vs. 3.4%; p 0.025). Comparing the previous two ""COVID-19-free"" years, no significative differences were reported. At multivariate analysis, the measures to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 spread (OR 0.368; p 0.05) were independently associated with the reduction for total, superficial and deep SSIs. Moreover, the presence of drains (OR 4.99; p 0.009) and a Type III-IV of SWC (OR 1.8; p 0.001) demonstrated a worse effect regarding the primary endpoint. Furthermore, the presence of the drain was not associated with an increased risk of superficial and deep SSIs. In this study, we provided important insights into the superficial and deep SSIs risk assessment for patients who underwent surgery. Simple and easily viable precautions such as wearing surgical masks and the restriction of visitors emerged as promising tools for the reduction of SSIs risk.","Losurdo, Pasquale; Paiano, Lucia; Samardzic, Natasa; Germani, Paola; Bernardi, Laura; Borelli, Massimo; Pozzetto, Barbara; de Manzini, Nicolò; Bortul, Marina",Updates Surg,,59

382311,Geographically varying relationships of COVID-19 mortality with different factors in India,2021,"PURPOSE: To investigate bacterial dispersion with patient face mask use during simulated intravitreal injections. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study METHODSSETTING: Single-center STUDY POPULATION: Fifteen healthy subjects were recruited INTERVENTION: Each participant was instructed not to speak for 2-minutes, simulating a ""no-talking"" policy, while in an ophthalmic examination chair with an blood agar plate secured to the forehead and wearing various face masks (no mask, loose fitting surgical mask, tight-fitting surgical mask without tape, tight-fitting surgical mask with adhesive tape securing the superior portion of the mask, N95 mask, and cloth mask). Each scenario was then repeated while reading a 2-minute script, simulating a talking patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of colony-forming units (CFU) and microbial species. RESULTS: During the ""no-talking"" scenario, subjects wearing a tight-fitting surgical mask with tape developed fewer CFUs compared to subjects wearing the same mask without tape (difference, 0.93CFU; 95%CI, 0.32-1.55; P=.003). During the speech scenarios, subjects wearing a tight-fitting surgical mask with tape had significantly fewer CFUs compared to subjects without a face mask (difference, 1.07CFU; P=.001), subjects with a loose face mask (difference, 0.67; P=.034), and subjects with a tight face mask without tape (difference, 1.13; P<.001). There was no difference between those with a tight-fitting surgical mask with tape and an N95 mask in the ""no-talking"" (P>.99) and ""speech"" (P=.831) scenarios. No oral flora was isolated in ""no-talking"" scenarios, but was isolated in 8/75 (11%) cultures in speech scenarios (P=.02). CONCLUSION: Addition of tape to the superior portion of a patient's face mask reduced bacterial dispersion during simulated intravitreal injections, and had no difference in bacterial dispersion compared to wearing N95 masks.","Patel, Samir N; Mahmoudzadeh, Raziyeh; Salabati, Mirataollah; Soares, Rebecca R; Hinkle, John; Hsu, Jason; Garg, Sunir J; Regillo, Carl D; Ho, Allen C; Cohen, Michael N; Khan, M Ali; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro; Chiang, Allen; Gupta, Omesh P; Kuriyan, Ajay E",Am J Ophthalmol,,59
382342,Beyond recruitment: good participatory practice enhances the impact of research in a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to appraise a recently developed preparedness model for the provision of oral health care during a threat such as the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of oral health care providers, administrators/staff, and patients. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative inquiry via at-a-distance semi-structured interviews and group discussions engaged a purposefully selected sample of oral health care workers and patients in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Participants were asked to appraise a preparedness model by considering how to prepare for oral care during a pandemic, while answering open-ended questions about the model content and visual presentation. Interviews and group discussions occurred between April 2020 and January 2021, were audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. An inductive coding process was used to identify themes, subthemes, and categories of information until saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Seventy-four participants, including 19 dentists, 15 dental hygienists, 10 certified dental assistants, 9 administrators, and 21 patients, suggested modifications to the recently developed preparedness model. Individual interviews (41 participants) and group discussions (33 participants in groups ranging from 2 to 9 attendees each) lasted for an average of 53 min. Eighty-four hours of audio recordings led to more than 1110 single-spaced pages of transcripts. The thematic analysis identified 82 codes, 12 categories, and four main themes: life-long learning, critical thinking, personal and professional risk, and patient-centred care. These themes were understood within provider characteristics and social and environmental contexts. Participants highlighted the need for the model to focus on information and communication, developing awareness and understanding, inferring risks, and performing oral health care during a threat such as a pandemic or disease outbreak. A modified portrayal of the model was suggested to better represent participants' perspectives. CONCLUSION: A recently developed preparedness model for the provision of dental care during an unfolding threat like the COVID-19 pandemic was appraised and modified by oral health care workers. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the modified model for use in the event of another unfolding threat collaboratively with providers, patients and stakeholders.","Brondani, Mario; Donnelly, Leeann",BMC Oral Health,,59

385107,Inter-cluster Transmission Control Using Graph Modal Barriers,2020-10-09,"Background: Vulnerability to COVID-19 hospitalization has been linked to behavioral risk factors, including combustible psychoactive substance use (e.g., tobacco smoking). Paralleling the COVID-19 crisis have been increasingly permissive laws for recreational cannabis use. Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is a psychiatric disorder that is heritable and genetically correlated with respiratory disease, independent of tobacco smoking. We examined the genetic relationship between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization. Methods: We estimated the genetic correlation between CUD (n case=14,080, n control=343,726) and COVID-19 hospitalization (n case=9,373, n control=1,197,256) using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Using independent GWASs conducted prior to the pandemic, we controlled for several covariates (i.e., tobacco use phenotypes, problematic alcohol use, BMI, fasting glucose, forced expiration volume, education attainment, risk-taking, ADHD, and Townsend Deprivation Index; as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes) using genomic structural equation modeling. Genetic causality between CUD and COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated using latent causal variable models. Results: Genetic vulnerability to COVID-19 was correlated with genetic liability to CUD (rG=0.423(.0965), p=1.33e-6); this association remained when accounting for genetic liability to related risk factors and covariates (b = 0.381 - 0.539, p=0.012 - 0.049). Latent causal variable analysis revealed causal effect estimates that were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Problematic cannabis use and vulnerability to serious COVID-19 complications share genetic underpinnings that are unique from common correlates. While CUD may plausibly contribute to severe COVID-19 presentations, causal inference models yielded no evidence of putative causation. Curbing excessive cannabis use may mitigate COVID-19's impact.","Hatoum, Alexander S; Morrison, Claire L; Colbert, Sarah M C; Winiger, Evan A; Johnson, Emma C; Agrawal, Arpana; Bogdan, Ryan",,,59

Compari-son of genome sequences from diverse locations allows us to identify the genetic diversity among viruses which would help in ascertaining viral virulence, dis-ease pathogenicity, origin and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 between countries. The aim of this study is to determine the genetic diversity among Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Initial examination of the phylogenetic data of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n = 3123) from differ-ent continents deposited at GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) revealed multiple origin for Indian isolates. An in-depth analysis of 558 viral genomes derived from samples representing countries from USA, Europe, China, East Asia, South Asia, Oceania, Middle East regions and India revealed that most Indian samples are divided into two clus-ters. A1 sub-cluster showed more similarity to Ocean-ia and Kuwait samples, while A2 sub-cluster grouped with South Asian samples. In contrast, cluster B grouped with countries from Europe, Middle East and South Asia. Viral clade analysis of Indian samples re-vealed a high occurrence of G clade (D614G in spike protein; 37%), which is a European clade, followed by I clade (V378I in ORF1ab; 12%), which is an Oceania clade with samples having Iran connections. While A1 cluster is enriched with I clade, the cluster B is en-riched with G clade type. Thus our study identifies that the Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses are enriched with G and I clades in addition to 50% samples with unknown genetic variations. The potential origin to be countries mainly from Europe, Middle East Oceania and South Asia regions, which strongly imply the spread of virus through most travelled countries. The study also emphasizes the importance of pathogen genomics through phylogenetic analysis to discover vi-ral genetic diversity and understand the viral trans-mission dynamics with eventual grasp on viral virulence and disease pathogenesis.","Mondal, Mainak; Lawarde, Ankita; Somasundaram, Kumaravel",Curr.

391085,Factors influencing the filtration performance of homemade face masks,2021,"In December 2019, a new human coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. Spreading globally, it is now considered pandemic, with approximately 3 million cases worldwide at the end of April. Its symptoms include fever, cough, and headache, but the main one is shortness of breath. In turn, it is believed that there is a relationship between COVID-19 and damage to the heart muscle, and hypertensive and diabetic patients, for example, seem to have worse prognosis. Therefore, COVID-19 may worsen in individuals with underlying adverse conditions, and a not negligible number of patients hospitalized with this virus had cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. Systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression may be behind this association. In addition, the virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors, more precisely ACE2, to penetrate the cell; therefore, the use of ACE inhibitor drugs and angiotensin receptor blockers could cause an increase in these receptors, thus facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell. There is, however, no scientific evidence to support the interruption of these drugs. Since they are fundamental for certain chronic diseases, the risk and benefit of their withdrawal in this scenario should be carefully weighed. Finally, cardiologists and health professionals should be aware of the risks of infection and protect themselves as much as possible, sleeping properly and avoiding long working hours.","Ferrari, Filipe",Arq Bras Cardiol,,59

The model attempts to show the complex interactions between output levels and social distancing, developing cycle paths for both variables. Ultimately, however, defying gravity via prolonged social distancing shows that a lower growth path is inevitable as a result.","Garcia, Alfredo D.; Hartwell, Christopher A.; Szybisz, Mart'in Andr'es",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09361v1.pdf,59

However, given the life-threatening adverse effects of HCQ that have been reported, its use as a prophylactic treatment remains debated. HCQ has long been used in India for the treatment of malaria, auto-immune and inflammatory diseases, and even type 2 diabetes mellitus recently. We aimed to review existing literature and relevant Web sites regarding the safety profile of HCQ in the Indian subcontinent. A non-systematic critical analysis of all published literature/studies focused on the Indian population, recording on the use of HCQ for various indications up till April 2020 was done and frequency of occurrence of HCQ related life-threatening and cardiac side effects were noted. Results from PubMed database showed an incidence of 0.6% of cardiac-related side effects and 7.42% of other self-limiting and minor side effects among the Indian population on HCQ. Considering its minimal risk and favorable safety profile, cost-effectiveness, availability, and affordability in India, the use of hydroxychloroquine in the fight against COVID-19 appears rationale. Following the results of our study, we hypothesize that Indians might be less likely to suffer from cardiac-related side effects given their genetic make-up. However, this would need further studies, clinical trials, and a pharmacogenomic understanding of the subject.","Thangaraju, Pugazhenthan; Venkatesan, Nanditha; Venkatesan, Sajitha; Gurunthalingam, Meenalotchini Prakash; Thangaraju, Eswaran",SN Compr Clin Med,,59

However, detailed information on the characteristics of COVID-19 in children is still scarce. Five patients with non-respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation were hospitalized from the emergency department, and were later confirmed to have COVID-19, between 23 January and 20 February 2020, at the Wuhan Children's Hospital. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was positive for all the patients. Four of the patients were male and one was female, and their ages ranged from 2-months to 5.6 years. All lived in Wuhan. One patient had a clear history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, one had a suspected history of exposure, while the others had no exposure history. For three of the five patients, the primary onset disease required an emergency operation or treatment, and included intussusception, acute suppurative appendicitis perforation with local peritonitis, and traumatic subdural hemorrhage with convulsion, while for the other two it was acute gastroenteritis (including one patient with hydronephrosis and a stone in his left kidney). During the course of the disease, four of the five patients had a fever, whereas one case had no fever or cough. Two patients had leukopenia, and one also had lymphopenia. In the two cases of severe COVID-19, the levels of CRP, PCT, serum ferritin, IL-6, and IL-10 were significantly increased, whereas the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and CD16 + CD56 natural killer cells were decreased. We also found impaired liver, kidney, and myocardial functions; the presence of hypoproteinemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia; and, in one case, abnormal coagulation function. Except for one patient who had a rotavirus infection, all patients tested negative for common pathogens, including the influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella. Chest CT images of all the patients showed patches or ground-glass opacities in the lung periphery or near the pleura, even large consolidations.

394482,Cadaver versus Simulator Based Arthroscopic Training in Shoulder Surgery,2021,"BACKGROUND: Randomized trials are generally performed from a frequentist perspective, which can conflate absence of evidence with evidence of absence. The RECOVERY trial evaluated convalescent plasma for patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and concluded that there was no evidence of an effect. Re-analysis from a Bayesian perspective is warranted. METHODS: Outcome data were extracted from the RECOVERY trial by serostatus and time of presentation. A Bayesian re-analysis with a wide variety of priors (vague, optimistic, sceptical, and pessimistic) was performed, calculating the posterior probability for: any benefit, an absolute risk difference of 0.5% (small benefit, number needed to treat 200), and an absolute risk difference of one percentage point (modest benefit, number needed to treat 100). RESULTS: Across all patients, when analysed with a vague prior, the likelihood of any benefit or a modest benefit with convalescent plasma was estimated to be 64% and 18%, respectively. The estimated chance of any benefit was 95% if presenting within 7 days of symptoms, or 17% if presenting after this. In patients without a detectable antibody response at presentation, the chance of any benefit was 85%. However, it was only 20% in patients with a detectable antibody response at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian re-analysis suggests that convalescent plasma reduces mortality by at least one percentage point among the 39% of patients who present within 7 days of symptoms, and that there is a 67% chance of the same mortality reduction in the 38% who are seronegative at the time of presentation. This is in contrast to the results in people who already have antibodies when they present. This biologically plausible finding bears witness to the advantage of Bayesian analyses over misuse of hypothesis tests to inform decisions.","Hamilton, F W; Lee, Todd; Arnold, D T; Lilford, R; Hemming, K",Int J Infect Dis,,59

The previous study reported a higher severe status rate and mortality rate in male patients in China. However, the reason underlying this difference has not been reported. The convalescent plasma containing a high level of SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody has been used in clinical therapy and achieved good effects in China. In this study, to compare the differences of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody between male and female patients, a total number of 331 patients confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The serum of these patients was collected during hospitalization and detected for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Our data showed that the concentration of IgG antibody in mild, general, and recovering patients showed no difference between male and female patients. In severe status, compared with male patients, there were more female patients having a relatively high concentration of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. In addition, the generation of IgG antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in disease early phase. Our study identified a discrepancy in the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody level in male and female patients, which may be a potential cause leading to a different outcome of Coronavirus Disease 2019 between sex.","Zeng, Fanfan; Dai, Chan; Cai, Pengcheng; Wang, Jinbiao; Xu, Lei; Li, Jianyu; Hu, Guoyun; Wang, Zheng; Zheng, Fang; Wang, Lin",J. med. virol,,59

397974,Face masks,2020,"With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to social media to read and to share timely information including statistics, warnings, advice, and inspirational stories. Unfortunately, alongside all this useful information, there was also a new blending of medical and political misinformation and disinformation, which gave rise to the first global infodemic. While fighting this infodemic is typically thought of in terms of factuality, the problem is much broader as malicious content includes not only fake news, rumors, and conspiracy theories, but also promotion of fake cures, panic, racism, xenophobia, and mistrust in the authorities, among others. This is a complex problem that needs a holistic approach combining the perspectives of journalists, fact-checkers, policymakers, government entities, social media platforms, and society as a whole. Taking them into account we define an annotation schema and detailed annotation instructions, which reflect these perspectives. We performed initial annotations using this schema, and our initial experiments demonstrated sizable improvements over the baselines. Now, we issue a call to arms to the research community and beyond to join the fight by supporting our crowdsourcing annotation efforts.","Alam, Firoj; Dalvi, Fahim; Shaar, Shaden; Durrani, Nadir; Mubarak, Hamdy; Nikolov, Alex; Martino, Giovanni Da San; Abdelali, Ahmed; Sajjad, Hassan; Darwish, Kareem; Nakov, Preslav",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07996v1.pdf,59

Here, we investigated the potential of platelets to modulate CD133+BMSC homing to hepatic endothelial cells and sequestration to warm ischemic livers. Modulatory effects of platelets on the adhesion of CD133+BMSC to human and mouse liver-sinusoidal- and micro- endothelial cells (EC) respectively were evaluated in in vitro co-culture systems. CD133+BMSC adhesion to all types of EC were increased in the presence of platelets under shear stress. This platelet effect was mostly diminished by antagonization of P-selectin and its ligand P-Selectin-Glyco-Ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Inhibition of PECAM-1 as well as SDF-1 receptor CXCR4 had no such effect. In a model of the isolated reperfused rat liver subsequent to warm ischemia, the co-infusion of platelets augmented CD133+BMSC homing to the injured liver with heightened transmigration towards the extra sinusoidal space when compared to perfusion conditions without platelets. Extravascular co-localization of CD133+BMSC with hepatocytes was confirmed by confocal microscopy. We demonstrated an enhancing effect of platelets on CD133+BMSC homing to and transmigrating along hepatic EC putatively depending on PSGL-1 and P-selectin. Our insights suggest a new mechanism of platelets to augment stem cell dependent hepatic repair.","Lehwald, Nadja; Duhme, Constanze; Pinchuk, Iryna; Kirchner, Julian; Wieferich, Kristina; Schmelzle, Moritz; Jurk, Kerstin; Windmöller, Beatrice A; Hübner, Wolfgang; Homey, Bernhard; Bode, Johannes; Kubitz, Ralf; Benhidjeb, Tahar; Krüger, Martin; Robson, Simon C; Knoefel, Wolfram T; Kehrel, Beate E; Schulte Am Esch, Jan",,,59

We prepared a guiding protocol for treating early to moderate COVID-19 patients with plasma transfusion from convalescent COVID-19 patients. This protocol was deduced based on previously published reports and studies that evaluated and tested convalescent plasma as a prospective therapy for COVID-19 patients. The protocol covers instructions on patient and donor selection criteria, plasma harvesting, plasma product specifications, dosage and precautions for convalescent plasma collection and transfusion process. Altogether, we prepared a treatment protocol that is tailored to the context of Sudan to be adopted by Sudan's health authority.

Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in 30-45 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic sequence. RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from actual COVID-19 patients was also tested. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 in both simulated patient samples and clinical specimens. This test was performed in 30-45 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.","Lamb, Laura E; Bartolone, Sarah N; Ward, Elijah; Chancellor, Michael B",PLoS One,,59

While a terrible event, it can also be approached as offering a once-in-a-lifetime (hopefully) natural experiment. This is certainly true as far as the global pandemic applies to how and what we eat, given how it has radically altered many everyday food-related practices, whether due to supply chain failures or state-mandates (e.g., shelter-in-place orders). This paper is based on data collected pre- and post-outbreak, triangulating survey and qualitative data, in an attempt to further interrogate the concepts of ethical consumption and activism broadly defined, including the idea of consumer activism. With conceptual assistance from social practice theory, the paper interrogates certain long-standing questions in the literature, such as ethical consumption's link to other forms of political action. It also poses new ones, such as by disentangling the various ways individuals do (and do not do) ethical consumption. Finally, the data suggest tentative empirical and conceptual paths forward as we contemplate ethical consumption and social activism more generally in the shadow of COVID-19.","Carolan, Michael",Appetite,,59

Therefore, understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that underpin plant fertility under environmental constraints is critical to safeguarding future food production3. Here, we identified two Argonaute-like proteins whose activities are required to sustain male fertility in maize plants under high temperatures. We found that MALE-ASSOCIATED ARGONAUTE-1 and -2 associate with temperature-induced phased secondary small RNAs in pre-meiotic anthers and are essential to controlling the activity of retrotransposons in male meiocyte initials. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed how male-associated Argonaute activity and its interaction with retrotransposon RNA targets is modulated through the dynamic phosphorylation of a set of highly conserved, surface-located serine residues. Our results demonstrate that an Argonaute-dependent, RNA-guided surveillance mechanism is critical in plants to sustain male fertility under environmentally constrained conditions, by controlling the mutagenic activity of transposons in male germ cells.","Lee, Yang-Seok; Maple, Robert; Dürr, Julius; Dawson, Alexander; Tamim, Saleh; Del Genio, Charo; Papareddy, Ranjith; Luo, Anding; Lamb, Jonathan C; Amantia, Stefano; Sylvester, Anne W; Birchler, James A; Meyers, Blake C; Nodine, Michael D; Rouster, Jacques; Gutierrez-Marcos, Jose",Nat Plants,,59

On February 2, 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that the public health emergency justified the development and emergency use of ""in vitro diagnostics for the detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19"" by activating the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Unfortunately, effective mitigation efforts were thwarted early in the outbreak resulting in an expansion of the initial EUA on February 29, 2020, to improve accessibility to in vitro diagnostic testing. Expectantly, the development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing including RT-PCR expanded rapidly in the weeks following the EUA expansion. These newly developed and approved SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests boast impressive positive and negative agreement rates nearing 100%. Despite the exceptionally high rates of agreement, caution is advised as the RT-PCR tests approved under the COVID-19 EUA are in vitro analyses developed with samples artificially doped with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These tests therefore do not have clinically applicable sensitivity and specificity because they lack a ""gold standard"" for diagnosis. Here we present three challenging cases requiring cautious interpretation of the newest generation of RT-PCR molecular detection assays, highlighting the major challenges faced by providers treating patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Joyce, Nicole Seim Lynsey Smerina Michael",Case Reports in Medicine,,59

Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay, which is used in >30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRp-P2-negative specimens (119/273 [43.6%] versus 77/273 [28.2%]; P < 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21 × 104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21 × 102 to 4.71 × 105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture.

The second wave spreading worldwide has devastating consequences in every sector of life. Several measures to contain and curb its infection have forged significant challenges for the education community. With an estimated 1.6 billion learners, the closure of schools and other educational institutions has impacted more than 90% of students worldwide from the elementary to tertiary level. Methods: In a view to studying impacts on student’s fraternity, this article aims at addressing alternative ways of educating—more specifically, online education—through the analysis of Google trends for the past year. The study analyzed the platforms of online teaching and learning systems that have been enabling remote learning, thereby limiting the impact on the education system. Thorough text analysis is performed on an existing dataset from Kaggle to retrieve insight on the clustering of words that are more often looked at during this pandemic to find the general patterns of their occurrence. Findings: The results show that the coronavirus patients are the most trending patterns in word search clustering, with the education system being at the control and preventive measures to bring equilibrium in the system of education. There has been significant growth in online platforms in the last year. Existing assets of educational establishments have effectively converted conventional education into new-age online education with the help of virtual classes and other key online tools in this continually fluctuating scholastic setting. The effective usage of teaching tools such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and WebEx are the most used online platforms for the conduction of classes, and whiteboard software tools and learning apps such as Vedantu, Udemy, Byju’s, and Whitehat Junior have been big market players in the education system over the pandemic year, especially in India. Conclusions: The article helps to draw a holistic approach of ongoing online teaching-learning methods during the lockdown and also highlights changes that took place in the conventional education system amid the COVID pandemic to overcome the persisting disruption in academic activities and to ensure correct perception towards the online procedure as a normal course of action in the new educational system. To fill in the void of classroom learning and to minimize the virus spread over the last year, digital learning in various schools and colleges has been emphasized, leading to a significant increase in the usage of whiteboard software platforms.","Kansal, Ashwani Kumar Gautam Jyoti Chintalapudi Nalini Jain Shivani Battineni Gopi",Infectious Disease Reports,,59

However, their successful use in China, South Korea and the Czech Republic has encouraged their widespread use, and the shortage that already existed. This has caused that companies and individuals are looking at the best way to reuse them, and to manufacture, homemade or not, of non-certified masks. This paper is based on two objectives: to consult the scientific literature to identify the main strategies for disinfecting them, and to determine the effectiveness of non-certified disposable masks. A rapid review has been conducted in which the main publications and other information available online have been analyzed. Results showed that the most promising methods are those that use hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet radiation, moist heat, dry heat and ozone gas. Soapy water, alcohol, bleach immersion, ethylene oxide, ionizing radiation, microwave, high temperature, autoclave or steam are not fully recommended. Regarding the effectiveness of surgical masks compared to PPE, the former have been seen to be slightly less effective than PPE.

This ‘invisible stranger’ interrupting our daily lives is highlighting in a new and acute way the vulnerability of the human race. Life as we knew it is being changed forever. COVID-19 also exposed the injustices embedded in social structures all over the world. What will life with and after COVID-19 look like in South Africa? The pandemic reveals that South Africa is not the fair and just society we hoped for since the transition to a democratic country in 1994. In light of this, we should be preparing ourselves for the new ‘abnormal’ as what seemed normal was problematic and therefore, truly abnormal. Seeking guidance from evolutionary anthropology, this article will explore whether the evolutionary story of Homo sapiens might offer us insights on how to successfully navigate the multiple challenges COVID-19 unmasks and also brings forth. A discussion on the evolutionary history of homo sapiens within the context of niche construction theory reveals that our unique capacity for imagination and creative collaboration made us successful as a species.

412300,Reaction to Letter from Zhang et al,2020,"A major assumption for both leadership researchers and practitioners is that the relationship between leaders and followers is the pivotal concern for leadership Viewing leadership through the lens of responsibility, however, changes the pivotal relationship substantially The principal relationship concern becomes the relationship between leaders and their stakeholders To better understand this relationship the article seeks to explore the question: Leadership for what purpose? The article offers an initial answer to this question by looking at the responsibilities of those who lead in the corporate world In particular, we argue that leaders need to give primary attention to what they seek to achieve, why, for whom, and where In this way the article seeks to (re)centre the concerns of leadership scholarship to address the challenges and responsibilities of those who seek to lead The article offers an inter-disciplinary theory rooted in an inter-complementary perspective on capitalism, purpose and responsibility that enables organizational leaders to understand how the fiduciary duty of generating value for shareholders can be aligned with other stakeholder interests including employees, communities, societies, the environment and indeed humanity This theory we describe as the ‘The theory of Good Dividends’ MAD statement: This article seeks to Make a Difference (MAD) through challenging how we consider leadership in order to address the perfect storm of societal challenges that threaten humanity In the recent past, our most pressing challenge was Climate Change;but this has been overshadowed by Covid 19 And this too will be overshadowed by other more compelling challenges Corporate leadership has the power and influence to address and tackle these challenges The article argues that leadership scholars need to fundamentally shift our focus away from the leader-follower relationship that has traditionally dominated our field of inquiry to the leader-stakeholder relationship © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Kempster, S.; Jackson, B.",Journal of Change Management,,59
412383,Use of the Internet to Facilitate an Annual Scientific Meeting: A Report of the First Virtual Chest Wall Injury Society Summit,2020,"We consider how the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged European small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the manufacturing sector, and draw suggests policy implications. The sudden onslaught of the pandemic has acted as an economic shock, and we consider how it is likely to affect different types of manufacturing SMEs. We distinguish between immediate effects, a result of the almost-simultaneous lockdowns across Europe and its major trading partners, and longer-term implications for both SMEs and the global value chains where they are inserted. In the shorter run, most SMEs have faced logistical challenges in addition to demand disruptions, although the severity has differed across firms and industries. We argue that in the longer-term, there will be different challenges and opportunities depending on the type of SME. Policy interventions will also need to be sensitive to the different types of SMEs, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. The policy mix will need to shift from its initial focus on the survival of European SMEs in the short term, towards a more structural and longer-term approach based on promoting their renewal and growth through innovation, internationalization and networking.","Juergensen, Jill; Guimón, José; Narula, Rajneesh",J.

413675,Can virtual clinics streamline urology referrals from primary to secondary care?,2021,"As one of the most common forms of cancer, lung cancers present as a collection of different histological subtypes. These subtypes are characterized by distinct sets of driver mutations and phenotypic appearance, and they often show varying degrees of heterogenicity, aggressiveness, and response/resistance to therapy. Intriguingly, lung cancers are also capable of showing features of multiple subtypes or converting from one subtype to another. The intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of lung cancers as well as incidences of subtype transdifferentiation raise the question of to what extent the tumor characteristics are dictated by the cell of origin rather than the acquired driver lesions. We provide here an overview of the studies in experimental mouse models that try to address this question. These studies convincingly show that both the cell of origin and the genetic driver lesions play a critical role in shaping the phenotypes of lung tumors. However, they also illustrate that there is far from a direct one-to-one relationship between the cell of origin and the cancer subtype, as most epithelial cells can be reprogrammed toward diverse lung cancer fates when exposed to the appropriate set of driver mutations.","Ferone, Giustina; Lee, Myung Chang; Sage, Julien; Berns, Anton",Genes Dev,,59

A live-attenuated and killed vaccine is currently immunized to control IBV infection; however, repeated outbreaks occur in both unvaccinated and vaccinated birds due to the choice of inadequate vaccine candidates and continuous emergence of novel infectious bronchitis (IB) variants and failure of vaccination. However, similar clinical signs were shown in different respiratory diseases that are essential to improving the diagnostic assay to detect IBV infections. Various risk factors involved in the failure of IB vaccination, such as various routes of application of vaccination, the interval between vaccinations, and challenge with various possible immunosuppression of birds are reviewed. The review article also highlights and updates factors affecting the diagnosis of IBV disease in the poultry industry with differential diagnosis to find the nature of infections compared with non-IBV diseases. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the common reasons for failed IBV vaccinations with preventive action, and proper diagnostic facilities for identifying the infective stage, leading to earlier control and reduced economic losses from IBV disease.","Bhuiyan, Md Safiul Alam; Amin, Zarina; Bakar, Ag Muhammad Sagaf Abu; Saallah, Suryani; Yusuf, Noor Hydayaty Md; Shaarani, Sharifudin Md; Siddiquee, Shafiquzzaman",,,59

414815,"Moving From Just ""Thinking Outside the Box"" to Doing",2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic represents an unprecedented traumatic stressor to mental health. Psychological distress is considered a reliable proxy for psychopathology and can be negatively influenced by childhood trauma through sensitization effects. Emotion dysregulation has been proposed as a potential mediator of this mechanism. We aimed to test this hypothesis in a national Italian sample assessed in the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between psychological distress and childhood trauma in 500 healthy participants assessed through a survey-based study, after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic lockdown in Italy. Levels of psychological distress and history of childhood trauma were obtained using the Kessler-10 (K10) and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, respectively. We used bootstrapped mediation analysis to test the mediator role of emotional dysregulation, measured through the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, on the effect of childhood trauma on psychological distress. RESULTS: In total, 190 (38%) reported psychological distress related to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Individuals with psychological distress experienced more childhood trauma, specifically emotional abuse (F = 23.51, df = 1, p < 0.001) and neglect (F = 10.98, df = 1, p = 0.001). After modelling the effect of emotional dysregulation, the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress resulted in indirect effects and mediated by deficits in emotion regulation mechanisms (bootstrapped lower level of confidence interval = 0.345, upper level of confidence interval = 0.598). CONCLUSION: Childhood trauma is associated with increased vulnerability to the stressful effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Our data suggest that emotional dysregulation may represent a dimension mediating the impact of childhood trauma on coronavirus disease 2019-related psychological distress and may be considered as specific target for interventions aiming at empowering resilience.","Janiri, Delfina; Moccia, Lorenzo; Dattoli, Luigi; Pepe, Maria; Molinaro, Marzia; De Martin, Valentina; Chieffo, Daniela; Di Nicola, Marco; Fiorillo, Andrea; Janiri, Luigi; Sani, Gabriele",Aust N Z J Psychiatry,,59

Given these parameters, we determine whether there will be a pandemic outbreak and if yes, we calculate the size of the giant--connected-component of the graph, thereby, determining the fraction of the population of each type that would contract the disease before it ends. We show that the disease spread has a natural evolution direction given by the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of a matrix whose entries encode the average number of individuals of one type expected to be infected by an individual of another type. The corresponding eigenvalue is the basic reproduction number of the pandemic. We perform numerical simulations that compare homogeneous and heterogeneous disease spread graphs and quantify the difference between the pandemics. We elaborate on the difference between herd immunity and the end of the pandemics and the effect of countermeasures on the fraction of infected population.","Minzer, Dor; Oz, Yaron; Safra, Muli; Wainstain, Lior",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05354v1.pdf,59

417569,Surveillance and Safety,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses several challenges to the management of patients with leukemia. The biology of each leukemia and its corresponding treatment with conventional intensive chemotherapy, with or without targeted therapies (venetoclax, FLT3 inhibitors, IDH1/2 inhibitors, Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors), introduce additional layers of complexity during COVID-19 high-risk periods. The knowledge about COVID-19 is accumulating rapidly. An important distinction is the prevalence of ""exposure"" versus ""clinical infectivity,"" which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia. At present, the rate of clinical infection is <1-2% worldwide. With a mortality rate of 1-5% in CO-VID-19 patients in the general population and potentially of >30% in patients with cancer, careful consideration should be given to the risk of COVID-19 in leukemia. Instead of reducing patient access to specialized cancer centers and modifying therapies to ones with unproven curative benefit, there is more rationale for less intensive, yet effective therapies that may require fewer clinic visits or hospitalizations. Here, we offer recommendations on the optimization of leukemia management during high-risk COVID-19 periods.","Paul, Shilpa; Rausch, Caitlin R; Jain, Nitin; Kadia, Tapan; Ravandi, Farhad; DiNardo, Courtney D; Welch, Mary Alma; Dabaja, Bouthaina S; Daver, Naval; Garcia-Manero, Guillermo; Wierda, William; Pemmaraju, Naveen; Montalban Bravo, Guillermo; Thompson, Philip; Verstovsek, Srdan; Konopleva, Marina; Kantarjian, Hagop; Jabbour, Elias",Acta Haematol,,59

This approach may be of even greater importance in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This concurrent mixed methods study included (1) interviews with patients and patient advocates and (2) a cross-sectional survey of women with breast cancer served by a charitable nonprofit organization. Questions evaluated interest in de-escalation trial participation, perceived barriers/facilitators to participation, and language describing de-escalation. RESULTS: Sixteen patient advocates and 24 patients were interviewed. Key barriers to de-escalation included fear of recurrence, worry about decision regret, lack of clinical trial interest, and dislike for focus on less treatment. Facilitators included trust in physician recommendation, toxicity avoidance, monitoring for progression, perception of good prognosis, and impact on daily life. Participants reported that the COVID-19 pandemic made them more likely to avoid chemotherapy if possible. Of 91 survey respondents, many (43%) patients would have been unwilling to participation in a de-escalation clinical trial. The most commonly reported barrier to participation was fear of recurrence (85%). Few patients (19%) considered clinical trials themselves as a barrier to de-escalation trial participation. The most popular terminology describing chemotherapy de-escalation was ""lowest effective chemotherapy dose"" (53%); no patients preferred the term ""de-escalation."" CONCLUSIONS: Fear of recurrence is a common concern among breast cancer survivors and patient advocates, contributing to resistance to de-escalation clinical trial participation.

SARS-CoV-2 shares homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement. OBJECTIVE: To review the neurological aspects of SARS-cov2 and other coronavirus, including transmission pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases. Reviewed evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: A total 67 studies were included in the final analysis of experimental studies, case reports, series of cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other human coronavirus infections. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor is expressed in the nervous system. Common reported symptoms included hyposmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have been associated with COVID-19. Infection through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb and dissemination through trans-synaptic transfer are some of the mechanisms proposed. Invasion of the medullary cardiorespiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent experimental models with neuro-invasion as a reasonable concern that SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen. How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clarified in future research.","Montalvan, V; Lee, J; Bueso, T; De Toledo, J; Rivas, K",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,59

Intending biological activities and SAR we propose replacements of fluorine, methyl and methoxy of synthetic compounds for noteworthy antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer and anti-tuberculosis activities. Among these compounds 3a, 4a and 5e were progressively strong against E. coli and K. pneumonia. Whereas, compounds 4a, 5a and 6a with addition of various functional groups (OCH3, CH3) were excellent against S. aureus and B. subtilis. Compound 5c exhibited strong RSA and dynamic ferrous ion (Fe2+) metal chelating impact with IC50 of 7.88 ± 0.93 and 4.06±0.31µg/mL, respectively. Compound 5e was considerably cytotoxic against all cancer cells displaying activity better than the standard drug. Compounds 6b and 6e inhibited M. tuberculosis (MIC 1.0 mg/L) considerably. Molecular docking studies indicate that compounds 4d, 5a, 5b, 6b and 6f exhibited good interactions with 6LZE (COVID-19) and 6XFN (SARS-CoV-2) at active sites.

Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spread rapidly all over the world, infecting all age groups with this novel virus. In this manuscript, we report characteristics of children with COVID-19 in Mazandaran province, northern Iran. Method. From 12 February to 28 July 2020, medical records of 100 children diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to the hospitals of Mazandaran province were collected. Patients' age, gender, clinical symptoms, and signs, in addition to therapeutic management and outcomes, were reported. Results. 57 (57%) boys and 43 girls with the mean age of 104.63 ± 79.14 months were evaluated. 20 patients (20%) were transferred to the PICU (pediatric intensive care unit), and 13 children experienced a severe form of the disease, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS). The mean duration of hospitalization was 5.3 ± 4.7 days. Fever (81%), respiratory (79%), gastrointestinal (47%), and neurologic complaints (29%) were experienced by the patients in addition to skin rash (14%). Sixty-two patients needed supplemental oxygen, and 6 of them underwent endotracheal intubation. Leukopenia was reported in 7, anemia in 24, and thrombocytopenia in 12 patients. 4 patients with underlying diseases including chronic renal failure, Down syndrome with cerebral palsy, and morbid obesity died. Conclusion. COVID-19 can cause symptoms in children in two stages. In the first week, upper and lower respiratory symptoms can occur which has lower severity and prevalence compared to adults. But after 2-3 weeks following infection, symptoms of MIS-C or multisystem involvement can occur and COVID-19 should be considered. The most common indication for admission is fever, rash, and respiratory problems.

Rapid and safe inactivation of specimens containing these viruses is fundamental to enable downstream processing for diagnostics or research under lower biosafety conditions. We established a protocol to test the efficacy of inactivation methods using the low-pathogenic Morogoro arenavirus as surrogate for the related highly pathogenic viruses. As the validation of chemical inactivation methods in cell culture systems is difficult due to cell toxicity of commonly used chemicals, we employed filter devices to remove the chemical and concentrate the virus after inactivation and before inoculation into cell culture. Viral replication in the cells was monitored over 4 weeks by using indirect immunofluorescence and immunofocus assay. The performance of the protocol was verified using published inactivation methods including chemicals and heat. Ten additional methods to inactivate virus in infected cells or cell culture supernatant were validated and shown to reduce virus titers to undetectable levels. In summary, we provide a robust protocol for the validation of chemical and physical inactivation of arenaviruses in cell culture, which can be readily adapted to different inactivation methods and specimen matrices.","Olschewski, Silke; Thielebein, Anke; Hoffmann, Chris; Blake, Olivia; Müller, Jonas; Bockholt, Sabrina; Pallasch, Elisa; Hinzmann, Julia; Wurr, Stephanie; Neddersen, Neele; Rieger, Toni; Günther, Stephan; Oestereich, Lisa",Viruses,,59
430030,Infertility: still a largely uncovered and undertreated disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, all 50 state governments deployed publicly viewable dashboards regarding the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to track and respond to the pandemic. States dashboards, however, reflect idiosyncratic design practices based on their content, function, and visual design and platform. There has been little guidance for what state dashboards should look like or contain, leading to significant variation. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of our study was to catalog how information, system function, and user interface were deployed across the COVID-19 state dashboards. Our secondary objective was to group and characterize the dashboards based on the information we collected using clustering analysis. METHODS: For preliminary data collection, we developed a framework to first analyze two dashboards as a group and reach agreement on coding. We subsequently doubled coded the remaining 48 dashboards using the framework and reviewed the coding to reach total consensus. RESULTS: All state dashboards included maps and graphs, most frequently line charts, bar charts, and histograms. The most represented metrics were total deaths, total cases, new cases, laboratory tests, and hospitalization. Decisions on how metrics were aggregated and stratified greatly varied across dashboards. Overall, the dashboards were very interactive with 96% having at least some functionality including tooltips, zooming, or exporting capabilities. For visual design and platform, we noted that the software was dominated by a few major organizations. Our cluster analysis yielded a six-cluster solution, and each cluster provided additional insights about how groups of states engaged in specific practices in dashboard design. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that states engaged in dashboard practices that generally aligned with many of the goals set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Essential Public Health Services. We highlight areas where states fall short of these expectations and provide specific design recommendations to address these gaps.","Fareed, Naleef; Swoboda, Christine M; Chen, Sarah; Potter, Evelyn; Wu, Danny T Y; Sieck, Cynthia J",Appl Clin Inform,,59

Under the theoretical framework of connectionism and social cognition, we propose a method for modeling the conceptual system related to medical knowledge held by a society, on the basis of Internet search queries produced by it over time. Our model can be used to simulate the learning about medical issues by a society through language, and this has implications for the early detection of pandemics and the identification of appropriate responses by means of public information campaigns.

CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 12-year-old girl with recent COVID-19 infection who presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain and other symptoms that meet the definition of MIS-C. She had lymphopenia and a high level of inflammatory markers. She was admitted to pediatric intensive care unit since she rapidly developed refractory catecholamine-resistant shock with multiple organ failure. Echocardiography showed a small pericardial effusion with a normal ejection fraction (Ejection Fraction = 60%) and no valvular or coronary lesions. The child showed no signs of improvement even after receiving intravenous immunoglobulin, fresh frozen plasma, high doses of Vasopressors and corticosteroid. His outcome was fatal. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients affected by the new COVID-19 related syndrome may show severe life-threatening conditions similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. Hypotension in these patients results from heart failure and the decreased cardiac output. We report a new severe clinical feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children in whom hypotension was the result of refractory vasoplegia.","Ajmi, Houda; Besghaier, Wissem; Kallala, Wafa; Trabelsi, Abdelhalim; Abroug, Saoussan",Ital J Pediatr,,59
435248,Effects of space sizes on the dispersion of cough-generated droplets from a walking person,2020-10-26,"Assessing the impact of an intervention using time-series observational data on multiple units and outcomes is a frequent problem in many fields of scientific research. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate intervention effects in such a setting by generalising existing approaches based on the factor analysis model and developing a Bayesian algorithm for inference. Our method is one of the few that can simultaneously: deal with outcomes of mixed type (continuous, binomial, count); increase efficiency in the estimates of the causal effects by jointly modelling multiple outcomes affected by the intervention; easily provide uncertainty quantification for all causal estimands of interest. We use the proposed approach to evaluate the impact that local tracing partnerships (LTP) had on the effectiveness of England's Test and Trace (TT) programme for COVID-19. Our analyses suggest that, overall, LTPs had a small positive impact on TT. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the estimates of the causal effects over units and time.","Samartsidis, Pantelis; Seaman, Shaun R.; Harrison, Abbie; Alexopoulos, Angelos; Hughes, Gareth J.; Rawlinson, Christopher; Anderson, Charlotte; Charlett, Andre; Oliver, Isabel; Angelis, Daniela De",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02005v1.pdf,59

436124,Veterinarians and One Health in the Fight Against Zoonoses Such as COVID-19,2020,"More than a year ago, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, with the world approaching its fourth wave. During this period, vaccines were developed in a much shorter period than thought possible, with the initiation of the pertinent vaccination. However, oral cavities have come under renewed scrutiny worldwide because saliva, a mixture of salivary secretions, pharyngeal secretions, and gingival crevicular fluid, have not only been shown to contain infective viral loads, mediating the route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via droplet, aerosol, or contagion, but also used as a sample for viral RNA testing with a usefulness comparable to the nasopharyngeal swab. The oral cavity is an important portal for ingress of SARS-CoV-2, being an entryway to the bronchi, alveoli, and rest of the lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation by viral infection. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, coupled with proteases responsible for viral entry have been found to be expressed on the tongue and other oral mucosae, suggesting that the oral cavity is the site of virus replication and propagation. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the aspiration of oral bacteria (such as periodontal pathogens) along with saliva into the lower respiratory tract may be a complicating factor for COVID-19 because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes are known COVID-19 comorbidities with a greater risk of disease aggravation and higher death rate. These comorbidities have a strong connection to chronic periodontitis and periodontal pathogens, and an oral health management is an effective measure to prevent these comorbidities. In addition, oral bacteria, particularly periodontal pathogens, could be proinflammatory stimulants to respiratory epithelia upon its exposure to aspirated bacteria. Therefore, it may be expected that oral health management not only prevents comorbidities involved in aggravating COVID-19 but also has an effect against COVID-19 progression. This review discusses the significance of oral health management in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the era of ""the new normal with COVID-19"" and COVID-19 prevention with reference to the hypothetical mechanisms that the authors and the other researchers have proposed.","Imai, Kenichi; Tanaka, Hajime",Int. j. mol. sci.

437712,Utilizing heat pipe heat exchanger to reduce the energy consumption of airborne infection isolation hospital room HVAC system,2021,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease with a broad spectrum of clinical severity. Patients with systemic vasculitis have an increased risk of serious infections and so may be at risk of severe outcomes following COVID-19. It is important to establish the risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes in these patients, including the impact of immunosuppressive therapies. METHODS: A multi-centre cohort was developed through the participation of centres affiliated with national UK and Ireland vasculitis registries. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were described. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between potential risk factors and severe COVID-19 outcome, defined as a requirement for advanced oxygen therapy, invasive ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Sixty-five cases of patients with systemic vasculitis who developed COVID-19 were reported (median age 70 years, 49% female) of whom 25 (38%) experienced a severe outcome. Most cases (55/65, 85%) had ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Almost all patients required hospitalization (59/65, 91%), 7 patients (11%) were admitted to intensive care and 18 patients (28%) died. Background glucocorticoid therapy was associated with severe outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.7 (1.1-14.9, p=0.047)) as was comorbid respiratory disease (aOR 7.5 (1.9-38.2, p=0.006)). Vasculitis disease activity and non-glucocorticoid immunosuppression were not associated with severe outcome. CONCLUSION: In patients with systemic vasculitis, glucocorticoid use at presentation and comorbid respiratory disease were associated with severe outcomes in COVID-19. These data can inform clinical decision making relating to risk of severe COVID-19 in this vulnerable patient group.","Rutherford, Matthew A; Scott, Jennifer; Karabayas, Maira; Antonelou, Marilina; Gopaluni, Seerapani; Gray, David; Barrett, Joe; Brix, Silke R; Dhaun, Neeraj; McAdoo, Stephen P; Smith, Rona M; Geddes, Colin; Jayne, David; Luqmani, Raashid; Salama, Alan D; Little, Mark; Basu, Neil",Arthritis rheumatol.

438230,Valuing life . . . and other stories,2021,"Inferior olive (IO), a nucleus in the ventral medulla, is the only source of climbing fibers that form one of the two input pathways entering the cerebellum. IO has long been proposed to be crucial for motor control and its activity is currently considered to be at the center of many hypotheses of both motor and cognitive functions of the cerebellum. While its physiology and function have been relatively well studied on single-cell level in vitro, presently there are no reports on the organization of the IO network activity in living animals. This is largely due to the extremely challenging anatomical location of the IO, making it difficult to subject to conventional fluorescent imaging methods, where an optic path must be created through the entire brain located dorsally to the region of interest. Here we describe an alternative method for obtaining state-of-the-art -level calcium imaging data from the IO network. The method takes advantage of the extreme ventral location of the IO and involves a surgical procedure for inserting a gradient-refractive index (GRIN) lens through the neck viscera to come into contact with the ventral surface of the calcium sensor GCaMP6s-expressing IO in anesthetized mice. A representative calcium imaging recording is shown to demonstrate the feasibility to record IO neuron activity after the surgery.

440297,2020 Spring Highlights Meeting: President-Elect Address,2020,"The rise of concepts such as the 15-minute-city represents the growing importance of accessibility by active mobility. In order to promote accessibility, accessibility instruments are developed that have substantial potential to assist practitioners in decision making processes. Therefore, this research starts with an up-to-date overview on the suitability of accessibility instruments when planning for active mobility. It was found that accessibility instruments were significantly further developed in the last few years and there is a rising number of tools that contain novel features. However, it was identified that there is a clear lack of tools specifically designed for modeling active mobility that are open source, include interactive scenario building, and can easily be transferred to new study areas. Therefore, an interactive accessibility instrument named GOAT (Geo Open Accessibility Tool) was developed, which is open source, transferable, and has an easy-to-use web interface. This instrument has been developed following an iterative software development process in close cooperation with practitioners from three municipalities in the region of Munich, Germany. The practitioners tested the tool independently in numerous workshops in order to provide feedback, which was integrated into the development. Furthermore, the tool was tested and transferred to more than 20 German municipalities, the City of Bogot & acute;a (Colombia) and Matosinhos (Portugal). First results show that the collaborative and open development process produced a user-centric solution, which bears the high potential to make planning for active mobility more effective and efficient.","Pajares, E.; Buttner, B.; Jehle, U.; Nichols, A.; Wulfhorst, G.",Journal of Transport Geography,,59

However, the field is so new that no consensus view has emerged guiding clinical decisions to employ imaging procedures such as radiography, computer tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging, and in what measure the risk of exposure of staff to possible infection could be justified by the knowledge gained. The insensitivity of current RT-PCR methods for positive diagnosis is part of the rationale for resorting to imaging procedures. While CT is more sensitive than genetic testing in hospitalized patients, positive findings of ground glass opacities depend on the disease stage. There is sparse reporting on PET/CT with [18F]-FDG in COVID-19, but available results are congruent with the earlier literature on viral pneumonias. There is a high incidence of cerebral findings in COVID-19, and likewise evidence of gastrointestinal involvement. Artificial intelligence, notably machine learning is emerging as an effective method for diagnostic image analysis, with performance in the discriminative diagnosis of diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia comparable to that of human practitioners.","Afshar-Oromieh, Ali; Prosch, Helmut; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia; Bohn, Karl Peter; Alberts, Ian; Mingels, Clemens; Thurnher, Majda; Cumming, Paul; Shi, Kuangyu; Peters, Alan; Geleff, Silvana; Lan, Xiaoli; Wang, Feng; Huber, Adrian; Gräni, Christoph; Heverhagen, Johannes T; Rominger, Axel; Fontanellaz, Matthias; Schöder, Heiko; Christe, Andreas; Mougiakakou, Stavroula; Ebner, Lukas",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,59

This article highlights a social work practice innovation model adapted from a traditional social work casework model. A group of multidisciplinary leaders strategized about ways to meet the needs of older African-American adults as many traditional government agencies were not sending staff into the community due to COVID-19. The result birthed a faith-based virtual health ministry.Using a faith-based virtual health ministry, church lay leaders and other professionals partnered with Master of Social Work (MSW) level social workers using a telehealth platform with technology tools to assist shut-in older adults in Washington, DC. The project uses a structured, coordinated care telehealth support model for a marginalized population. Telehealth within the rubric of healthcare models has not been demonstrated in African American communities, particularly older adults. Meeting the needs of shut-in older adults and marginalized groups within the COVID-19 pandemic may show innovation that can be translational for local governments and traditional safety net providers within a social work milieu.","Shelton, Rachel L; Hall, Mewelau; Ford, Seairra; Cosby, Robert L",Soc Work Health Care,,59

Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. METHODS: This historical cohort study included members of a large health provider in Israel that were vaccinated with at least one dose of BNT162b2. The primary outcome was incidence rate of a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed with rt-PCR, between 7 to 27 days after second dose (protection-period), as compared to days 1 to 7 after the first dose, where no protection by the vaccine is assumed (reference-period). RESULTS: Data of 1,178,597 individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 were analyzed (mean age 47.7 years [SD=18.1], 48.4% males) of whom 872,454 (74.0%) reached the protection period. Overall, 4514 infections occurred during the reference period compared to 728 during the protection period, yielding a weighted mean daily incidence of 54.8 per 100,000 (95%CI: 26.1-115.0 per 100,000) and 5.4 per 100,000 (95%CI: 3.5-8.4 per 100,000), respectively. The vaccine effectiveness in preventing infection was 90% (95%CI:79%- 95%) and 94% (95%CI:88%-97%) against COVID-19. Among immunosuppressed patients, vaccine effectiveness against infection was 71% (95%CI:37%-87%). The adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization in those infected were 0.82 (95%CI:0.36-1.88), 0.45 (95%CI:0.23-0.90), and 0.56 (95%CI:0.36-0.89) in the age groups 16-44, 45-64 and 75 and above, respectively.

However, data on CNS inflammatory disorders in COVID-19 are still evolving. We performed a literature review of CNS inflammatory disorders associated with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We screened all articles resulting from a search of PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus, using the keywords; ""SARS-CoV-2 and neurological complication"", ""SARS-CoV-2 and CNS Complication"" looking for reports of transverse myelitis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, neuromyelitis optica, myelitis, Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody Disorder (MOGAD), Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Acute Hemorrhagic Necrotizing Encephalitis/Acute Hemorrhagic Leukoencephalitis (AHNE/AHLE), Cytotoxic lesion of the Corpus Callosum/Mild Encephalopathy Reversible Splenium Lesion(CLOCC/MERS) and Optic neuritis published between December 01, 2019 and March 15, 2021. RESULTS: Our literature search revealed 43 patients meeting the diagnosis of myelitis, including Transverse Myelitis, ADEM, AHNE/AHLE or CLOCC/MERS and Optic neuritis. Acute myelitis was most commonly associated with non-severe COVID-19 and all reported cases of AHNE/AHLE had severe COVID-19 infection. Based on IDSA/ATS criteria of either requiring vasopressor for septic shock or mechanical ventilation, 49% (n = 18) patients were considered to have a severe COVID infection. There were 7 (n = 19%) fatalities. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is among the first reviews that includes the clinical features, neuroimaging, CSF findings and outcomes in COVID-19-associated CNS inflammatory disorders. Our observational review study reveals that although rare, myelitis, ADEM, AHNE and CLOCC can be associated with COVID-19 infection. Further studies using MRI imaging and CSF analysis in early diagnosis and intervention of these disorders are warranted.","Sriwastava, Shitiz; Tandon, Medha; Podury, Sanjiti; Prasad, Apoorv; Wen, Sijin; Guthrie, Garret; Kakara, Mihir; Jaiswal, Shruti; Subedi, Roshan; Elkhooly, Mahmoud; Lisak, Robert P",J. neurol,,59

METHODS: Two paired anterior nasal swabs or two paired nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from each participant. Swabs were tested by the LumiraDx SARS-CoV-2 antigen test and compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR; Roche cobas 6800 platform). Sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results were stratified on the basis of gender, age, duration of symptoms, and rt-PCR cycle threshold. RESULTS: Out of the 512 participants, aged 0-90 years, of this prospective validation study, 414 (81%) were symptomatic for COVID-19 and 123 (24%) swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2 based on rt-PCR testing. Compared with rt-PCR, the 12-min nasal swab test had 97.6% sensitivity and 96.6% specificity, and nasopharyngeal swab had 97.5% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity, within 12 days of symptom onset, representing the period of infectivity. All (100%) samples detected within 33 rt-PCR cycles were also identified using the antigen test. Results were consistent across age and gender. The user error rate of the test system when used by minimally trained operators was 0.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-3.7%). CONCLUSION: The rapid, high-sensitivity assay using nasopharyngeal or anterior nasal sampling may offer significant improvements for diagnosing acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinic- and community-based settings.","Drain, Paul K; Ampajwala, Madhavi; Chappel, Christopher; Gvozden, Andre B; Hoppers, Melanie; Wang, Melody; Rosen, Robert; Young, Stephen; Zissman, Edward; Montano, Michalina",,,59
452393,Author commentary on Marta Rodríguez-Carrasco et al,2021,"BACKGROUND: Differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have brought deeply rooted inequities to the forefront, where increasing evidence has shown that racialized immigrant and migrant (im/migrant) populations face a disproportionate burden of COVID-19. Im/migrant communities may be worst affected by lockdowns and restrictive measures, face less opportunity to physically distance or stay home sick within 'essential' jobs, and experience severe barriers to healthcare. Insufficient attention to experiences of racialized im/migrants in current pandemic responses globally highlights an urgent need to more fulsomely address unmet health needs through an anti-racist, equity-oriented lens. This commentary aims to highlight the need for public health and clinical training, research, and policy to thoughtfully prioritize im/migrant health equity during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN TEXT: Global pandemic responses have neglected im/migrants by continuing to ignore or insufficiently address inequities, exacerbating COVID transmission, xenophobia, and occupational injustice. Deaths, illness, stress, and other negative outcomes of the overlapping epidemics of COVID-19 and structural racism disproportionately borne by racialized im/migrants suggest the urgent need for action. As evidence mounts about how im/migrants have been left behind in times of crises, we need enhanced focus on health equity within COVID-19 research and interventions, including research that examines and pursues structural interventions necessary to mitigate these impacts, and that identifies patterns and harms of xenophobic policy, structural racism, and white supremacy in shaping im/migrant health outcomes. We must also strengthen anti-racist and equity-oriented curriculum within health education, and ensure sufficient attention to the needs of im/migrant communities within public health, clinical, and research training. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated and rendered more visible the deeply rooted health and social inequities faced by racialized im/migrants across diverse settings. We argue for a greater emphasis on equity-focused and anti-racist im/migrant health research, interventions, and training. Policymakers and practitioners must ensure that healthcare policies and practices do not exacerbate inequities, and instead meaningfully address unmet needs of communities, including racialized im/migrants. Ethical and respectful community engagement, commitment and collaboration with global, national, and local communities, policymakers, academics, and educators, as well as accountability across sectors, is critical.","Machado, Stefanie; Goldenberg, Shira",Int J Equity Health,,59

In general, the available IH/OEHS tools were designed to control hazards originating in the workplace; however, attempts to tailor them specifically to the control of infectious disease outbreaks have been limited. This analysis evaluated the IH decision-making framework (Anticipate, Recognize, Evaluate, Control, and Confirm (""ARECC"")) as it relates to biological hazards, in general, and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), specifically. Available IH/OEHS risk assessment and risk management tools (e.g. control banding and the hierarchy of controls) are important components of the ARECC framework. These conceptual models, however, were primarily developed for controlling chemical hazards and must be adapted to the unique characteristics of highly infectious and virulent pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. This assessment provides an overview of the key considerations for developing occupational infection control plans, selecting the best available controls, and applying other emerging tools (e.g. quantitative microbial risk assessment), with the ultimate goal of facilitating risk management decisions during the current global pandemic.","Zisook, Rachel E; Monnot, Andrew; Parker, Justine; Gaffney, Shannon; Dotson, Scott; Unice, Kenneth",Toxicol Ind Health,,59

459021,"A Message from the Executive Director: Coronavirus, the Cloud, and SMPTE",2020,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is leading to a worldwide pandemic. Except representative manifestation of pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 patients have also shown different levels of liver injury or liver dysfunction. The aim of our study was to explore the probable clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients and their liver dysfunction. METHOD: A combination of computer and manual retrieval was used to search in Medline through PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to examine the heterogeneity among the studies and to calculate the combined effect value (OR, 95CI). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias test were also performed. RESULTS: We found a significant connection between liver dysfunction and mortality of COVID-19 patients with a pooled OR of 1.98 (95% CI 1.39-2.82; P = 0.0002). There was a significant association between AST and severity of COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 4.48 (95% CI 3.24-7.21; P < 0.001), and a pooled WMD of 3.35 (95% CI, 2.07 to 4.64; P < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant difference between TBIL and severity of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 1.91 (95% CI 1.40-2.60; P < 0.001), and with a pooled WMD of 1.18 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.58; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The mortality and severity of COVID-19 patients are significantly associated with liver dysfunction. The non-survivors and severe COVID-19 patients have elevated serum AST levels than the survivors and non-severe COVID-19 patients. The results of this study form a basis for better clinical liver management of patients with COVID-19.","Wu, Zeng-Hong; Yang, Dong-Liang",Eur J Med Res,,59

459882,Mortality from Fear,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked unprecedented societal havoc worldwide. The infected individuals may present mild to severe symptoms, with nearly 20% of the confirmed patients impaired with significant complications, including multi-organ failure. Acute respiratory distress imposed by SARS-CoV-2 largely results from an aggravated cytokine storm and deregulated immune response. The forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are reported to play a significant role in maintaining normal cell physiology by regulating survival, apoptosis, oxidative stress, development and maturation of T and B lymphocytes, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, etc. We propose a potent anti-inflammatory approach based on activation of the FoxO as an attractive strategy against the novel coronavirus. This regime will be focused on restoring redox and inflammatory homeostasis along with repair of the damaged tissue, activation of lymphocyte effector and memory cells. Repurposing FoxO activators as a means to alleviate the inflammatory burst following SARS-CoV-2 infection can prove immensely valuable in the ongoing pandemic and provide a reliable groundwork for enriching our repertoire of antiviral modalities for any such complication in the future. Altogether, our review highlights the possible efficacy of FoxO activation as a novel arsenal for clinical management of COVID-19.","Cheema, Pradeep Singh; Nandi, Deeptashree; Nag, Alo",Open Biol,,59

This pandemic portrays a spectrum of clinical complications, primarily affecting the respiratory system reported to be caused by a pathogen SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the family of beta coronavirus. Currently, the main objective of the government authorities of all affected countries and research organizations is to find a potential solution in the form of a pharmacological intervention or a vaccination to eradicate the disease and to have a long-term solution to deal with the pandemic. A multitude of anti-viral regimens is proposed based on the repurposing of currently available drugs for other issues or the compassionate use of drugs to immediately control and optimize the healthcare facilities. Meanwhile, a number of agencies are proposing new drug candidates to recreate the possibility of treating the disease. Similarly, a lot of research work is going on worldwide for the development of vaccination. Currently, a good number of candidates has finally reached the borders of Clinical Trials and are expected to be launched as soon as possible. However, the regulatory framework and authorization of these candidates is the most significant aspect of the whole scenario, which needs a specific set of time for validation purposes. The present work is widely focused on the general aspects of COVID-19 and the regulatory landscape for the emergency authorization of repurposed drug candidates, compassionate use of drugs, investigational entities, and vaccine development worldwide.

460369,STAN: Spatio-Temporal Attention Network for Pandemic Prediction Using Real World Evidence,2020-07-23,"In past decades, to improve the chemotherapeutic efficiency and reduce the systemic toxicity of small molecule anti-cancer drugs, polymer-based drug delivery systems (DDSs) have attracted great attention for tumor treatment due to their remarkable biocompatibility and responsive degradation in tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, we developed a kind of pH-responsive and degradable hyperbranched polymeric nanocarriers via yne-phenol click-reaction of resveratrol (RSV) with bifunctional n-butyl dipropiolate (BDP) for efficient doxorubicin (DOX) delivery. The natural product RSV with three phenol groups has excellent antioxidant activity and synergetic enhancement for some anticancer drugs such as DOX. RSV tends to attack the alkynyl groups on BDP by nucleophilic addition in the presence of base as catalyst to afford hyperbranched polyprodrug (denoted as RB). PEGylated RB (termed as RBP) were further synthesized to improve the water solubility and prolong blood circulation by the click reaction of propiolate-terminated RB with amino terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-NH2). Interestingly, the RBP have high DOX loading ratio (â¼58.6 %) at neutral pH, but the vinyl-ether bonds in RB could break down at low pH conditions such as acidic TME (extracellular pHâ¼6.8, endosomes and lysosomes pHâ¼5.0) that leading to the targeting release of DOX and RSV. Therefore, the developed RBP@DOX nanoparticles exhibited high kill efficiency to tumor cells and slight damage to normal cells due to the effective delivery and release of DOX and RSV in tumor sites and the synergistic enhancement effect of two drugs.","Zhang, Ning; Wang, Daquan; Yang, Tingting; Jing, Xunan; Meng, Lingjie",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,59

463292,COVID-19 heath crisis: less colorectal resections and yet no more peritonitis or bowel obstruction as a collateral effect?,2020,"Feeding of the hungry is a theologically significant miracle in the ministry of Jesus, little wonder it is recorded by all the gospel writers (Mathew, Mark, Luke and John). In Judaism, feeding the hungry and hearkening to the needs of the poor and vulnerable are core demands of the religion. In fact, such a service far outweighs any service that anyone could render to God. The hungry people, who Jesus attended to, are desperately hopeless and Jesus exemplified heightened selflessness, love and care. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hunger is very peculiar and severe. The hunger is a result of the lockdown of commercial activities, which paralysed businesses and grounded economic activities to a halt, and placed both the rich and the poor in the same boat. The appalling situation that prompted this research is that, whilst food and monetary donations are being made by concerned philanthropists, hungry people still abound in the state because of ineffective strategies in the sharing of the palliatives. This research adopted a historical–critical method of analysis and the new method in New Testament interpretation in interpreting the pericope (Lk 9:10–17). Focus was placed on the core text;parallel passages are compared to bring out the original meaning of the text and how it can be pragmatised in Anambra State. Results showed that Jesus effectively satisfied both the physical and spiritual hunger of the crowds (hoi ochloi). He was able to draw the attention of his disciples to the need to cater for the hungry;there is surplus and no wastage. Additionally, compassion, love and selflessness are seen to be important virtues needed for equitable distribution of aid to the poor. If Jesus’ strategies are adopted where applicable, Anambra State can be hunger-free. Contribution: This article reveals that Jesus effectively and holistically fed a hungry crowd of 5000 men. Their psychological, emotional and physical hunger were satisfied. Jesus’ strategies were contextualised within Anambra state where the COVID-19 lockdown generated much hunger.

Methods: Six burn patients combined with inhalation injury were hospitalized in Department of Burns of Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University & Wuhan Third Hospital from February 1 to March 1 in 2020 during the high-incidence period of COVID-19, including 4 males and 2 females, aged 21-63 years, admitted at 2-4 hours after burns, with total burn areas of 1%-20% total body surface area (TBSA) and full-thickness burn areas of 1%-12% TBSA. Among them, 1 case had severe inhalation injury, 2 cases had mild inhalation injury, and 3 cases had moderate inhalation injury. The body temperatures of the patients were normal at the time of admission, with no fever or cough in the past 2 weeks. At admission, chest CT of one patient showed double lower lobes and left upper lobes had multiple slices and slightly high-density shadow of nodules. Chest CT of two patients showed thickening of bilateral lung texture, and the chest CT of remaining patients were normal. After admission, 6 patients were given routine treatment, the medical staffs paid attention to the protection and screened for COVID-19 according to the diagnosis and treatment plan of COVID-19. On post injury day (PID) 1, 3, 6, and 9, vein blood of patients were collected for determination of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil, lymphocyte absolute value, and level of procalcitonin (PCT). Nucleic acid of novel coronavirus was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on PID 3 and 6. The temperatures of patients were recorded after admission. The results of chest CT within one week after injury and the prognosis of the patients were recorded. Measurement data distributed normally were expressed as x±s, and measurement data distributed abnormally were expressed as M(P(25), P(75)). Results: (1) On PID 1, 3, 6, and 9, WBC counts of patients were respectively (19.8±3.8)×10(9)/L, (17.2±3.4)×10(9)/L, (13.3±3.1)×10(9)/L, and (11.1±1.6)×10(9)/L, neutrophils of patients were respectively 0.919±0.019, 0.899±0.011, 0.855±0.034, and 0.811±0.035, absolute values of lymphocytes of patients were respectively (0.65±0.18)×10(9)/L, (0.65±0.24)×10(9)/L, (0.91±0.34)×10(9)/L, and (1.23±0.42)×10(9)/L, and PCT values of patients were respectively 0.49 (0.36, 1.64), 0.39 (0.26, 0.73), 0.28 (0.18, 0.33), and 0.12 (0.11, 0.20) ng/mL. The values of WBC and neutrophils of patients were higher than the normal value, showing a downward trend. The absolute values of lymphocyte of patients returned to the normal value from PID 6. The PCT values of patients were higher than the normal value. (2) Nucleic acid test results of novel coronavirus of 6 patients were negative on PID 3 and 6. The temperatures of 6 patients ranged from 36.5 to 38.6 â. The typical imaging features of COVID-19 were not found in 6 patients within 1 week after injury by chest CT. After treatment for 14-32 days, 6 patients were cured and discharged. Conclusions: During COVID-19 pandemic, burn patients combined with inhalation injury should be treated under condition of good protection for doctors and nurses. Meanwhile, virus should be actively screened to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among doctors and patients.","Jiang, N N; Wang, D Y; Chen, L; Xie, W G",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,,59

The first lockdown modified daily living and could have led to a decrease in the frequency of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the present study, we compared the frequency and severity of severe TBI before and during the first containment in Normandy. METHODS: We included all patients admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe TBI in the two tertiary neurosurgical trauma centres of Normandy during the first lockdown. The year before the containment served as control. The primary outcome was the number of patients admitted per week in ICU. We compared the demographic characteristics, TBI mechanisms, CT scan, surgical procedure, and mortality rate. RESULTS: The incidence of admissions for severe TBI in Normandy decreased by 33% during the containment. The aetiology of TBI significantly changed during the containment: there were less traffic road accidents and more TBI related to alcohol consumption.

468669,Optimize Your Patient Portal and Streamline Your Workflows,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response. For some viruses, antibody concentrations correlate with host protection and viral neutralization, but in rare cases, anti-viral antibodies can promote disease progression. Elucidation of the kinetics and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response is essential to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and identify potential therapeutic targets. METHODS: Sera (n=533) from patients with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 (n=94 with acute infections and n=59 convalescent patients) were tested using a high-throughput quantitative IgM and IgG assay that detects antibodies to the spike protein receptor binding domain and nucleocapsid protein. Individual and serial samples covered the time of initial diagnosis, during the disease course, and following recovery. We evaluated antibody kinetics and correlation between magnitude of the response and disease severity. RESULTS: Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 antibody production varied considerably. Among 52 patients with 3 or more serial specimens, 44 (84.6%) and 42 (80.8%) had observed IgM and IgG seroconversion at a median of 8 and 10 days, respectively. Compared to those with milder disease, peak measurements were significantly higher for patients admitted to the intensive care unit for all time intervals between 6 and 20 days for IgM, and all intervals after 5 days for IgG. CONCLUSIONS: High sensitivity assays with a robust dynamic range provide a comprehensive picture of host antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. IgM and IgG responses were significantly higher in patients with severe than mild disease. These differences may affect strategies for seroprevalence studies, therapeutics and vaccine development.","Lynch, Kara L; Whitman, Jeffrey D; Lacanienta, Noreen P; Beckerdite, Erica W; Kastner, Shannon A; Shy, Brian R; Goldgof, Gregory M; Levine, Andrew G; Bapat, Sagar P; Stramer, Susan L; Esensten, Jonathan H; Hightower, Allen W; Bern, Caryn; Wu, Alan H B",Clin. infect. dis,,59

For mass screening, using CXRs, a computationally efficient AI-driven tool is the must to detect COVID-19-positive cases from non-COVID ones. For this purpose, we proposed a light-weight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-tailored shallow architecture that can automatically detect COVID-19-positive cases using CXRs, with no false negatives. The shallow CNN-tailored architecture was designed with fewer parameters as compared to other deep learning models. The shallow CNN-tailored architecture was validated using 321 COVID-19-positive CXRs. In addition to COVID-19-positive cases, another set of non-COVID-19 5856 cases (publicly available, source: Kaggle) was taken into account, consisting of normal, viral, and bacterial pneumonia cases. In our experimental tests, to avoid possible bias, 5-fold cross-validation was followed, and both balanced and imbalanced datasets were used. The proposed model achieved the highest possible accuracy of 99.69%, sensitivity of 1.0, where AUC was 0.9995. Furthermore, the reported false positive rate was only 0.0015 for 5856 COVID-19-negative cases. Our results stated that the proposed CNN could possibly be used for mass screening. Using the exact same set of CXR collection, the current results were better than other deep learning models and major state-of-the-art works.","Mukherjee, Himadri; Ghosh, Subhankar; Dhar, Ankita; Obaidullah, Sk Md; Santosh, K C; Roy, Kaushik",Cognit Comput,,59

473582,Crises drive innovation,2020,"The starting hypothesis of this article is that the confinement suffered by the Spanish population during COVID-19 has brought at least three important consequences. The first, that the cities -Alicante, between them- and the Spanish towns were deserted, so that, in a certain sense, society was also emptied. The second, that the shelterdwellings expanded their traditional functions and assumed new ones, becoming ""World-Homes"". And, third, that individualism and ""communitas"" have been reinforced, along with fear of Society, Nature and History. This starting hypothesis is confirmed, with nuances, by the content analysis of 14 photographs selected from hundreds, which the photojournalist, Rafa Arjones, from the newspaper Informacion, carried out during the confinement of Alicante (in phase 0, which lasted from March 14 to May 18, 2020). This city of 330,000 inhabitants is the capital of a dynamic province, located in the southeast of Spain. And, for this, we will use hermeneutics, concretized by linking three methods of image analysis: Panofsky's iconological analysis, K. Mannheim's documentary method and Visual Framing from Communication. In addition, these images will be contrasted with other 17 published in various media in Spain and the world, so that Alicante represents a local and, at the same time, global case of the impact of the pandemic on society.","Roche Carcel, J.

To our knowledge, this work represents the first centrifugal microdevice for comprehensive preparation of high-purity NAs from raw buccal swab samples. Direct-from-swab cellular lysis was integrated upstream of NA extraction, and automatable laser-controlled on-board microvalving strategies provided the strict spatiotemporal fluidic control required for practical point-of-need use. Solid-phase manipulation during extraction leveraged the application of a bidirectional rotating magnetic field to promote thorough interaction with the sample (e.g., NA capture). We illustrate the broad utility of this technology by establishing downstream compatibility of extracted nucleic acids with three noteworthy assays, namely, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The PCR-readiness of the extracted DNA was confirmed by generating short tandem repeat (STR) profiles following multiplexed amplification. With no changes to assay workflow, viral RNA was successfully extracted from contrived (spiked) SARS-CoV-2 swab samples, confirmed by RT-qPCR. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of the extracted DNA with LAMP-a technique well suited for point-of-need genetic analysis due to minimal hardware requirements and compatibility with colorimetric readout. We describe an automatable, portable microfluidic platform for the nucleic acid preparation device that could permit practical, in situ use by nontechnical personnel.","Dignan, Leah M; Woolf, M Shane; Tomley, Christopher J; Nauman, Aeren Q; Landers, James P",Anal Chem,,59

We also examine the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the causal agent of COVID-19, from domestic cats to bats, which, although unlikely, might generate a novel wildlife reservoir in these mammals, and identify research and management directions to achieve more effective risk assessment, mitigation or prevention. Overall, not only does bat killing by cats represent a potentially serious threat to biodiversity conservation, but it also bears zoonotic implications that can no longer be neglected.","Salinas-Ramos, Valeria B; Mori, Emiliano; Bosso, Luciano; Ancillotto, Leonardo; Russo, Danilo",,,59

ICI-induced pneumonitis is a serious complication seen with treatment with these agents. Cancer has been reported to be one of the risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that has engulfed the world in the last couple of months. In patients with cancer treated with ICI who present at the emergency department with respiratory symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, correct diagnosis can be challenging. Symptoms and radiological features of ICI pneumonitis can be overlapping with those of COVID-19 related pneumonia. For the latter, dexamethasone and remdesivir have shown encouraging results, while vaccines are currently being evaluated in phase III trials. The mainstay of treatment in ICI pneumonitis is immunosuppressive therapy, as this is a potentially fatal adverse event. It has been speculated that immunosuppression may be associated with increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19, especially during the early stage of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, distinction between these two entities is warranted. We summarize the clinical, radiological features as well as additional investigations of both entities, and suggest a diagnostic algorithm for distinction between the two. This algorithm may be a supportive tool for clinicians to diagnose the underlying cause of the pneumonitis in patients treated with ICI during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Dumoulin, Daphne W; Gietema, Hester A; Paats, Marthe S; Hendriks, Lizza E L; Cornelissen, Robin",Front Oncol,,59
478812,Epidemics from the Eye of the Pathogen,2021-03-23,"To combat the rampant spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided Americans with empirically supported preventive behavioral guidelines (e.g., wearing a face mask). However, there is a need to develop behavioral strategies that can effectively increase adherence to these guidelines, especially for young adults, who report particularly poor adherence. Across several domains of prevention science, norms-based interventions have successfully motivated constructive health behavior by correcting normative misperceptions, but these strategies are only relevant when these misperceptions are widespread. We examined the accuracy of young adults' perceptions of peers' adherence to CDC-recommended behavioral guidelines (i.e., perceived social norms) to assess the rationale for employing norm-correcting strategies. Young adult college students (N = 539; Mage = 19.5 years) self-reported their level of adherence to a list of preventive behavioral guidelines and estimated the norms regarding the extent to which other young adults adhered to these guidelines. We measured adherence and perceived norms for each guideline in terms of adherence frequency, ranging from 0 to 100% of the time. We found that young adults, on average, underestimated the extent to which other young adults adhere to each of the recommended preventive behaviors. That is, young adults tended to think that other young adults are failing to adhere to CDC guidelines, whereas our self-reported data showed adherence frequency may be quite high. Moreover, we found positive associations between self-reported adherence and perceptions of others' adherence-that is, those who underestimated others' adherence also self-reported lower adherence to guidelines. Findings from this study establish proof-of-concept for the development of norms-based strategies designed to improve young adults' adherence to preventive behavioral guidelines that are both specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and that prepare for future contagious outbreaks.","Graupensperger, Scott; Lee, Christine M; Larimer, Mary E",J Prim Prev,,59

481724,Attention-based Clinical Note Summarization,2021-04-18,"Inflammation is an intrinsic defence mechanism triggered by the immune system against infection or injury. Chronic inflammation allows the host to recover or adapt through cellular and humoral responses, whereas acute inflammation leads to cytokine storms resulting in tissue damage. In this review, we present the overlapping outcomes of cancer inflammation with virus-induced inflammation. The study emphasises how anti-inflammatory drugs that work against cancer inflammation may work against the inflammation caused by the viral infection. It is established that the cytokine storm induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to disease-associated mortality. While cancer remains the second among the diseases associated with mortality worldwide, cancer patients' mortality rates are often observed upon extended periods after illness, usually ranging from months to years. However, the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 disease are robust. The cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be responsible for the multi-organ failure and increased mortality rates. Since both cancer and COVID-19 disease share overlapping inflammatory mechanisms, repurposing some anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 may lower mortality rates. Here, we review some of these inflammatory mechanisms and propose some potential chemotherapeutic agents to intervene in them. We also discuss the repercussions of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine with zinc or antiviral drugs such as ivermectin and remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm. In this review, we emphasise on various possibilities to reduce SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm.","Amere Subbarao, Sreedhar",Inflammopharmacology,,59

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: SPEC was implemented at ten nursing homes in South Korea in random order using a stepped-wedge design. Data were collected on all participating older residents in the homes before the first implementation and until six months after the last implementation. The 21-month SPEC intervention guided by the chronic care model (CCM) consists of five strategies: comprehensive geriatric assessment, care planning, optional interdisciplinary case conferences, care coordination, and a cloud-based ICT tool along with free messaging app. The primary outcome was quality of care measured by a composite quality indicator (QI) from the interRAI assessment system. Usual care continued over the control periods. Nursing home staff were not blinded to the intervention. RESULTS: There were a total of 482 older nursing home residents included in the analysis. Overall quality of care measured by the composite QI was significantly improved (adjusted mean difference: -0.025 [95% CI: -0.037 ~ -0.014, p <.0001]). The intervention effect was consistent in the subgroup analysis by cognition and activities of daily living. There were no important adverse events or side effects. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The SPEC, a CCM-guided, ICT-supported, multidisciplinary integrated care management intervention, can improve quality of care measured by health and functional outcomes for frail older persons residing in nursing homes with limited healthcare provision.

483018,Ebioenergy crisis in coronavirus diseases?,2020,"The seventh human coronavirus SARS-CoV2 belongs to the cluster of extremely pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which can cause fatal lower respiratory tract infection. Likewise, SARS-CoV2 infection can be fatal as the disease advances to pneumonia, followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The development of lethal clinical symptons is associated with an exaggerated production of inflammatory cytokines, referred to as the cytokine storm, is a consequence of a hyperactivated immune response aginst the infection. In this article, we discuss the pathogenic consequences of the cytokine storm and its relationship with COVID-19 associated risk factors. The increased pro-inflammatory immune status in patients with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, COPD) exacerbates the Cytokine-storm of COVID-19 into a 'Cytokine Super Cyclone'. We also evaluate the antiviral immune responses provided by BCG vaccination and the potential role of 'trained immunity' in early protection against SARS-CoV2.","Johnson, Betcy Susan; Laloraya, Malini",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,59

This study aims to estimate the incubation period and serial interval of COVID-19. We collected contact tracing data in a municipality in Hubei province during a full outbreak period. The date of infection and infector-infectee pairs were inferred from the history of travel in Wuhan or exposed to confirmed cases. The incubation periods and serial intervals were estimated using parametric accelerated failure time models, accounting for interval censoring of the exposures. Our estimated median incubation period of COVID-19 is 5.4 days (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.8-6.0), and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles are 1 and 15 days, respectively; while the estimated serial interval of COVID-19 falls within the range of -4 to 13 days with 95% confidence and has a median of 4.6 days (95% CI 3.7-5.5). Ninety-five per cent of symptomatic cases showed symptoms by 13.7 days (95% CI 12.5-14.9). The incubation periods and serial intervals were not significantly different between male and female, and among age groups. Our results suggest a considerable proportion of secondary transmission occurred prior to symptom onset.

486752,"Patterns, anticipation and participatory futures",2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, several health care programs intended to provide telemedicine services have been introduced in Libya. Many physicians have used these services to provide care and advice to their patients remotely. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide an overview of physicians' awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skill in using telehealth services in Libya. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we administered a web-based survey to health care workers in Libya in May 2020. The questionnaire collected information on physicians' general demographic characteristics, ability to use a computer, and telemedicine awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skills. RESULTS: Among 673 health care workers who responded to the survey, 377 (56%) and 248 (36.8%) reported high awareness and high computer skill scores, respectively, for telemedicine. Furthermore, 582 (86.5%) and 566 (82.6%) health care workers reported high knowledge and high attitude scores, respectively. We observed no significant differences in awareness, knowledge, attitude, and skill scores among physicians employed at public, private, or both types of hospitals. We observed significant differences in the mean awareness (P<.001), attitude (P=.001), and computer skill scores (P<.001) , where the score distribution of the groups based on the ability to use computers was not similar. Knowledge scores did not significantly differ among the three groups (P=.37). Respondents with professional computer skills had significantly higher awareness (&#967;23=14.5; P<.001) and attitude (&#967;23=13.5; P=.001) scores than those without professional computer skills. We observed significant differences in the mean computer skill scores of the groups (&#967;23=199.6; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to persist for a long time. Hence, policy programs such as telemedicine services, which aim to address the obstacles to medical treatment owing to physical distancing measures, will likely continue for a long time. Therefore, there is a need to train and support health care workers and initiate government programs that provide adequate and supportive health care services to patients in transitional countries.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Elhadi, Ahmed; Bouhuwaish, Ahmad; Bin Alshiteewi, Fatimah; Elmabrouk, Amna; Alsuyihili, Ali; Alhashimi, Ayiman; Khel, Samer; Elgherwi, Alsafa; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Albakoush, Ahmed; Abdulmalik, Abdulmuez",J Med Internet Res,,59
487257,Rapidly Growing Bullous Plaque on the Hand,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the global level and in the Arab world, particularly in low-income countries, COVID-19 remains a major public health issue. As demonstrated by an incredible number of COVID-19-related publications, the research science community responded rapidly. Therefore, this study was intended to assess the growing contribution of the Arab world to global research on COVID-19. METHODS: For the period between December 2019 and March 2021, the search for publications was conducted via the Scopus database using terms linked to COVID-19. VOSviewer 1.6.16 software was applied to generate a network map to assess hot topics in this area and determine the collaboration patterns between different countries. Furthermore, the research output of Arab countries was adjusted in relation to population size and gross domestic product (GDP). RESULTS: A total of 143,975 publications reflecting the global overall COVID-19 research output were retrieved. By restricting analysis to the publications published by the Arab countries, the research production was 6131 documents, representing 4.26% of the global research output regarding COVID-19. Of all these publications, 3990 (65.08%) were original journal articles, 980 (15.98%) were review articles, 514 (8.38%) were letters and 647 (10.55%) were others, such as editorials or notes. The highest number of COVID-19 publications was published by Saudi Arabia (n = 2186, 35.65%), followed by Egypt (n = 1281, 20.78%) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), (n = 719, 11.73%). After standardization by population size and GDP, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Lebanon had the highest publication productivity. The collaborations were mostly with researchers from the United States (n = 968), followed by the United Kingdom (n = 661). The main research lines identified in COVID-19 from the Arab world are related to: public health and epidemiology; immunological and pharmaceutical research; signs, symptoms and clinical diagnosis; and virus detection. CONCLUSIONS: A novel analysis of the latest Arab COVID-19-related studies is discussed in the current study and how these findings are connected to global production. Continuing and improving future collaboration between developing and developed countries will also help to facilitate the sharing of responsibilities for COVID-19 in research results and the implementation of policies for COVID-19.","Zyoud, Sa039; ed, H",Global Health,,59

Little research is performed to investigate the relevant mechanism mediated by HuR to promote the progress of ovarian cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was retrieved to calculate the correlation between HuR and translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 44 (TIMM44) expression. HuR expression plasmid, TIMM44 expression plasmid, siRNA HuR, and TIMM44 siRNAs were further transfected into A2780 and SKOV3 cells. The 3'UTR of TIMM44 fragment was cloned into the back of Renilla luciferase in the pSicheck2 dual fluorescent reporter to indicate the interaction between HuR and TIMM44. Cell count and MTT assay were performed to assay the proliferation ability of A2780 and SKOV3 cells. High-level HuR expression in 56 ovarian cancer patients recruited in Zibo Central Hospital was positively correlated with metastasis status and poor prognosis revealed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Both HuR and TIMM44 can promote the proliferation of SKOV3 and A2780 cells. A high correlation of HuR and TIMM44 expression was testified in the TCGA data. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed that HuR could bind to TIMM44 to maintain the mRNA stability. TIMM44 siRNA administration inhibited the proliferation of SKOV3 cells, which could not be rescued. All of these indicate that the main function of HuR on ovarian cancer proliferation is mediated by TIMM44 through mRNA stability regulation, and HuR/TIMM44 complex can be used as a target to inhibit the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells.","Yu, Xiaohui; Li, Yujiao; Ding, Yumei; Zhang, Hong; Ding, Ning; Lu, Ming",Cell biochem. biophys,,59

We employ a novel Bayesian structural time series approach (a state-space model) to estimate the relative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock market performance in those countries. Generally, our Bayesian posterior estimates show that, in relative terms, stock market performances in Africa have significantly reduced during and after the occurrence of the COVID-19, usually between -2.7 % and -21 %. At the heterogeneous level, we find that 10 countries have their stock markets significantly and adversely affected by the COVID-19, whereas the remaining 3 countries see no significant impact (or a rather short-lived negative significant impact) of the COVID-19 pandemic on their stock markets. We find that, within our sample period, there is almost no chance that the COVID-19 pandemic would have positive effects on the stock market performance in Africa. Our findings contribute to the discussion and research on the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing empirical evidence that the pandemic has restrictive effects on stock market performance in African economies.","Takyi, Paul Owusu; Bentum-Ennin, Isaac",J Econ Bus,,59
488315,Corrigendum,2021,"Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs that are used to treat an extraordinary range of human disease, including COVID-19, underscoring the ongoing importance of understanding their molecular mechanisms. Early studies of GR signaling led to broad acceptance of models in which glucocorticoid receptor (GR) monomers tether repressively to inflammatory transcription factors, thus abrogating inflammatory gene expression. However, newer data challenge this core concept and present an exciting opportunity to reframe our understanding of GR signaling. Here, we present an alternate, two-part model for transcriptional repression by glucocorticoids. First, widespread GR-mediated induction of transcription results in rapid, primary repression of inflammatory gene transcription and associated enhancers through competition-based mechanisms. Second, a subset of GR-induced genes, including targets that are regulated in coordination with inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-&#954;B, exerts secondary repressive effects on inflammatory gene expression. Within this framework, emerging data indicate that the gene set regulated through the cooperative convergence of GR and NF-&#954;B signaling is central to the broad clinical effectiveness of glucocorticoids in terminating inflammation and promoting tissue repair.","Gerber, Anthony N; Newton, Robert; Sasse, Sarah K",J Biol Chem,,59

METHODS: Patients older than 18 years with COVID-19, registered between March and August 2020, were included. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test. To evaluate the impact on mortality, a logistic regression model was used; the relationship between the percentage of patients who received the influenza vaccine and mortality was determined with Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: 16,879 participants were included; 17 % had a history of influenza vaccination. Mortality was lower in the group with a history of vaccination (3.5 % vs. 7 %, p < 0.0001). The vaccination rate had an inverse relationship with the mortality rate (Pearson's r: -0.922, p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Previous influenza immunization was an independent protective factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19. Although further studies are needed to determine a causal relationship, it would be reasonable to increase influenza immunization in the general population.","Sánchez-García, Carlos; Salinas-Aguirre, Juan E; Rodríguez-Muñoz, Lorena; Rodríguez-Sánchez, Raúl; Díaz-Castaño, Angélica; Bernal-Gómez, Roberto",Gac Med Mex,,59

AIM: To evaluate the knowledge Latin American gastroenterologists and endoscopists (staff physicians and residents) have about the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as the prevention measures to be taken during endoscopic procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary. Forty-eight percent of the participants surveyed were not familiar with the protocol for reprocessing the endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The majority of the gastroenterologists and endoscopists surveyed were familiar with the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the populations at risk for complications. There was a lack of knowledge about prevention measures (during clinical care and endoscopic procedures) and the reprocessing of endoscopic equipment by 70% and 48%, respectively, of those surveyed.

The study hypothesis was that this exceptional situation temporarily altered childhood trauma epidemiology. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective study was performed during the 8 weeks of lockdown. Pediatric traumatology emergency activity was compared to that during the same period in the previous 3 years. RESULTS: During lockdown, emergency consultations decreased by 50%. The number of patients operated on was 86% of that in the previous 3 years. Patients operated on during lockdown had a mean age of 7.6 years (median, 7.5 years) compared to 9.3 years (9.4 years). The rate of domestic accidents (59% versus 23%) and trampoline accidents (16% versus 5%) increased, while those of sport and locomotion-related accidents decreased. Wounds were more frequent, at 35% of procedures, versus 13% previously. The rate of surgery for upper-limb fracture deceased, while that of lower-limb fracture was unchanged. Distal forearm fracture was less frequent, as was distal tibial fracture. DISCUSSION: The present study found a 50% decrease in pediatric traumatology emergency activity during lockdown, without decrease in surgery. In case of renewed lockdown, we recommend reorganizing emergency admission to free teams for management of Covid-19 patients, while maintaining operative rooms for emergency surgery. A general public information campaign could help prevent domestic accidents and risk related to use of trampolines.

494636,Offline: The coming technocracy,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth technologies and mental health apps have been promoted to manage distress in the public and to augment existing mental health services. From a humanistic perspective, the promotion and use of mobile apps raises ethical concerns regarding the autonomy of the person using the app. However, there are other dangers that arise when technological fixes are embraced at a time of crisis. Naomi Klein and Shoshanna Zuboff have recently warned about disaster and surveillance capitalism—using crises to pass legislation that will benefit the rich and deepen inequality, and using anonymized behavioral data for commercial purposes. This analysis reveals that mental health apps may take individuals at their most vulnerable and make them part of a hidden supply chain for the marketplace. We provide a case study of a mental health app that uses digital phenotyping to predict negative mood states. We describe the logic of digital phenotyping and assess the efficacy data on which claims of its validity are based. Drawing from the frameworks of disaster and surveillance capitalism, we also use a humanistic psychology lens to identify the ethical entanglements and the unintended consequences of promoting and using this technology during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cosgrove, Lisa; Karter, Justin M.; Morrill, Zenobia; McGinley, Mallaigh",J.

Machine learning has the potential to bridge this gap by providing a link between what people observe and how they act in order to reach their goal. In this paper we use a framework for agent-based modelling that utilizes human values like fairness, conformity and altruism. Using this framework we simulate a public goods game and compare to experimental results. We can report good agreement between simulation and experiment and furthermore find that the presented framework outperforms strict reinforcement learning. Both the framework and the utility function are generic enough that they can be used for arbitrary systems, which makes this method a promising candidate for a foundation of a universal agent-based model.","Jager, Georg; Reisinger, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04267v1.pdf,59

498315,The impact of environmental variables on the spread of COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the engagement of students enrolled in the fifth year of pharmaceutical studies in the management of the health crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify some determinants of this engagement during this period. METHODS: With the health crisis, new missions have been entrusted during hospital internships, whereas certain internship sites were removed in hospitals and as part of the health service organization. In addition, some students who were no longer in internship returned to the hospital setting for helping in critical activities. Student engagement was studied with a questionnaire and focus groups including six or seven students in each group. RESULTS: Forty-three students participated to the study. The answers to the questionnaire highlighted that they were engaged, that they usually did not wait for compensation, and that most of them were satisfied by their activity during the crisis. The thematic analysis demonstrated that despite a feeling of frustration, which was often associated with the interruption of rewarded activities, and despite a stress due to the particular context, student engagement was supported by a better consideration of the pharmacist's role as a professional in public health and by a better acknowledgement of this role by other health professionals. CONCLUSION: This level of engagement is particularly encouraging because it is the witness of the ability of pharmacists to mobilize for general interest, even in adverse context.","Spiesser-Robelet, L; Baglin, I; Moal, F; Lagarce, F; Eveillard, M",Ann. pharm. fr,,59

498620,Rethinking Our Approach to the Public Mistrust of Science,2020,"BACKGROUND: Intrinsic resistance is a major obstacle in treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with an activating mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We investigated co-occurring genetic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as predictive markers of clinical response to first-line erlotinib. METHODS: Pretreatment plasma samples were collected from 76 patients with EGFR-mutated, advanced-stage NSCLC treated with first-line erlotinib. We isolated ctDNA from plasma for next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Co-occurring oncogenic drivers were detected in 21% of pretreatment samples and correlated with decreased progression-free survival (PFS) (6.9 months vs 14.4 months; hazard ratio [HR], 2.088; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8119-5.370; P = .0355). Concurrent MET amplification was identified in 9 samples (12%), predicting inferior PFS (5.5 months vs 14.4 months; HR, 4.750; 95% CI, 0.5923-38.10; P = .0007) and overall survival (7.6 months vs 28.3 months; HR, 3.952; 95% CI, 0.8441-18.50; P = .0005). Co-occurring non-MET-amplification oncogenic alterations showed a tendency for shorter PFS (9.9 months vs 14.4 months; HR, 1.199; 95% CI, 0.3373-4.265; P = .7586). Clearing EGFR-mutated ctDNA during erlotinib treatment is a positive predictor of clinical outcomes. Among patients who cleared the EGFR mutation, 12% had a co-occurring oncogenic driver, with a tendency toward inferior PFS (8.7 months vs 16.1 months; HR, 1.703; 95% CI, 0.5347-5.424; P = .2508). CONCLUSION: Co-occurring MET amplification in pretreatment ctDNA samples predict inferior clinical response to first-line erlotinib in advanced-stage, EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients. Co-occurring oncogenic alterations were associated with inferior response and may be potential predictors of clinical outcome.","Clement, Michelle S; Ebert, Eva Boysen Fynboe; Meldgaard, Peter; Sorensen, Boe S",Clin. lung cancer,,59
499829,Coronavirus Human Infection Challenge Studies: Assessing Potential Benefits and Risks,2020,"The human body is punctuated with wide array of sensory systems that provide a high evolutionary advantage by facilitating formation of a detailed picture of the immediate surroundings. The sensors range across a wide spectrum, acquiring input from non-contact audio-visual means to contact based input via pressure and temperature. The ambit of sensing can be extended further by imparting the body with increased non-contact sensing capability through the phenomenon of electrostatics. Here we present graphene-based tattoo sensor for proximity sensing, employing the principle of electrostatic gating. The sensor shows a remarkable change in resistance upon exposure to objects surrounded with static charge on them. Compared to prior work in this field, the sensor has demonstrated the highest recorded proximity detection range of 20 cm. It is ultra-thin, highly skin conformal and comes with a facile transfer process such that it can be tattooed on highly curvilinear rough substrates like the human skin, unlike other graphene-based proximity sensors reported before. Present work details the operation of wearable proximity sensor while exploring the effect of mounting body on the working mechanism. A possible role of the sensor as an alerting system against unwarranted contact with objects in public places especially during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has also been explored in the form of an LED bracelet whose color is controlled by the proximity sensor attached to it.","Kedambaimoole, Vaishakh; Kumar, Neelotpala; Shirhatti, Vijay; Nuthalapati, Suresh; Kumar, Saurabh; Nayak, Mangalore Manjunatha; Sen, Prosenjit; Akinwande, Deji; Rajanna, Konandur",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11537v1.pdf,59

501444,An accessible method for screening aerosol filtration identifies poor-performing commercial masks and respirators,2020,"BACKGROUND: Emerging clinical evidence has shown that patients with the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) have complications that include venous thromboembolism (VTE), consisting of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). The prevalence of VTE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is unclear. METHODS: Eligible studies on COVID-19 were collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Patient characteristics and information were extracted for three categories of patients: consecutive, ICU, and non-ICU group. All PEs and DVTs were diagnosed by computed tomographic pulmonary arteriography and duplex ultrasound examination, respectively. A subgroup analysis of testing strategies in ICU and non-ICU patients for PE and DVT was also performed. RESULTS: Forty clinical studies involving 7966 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included. Pooled VTE prevalence was 13% in consecutive patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.24; I2 = 97%), 7% in non-ICU patients (95% CI, 0.01-0.18; I2 = 93%), and 31% in ICU patients (95% CI, 0.22-0.42; I2 = 91%). ICU patients had the highest prevalence of PE among the three groups (17% [95% CI, 0.12-0.23] vs 8% in consecutive patients [95% CI, 0.04-0.13], 4% in non-ICU patients [95% CI, 0.01-0.08]). ICU patients also had the highest DVT prevalence (25% [95% CI, 0.14-0.37] vs 7% in consecutive patients [95% CI, 0.03-0.14], and 7% in non-ICU [95% CI, 0.02-0.14]). The subgroup analysis showed a three-fold improvement in the PE and DVT detection rates in both ICU and non-ICU patients with COVID-19 when the screening test for VTE was applied. In the settings of screening tests for VTE, ICU patients have a significantly higher prevalence of PE (37% vs 10%; P < .0001) and DVT (40% vs 12%; P = .0065) compared with non-ICU patients. CONCLUSIONS: VTE is common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, especially among ICU patients. Screening tests for PE and DVT may significantly improve detection rates in both ICU and non-ICU patients with COVID-19 than tests based on clinical suspicion.","Zhang, Rui; Ni, Leng; Di, Xiao; Wang, Xuebin; Ma, Baitao; Niu, Shuai; Liu, Changwei",J.

Given the political context of the pandemic and the nation’s response to it, this study sought to assess the extent of Americans’ personal fear about the virus as well as their fear for others (altruistic fear), identify potential predictors of these fears, and examine the mental health impact of heightened COVID-19 fears. Overall, a majority of respondents worried about various aspects of the virus, from being exposed to dying, and reported often worrying about others, including family, the elderly, and healthcare professionals. Building on the fear of crime literature, we find that certain individuals, including those who believe they are at a high risk of dying from the virus, non-Whites, and those who closely follow news coverage of the pandemic, are likely to experience elevated fear and, possibly, its consequences.

501556,Management of hemato-oncology children during covid-19 crisis,2020,"It has been well known for decades that prone positioning (PP) improves oxygenation. However, it has gained widespread acceptance only in the last few years since studies have shown significant survival benefit. Many centers have established prone ventilation in their treatment algorithm for mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Physiologically, PP should also benefit awake, non-intubated patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. However, proning in non-intubated (PINI) patients did not gain any momentum until a few months ago when the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surged. A large number of sick patients overwhelmed the health care system, and many centers faced a dearth of ventilators. In addition, outcomes of patients placed on mechanical ventilation because of COVID-19 infection have been highly variable and often dismal. Hence, increased focus has shifted to using various strategies to prevent intubation, such as PINI. There is accumulating evidence that PINI is a low-risk intervention that can be performed even outside intensive care unit with minimal assistance and may prevent intubation in certain patients with ARDS. It can also be performed safely at smaller centers and, therefore, may reduce the patient transfer to larger institutions that are overwhelmed in the current crisis. We present a case series of 2 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who experienced significant improvements in oxygenation with PP. In addition, the physiology of PP is described, and concerns such as proning in obese and patient's anxiety are addressed; an educational pamphlet that may be useful for both patients and health care providers is provided.","Paul, Vishesh; Patel, Shawn; Royse, Michelle; Odish, Mazen; Malhotra, Atul; Koenig, Seth",J Intensive Care Med,,59
502036,"COVID-19 vaccines poised for launch, but impact on pandemic unclear",2020,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare clinicopathologic features and outcomes between patients with familial non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC) and patients with sporadic non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (SNMTC) after performing individual risk factor-matching. Additionally, the study evaluated a dynamic risk stratification (DRS) system to validate its usefulness for familial-type thyroid carcinoma. METHODS: After individual risk factor-matching, 286 patients remained in the FNMTC group, and 858 patients were assigned to the SNMTC group consisting of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The prognostic outcomes were compared between the two groups in a matched cohort. RESULTS: During the mean follow-up period of 142 months, recurrences were experienced by 64 patients in the sporadic group (7.5%) and 29 patients in the familial group (10.1%). In the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for recurrence were primary tumor size (p = 0.033), gross extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001). The independent risk factors did not include family history alone (p = 1.101) or the number of affected family members (p = 0.122 for 2 members and p = 0.625 for &#8805; 3 members). In this matched-cohort study, the DRS system was well adjusted in the FNMTC and SNMTC groups. Moreover, the proportion of DRS categories and the recurrence rate in each DRS category were similar between the familial and sporadic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Family history did not present a statistically significant association with a poor prognosis for PTC patients. With a family history of PTC alone, less aggressive treatment could be considered. In this matched cohort, DRS was adjusted well and could be useful in predicting prognosis, even for PTC patients with a family history of PTC.","Lee, Yu-Mi; Jeon, Min Ji; Kim, Won Woong; Chung, Ki-Wook; Baek, Jung Hwan; Shong, Young Kee; Sung, Tae-Yon; Hong, Suck Joon",Ann. surg. oncol,,59

However, none of them have succeeded, and they have only provided series of natural experiments. Although simulation studies seem to be helpful, there is no model that addresses the how much testing to be conducted to minimise the emerging infectious disease outbreaks. In this study, we develop a testing susceptible, infectious, exposed, recovered, and dead (testing-SEIRD) model using two discrete populations inside and outside hospitals. The populations that tested positive were isolated. Through the simulations, we examined the infectious spread represented by the number of cumulative deaths, hospitalisations, and positive tests, depending on examination strategies, testing characteristics, and hospitalisation capacity. We found all-or-none responses of either expansion or extinction of the infectious spreads, depending on the rates of follow-up and mass testing, which represent testing the people identified as close contacts with infected patients using follow-up surveys and people with symptoms, respectively. We also demonstrated that there were optimal and worst examination strategies, which were determined by the total resources and testing costs. The testing-SEIRD model is useful in making decisions on examination strategies for the emerging infectious disease outbreaks.","Onishi, Tatsuki; Honda, Naoki; Igarashi, Yasunobu",,,59

504660,Assessment of a food-warming cabinet for heat and humidity decontamination of n95 respirators,2021,"Contact tracing via smartphone applications is expected to be of major importance for maintaining control of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, viable deployment demands a minimal quarantine burden on the general public. That is, consideration must be given to unnecessary quarantining imposed by a contact tracing policy. Previous studies have modeled the role of contact tracing, but have not addressed how to balance these two competing needs. We propose a modeling framework that captures contact heterogeneity. This allows contact prioritization: contacts are only notified if they were acutely exposed to individuals who eventually tested positive. The framework thus allows us to address the delicate balance of preventing disease spread while minimizing the social and economic burdens of quarantine. This optimal contact tracing strategy is studied as a function of limitations in testing resources, partial technology adoption, and other intervention methods such as social distancing and lockdown measures. The framework is globally applicable, as the distribution describing contact heterogeneity is directly adaptable to any digital tracing implementation.","Lunz, Davin; Batt, Gregory; Ruess, Jakob",Epidemics,,59

The urgent needs for exploring the neutralizing antibodies from patients with different clinical characteristics are emerging. METHODS: A total of 117 blood samples were collected from 70 COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients. Antibodies were determined with a modified cytopathogenic neutralization assay (NA) based on live SARS-CoV-2 and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different time points with different clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6) by NA and 1:12441.7 (95% CI, 9754.5 to 15869.2) by ELISA. The antibody level by NA and ELISA peaked on day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-45, 46-60, and 61-84 had a higher neutralizing antibody level than those at age of 16-30 (ß=1.0470, P=0.0125; ß=1.0613, P=0.0307; ß=1.3713, P=0.0020).

The objective is to identify epidemiological, clinical and radiological factors considered as predictors of neurological involvement in patients with COVID-19 assessed by neuroimaging and to describe the neuroimaging findings. This retrospective study was performed with 232 consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients, from two radiological units, which were divided into two groups: (1) those who underwent a brain CT/MRI scan (n = 35) versus (2) those who did not undergo the brain CT/MRI scan, but underwent only chest CT (n = 197). There was a statistically significant difference with associations regarding the COVID-19 brain scan group for: admission to ICU, greater severity of lung injuries, the use of a mechanical ventilator and sepsis. Statistical tendency was found for chronic renal failure and systemic arterial hypertension. Forty-percent of COVID-19 patients from the brain scan group were abnormal on brain CT and/or brain MRI (22.9% of the cases with bleeding or microbleeding, 8.6% with restricted diffusion lesions). One ischemic stroke case was associated with irregularity at the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. There was a case of left facial nerve palsy with enhancement of the left geniculate ganglia. An analysis of the olfactory bulbs was possible in 12 brain MRIs and 100% had enhancement and/or microbleeding. In conclusion, a more severe COVID-19 disease from ICU, a more severe form of lung disease, the use of mechanical ventilator and sepsis were associated to the COVID-19 patients with neurological involvement who had undergone brain scans.

OBJECTIVES: The ""United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"" office in Ecuador in collaboration with ""Universidad de Las Américas"" performed surveillance screening at shelters for women victims of gender-based violence. They had been granted access to RT-qPCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis since July 2020, a few weeks after the general population lockdown was lifted. RESULTS: From 411 people tested, 52 tests were SARS-CoV-2 positive, yielding an overall high attack rate of 12.65%. Moreover, COVID-19 outbreaks were found in nine of 11 shelters that were included in the study. While attacks rates varied among shelters, no association was found with occupancy. CONCLUSION: This study is key to clarifying the epidemiological situation in this highly vulnerable population in Latin America. It highlights the importance of mass testing beyond the symptomatic population to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Vallejo-Janeta, Alexander Paolo; Morales-Jadan, Diana; Freire-Paspuel, Byron; Lozada, Tannya; Cherrez-Bohorquez, Cesar; Garcia-Bereguiain, Miguel Angel",Int J Infect Dis,,59
512083,"A Viral Pandemic, Vaccine Safety, and Compensation for Adverse Events",2021,"OBJECTIVES: The study aims to investigate GPs' experiences of how UK COVID-19 policies have affected the management and safety of complex elderly patients, who suffer from multimorbidity, at the primary care level in North West London (NWL). DESIGN: This is a service evaluation adopting a qualitative approach. SETTING: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted between 6 and 22 May 2020, 2 months after the introduction of the UK COVID-19 Action Plan, allowing GPs to adapt to the new changes and reflect on their impact. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen GPs working in NWL were interviewed, until data saturation was reached. OUTCOME MEASURES: The impact of COVID-19 policies on the management and safety of complex elderly patients in primary care from the GPs' perspective. RESULTS: Participants' average experience was fourteen years working in primary care for the NHS. They stated that COVID-19 policies have affected primary care at three levels, patients' behaviour, work conditions, and clinical practice. GPs reflected on the impact through five major themes; four of which have been adapted from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) framework, changes in primary care (at the three levels mentioned above), involvement of GPs in policy making, communication and coordination (with patients and in between medical teams), stressors and worries; in addition to a fifth theme to conclude the GPs' suggestions for improvement (either proposed mitigation strategies, or existing actions that showed relative success). A participant used an expression of ""infodemic"" to describe the GPs' everyday pressure of receiving new policy updates with their subsequent changes in practice. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all levels of the health system in the UK, particularly primary care. Based on the GPs' perspective in NWL, changes to practice have offered opportunities to maintain safe healthcare as well as possible drawbacks that should be of concern.","Alboksmaty, Ahmed; Kumar, Sonia; Parekh, Ravi; Aylin, Paul",PLoS One,,59

This study aimed to provide insights on dental hygienists' employment patterns as well as their attitudes toward working as dental hygienists during a pandemic.Methods: Licensed dental hygienists were invited to participate in a web-based 30-question survey between September 29 and October 8, 2020. Employment questions included current and pre-pandemic work status, reasons for not currently working as a dental hygienist, and estimated levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the primary work location. All statistical analysis was conducted in Qualtrics Core XM; cross tabulation was used to examine dental hygienist working patterns and attitudes by age, practice PPE supply, and other factors.Results: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an estimated 8% reduction in dental hygienist employment. The majority (59.1%, n=205) of this reduction is voluntary, with the main reason being general concerns over COVID-19 (48.3%, n=100). Other reasons include issues surrounding childcare and concerns over safety measures in the workplace. Dental hygienists aged 65 and older were most likely to have left the workforce voluntarily. More than half of respondents reported that their work locations had more than a two-week supply of most PPE items, although about 10% did not know supply levels. Dental hygienists working in settings with lower supplies of PPE were more concerned with COVID-19 transmission risk to themselves or to patients.Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to a reduction in the dental hygienist workforce that is likely to persist until the pandemic passes.The dental hygienist labor market has tightened and employers may continue to experience difficulties in filling vacant dental hygienist positions until the pandemic subsides. There is also likely to be a longer term, yet smaller, impact on dental hygiene employment levels.","Gurenlian, JoAnn R; Morrissey, Rachel; Estrich, Cameron G; Battrell, Ann; Bessner, Sue K; Lynch, Ann; Mikkelsen, Matthew; Araujo, Marcelo W B; Vujicic, Marko",J Dent Hyg,,59

513737,The rationale behind ayurveda codes of conduct (Aachar rasayana) in covid-19 like new disorders,2020,"PURPOSE: The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus poses unprecedented challenges to medical resources and infection prevention and control measures around the world. In this case, a rapid and effective detection method for COVID-19 can not only relieve the pressure of the medical system but find and isolate patients in time, to a certain extent, slow down the development of the epidemic. In this paper, we propose a method that can quickly and accurately diagnose whether pneumonia is viral pneumonia, and classify viral pneumonia in a fine-grained way to diagnose COVID-19. METHODS: We proposed a Cascade Squeeze-Excitation and Moment Exchange (Cascade-SEME) framework that can effectively detect COVID-19 cases by evaluating the chest x-ray images, where SE is the structure we designed in the network which has attention mechanism, and ME is a method for image enhancement from feature dimension. The framework integrates a model for a coarse level detection of virus cases among other forms of lung infection, and a model for fine-grained categorisation of pneumonia types identifying COVID-19 cases. In addition, a Regional Learning approach is proposed to mitigate the impact of non-lesion features on network training. The network output is also visualised, highlighting the likely areas of lesion, to assist experts' assessment and diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: Three datasets were used: a set of Chest x-ray Images for Classification with bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia and normal chest x-rays, a COVID chest x-ray dataset with COVID-19, and a Lung Segmentation dataset containing 1000 chest x-rays with masks in the lung region. We evaluated all the models on the test set. The results shows the proposed SEME structure significantly improves the performance of the models: in the task of pneumonia infection type diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F1 score of ResNet50 with SEME structure are significantly improved in each category, and the accuracy and AUC of the whole test set are also enhanced; in the detection task of COVID-19, the evaluation results shows that when SEME structure was added to the task, the sensitivities, specificities, accuracy and F1 scores of ResNet50 and DenseNet169 are improved. Although the sensitivities and specificities are not significantly promoted, SEME well balanced these two significant indicators. Regional learning also plays an important role. Experiments show that Regional Learning can effectively correct the impact of non-lesion features on the network, which can be seen in the Grad-CAM method. CONCLUSIONS: Experiments show that after the application of SEME structure in the network, the performance of SEME-ResNet50 and SEME-DenseNet169 in both two datasets show a clear enhancement. And the proposed regional learning method effectively directs the network's attention to focus on relevant pathological regions in the lung radiograph, ensuring the performance of the proposed framework even when a small training set is used. The visual interpretation step using Grad-CAM finds that the region of attention on radiographs of different types of pneumonia are located in different regions of the lungs.","Lv, Dailin; Wang, Yaqi; Wang, Shuai; Zhang, Qianni; Qi, Wuteng; Li, Yunxiang; Sun, Lingling",Med Phys,,59
514593,Through Plagues and Pandemics: The Evolution of Medical Face Masks,2020,"During the first few months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Canadian nursing homes implemented strict no-visitor policies to reduce the risk of introducing COVID-19 in these settings. There are now growing concerns that the risks associated with restricted access to family caregivers and visitors have started to outweigh the potential benefits associated with preventing COVID-19 infections. Many residents have sustained severe and potentially irreversible physical, functional, cognitive, and mental health declines. As Canada emerges from its first wave of the pandemic, nursing homes across the country have cautiously started to reopen these settings, yet there is broad criticism that emerging visitor policies are overly restrictive, inequitable, and potentially harmful. We reviewed the nursing home visitor policies for Canada's 10 provinces and 3 territories as well as international policies and reports on the topic to develop 10 provi-informed, data-driven, and expert-reviewed guidance for the re-opening of Canadian nursing homes to family caregivers and visitors.","Stall, Nathan M; Johnstone, Jennie; McGeer, Allison J; Dhuper, Misha; Dunning, Julie; Sinha, Samir K",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,59

515735,Ethical Considerations in Vaccine Allocation,2021,"Background: Over 50 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed globally as of November 2020. Evidence is rapidly emerging on the epidemiology of COVID-19, and its impact on individuals and potential burden on health services and society. Between 10-35% of people with COVID-19 may experience post-acute long Covid. This currently equates to between 8,129 and 28,453 people in Scotland. Some of these people will require rehabilitation to support their recovery. Currently, we do not know how to optimally configure community rehabilitation services for people with long Covid. Methods: This national survey aimed to provide a detailed description of current community rehabilitation provision for people with long Covid in Scotland. We developed, piloted, and conducted a national electronic survey of current community rehabilitation service provision for people presenting with long Covid symptomatology. Our sample were the Allied Health Professions Directors of all 14 territorial NHS Health Boards in Scotland. Fixed response and narrative data were analysed descriptively. Results: Responses were received from all respondents (14/14), enabling a national picture to be gained. Almost all Health Boards (13/14) currently deliver rehabilitation for people with long Covid within pre-existing services. Fatigue (11/14) and respiratory conditions (9/14) were the two most common presenting problems of patients. Most long Covid community rehabilitation services are delivered through a combination of face-to-face and digital contact (13/14). Conclusions: Community rehabilitation for people with long Covid is an emerging reality. This survey provides a national picture of current community rehabilitation for people with long Covid. We do not know how community rehabilitation can be optimally delivered for this population. This is vital as community rehabilitation services were already under pressure prior to the emergence of COVID-19. Further research is urgently required to investigate the implementation, outcomes and cost-effectiveness of differing models of community rehabilitation for this patient population. © 2021 Duncan E et al.","Duncan, E.; Cooper, K.; Cowie, J.; Alexander, L.; Morris, J.; Preston, J.",,,59
515736,Ethical Considerations in Vaccine Allocation,2021,"In semantic segmentation, we aim to train a pixel-level classifier to assign category labels to all pixels in an image, where labeled training images and unlabeled test images are from the same distribution and share the same label set. However, in an open world, the unlabeled test images probably contain unknown categories and have different distributions from the labeled images. Hence, in this paper, we consider a new, more realistic, and more challenging problem setting where the pixel-level classifier has to be trained with labeled images and unlabeled open-world images -- we name it open world semantic segmentation (OSS). In OSS, the trained classifier is expected to identify unknown-class pixels and classify known-class pixels well. To solve OSS, we first investigate which distribution that unknown-class pixels obey. Then, motivated by the goodness-of-fit test, we use statistical measurements to show how a pixel fits the distribution of an unknown class and select highly-fitted pixels to form the unknown region in each image. Eventually, we propose an end-to-end learning framework, known-region-aware domain alignment (KRADA), to distinguish unknown classes while aligning distributions of known classes in labeled and unlabeled open-world images. The effectiveness of KRADA has been verified on two synthetic tasks and one COVID-19 segmentation task.","Zhou, Chenhong; Liu, Feng; Gong, Chen; Liu, Tongliang; Han, Bo; Cheung, William",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06237v1.pdf,59

The uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-6, is associated with ARDS. This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of ß-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom Lentinus edodes on the reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of our novel in 'house' (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis. CL comprised higher amounts of &#945;-glucans and correspondingly less ß-glucans. The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine-induced NF-&#954;B activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses. In contrast, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-&#945;, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-ß and IL-10. The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate significant physicochemical differences between Lentinan extracts, which produce differential in vitro immunomodulatory and pulmonary cytoprotective effects that may also have positive relevance to candidate COVID-19 therapeutics targeting cytokine storm.","Murphy, Emma J; Masterson, Claire; Rezoagli, Emanuele; O039,; Toole, Daniel; Major, Ian; Stack, Gary D; Lynch, Mark; Laffey, John G; Rowan, Neil J",Sci Total Environ,,59

Important contributions are in terms of assessing the effect of the temporary short selling ban on restricted health-care stocks;the effect of COVID-19 cases and crude oil price volatility onto health-care stocks;and whether COVID-19 resulted in a change in the risk and average stock price of health-care stocks. Design/methodology/approach The methodology involves impulse responses to capture the shock of the short selling ban onto health-care stocks, and Markov switching regimes to capture the effect of COVID-19 onto the risk and prices in the health-care industry. Daily data from 9 November 2018 till 23 December 2020 is used. Findings Findings suggest there were significant changes in average prices in health-care technology and health-care services stocks before, during and after the short selling ban. Shocks to the number of COVID-19 cases and crude oil price volatility impacted health-care stocks but lasted only for a few days. While daily changes in the number of COVID-19 cases impacted some health-care stocks in the presence of a two-state Markov regime, insignificant coefficients and relatively low duration suggest that the short selling policy did not significantly change the average price and risk in health-care stocks to explain a two-state regime in the health-care industry. Research limitations/implications Insignificant coefficients in a two-state Markov regime reinforce that short-selling policies have a short-lasting effect onto health-care equity prices. The findings are limited by the duration of the short selling policy, the pandemic event and the health-care industry. Originality/value This is the first study to look at the impact of early COVID-19 and short selling ban policy on health-care stocks.","Gurrib, I.",Studies in Economics and Finance,,59

519899,In brief: Suspension of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine lifted,2021,"BACKGROUND: Ras-GTPase activating protein SH3-domain-binding proteins (G3BP) are a small family of RNA-binding proteins implicated in regulating gene expression. Changes in expression of G3BPs are correlated to several cancers including thyroid, colon, pancreatic and breast cancer. G3BPs are important regulators of stress granule (SG) formation and function. SG are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that respond to cellular stresses to triage mRNA resulting in transcripts being selectively degraded, stored or translated resulting in a change of gene expression which confers a survival response to the cell. These changes in gene expression contribute to the development of drug resistance. Many RNA viruses, including Chikungunya (and potentially Coronavirus), dismantle SG so that the cell cannot respond to the viral infection. Non-structural protein 3 (nsP3), from the Chikungunya virus, has been shown to translocate G3BP away from SG. Interestingly in cancer cells, the formation of SG is correlated to drug-resistance and blocking SG formation has been shown to reestablish the efficacy of the anticancer drug bortezomib. METHODS: Chikungunya nsP3 was transfected into breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 to disrupt SG formation. Changes in the cytotoxicity of bortezomib were measured. RESULTS: Bortezomib cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines changed with a 22 fold decrease in its IC50 for T47D and a 7 fold decrease for MCF7 cells.

Presently, there is no approved treatment for COVID-19. Consequently, the clinical, scientific, and regulatory authorities have joint efforts to reduce the severe impact of COVID-19. To date, there is minimal arsenal with no definite curative drugs, licensed-vaccines, or therapeutic conducts to combat the COVID-19 infections. Keeping in view the threats of this pandemic, various global organizations, physicians, researchers, and scientists, are trying to recognize the epidemiological characteristics and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 to discover potential treatment regimens, vaccines, and therapeutic modes for future anticipation. Herein, we summarize a contemporary overview of curative invasions and vaccines for COVID-19 based on the earlier information and considerate of similar earlier RNA coronaviruses. The information reviewed here establishes a paramount intellectual basis to promote ongoing research to develop vaccines and curative agents.

Our analyses were performed using a supercomputing DreamLab App platform, harnessing the idle computational power of thousands of smartphones. Machine learning models were initially calibrated by demonstrating that the proposed method can predict anti-COVID-19 candidates among experimental and clinically approved drugs (5658 in total) targeting COVID-19 interactomics with the balanced classification accuracy of 80-85% in 5-fold cross-validated settings. This identified the most promising drug candidates that can be potentially ""repurposed"" against COVID-19 including common drugs used to combat cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin and metformin. A database of 7694 bioactive food-based molecules was run through the calibrated machine learning algorithm, which identified 52 biologically active molecules, from varied chemical classes, including flavonoids, terpenoids, coumarins and indoles predicted to target SARS-CoV-2-host interactome networks. This in turn was used to construct a ""food map"" with the theoretical anti-COVID-19 potential of each ingredient estimated based on the diversity and relative levels of candidate compounds with antiviral properties.

522684,What Is Anosmia?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is rapidly progressive, severe, and refractory to conventional therapies. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used as a supportive therapy to improve outcomes but evidence-based guidelines have not been defined. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Initial mortality rates associated with ECMO for ARDS in COVID-19 were high, leading some to believe that there was no role for ECMO in this viral illness. With more experience, outcomes have improved. The ideal candidate, timing of cannulation, and best post-cannulation management strategy, however, has not yet been defined. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review from April 1 to July 31 2020 of the first 25 patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS placed on V-V ECMO at our institution. We analyzed the differences between survivors to hospital discharge and those who died. Modified Poisson regression was used to model adjusted risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: 44% of patients (11/25) survived to hospital discharge. Survivors were significantly younger (40.5 years vs. 53.1 years; p < 0.001) with no differences between cohorts in mean body mass index, diabetes, or PaO2:FiO2 at cannulation. Survivors had shorter duration from symptom onset to cannulation (12.5 days vs. 19.9 days, p = 0.028) and shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) prior to cannulation (5.6 days vs. 11.7 days, p = 0.045). Each day from ICU admission to cannulation increased the adjusted risk of death by 4% and each year increase in age increased the adjusted risk 6%. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO has a role in severe, refractory ARDS associated with COVID-19. Increasing age and time from ICU admission were risk factors for mortality and should be considered in patient selection. Further studies are needed to define best practices for V-V ECMO use in COVID-19.","Raff, Lauren A; Gallaher, Jared R; Johnson, Daniel; Raff, Evan J; Charles, Anthony G; Reid, Trista S",Ann. surg,,59
522859,WiC-TSV: An Evaluation Benchmark for Target Sense Verification of Words in Context,2020-04-30,"SIGNIFICANCE: SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, affects every aspect of human life by challenging bodily, socio-economic and political systems at unprecedented levels. As vaccines become available, their distribution, safety and efficacy against emerging variants remain uncertain, and specific treatments are lacking. Recent Advances: Initially affecting the lungs, COVID-19 is a complex multi-systems disease that disturbs whole-body redox balance and can be long-lasting (Long-COVID). Numerous risk factors have been identified, but reasons for variations in susceptibility to infection, disease severity and outcome are poorly understood. The reactive species interactome (RSI) was recently introduced as a framework to conceptualise how cells and whole organisms sense, integrate and accommodate stress. CRITICAL ISSUES: We here consider COVID-19 as a redox disease, offering a holistic perspective of its effects on the human body, considering the vulnerability of complex interconnected systems with multi-organ/multi-level interdependencies. Host/viral glycan interactions underpin SARS-CoV-2's extraordinary efficiency in gaining cellular access, crossing the epithelial/endothelial barrier to spread along the vascular/lymphatic endothelium, and evading antiviral/antioxidant defences. An inflammation-driven 'oxidative storm' alters the redox landscape, eliciting epithelial, endothelial, mitochondrial, metabolic and immune dysfunction, and coagulopathy. Concomitantly reduced nitric oxide availability renders the sulfur-based redox circuitry vulnerable to oxidation, with eventual catastrophic failure in redox communication/regulation. Host nutrient limitations are crucial determinants of resilience at individual and population level. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: While inflicting considerable damage to health and wellbeing, COVID-19 may provide the ultimate testing ground to improve diagnosis and treatment of redox-related stress diseases. 'Redox phenotyping' of patients to characterise whole-body RSI status as the disease progresses may inform new therapeutic approaches to regain redox balance, reduce mortality in COVID-19 and other redox diseases, and provide opportunities to tackle Long-COVID.","Cumpstey, Andrew F; Clark, Anna D; Santolini, Jerome; Jackson, Alan A; Feelisch, Martin",Antioxid. redox signal,,59

This study re-evaluates the effectiveness of IFN-&#945;2b during the period from March 11 to June 17, 2020. Patients received a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of IFN-&#945;2b. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital; the secondary endpoint was the case fatality rate, and several outcomes related to time variables were also evaluated. From March 11 to June 17, 2,295 patients had been confirmed to be severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive in Cuba, 2,165 were treated with Heberon® Alpha R, and 130 received the approved protocol without IFN. The proportion of fully recovered patients was higher in the IFN-treated compared with the non-IFN-treated group. Prior IFN treatment decreases the likelihood of intensive care and increases the survival after severe or critical diseases. Benefits of IFN were significantly supported by time variables analyzed. This second report confirmed our preliminary evidence about the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN-&#945;2b in SARS-CoV-2 infection and postulated Heberon Alpha R as the main component within antiviral drugs used in the Cuban protocol COVID-19.","Pereda, Ricardo; González, Daniel; Rivero, Hubert Blas; Rivero, Juan Carlos; Pérez, Albadio; Lopez, Lissette Del Rosario; Mezquia, Natacha; Venegas, Rafael; Betancourt, Julio Roberto; Domínguez, Rodolfo Emilio; Nodarse, Hugo",J Interferon Cytokine Res,,59

Tyrol is known for numerous skiing areas. Thus, winter sport resorts became a starting point for COVID-19 infections spreading towards the rest of the state, Austria and other countries, leading to a mandatory quarantine for almost a million people, who were placed under a curfew and restrictions in daily life. Additionally, all ski resorts and hotels were closed. We aimed to analyze the influence of the COVID-19 quarantine on traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases in Tyrol. METHODS: We retrospectively compared demographical and injury characteristics from all TBI patients within the 2020 strict quarantine period with the respective time periods from 2016 to 2019. As our department is the only neurosurgical unit in Tyrol, all patients with moderate or severe TBI are transferred to our hospital. RESULTS: During 3 weeks of the full quarantine period, the weekly TBI cases load decreased significantly in comparison to the same time periods in the years 2016-2019. Furthermore, concomitant skull fractures decreased significantly (p < 0.016), probably reflecting different causative mechanisms. The other demographical and injury characteristics and particularly falls at home stayed relatively unchanged. CONCLUSION: TBI remained an important contributor to the neurosurgical workflow during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We find that “objective” measures of lockdown affectedness and economic structure explain fairly well how businesses availed of support measures to cover labour costs. Recourse to government-backed corona loans, however, appears to be driven to a larger extent by behavioural idiosyncrasies across firms. Specifically, previously indebted businesses took out corona loans more readily than those who had been debt-free before the pandemic. Since uptake is not well in line with firm fundamentals, we propose making loan repayments contingent on future profits.

Given the dangerousness and the extent of the contagion, almost no one has questioned the suggestions that these experts have advised policymakers to implement. Quite often the latter explicitly sought experts' advice and justified unpopular measures (e.g., restricting people's freedom of movement) by referring to the epistemic authority attributed to experts. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the basis of this epistemic authority and the reasons why in this case it has not been challenged, contrary to the widespread tendency to devalue expertise that has been observed in recent years. In addition, in relation to the fact that experts' recommendations are generally technical and supposedly neutral, we note that in the COVID-19 crisis different experts have suggested different public health policies. We consider the British case of herd immunity and the US case of the exclusion of disabled people from medical care. These decisions have strong axiological implications and affect people profoundly in very sensitive domains. Another goal is, therefore, to argue that in such cases experts should justify their recommendations-which effectively become obligations-by the canons of public reason within the political process because when values are involved it is no longer just a matter of finding the “best technical solution,” but also of making discretionary choices that affect citizens and that cannot be imposed solely on the basis of epistemic authority.","Lavazza, Andrea; Farina, Mirko",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32760690/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00356,59

In addition to occupational risk factors, the increased use of telecommunication and changed work environment may contribute to voice and vocal tract discomfort (VTD). This study established the prevalence, incidence, characteristics and impact of self-perceived dysphonia and VTD in those working from home during COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study using an online survey recruited 1575 participants. It captured information about dysphonia and VTD presence, onset and severity. Those with dysphonia completed the V-RQOL to measure impact. Regression analyses identified risk factors for voice and vocal tract problems. RESULTS: Dysphonia and VTD prevalence rates were 33% and 68% respectively, incidences were 28% and 50%. Perceived dysphonia severity was mild in 72% of cases. Dry throat was the most common VTD symptom at 66%. Mean V-RQOL score was 82.4 (SD ±13.2). Raising or straining the voice while working predicted new onset dysphonia and VTD. Increasing telecommunication use was associated with worse dysphonia and VTD onset. CONCLUSION: Those working from home have seen a rise in dysphonia and VTD, which were associated with communication modality and change in environment. If home offices become the ‘new normal’ post-COVID, workplaces should consider voice training for employees to limit potential difficulties.","Kenny, Ciarán",J Voice,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892199720303842?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2020.10.010; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0892199720303842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33223124/,59

Isatin itself is an endogenous oxidized indole with a wide spectrum of behavioral and metabolic effects. It has a distinct and discontinuous distribution in the brain, peripheral tissues and body fluids and isatin binding sites are widely distributed also. Its output is increased during stress. Its most potent known in vitro actions are as an antagonist of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) function and NO signaling. As we understand more about its function and sites of action we may be able to develop new pharmacological agents to mimic or counteract its activity.

Although there is a substantial body of literature characterizing the microbial community found in wastewater, only a few studies have characterized the viral component of WTC aerosols, despite the fact that most diseases affecting WTC workers are of viral origin and that some of these viruses are transmitted through the air. In this study, we evaluated in four WTCs the presence of 11 viral pathogens of particular concern in this milieu and used a metagenomic approach to characterize the total viral community in the air of one of those WTCs. The presence of viruses in aerosols in different locations of individual WTCs was evaluated and the results obtained with four commonly used air samplers were compared. We detected four of the eleven viruses tested, including human adenovirus (hAdV), rotavirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Herpes Simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). The results of the metagenomic assay uncovered very few viral RNA sequences in WTC aerosols, however sequences from human DNA viruses were in much greater relative abundance.","Brisebois, Evelyne; Veillette, Marc; Dion-Dupont, Vanessa; Lavoie, Jacques; Corbeil, Jacques; Culley, Alexander; Duchaine, Caroline",J Environ Sci (China),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2017.07.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074217305120; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1001074217305120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778173/,59
595794,Teaching microbiology in times of plague,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence from health emergencies suggests COVID-19 will disrupt women’s sexual and reproductive health (SRH). In sub-Saharan Africa, which experiences the highest rates of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion globally, COVID-19 is projected to slow recent progress toward universal access to contraceptive services. METHODS: We used longitudinal data collected from women at risk of unintended pregnancy in Burkina Faso (n=1186) and Kenya (n=2784) before (November 2019–February 2020) and during (May–July 2020) COVID-19 to quantify contraceptive dynamics during COVID-19; examine sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 experiences related to contraceptive dynamics; and assess COVID-19-related reasons for contraceptive non-use. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine correlates of contraceptive dynamics amid COVID-19. RESULTS: Most women did not change their contraceptive status during COVID-19 (68.6% in Burkina Faso and 81.6% in Kenya) and those who did were more likely to adopt a method (25.4% and 13.1%, respectively) than to discontinue (6.0% and 5.3%, respectively). Most women who switched contraceptives were using methods as or more effective than their pre-pandemic contraception. Economic instability related to COVID-19 was associated with increased contraceptive protection in Burkina Faso but not in Kenya. Altogether, 14.4% of non-contraceptive users in Kenya and 3.8% in Burkina Faso identified COVID-19-related reasons for non-use. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of women at risk of unintended pregnancy did not change their contraceptive status during COVID-19, and more women adopted than discontinued methods. A minority of women reported COVID-19-related reasons for non-use, underscoring the importance of expanding safe modes of service delivery during health crises.","Karp, Celia; Wood, Shannon N; Guiella, Georges; Gichangi, Peter; Bell, Suzanne O; Anglewicz, Philip; Larson, Elizabeth; Zimmerman, Linnea; Moreau, Caroline",BMJ Sex Reprod Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-200944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33579717/,59

For many, the impacts of this global pandemic have been insurmountable and have resulted in significant stressors. Although medical advances have allowed individuals to slowly begin to restore their sense of normalcy, COVID-19 has resulted in unprecedented mental health impacts for many, especially children and adolescents. The present study examines whether stressors related to COVID-19 and whether subsequent quarantine/isolation were possible contributors to psychiatric crises that led to adolescent psychiatric inpatient admissions. Electronic medical records of those admitted to Strong Memorial Hospital's Child and Adolescent Inpatient Unit between March 13, 2020 and January 1, 2021 were reviewed. Admission and discharge notes were analyzed to determine the presence and context of keywords related to COVID-19. Approximately, 53% of all adolescent psychiatric crises that led to inpatient admission were related to COVID-19 stressors. Results of this study will be used to help understand the extraordinary mental health impacts of a global pandemic and will assist mental health service leaders to better plan for patient flow should there be another wave of quarantine/isolation. Additionally, these results can help inform and develop pandemic-related strategies and interventions that can reduce overall distress in children and adolescents.","Reece, Leah; Sams, Deanna P",Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211030666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34229484/,59

Given that these limitations could impact successful telemedicine use, we aimed to investigate the experiences of patients with parkinsonism using telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 19-item survey was emailed to patients with parkinsonism following telemedicine visits at a single US tertiary care parkinsonism specialty clinic. Seventy-four individuals responded, out of 270 invitations sent. Almost two-thirds (61.6%) of the respondents were comfortable with using technology in general, and almost all were very satisfied with their telemedicine experience. The most commonly reported benefits included cost and travel savings, ease of access to a specialist, and time savings. Issues with technology and previsit instructions were the most commonly identified challenges (28%). Urgent implementation, due to the pandemic, of telemedicine care for patients with parkinsonism was feasible and well received.

599426,The spread of macroscopic droplets from a simulated cough with and without the use of masks or barriers,2021-05-05,"Papain-like protease (PLpro) of coronaviruses (CoVs) carries out proteolytic maturation of non-structural proteins that play a role in replication of the virus and performs deubiquitination of host cell factors to scuttle antiviral responses. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent of bronchitis in chicken that results in huge economic losses every year in the poultry industry globally, encodes a PLpro. The substrate specificities of this PLpro are not clearly understood. Here, we show that IBV PLpro can degrade Lys(48)- and Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitin chains to monoubiquitin but not linear polyubiquitin. To explain the substrate specificities, we have solved the crystal structure of PLpro from IBV at 2.15-Å resolution. The overall structure is reminiscent of the structure of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV PLpro. However, unlike the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV PLpro that lacks blocking loop (BL) 1 of deubiquitinating enzymes, the IBV PLpro has a short BL1-like loop. Access to a conserved catalytic triad consisting of Cys(101), His(264), and Asp(275) is regulated by the flexible BL2. A model of ubiquitin-bound IBV CoV PLpro brings out key differences in substrate binding sites of PLpros. In particular, P3 and P4 subsites as well as residues interacting with the β-barrel of ubiquitin are different, suggesting different catalytic efficiencies and substrate specificities. We show that IBV PLpro cleaves peptide substrates KKAG-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin and LRGG-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin with different catalytic efficiencies. These results demonstrate that substrate specificities of IBV PLpro are different from other PLpros and that IBV PLpro might target different ubiquitinated host factors to aid the propagation of the virus.","Kong, Lingying; Shaw, Neil; Yan, Lingming; Lou, Zhiyong; Rao, Zihe",J Biol Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820767906; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m114.628636; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820767906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609249/,59

The system is composed of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) array, together with CRISPR (cas)-associated genes. This system consists of a complex machinery that integrates fragments of foreign nucleic acids from viruses and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), into CRISPR arrays. The inserted segments (spacers) are transcribed and then used by cas proteins as guide RNAs for recognition and inactivation of the targets. Different types and families of CRISPR-Cas systems consist of distinct adaptation and effector modules with evolutionary trajectories, partially independent. The origin of the effector modules and the mechanism of spacer integration/deletion is far less clear. A review of the most recent data regarding the structure, ecology, and evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems and their role in the modulation of accessory genomes in prokaryotes is proposed in this article. The CRISPR-Cas system&apos;s impact on the physiology and ecology of prokaryotes, modulation of horizontal gene transfer events, is also discussed here. This system gained popularity after it was proposed as a tool for plant and animal embryo editing, in cancer therapy, as antimicrobial against pathogenic bacteria, and even for combating the novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2; thus, the newest and promising applications are reviewed as well.","Butiuc-Keul, Anca; Farkas, Anca; Carpa, Rahela; Iordache, Dumitrana",Microb Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1159/000516643; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192695/,59

We show how COVID‐19 is a complex series of multispecies encounters shaped by humans, non‐human animals, and of course viruses. Central to these encounters is a politics of difference in which certain human lives are protected and helped to flourish while others, both human and animal, are forgotten if not sacrificed. Such difference encompasses practices of racialisation and racism, healthcare austerity, the circulation of capital, border‐making, intervention into non‐human nature, wildlife trade bans, anthropocentrism, and the exploitation of animal test subjects. The contributions highlight how COVID‐19 provides a needed opportunity to unite new materialist and anti‐racist, anti‐colonial scholarship as well as reimagine more radically sustainable multispecies futures. This requires embracing anti‐colonial humility, confronting debts owed to lab animal frontline workers, and rethinking economic systems that helped unleash COVID‐19 and ensured it became a disaster.","Lunstrum, Elizabeth; Ahuja, Neel; Braun, Bruce; Collard, Rosemary; Lopez, Patricia J.; Wong, Rebecca W.Y.",Antipode,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230712/; https://doi.org/10.1111/anti.12730,59

Objectives To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the seroprevalence and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in a maternity ward in an area that has been significantly affected by the virus. Study design Prospective study at the Antoine Beclere Hospital maternity ward (Paris area, France) from May 4 (one week before the end of lockdown) to May 31, 2020 (three weeks after the end of lockdown). All patients admitted to the delivery room during this period were offered a SARS-CoV-2 serology test as well concomitant SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample. Results A total of 249 women were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 8%. The RT-PCR positive rate was 0.5%. 47.4% of the SARS-CoV-2-IgG-positive pregnant women never experienced any symptoms. A history of symptoms during the epidemic, such as fever, myalgia and anosmia, was suggestive of previous infection. Conclusions Three weeks after the end of lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 infections were scarce in our region. A high proportion of SARS-CoV-2-IgG-negative pregnant women must be taken into consideration in the event of a resurgence of the pandemic in order to adapt public health measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as social distancing and teleworking for this specific population.","Mattern, Jeremie; Vauloup-Fellous, Christelle; Zakaria, Hoda; Benachi, Alexandra; Carrara, Julie; Letourneau, Alexandra; Bourgeois-Nicolaos, Nadege; Luca, Daniele De; Doucet-Populaire, Florence; Vivanti, Alexandre J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.14.20153304v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.20153304,59

METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative design. A logical framework based on the theoretical underpinning of public health functions of the government in the prevention and control of a major public health crisis was constructed. We compared the public health functions of the Chinese government and the effectiveness of these functions for COVID-19. RESULTS: The defects of the public health functions of the Chinese government in the prevention and control of COVID-19 include a lack of crisis prediction, initiative and timeliness in crisis early warning functions; weak crisis security functions; and a lack of functions for handling the aftermath. The Chinese government should improve its crisis early warning functions, strengthen its crisis security functions, and establish functions for handling the aftermath. CONCLUSION: The defects of the public health functions of the Chinese government in the prevention and control of COVID-19 can provide referential value for other countries. Especially, by continuously improving the construction of standard pandemic early warning procedures and regulations, optimizing the pandemic treatment system, and strengthening the fairness and accessibility of medical services, countries with severe pandemic situations may be able to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on public health more efficiently.","Zhang, Pengfei",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s284251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519248/,59

605148,Pandemic Vaccines: How Are We Going to Be Better Prepared Next Time?,2020-12-18,"To date only a handful of duplicated genes have been described in RNA viruses. This shortage can be attributed to different factors, including the RNA viruses with high mutation rate that would make a large genome more prone to acquire deleterious mutations. This may explain why sequence-based approaches have only found duplications in their most recent evolutionary history. To detect earlier duplications, we performed protein tertiary structure comparisons for every RNA virus family represented in the Protein Data Bank. We present a list of thirty pairs of possible paralogs with <30 per cent sequence identity. It is argued that these pairs are the outcome of six duplication events. These include the α and β subunits of the fungal toxin KP6 present in the dsRNA Ustilago maydis virus (family Totiviridae), the SARS-CoV (Coronaviridae) nsp3 domains SUD-N, SUD-M and X-domain, the Picornavirales (families Picornaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Iflaviridae and Secoviridae) capsid proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3, and the Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae) 3C and 2A cysteine-proteases.

However, metabolic adverse effects including muscle wasting restrict their use. The enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) modulates peripheral glucocorticoid responses through pre-receptor metabolism. This study investigates how 11β-HSD1 influences skeletal muscle responses to glucocorticoid therapy for chronic inflammation. We assessed human skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis for 11β-HSD1 activity ex vivo. Using the TNF-α-transgenic mouse model (TNF-tg) of chronic inflammation, we examined the effects of corticosterone treatment and 11β-HSD1 global knock-out (11βKO) on skeletal muscle, measuring anti-inflammatory gene expression, muscle weights, fiber size distribution, and catabolic pathways. Muscle 11β-HSD1 activity was elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and correlated with inflammation markers. In murine skeletal muscle, glucocorticoid administration suppressed IL6 expression in TNF-tg mice but not in TNF-tg(11βKO) mice. TNF-tg mice exhibited reductions in muscle weight and fiber size with glucocorticoid therapy. In contrast, TNF-tg(11βKO) mice were protected against glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy. Glucocorticoid-mediated activation of catabolic mediators (FoxO1, Trim63) was also diminished in TNF-tg(11βKO) compared to TNF-tg mice. In summary, 11β-HSD1 knock-out prevents muscle atrophy associated with glucocorticoid therapy in a model of chronic inflammation. Targeting 11β-HSD1 may offer a strategy to refine the safety of glucocorticoids.","Webster, Justine M.; Sagmeister, Michael S.; Fenton, Chloe G.; Seabright, Alex P.; Lai, Yu-Chiang; Jones, Simon W.; Filer, Andrew; Cooper, Mark S.; Lavery, Gareth G.; Raza, Karim; Langen, Ramon; Hardy, Rowan S.",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22157828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360594/,59

We show that using data from bank records it is possible to measure economic inequality at high frequency. The approach proposed in this paper allows measuring, timely and accurately, the impact on inequality of fast-unfolding crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying this approach to data from a representative sample of over three million residents of Spain we find that, absent government intervention, inequality would have increased by almost 30% in just one month. The granularity of the data allows analyzing with great detail the sources of the increases in inequality. In the Spanish case we find that it is primarily driven by job losses and wage cuts experienced by low-wage earners. Government support, in particular extended unemployment insurance and benefits for furloughed workers, were generally effective at mitigating the increase in inequality, though less so among young people and foreign-born workers. Therefore, our approach provides knowledge on the evolution of inequality at high frequency, the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the increase of inequality and the subgroups of the population most affected by the changes in inequality. This information is fundamental to fine-tune public policies on the wake of a fast-moving pandemic like the COVID-19.","Aspachs, Oriol; Durante, Ruben; Graziano, Alberto; Mestres, Josep; Reynal-Querol, Marta; Montalvo, Jose G.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33788886/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249121,59

A concurrent nested mixed-method design was adopted. Quantitative data analysis included pathway mapping of facilities and services used throughout their lives. For qualitative data, interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was applied. Eleven South Korean (congenital 7, acquired 4) and nine Japanese (congenital 6, acquired 3) participants were surveyed and interviewed. Pathway mapping was conducted by classifying the participants into focus groups. South Korean participants took nine years more than the Japanese participants to reach independence and showed different pathway characteristics. Superordinate themes from the IPA provided insight into the differences in experiences between PWSPD of the two countries: (1) accessibility and continuity of medical services; (2) experience of vocational training; (3) way and degree of social support for independent living; (4) care planning for receiving comprehensive services. In developing a community care model for the PWSPD to accelerate their time to independence, the government should strive for accessibility and connectivity of medical services, strengthen vocational training, social support for independent living, and information provision for the PWSPD.","Lee, Minyoung; Choi, Yeji; Lee, Eun Young; Kim, Dong-A; Ho, Seung Hee",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317015/,59

611764,What Lies Ahead,2021,"BACKGROUND: The vast sequence divergence among different virus groups has presented a great challenge to alignment-based analysis of virus phylogeny. Due to the problems caused by the uncertainty in alignment, existing tools for phylogenetic analysis based on multiple alignment could not be directly applied to the whole-genome comparison and phylogenomic studies of viruses. There has been a growing interest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data. Among the alignment-free methods, a dynamical language (DL) method proposed by our group has successfully been applied to the phylogenetic analysis of bacteria and chloroplast genomes. RESULTS: In this paper, the DL method is used to analyze the whole-proteome phylogeny of 124 large dsDNA viruses and 30 parvoviruses, two data sets with large difference in genome size. The trees from our analyses are in good agreement to the latest classification of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). CONCLUSIONS: The present method provides a new way for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses and parvoviruses, and also some insights on the affiliation of a number of unclassified viruses. In comparison, some alignment-free methods such as the CV Tree method can be used for recovering the phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses, but they are not suitable for resolving the phylogeny of parvoviruses with a much smaller genome size.","Yu, Zu-Guo; Chu, Ka Hou; Li, Chi Pang; Anh, Vo; Zhou, Li-Qian; Wang, Roger Wei",BMC Evol Biol,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-10-192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20565983/,59

Faced with this novel coronavirus, scientists have been trying to use drugs that have not been validated by rigorous clinical trials, such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). These drugs may be used tentatively for general population with COVID‐19, but for solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with long‐term immunosuppressive therapy and drug‐related metabolic diseases, antiviral drugs should be chosen with particular care. Notably, the elderly SOT patients commonly suffer from liver and kidney dysfunction of varying degrees, resulting in worse drug metabolism.","Xia, Tian; Wang, Yanfeng",Am J Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32400965/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15992,59

Data were collected from undergraduate students who experienced a fully online learning process during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Based on social cognitive theory, the relationships among the personal and environmental influences on student behaviour and outcomes were examined using structural equation modelling. The results indicated that academic self-efficacy had significant direct relationships with behavioural engagement and emotional engagement, while perceived usefulness significantly influenced emotional engagement and cognitive engagement. Furthermore, teaching presence significantly influenced all engagement dimensions. Student satisfaction was significantly and directly influenced by behavioural engagement and emotional engagement, but not by cognitive engagement. Finally, the mediation role of each engagement dimension is proven in this study. This study was conducted in Egypt; thus, it contributes to add an empirical evidence regarding online student engagement and satisfaction in the context of a developing country.","El-Sayad, Ghada; Md Saad, Nor Hasliza; Thurasamy, Ramayah",J,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40692-021-00191-y,59

It is of equal importance to evaluate the risk of transmission in children who are often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers that may incidentally transmit SARS-CoV-2 in different settings. We conducted this review to assess transmission and risks for SARS-CoV-2 in children (by age-groups or grades) in community and educational-settings compared to adults. METHODS: Data for the review were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, WHO COVID-19 Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Database, WanFang Database, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Google Scholar, and preprints from medRixv and bioRixv) covering a timeline from December 1, 2019 to April 1, 2021. Population-screening, contact-tracing and cohort studies reporting prevalence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in children were included. Data were extracted according to PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Ninety studies were included. Compared to adults, children showed comparable national (risk ratio (RR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.71-1.060 and subnational (RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.66-1.01) prevalence in population-screening studies, and lower odds of infection in community/household contact-tracing studies (odds ratio (OR) = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.46-0.84). On disaggregation, adolescents observed comparable risk (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.74-2.04) with adults. In educational-settings, children attending daycare/preschools (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.38-0.72) were observed to be at lower-risk when compared to adults, with odds of infection among primary (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.55-1.31) and high-schoolers (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.71-2.38) comparable to adults. Overall, children and adolescents had lower odds of infection in educational-settings compared to community and household clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Children (<10 years) showed lower susceptibility to COVID-19 compared to adults, whereas adolescents in communities and high-schoolers had comparable risk. Risks of infection among children in educational-settings was lower than in communities. Evidence from school-based studies demonstrate it is largely safe for children (<10 years) to be at schools, however older children (10-19 years) might facilitate transmission. Despite this evidence, studies focusing on the effectiveness of mitigation measures in educational settings are urgently needed to support both public health and educational policy-making for school reopening.","Irfan, Omar; Li, Jiang; Tang, Kun; Wang, Zhicheng; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",J Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326997/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.05013,59
614868,Using Surgical Suction During Sedation to minimize the spread of aerosols,2020-11-26,"Nucleocapsid protein plays a critical role in SARS-CoV pathogenesis, and high-level anti-nucleocapsid antibodies are detected in the patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several studies have shown that there exists an interaction between nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) protein. In this paper, we investigate whether the expression of membrane protein can affect the immune responses induced by nucleocapsid DNA immunization. Two recombinant plasmids containing M and N coding sequence were constructed. Moreover, in order to get the antigen for ELISA and in vitro stimulation assay, N protein were expressed and purified from E. coli bacteria. Injection of 20 μg of the mixture of pVAX1-M and pVAX1-N into the Balb/c mice could elicit the humoral and cellular responses. The ELISA analysis using the N antigen or inactivated SARS-CoV particles as capture antigen showed that co-injection of SARS-M could enhance N-induced antibody production, especially IgG2a subclass. After lymphocytes were stimulated with 10 μg/ml purified N antigen, The CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of N and M plus N group were increased compared with those of control groups, and the M protein could augment the activation of lymphocytes induced by N DNA vaccine. Cytokine ELISA analysis revealed that co-injection of M could enhance the levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 release induced by N antigen. Further experiments in field mouse also support the claim that membrane protein can augment the N-specific immune responses. Virus challenge test was conducted in BSL3 bio safety laboratory with Brandt's vole SARS-CoV model, and the results indicated that co-immunization of M and N antigens could reduce the mortality and pathological changes in lung from the virus infection.","Shi, Shu-Qun; Peng, Jing-Pian; Li, Yin-Chuan; Qin, Chuan; Liang, Guo-Dong; Xu, Li; Yang, Ying; Wang, Jin-Ling; Sun, Quan-Hong",Mol Immunol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589005003792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16423399/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589005003792,59

615578,JCD editorial - July 2021,2021,"It has been proposed that patients with hematologic malignancy and autoimmune diseases receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy are particularly at risk of severe Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) because the profound and long-lasting B-cell depletion induced by anti-CD20 mAb may impair virus clearance and may also contribute to reactivation of latent viruses, especially hepatitis B and JC viruses. As of July 20, 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases reported by the Italian authorities reached 245,000. The north of the country was mostly hit, and Milan and Brescia were among the Italian provinces that registered the highest number of COVID-19 cases. Consistent with this, a high number of COVID-19 patients affected with multiple types of hematological disorders (n. 137) and with multiple sclerosis (MS, n. 114) were referred to ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia. Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed in 70 patients with hematological disease, and in few patients with MS. Among these, 10 patients (7 with hematologic disease and 3 with MS) had received treatment with rituximab or ocrelizumab, two anti-CD20 mAbs, within 3 months prior to COVID-19 onset. Clinical indication to CD20-depleting treatment for patients with hematological disorders included Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) or Follicular Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). Anti-spike protein (anti-S) and anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed during the acute phase of infection and up to 3 months since the onset of symptoms by quantitative measurements of plasma or serum antibodies with luciferase immune precipitation assay systems (LIPS). With this technique, production of anti-S and anti-N antibodies has been demonstrated between day 8 and day 14 after onset of symptoms in immunocompetent individuals, whereas specific antibody production was delayed by few days in immunocompromised patients (Burbelo PD et al, medRxiv. 2020 Apr 24:2020.04.20.20071423). All 10 patients remained seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 for the first 20 days since onset of symptoms. One patient with DLBCL secondary to Follicular NHL had detectable anti-S and anti-N antibodies at day +25, and one patient with MS developed anti-N antibodies by day +23. Two patients, one with DLBCL secondary to Follicular NHL and one with Follicular NHL were still seronegative for both anti-S and anti-N antibodies at 133 and 74 days since onset of symptoms. Two MS patients were seronegative at the last examination, and one other MS patient was anti-S seronegative at day +74. Three of the 10 patients have died; all three were SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR+ and seronegative at the time of death. While it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is cleared without significant problems by the majority of people with MS or other autoimmune diseases on immunotherapy, these data indicate that treatment with anti-CD20 mAb may significantly alter humoral responses to the virus. Until a vaccine to SARS-CoV-2 is available, the risk-benefit ratio of anti-CD20 mAb therapy in areas with high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be carefully weighed. Moreover, for patients with B-cell malignancies or autoimmune diseases, transient discontinuation of this therapy, or use of alternative therapeutic approaches, should be considered once an efficacious vaccine becomes available.

Mild to moderate intensity side effects like low-grade fever, myalgia, chills and malaise were reported in the trials related to the vaccine. With this case report, we report a case of purpuric rash and thrombocytopenia after receiving the first dose of the m-RNA-1273 vaccine. The patient, in this case, is a 60-year-old male patient who received the first vaccine dose and within two days, he developed diffuse papular rash associated with some thrombocytopenia. He had a history of tobacco use, Hepatitis C liver cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease stage 4, untreated hypertension and systolic congestive heart failure at the baseline. With review of the limited literature related to the vaccine and its side effect profile and with no other etiology explaining the sudden onset of rash, we attribute this thrombocytopenia and purpuric rash as the side effects of the mRNA-1273 vaccine.","Malayala, Srikrishna V; Mohan, Gisha; Vasireddy, Deepa; Atluri, Paavani",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33786251/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14099,59

METHODS: We conducted an anonymous online survey between May 7 and June 21, 2020. RESULTS: Nearly all participants reported worry about the pandemic. Nearly half (95% CI: 43.3-51.3) reported moderate-to-severe anxiety, and 42.0% (95% CI: 38.0-45.9) reported experiencing poor sleep quality. Those with moderate-to-severe anxiety were more likely (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: 2.4-4.7) to report poor sleep quality than those with less anxiety. Moderate or extreme worry about the pandemic was associated with poor sleep quality (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey found high levels of stress, worry, anxiety, and poor sleep among US college and university students during the early months of the pandemic. Universities should prioritize access to resources for healthy coping to help students manage anxiety and improve sleep quality as the pandemic continues.","Ulrich, Angela K; Full, Kelsie M; Cheng, Bethany; Gravagna, Katie; Nederhoff, Dawn; Basta, Nicole E",J Am Coll Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34242544/; https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.1928143,59

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mental burden and quality of work life in nurses in intensive care units of Covid-19 patients. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 200 people—100 nurses in care units for patients with COVID-19 (group 1) and 100 nurses in non-COVID-19 patient care units (group 2—in three university hospitals were obtained. These 200 samples were randomly extracted from the list of employees and selected. Data were collected using three questionnaires, including (1) a demographic, (2) the NASA-Task Load Index (1988) (Hart & Staveland, 1988) and (3) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Quality of Life. Data were analyzed using SPSS-24 software and descriptive and analytical statistical methods. RESULTS: The overall mean scores of nurses’ quality of work life were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05). The average score of quality of life in nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 is 92.57, more than nurses caring for patients without COVID-19, 79.43. Among the dimensions of mental workload: Performance and efficiency, with an average score of 77.32 ± 15.85, had the highest score, while discouragement and failure, with an average score of 58.04 ± 26.72, had the lowest score of mental workload. There is a significant difference between the mental load of work in the two groups (P = 0.001). There is a significant inverse relationship between total quality of work life and total mental workload (r = –14 and P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this study, it was observed that nurses caring for Covid-19 patients are in a more unfavorable situation in terms of the studied characteristics. Due to the work period, these nurses have a high workload and a low quality of work life to compensate for the mental and physical deficiencies required by a long presence in the work environment.","Nikeghbal, Kiana; Kouhnavard, Bahram; Shabani, Ali; Zamanian, Zahra",Annals of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34434715/; https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3386,59

624936,Challenges and Opportunities of Targeting Astrocytes to Halt Neurodegenerative Disorders,2021-08-07,"Diseases like widespread diabetes or rare galactosemia may lead to high sugar concentrations in the human body, thereby promoting the formation of glycoconjugates. Glycation of collagen, i.e. the formation of glucose bridges, is nonenzymatic and therefore cannot be prevented in any other way than keeping the sugar level low. It relates to secondary diseases, abundantly occurring in aging populations and diabetics. However, little is known about the effects of glycation of collagen on the molecular level. We studied in vitro the effect of glycation, with d-glucose and d-galactose as well as d-ribose, on the structure of type 1 collagen by preparing decellularized matrices of bovine pericardia soaked in different sugar solutions, at increasing concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg ml(−1)), and incubated at 37°C for 3, 14, 30 and 90 days. The tissue samples were analyzed with small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering in scanning mode. We found that glucose and galactose produce similar changes in collagen, i.e. they mainly affect the lateral packing between macromolecules. However, ribose is much faster in glycation, provoking a larger effect on the lateral packing, but also seems to cause qualitatively different effects on the collagen structure.","Giannini, Cinzia; De Caro, Liberato; Terzi, Alberta; Fusaro, Luca; Altamura, Davide; Diaz, Ana; Lassandro, Rocco; Boccafoschi, Francesca; Bunk, Oliver",IUCrJ,https://doi.org/10.1107/s2052252521005054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34258010/,59

However, only few studies focused on risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection among patients with COVID-19. We included 206 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from two hospitals between 23 Jan and 1 April 2020. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was used to screen out independent risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. By multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis and Cox regression analysis, we further determined the associations between SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and potential risk factors. All patients had two negative SARS-CoV-2 tests with 33 days of median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (interquartile range: 25.2–39 days). LASSO and binomial logistic regression analyses suggested that delayed hospital admission (adjusted OR = 3.70, 95% CI: 1.82–7.50), hypokalemia, and subpleural lesion (adjusted OR = 4.32, 95% CI: 1.10–16.97) were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. By LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analyses, we observed that delayed hospital admission, subpleural lesion, and high-dose corticosteroid use were independent risk factors of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Early hospital admission shortened 5.73 days of mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection than delayed hospital admission after adjusting confounding factors. Our study demonstrated that delayed hospital admission and subpleural lesion were associated with prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection among patients with COVID-19. The use of high-dose corticosteroids should be interpreted with extreme caution in treating COVID-19.","Hu, Zhigang; Li, Sijia; Yang, Ailan; Li, Wenxin; Xiong, Xiaoqi; Hu, Jianwu; Jiang, Jun; Song, Xinyu",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123934/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10096-020-04085-2,59
626736,Telehealth in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Opportunities and Challenges for Patients and Physicians,2021-02-13,"INTRODUCTION: Most patients with COVID‐19 have mild or moderate manifestations; however, there is a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and even more severe repercussions that require high diagnostic suspicion. Vital sign acquisition and monitoring are crucial for detecting and responding to patients with COVID‐19. OBJECTIVE: Thus, we conducted this study to demonstrate the impact of using a tool called Smart Check on the triage time of patients with suspected COVID‐19 and to identify the main initial clinical manifestations in these patients. METHODOLOGY: We assessed triage times before and after the use of Smart Check in 11 466 patients at Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Porto Alegre, Brazil, from 1 June to 31 July 2020. In this group, we identified 220 patients for the identification of COVID‐19 clinical manifestations in a case–control analysis. RESULTS: Smart Check was able to decrease the triage time by 33 seconds on average (P < .001), with 75% of the exams being performed within 5 minutes, whereas with the usual protocol these steps were performed within 6 minutes. A range of clinical presentations made up the COVID‐19 initial manifestations. Those with the highest frequency were dry cough (46.4%), fever (41.3%), dyspnoea (35.8%), and headache (31.8%). Loss of appetite was the manifestation that had a statistically significant association with the SARS‐CoV‐2 presence (univariate analysis). When analysed together, loss of appetite associated with dyspnoea and/or ageusia and/or fever was related to the diagnosis of COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: Smart Check, a simple clinical evaluation tool, along with the targeted use of rapid PCR testing, can optimise triage time for patients with and without COVID‐19. In triage centres, a number of initial signs and symptoms should be cause for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection suspicion, in particular the association of respiratory, neurological, and gastrointestinal manifestations.","Anschau, Fernando; Worm, Paulo Valdeci; Kopittke, Luciane; de Mello Villwock, Luis Humberto; Lemos Sartori, Marcos Luiggi; Cardoso do Rosário, Jéferson; Secorun Inácio, José Francisco; Much, Maicon Diogo; Marckmann, Eduardo; Pinheiro, Sandro; Nickenig Vissoci, João Ricardo; de Lara Machado, Wagner; Costa, Dalton Breno; Klug, Daniel; Martin Prestes, Juliane; Hessel, Fabiano",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235816/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14610,59

When all four expression vectors were co‐transfected VLP formed, as confirmed using electron microscopy. Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific to the N protein, N‐protein‐containing particles similar in size to the VLP were also observed by immunoelectron microscopy, indicating that the VLP contained the N protein. Co‐immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated an interaction between the N and M proteins, suggesting that N protein binds directly to M protein to be incorporated into VLP.","Nakauchi, Mina; Kariwa, Hiroaki; Kon, Yasuhiro; Yoshii, Kentaro; Maeda, Akihiko; Takashima, Ikuo",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19120977/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1348-0421.2008.00079.x,59

Widespread community transmission necessitates a large, diverse workforce with specialized knowledge and skills. The University of California, San Francisco and Los Angeles partnered with the California Department of Public Health to rapidly mobilize and train a CI/CT workforce. In April through August 2020, a team of public health practitioners and health educators constructed a training program to enable learners from diverse backgrounds to quickly acquire the competencies necessary to function effectively as CIs and CTs. Between April 27 and May 5, the team undertook a curriculum design sprint by performing a needs assessment, determining relevant goals and objectives, and developing content. The initial four-day curriculum consisted of 13 hours of synchronous live web meetings and 7 hours of asynchronous, self-directed study. Educational content emphasized the principles of COVID-19 exposure, infectious period, isolation and quarantine guidelines and the importance of prevention and control interventions. A priority was equipping learners with skills in rapport building and health coaching through facilitated web-based small group skill development sessions. The training was piloted among 31 learners and subsequently expanded to an average weekly audience of 520 persons statewide starting May 7, reaching 7,499 unique enrollees by August 31. Capacity to scale and sustain the training program was afforded by the UCLA Extension Canvas learning management system. Repeated iteration of content and format was undertaken based on feedback from learners, facilitators, and public health and community-based partners. It is feasible to rapidly train and deploy a large workforce to perform CI and CT. Interactive skills-based training with opportunity for practice and feedback are essential to develop independent, high-performing CIs and CTs. Rigorous evaluation will continue to monitor quality measures to improve the training experience and outcomes.","Brickley, Debbie B.; Forster, Maeve; Alonis, Amelia; Antonyan, Elizabeth; Chen, Lisa; DiGiammarino, Alicia; Dorian, Alina; Dunn, Caitlin; Gandelman, Alice; Grasso, Mike; Kiureghian, Alice; Maher, Andrew D.; Malan, Hannah; Mejia, Patricia; Peare, Anna; Prelip, Michael; Shafir, Shira; White, Karen; Willard-Grace, Rachel; Reid, Michael",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.706697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34434915/,59
629000,A Traffic Light System to Maximize Carbohydrate Cryoprotectants’ Effectivity in Nanostructured Lipid Carriers’ Lyophilization,2021-08-25,"OBJECTIVES: Reporting of COVID-19 cases, deaths and testing has often lacked context for appropriate assessment of disease burden within risk groups. The research considers how routine surveillance data might provide initial insights and identify risk factors, setting COVID-19 deaths early in the pandemic into context. This will facilitate the understanding of wider consequences of a pandemic from the earliest stage, reducing fear, aiding in accurately assessing disease burden and ensuring appropriate disease mitigation. SETTING: UK, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: The study is a secondary analysis of routine, public domain, surveillance data and information from Office for National Statistics (ONS), National Health Service (NHS) 111 and Public Health England (PHE) on deaths and disease. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Our principal focus is ONS data on deaths mentioning COVID-19 on the death certificate. We also consider information provided in NHS 111 and PHE data summaries. RESULTS: Deaths with COVID-19 significantly contributed to, yet do not entirely explain, abnormally elevated all-cause mortality in the UK from weeks 12–18 of 2020. Early in the UK epidemic, COVID-19 was the greatest threat to those with underlying illness, rarely endangering people aged under 40 years. COVID-19-related death rates differed by region, possibly reflecting underlying population structure. Risk of COVID-19-related death was greater for healthcare and social care staff and black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals, having allowed for documented risk factors. CONCLUSION: Early contextualisation of public health data is critical to recognising who gets sick, when and why. Understanding at-risk groups facilitates a targeted response considering indirect consequences of society’s reaction to a pandemic alongside disease-related impacts. COVID-19-related deaths mainly mirror historical patterns, and excess non-COVID-19-related deaths partly reflect reduced access to and uptake of healthcare during lockdown. Future outbreak response will improve through better understanding of connectivity between disease monitoring systems to aid interpretation of disease risk patterns, facilitating nuanced mitigation measures.","Clough, Helen E; McIntyre, K Marie; Patterson, Grace E; Harris, John P; Rushton, Jonathan",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558359/,59

METHODS: This investigation employed a quantitative-descriptive design. The study sample was comprised of the frontline nurses in the COVID-19 center hospitals in the northern part of Saudi Arabia. Snowball sampling was used, resulting in 80 frontline nurses. A survey using a self-administered questionnaire in a Google form was employed to collect the data, which was collected from May 20 through June 25, 2020. RESULTS: Some of the study participants were reported to have a history of both staying in the same household with each other (35%) and of traveling with a confirmed COVID-19 patient (20%). These participants were considered as community exposed to COVID-19. There were 8.8% who were classified as high risk due to failure in removing and replacing personal protective equipment (PPE); 6.3% were at high risk for not performing hand hygiene before and after touching COVID-19 patients, and 5% did not follow the recommended guidelines in performing hand hygiene after touching the patients' surroundings. In addition, 3.8% of the participants had an accident related to biological material, such as with splashes of biological fluid (in the eyes). These nurses were classified as high risk for COVID-19 virus infection, CONCLUSION: This study identifies practices that need improvement in combatting this virus. Since policies and guidelines may not always be optimal in all settings, a tailor-fitted guideline is appropriate. Nurse leaders, for example, need to establish an infection control system that provides real-time monitoring and facilitates immediate correction for nurses. Doing so will provide the nurses with a continuous awareness of predisposing themselves to acquiring the virus.","Albaqawi, Hamdan Mohammad; Pasay-an, Eddieson; Mostoles, Romeo; Villareal, Sandro",Appl Nurs Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0897189721000161; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0897189721000161; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2021.151410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745558/,59
630223,Mixed oxide nanotubes in nanomedicine: A dead-end or a bridge to the future?,2020-09-24,"The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has significantly affected global health and created a world crisis. The exponentially increasing numbers of infection and mortality have made preventive measures challenging. India being a highly populated nation has so far effectively counteracted the pandemic outbreak with a significantly lower rate of mortality despite the high infection rates. The genetic architecture of the immune response genes in the Indian population, BCG vaccination, the predominantly young age group of people, and their traditional food habits might contribute to the lower rate of mortality. Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) play a vital role in triggering T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells can immediately react to eliminate infected cells. Activation of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells selectively targets the infected cells and strengthens the immunoregulatory system. The checkpoint for NK cell function is the engagement of killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) molecules with their respective HLA ligands overexpressed or expressed on the compromised virus-infected cells which have shown polymorphism among different ethnic groups. Here, we explore if certain KIR-HLA motifs grant Indians a survival advantage in terms of the low rate of mortality. Additionally, enhanced immunity through BCG vaccination may favor fruitful eradication of SARS-CoV-2 and provide the way out as in therapeutic intervention and vaccination strategies.","Al-Dayan, Noura; Venugopal, Divya; Dhanasekaran, Sugapriya",Anal Cell Pathol (Amst),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33457195/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/6692739,59

To understand the underlying mechanisms involved in lung pathology, we investigated the role of the lung-specific immune response. We profiled immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood collected from patients with severe COVID-19 and patients with bacterial pneumonia not associated with viral infection. By tracking T cell clones across tissues, we identified clonally expanded tissue-resident memory-like T(H)17 cells (T(RM)17 cells) in the lungs even after viral clearance. These T(RM)17 cells were characterized by a potentially pathogenic cytokine expression profile of IL17A and CSF2 (GM-CSF). Interactome analysis suggests that T(RM)17 cells can interact with lung macrophages and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, which have been associated with disease severity and lung damage. High IL-17A and GM-CSF protein levels in the serum of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a more severe clinical course. Collectively, our study suggests that pulmonary T(RM)17 cells are one potential orchestrator of the hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","Zhao, Yu; Kilian, Christoph; Turner, Jan-Eric; Bosurgi, Lidia; Roedl, Kevin; Bartsch, Patricia; Gnirck, Ann-Christin; Cortesi, Filippo; Schultheiß, Christoph; Hellmig, Malte; Enk, Leon U.B.; Hausmann, Fabian; Borchers, Alina; Wong, Milagros N.; Paust, Hans-Joachim; Siracusa, Francesco; Scheibel, Nicola; Herrmann, Marissa; Rosati, Elisa; Bacher, Petra; Kylies, Dominik; Jarczak, Dominik; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Pfefferle, Susanne; Steurer, Stefan; Schulze zur Wiesch, Julian; Puelles, Victor G.; Sperhake, Jan-Peter; Addo, Marylyn M.; Lohse, Ansgar W.; Binder, Mascha; Huber, Samuel; Huber, Tobias B.; Kluge, Stefan; Bonn, Stefan; Panzer, Ulf; Gagliani, Nicola; Krebs, Christian F.",Sci Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abf6692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622974/,59

However, as of March 2021, countries in Africa are among those with the lowest reported incidence of COVID-19 worldwide (4). Whether this reflects effective mitigation, outbreak response, or demographic characteristics, (5) or indicates limitations in disease surveillance capacity is unclear (6). As countries implemented changes in funding, national policies, and testing strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance capacity might have been adversely affected. This study assessed whether changes in surveillance operations affected reporting in South Sudan; testing and case numbers reported during April 6, 2020-February 21, 2021, were analyzed relative to the timing of funding, policy, and strategy changes.* South Sudan, with a population of approximately 11 million, began COVID-19 surveillance in February 2020 and reported 6,931 cases through February 21, 2021. Surveillance data analyzed were from point of entry screening, testing of symptomatic persons who contacted an alert hotline, contact tracing, sentinel surveillance, and outbound travel screening. After travel restrictions were relaxed in early May 2020, international land and air travel resumed and mandatory requirements for negative pretravel test results were initiated. The percentage of all testing accounted for by travel screening increased >300%, from 21.1% to 91.0% during the analysis period, despite yielding the lowest percentage of positive tests among all sources. Although testing of symptomatic persons and contact tracing yielded the highest percentage of COVID-19 cases, the percentage of all testing from these sources decreased 88%, from 52.6% to 6.3% after support for these activities was reduced. Collectively, testing increased over the project period, but shifted toward sources least likely to yield positive results, possibly resulting in underreporting of cases. Policy, funding, and strategy decisions related to the COVID-19 pandemic response, such as those implemented in South Sudan, are important issues to consider when interpreting the epidemiology of COVID-19 outbreaks.","Shragai, Talya; Summers, Aimee; Olushayo, Olu; Rumunu, John; Mize, Valerie; Laku, Richard; Bunga, Sudhir",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7022a3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081689/,59

633606,Fifty Years of Witnessing Biomedical Science Developments,2020-11-11,"BACKGROUND: BCoV is identified in both healthy and diarrheic calves, complicating its assessment as a primary pathogen. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the detection rates of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in feces of healthy and diarrheic calves and to describe the usefulness of a pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (PanCoV‐RT‐PCR) assay to identify BCoV in samples of diarrheic calves. ANIMALS: Two hundred and eighty‐six calves <21 days. Calves with liquid or semiliquid feces, temperature >39.5°C, and inappetence were considered as cases, and those that had pasty or firm feces and normal physical examination were designated as controls. METHODS: Prospective case–control study. A specific BCoV‐RT‐PCR assay was used to detect BCoV in fecal samples. Association between BCoV and health status was evaluated by exact and random effect logistic regression. Fecal (n = 28) and nasal (n = 8) samples from diarrheic calves were tested for the presence of BCoV by both the PanCoV‐RT‐PCR and a specific BCoV‐RT‐PCR assays. A Kappa coefficient test was used to assess the level of agreement of both assays. RESULTS: BCoV was detected in 55% (157/286) of calves; 46% (66/143), and 64% (91/143) of healthy and diarrheic calves, respectively. Diarrheic calves had higher odds of BCoV presence than healthy calves (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.83, P = 0.004). A good agreement between PanCoV‐RT‐PCR and BCoV‐RT‐PCR to detect BCoV was identified (κ = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.392 to 0.967; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: BCoV was more likely to be detected in diarrheic than healthy calves. The PanCoV‐RT‐PCR assay can be a useful tool to detect CoV samples from diarrheic calves.","Gomez, D.E.; Arroyo, L.G.; Poljak, Z.; Viel, L.; Weese, J.S.",J Vet Intern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28913936/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.14811,59
633726,The impact of environmental variables on the spread of COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea,2021-03-16,"The emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, triggered the discovery of a high diversity of coronaviruses in bats. Studies from Europe have shown that coronaviruses circulate in bats in France but this reflects only a fraction of the whole diversity. In the current study the diversity of coronaviruses circulating in western Europe was extensively explored. Ten alphacoronaviruses in eleven bat species belonging to the Miniopteridae, Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families and, a SARS-CoV-related Betacoronavirus in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were identified. The diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses presently reported from western Europe is much higher than previously described and includes a SARS-CoV sister group. This diversity demonstrates the dynamic evolution and circulation of coronaviruses in this species. That said, the identified coronaviruses were consistently associated with a particular bat species or genus, and these relationships were maintained no matter the geographic location. The observed phylogenetic grouping of coronaviruses from the same species in Europe and Asia, emphasizes the role of host/pathogen coevolution in this group.","Ar Gouilh, Meriadeg; Puechmaille, Sébastien J.; Diancourt, Laure; Vandenbogaert, Mathias; Serra-Cobo, Jordi; Lopez Roïg, Marc; Brown, Paul; Moutou, François; Caro, Valérie; Vabret, Astrid; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude",Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2018.01.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682218300205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482919/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218300205,59

The characteristics most useful for the study of epidemiology are presented, in particular the very strong mutagenicity and the seasonality of infections with this virus. The control programs are based on numerous biosecurity measures applied as much to prevent viruses from spreading from sources of infection: biocontainment measures, as to measures to prevent contamination of uninjured herds: bioexclusion measures The control of avian coronaviruses is based mainly on vaccinations and because of the very strong mutagenic power of the virus, a race is regularly underway, to succeed in matching the different viruses frequently appearing in farms and vaccine viruses.

Based on a study of over one million 23andMe research participants, we report genetic and non-genetic associations with testing positive for COVID-19, respiratory symptoms, and hospitalization. Risk factors for hospitalization include advancing age, male sex, elevated body mass index, lower socio-economic status, non-European ancestry, and pre-existing cardio-metabolic and respiratory conditions. Using trans-ethnic genome-wide association studies, we identify a strong association between blood type and COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as a gene-rich locus on chr3p21.31 that is more strongly associated with outcome severity. While non-European ancestry was found to be a significant risk factor for hospitalization after adjusting for socio-demographics and pre-existing health conditions, we did not find evidence that these two primary genetic associations explain differences between populations in terms of risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes.","Shelton, J.

This paper aims to use geographic information systems technology to examine the association between socio-environmental exposures and health outcomes in all persons who have attended or currently attend the Sickle Cell Unit in Jamaica. Rural patients presented for clinical care at older ages and had less annual visits to clinic. Persons travelled relatively long distances to seek SCD care and those travelling longer had less health maintenance visits. Urban patients had a higher prevalence of significant pain crises (69.4% vs. 55.8%, p value<0.001) and respiratory events (21.2% vs. 14%, p value<0.001). Prevalence of leg ulcers did not vary between rural and urban patients but was higher in males than in females. Females also had lower odds of having respiratory events but there was no sex difference in history of painful crises. Persons with more severe genotypes lived in higher poverty and travelled longer for healthcare services. Persons in areas with higher annual rainfall, higher mean temperatures and living farther from factories had less painful crises and respiratory events. The paper highlights a need for better access to healthcare services for Jamaicans with SCD especially in rural areas of the island.

634996,"Scientists' opinion, attitudes, and consensus towards immunity passports",2021-02-03,"INTRODUCTION: Clinical and Translational Science Award Program (CTSA)-funded institutions were charged with developing clinical and translational science programs and transforming clinical research at their institutions. Community engagement (CE) was recognized as a key component and catalyst of that transformation. CE hub capacities for working with communities and translating knowledge into practice have been illustrated through their COVID-19 responses. METHODS: CE hub leaders met and discussed their CTSA’s early responses regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2-hour discussion was distilled into themes which were sent to the CE hub leaders with a request for written accounts describing actions taken to engage local partners, communities, and institutions. The written reports form the basis for this compendium. RESULTS: Eighteen institutions submitted written reports describing activities in relation to six themes: (1) listen to the community and respond to concerns, (2) collect data to understand the impact of COVID-19 on distinct communities and groups, (3) communicate science and address misinformation, (4) collaborate with health departments, (5) engage hubs and underrepresented populations in COVID-19 research, and (6) support our own well-being and that of others. CONCLUSIONS: Bidirectional interactions comprise the foundation of CE, which requires trusted partnerships that sustain communication through a series of activities and goals. The nimble responses to the pandemic substantiate the need for CE programs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to achieve the primary CTSA goals of improving health within and across communities and localities as well as expanding research participation of community members.","Eder, Milton Mickey; Millay, Tamara A.; Cottler, Linda B.",Journal of clinical and translational science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367677/; https://doi.org/10.1017/cts.2021.800,59
635730,A Multiple Peptides Vaccine against nCOVID-19 Designed from the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and Spike Glycoprotein (S) via the Immunoinformatics Approach,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Viral aetiologies are the most common cause of central nervous system (CNS) infections. Approximately one-half of CNS infections remain of undetermined origin. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) brought new perspectives to CNS infection investigations, allowing investigation of viral aetiologies with an unbiased approach. HTS use is still limited to specific clinical situations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to evaluate the contribution and pitfalls of HTS for the aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis in CNS patient samples. SOURCES: PubMed was searched from 1 January 2008 to 2 August 2018 to retrieve available studies on the topic. Additional publications were included from a review of full-text sources. CONTENT: Among 366 studies retrieved, 29 used HTS as a diagnostic technique. HTS was performed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy samples of 307 patients, including immunocompromised, immunocompetent paediatric, and adult cases. HTS was performed retrospectively in 18 studies and prospectively in 11. HTS led to the identification of a potential causal virus in 41 patients, with 11 viruses known and ten not expected to cause CNS infections. Various HTS protocols were used. IMPLICATIONS: The additional value of HTS is difficult to quantify because of various biases. Nevertheless, HTS led to the identification of a viral cause in 13% of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis cases in which various assays failed to identify the cause. HTS should be considered early in clinical management as a complement to routine assays. Standardized strategies and systematic studies are needed for the integration of HTS in clinical management.","Zanella, M.-C.; Lenggenhager, L.; Schrenzel, J.; Cordey, S.; Kaiser, L.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X18308127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30641229/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2018.12.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X18308127,59

METHODS: Cross-sectional regression methods are used to model the relationship between income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, and COVID-19 reported cases and deaths per-million. RESULTS: The results demonstrate a significant positive association between income inequality and COVID-19 cases and death per million in all estimated models. A 1% increase in the Gini coefficient is associated with an approximately 4% increase in cases per-million and an approximately 5% increase in deaths per-million. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that countries with high levels of income inequality have performed significantly worse when dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak in terms cases and deaths. Income inequality is a proxy for many elements of socioeconomic disadvantage that may contribute to the spread of, and deaths from, COVID-19. These include poor housing, smoking, obesity and pollution. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The findings suggest the importance of closing the gap in income inequality and improving the health and incomes of the poorest and most vulnerable groups.","Wildman, John",Eur J Health Econ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-021-01266-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590424/,59

AIM: To study the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and comorbidities associated with this pandemic in four different regions of Iran. METHODS: We analyzed data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients evaluated at four hospitals of Iran (n = 91), including South (Shiraz), Southeast (Dezful), Rasht (North), and Northwest (Mashhad) between April and September 2020. Demographics, comorbidities and clinical findings including GI symptoms were collected. Statistical descriptive analysis and correlation analyses of symptoms, comorbidities, and mortality were performed. RESULTS: The average age of COVID-19 patients was 51.1 years, and 56% were male. Mortality rate was 17%. Cough with 84.6%, shortness of breath with 71.4%, fever with 52.7%, and loss of appetite with 43.9% were the main symptoms. Overall cardiac disease was the most common comorbidity with an average of 28.5% followed by hypertension (28.5%) and diabetes (25.2%). The highest comorbidity in North (Rasht) was diabetes (30%) and in South (Dezful) hypertension (37%). Shiraz leads cardiac disease with 43.4%.

Subunit vaccines can avoid potential toxicity associated with traditional whole virion‐inactivated and live‐attenuated vaccines; however, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines is often poor. A facile method is here reported to produce lipid nanoparticle subunit vaccines that exhibit high immunogenicity and elicit protection against influenza virus. Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) immunogens are functionalized on the surface of liposomes via stable metal chelation chemistry, using a scalable advanced microfluidic mixing technology (NanoAssemblr). Immunization of mice with HA‐liposomes elicits increased serum antibody titers and superior protection against highly pathogenic virus challenge compared with free HA protein. HA‐liposomal vaccines display enhanced antigen deposition into germinal centers within the draining lymph nodes, driving increased HA‐specific B cell, and follicular helper T cell responses. This work provides mechanistic insights into highly protective HA‐liposome vaccines and informs the rational design and rapid production of next generation nanoparticle subunit vaccines.","Vu, Mai N.; Kelly, Hannah G.; Tan, Hyon‐Xhi; Juno, Jennifer A.; Esterbauer, Robyn; Davis, Thomas P.; Truong, Nghia P.; Wheatley, Adam K.; Kent, Stephen J.",Adv Healthc Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690985/; https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202002142,59

METHODS: Network pharmacology-based strategy including collection and analysis of putative compounds and target genes, network construction, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, and Gene Ontology(GO) enrichment, identification of key compounds and target genes, and molecule docking was performed in this study. RESULTS: A total of 82 bioactive compounds and 226 putative target genes of SHL oral liquid were collected. Of note, 28 hub target genes including 4 major hub target genes: estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NCOA2), nuclear receptor coactivator 1 (NCOA1), androgen receptor (AR) and 5 key compounds (quercetin, luteolin, baicalein, kaempferol and wogonin) were identified based on network analysis. The hub target genes mainly enriched in pathways including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, human cytomegalovirus infection, and human papillomavirus infection, which could be the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of SHL oral liquid for treating diseases. Moreover, the key compounds had great molecule docking binding affinity with the major hub target genes.

641248,Temperament Predicts the Quality of Social Interactions in Captive Female Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta),2021-08-20,"Background: There is currently major concern about the impact of the global COVID-19 outbreak on mental health. A number of studies suggest that mental health deteriorated in many countries prior to enforced isolation (lockdown), but it remains unknown how mental health has changed during lockdown. Aims: This study explored trajectories of anxiety and depression over the first two months of lockdown using data from the UK, and compared the experiences of individuals with and without diagnosed mental illness. Methods: Data from 53,328 adults in the UCL COVID -19 Social Study (a well-stratified panel study weighted to population proportions collecting data weekly during the Covid-19 pandemic) were analysed from 21/03/2020-10/05/2020. Growth curve modelling was fitted accounting for socio-demographic and health covariates. Results: 24.4% of the sample had scores indicating moderate-severe anxiety, and 31.4% indicating moderate-severe depressive symptoms. Over the first two months of lockdown, there was only a slight decrease in anxiety levels amongst participants as a whole and a very small decrease in depression levels between weeks 3-6 that then increased again in weeks 7-8. Adults with pre-existing diagnoses of mental health conditions had higher levels of anxiety and depression but there was no evidence of widening inequalities in mental health experiences compared to people without existing mental illness. Conclusions: Results suggest there has been little improvement in depression and only slight improvements in anxiety since lockdown commenced in the UK. These findings suggest greater efforts need to be made to help individuals manage their mental health during the pandemic.","Fancourt, D.; Steptoe, A.; Bu, F.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.20120923; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.03.20120923v1?rss=1,59
641353,Comparing cost and print time estimates for six commercially-available 3D printers obtained through slicing software for clinically relevant anatomical models,2021-01-06,"Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Although viral nucleic acid test (NAT) has been applied predominantly to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA for confirmation diagnosis of COVID-19, an urgent need for alternative, rapid, and sensitive immunoassays is required for primary screening of virus. In this study, we developed a smartphone-based nanozyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SP-NLISA) for detecting the specific nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 in 37 serum samples from 20 COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed by NAT previously. By using SP-NLISA, 28/37 (75.7%) serum samples were detected for NP antigens and no cross-reactivity with blood donors’ control samples collected from different areas of China. In a control assay using the conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), only 7/37 (18.91%) serum samples were detected for NP antigens and no cross-reactivity with control samples. SP-NLISA could be used for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen in primary screening of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.","Liu, Bochao; Wu, Ze; Liang, Chaolan; Lu, Jinhui; Li, Jinfeng; Zhang, Ling; Li, Tingting; Zhao, Wei; Fu, Yongshui; Hou, Shuiping; Tang, Xi; Li, Chengyao",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497592/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.692831,59
642489,Advancing COVID-19 differentiation with a robust preprocessing and integration of multi-institutional open-repository computer tomography datasets for deep learning analysis,2020-09-11,"OBJECTIVES: Intrinsic capacity (IC) was proposed by the WHO as a new concept for capturing an individual’s functional capacities across their lifetime. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with IC decline and examine associations between IC and adverse outcomes among community-dwelling older adults in China. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Community, China. PARTICIPANTS: Data were derived from the China Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Study, a population-based nationally representative sample. IC comprises of five domains: locomotion, cognition, vitality, sensory and psychology. Participants were deemed to have IC decline if they showed a decline in any of the five domains. Sociodemographic characteristics, chronic diseases, geriatric syndromes and adverse outcomes were also examined. RESULTS: Of the 5823 community-dwelling participants aged 60–98 years, 2506 had IC decline (weighted 39.9%): 57.7% in western, 38.3% in northern, 33.7% in northwest, 36.1% in middle, 16.9% in eastern and 19.8% in northeast China. The number of participants with decline in the locomotion, cognition, vitality, sensory and psychological domains were 1039 (17.8%), 646 (11.1%), 735 (12.6%), 824 (14.2%) and 713 (12.2%), respectively. Age, northern residence, low education, being unmarried, low income, less exercise, less meat intake, insomnia, memory loss, urinary incontinence, constipation, slowness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis were related to IC decline. After adjusting for age, sex, area, district, marriage, education, waist–hip ratio, smoking, alcohol consumption, exercise, income and chronic diseases, IC decline was independently associated with risk of frailty, disability, falls, fractures and immobility. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of IC decline in China is high. IC decline was significantly associated with adverse outcomes, after adjustment for related variables. Efforts promoting IC to delay functional dependence should focus on modifiable factors, including negative social factors, poor lifestyle, chronic diseases and geriatric syndromes.","Ma, Lina; Chhetri, Jagadish K; Zhang, Li; Sun, Fei; Li, Yun; Tang, Zhe",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33402410/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043062,59

Information on results and potential benefits of NHP research therefore remains unavailable. To fill this gap in knowledge, this study identified all published NHP research studies funded by the MRC, Wellcome Trust and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) from January 1997 to July 2012 and assessed full texts for medical relevance. In total, 284 papers were identified, of which 51 (18%) involved invasive NHP research, compared to 176 (61%) which used NHP tissue and cell lines, indicating a shift in research emphasis from invasive whole animal to cell-based research. Of these studies, 98 (35%) were medically relevant, of which 22 had potential therapeutic or public health applications. The relatively low proportion of medical studies together with the small number of applied studies raises questions over the level of investment in medical research and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from basic to applied research. Implementation of the Bateson Review’s Recommendation 4 would address these questions.","Moore, Edward",J R Soc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24739383/,59

643358,The convergence of financial inclusion across provinces in Vietnam: A novel approach,2021-08-26,"PURPOSE: The present study is focused on designing an automated jet nebulizer that possesses the capability of dynamic flow regulation. In the case of existing equipment, 50% of the aerosol is lost to the atmosphere through the vent, during the exhalation phase of respiration. Desired effects of nebulization may not be achieved by neglecting this poor administration technique. There may be adverse effects like bronchospasm and exposure to high drug concentrations. METHODS: The proposed nebulizer is composed of two modes as “Compressed Air” mode and the “Oxygen Therapy” mode. The automated triggering from one mode to another will be dependent upon the percentage of oxygen saturation of the patient, monitored from the SpO(2) sensor. The compressed airflow will be delivered to the patient according to the minute ventilation, derived with the aid of a temperature sensor–based algorithm. The compressor controller circuitry ensures that the patient receives optimum level of compressed air as per the flow rate. At the end of the drug delivery, if the liquid level sensor detects the absence of medication within the nebulizer chamber, the nebulization process will be terminated. The dynamic regulation of the motor speed with respect to the minute ventilation was accomplished. RESULTS: A laminar flow was obtained from the outlet of the compressor towards the nebulizer tubing, and a turbulent flow was obtained within the chamber. No excessive turbulent flows or rotational flow patterns were detected. CONCLUSION: Detecting the drug levels in the nebulizing chamber will prevent continuous workup and useful in situations where back-to-back nebulization is required. Oxygen therapy mode identifies the patient’s desaturation and important where the patient can be already hypoxic or have a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, but may be disadvantageous in severe COPD patients. The aforesaid results could certainly lead to the improvements of the existing nebulizers.","Dampage, Udaya; Ariyasinghe, Malmindi; Pulleperuma, Samanthi",J Pharm Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33841586/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12247-021-09557-2,59

The present study intended to establish an in vitro toll to assess the parasitological/immunological status of dogs, applicable in pre-clinical trials of vaccinology, prognosis follow-up and therapeutics analysis of canine visceral leishmaniasis. We have evaluated the performance of co-culture systems of canine Leishmania chagasi–infected macrophages with different cell ratios of total lymphocytes or purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from uninfected dogs were used for the system set up. Employing the co-culture systems of L. chagasi–infected macrophages and purified CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cell subsets we observed a microenvironment compatible with the expected status of the analyzed dogs. In this context, it was clearly demonstrated that, at this selected T-cell:target ratio, the adaptive immune response of uninfected dogs, composed by L. chagasi-unprimed T-cells was not able to perform the in vitro killing of L. chagasi–infected macrophages. Our data demonstrated that the co-culture system with T-cells from uninfected dogs at 1:5 and 1:2 ratio did not control the infection, yielding to patent in vitro parasitism (≥80%), low NO production (≤5 μM) and IL-10 modulated (IFN-γ/IL-10≤2) immunological profile in vitro. CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cells at 1:5 or 1:2 ratio to L. chagasi–infected macrophages seems to be ideal for in vitro assays. This co-culture system may have great potential as a canine immunological analysis method, as well as in vaccine evaluations, prognosis follow-up and therapeutic interventions.","Viana, Kelvinson Fernandes; Aguiar-Soares, Rodrigo Dian Oliveira; Ker, Henrique Gama; Resende, Lucilene Aparecida; Souza-Fagundes, Elaine Maria; Dutra, Walderez Ornelas; Fujiwara, Ricardo Toshio; Silveira-Lemos, Denise da; Sant'Ana, Rita de Cássia Oliveira; Wardini, Amanda Brito; Araújo, Márcio Sobreira Silva; Martins-Filho, Olindo Assis; Reis, Alexandre Barbosa; Giunchetti, Rodolfo Cordeiro",Vet Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26095951/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401715002745; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401715002745; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2015.05.025,59
644733,The Requisiteness for not Sacrificing Medical Biotechnology in the Coronavirus Era,2021,"Our objective was to present our experience on adapting to the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic on a pragmatic clinical trial. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) in Physical Therapy (PT) Study (FM-TIPS) is a pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial examining if the addition of TENS to routine PT improves movement-evoked pain in fibromyalgia (FM). FM patients (n=600) were enrolled from 24 PT clinics (12 PT only, 12 PT with TENS) across five healthcare systems. COVID-19 has significantly impacted PT practice and in-person interactions. In response, all PT clinics saw reduced volumes of patients, some clinics furloughed PTs, and some clinics were permanently closed. This led us to put contracts, reliance agreements, and training of clinics on hold and to seek additional clinics that could fill the gap for those who could no longer participate. It also led to a delay in onboarding healthcare systems and inpatient enrollment. In order to protect the integrity of the study and minimize missing data due to potential restrictions of in-person visits we developed alternative strategies. This includes procedures for home instruction of TENS via telehealth, a plan for bringing on backup clinics, and a plan for training virtually and in-person using personal protective equipment and social distancing. Assessment of primary outcome and questionnaire data were transitioned for the patient to perform at home through a patient-portal with embedded patient-specific videos. We have also set up a phone line for patients to call with additional questions or concerns. The impact of COVID-19 on statistical design and analysis was discussed including a plan for uneven enrollment across clinics and a sub-analysis of data for patients enrolled during or after the pandemic. In conclusion, COVID-19 altered the original study design of this large-pragmatic trial to account for greater flexibility for providers and patients to facilitate continued enrollment.

645283,"Publisher Correction: Cause analysis of PM(2.5) pollution during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nanning, China",2021-07-27,"BACKGROUND: Older people are at increased risk of adverse health events because of reduced physical activity. There is concern that activity levels are further reduced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as many older people are practicing physical and social distancing to minimize transmission. Mobile health (mHealth) and eHealth technologies may offer a means by which older people can engage in physical activity while physically distancing. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for mHealth or eHealth technology in the promotion of physical activity among older people aged 50 years or older. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of reviews using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched for systematic reviews published in the English language in 3 electronic databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, and Scopus. Two reviewers used predefined inclusion criteria to select relevant reviews and extracted data on review characteristics and intervention effectiveness. Two independent raters assessed review quality using the AMSTAR-2 tool. RESULTS: Titles and abstracts (n=472) were screened, and 14 full-text reviews were assessed for eligibility. Initially, we included 5 reviews but excluded 1 from the narrative as it was judged to be of critically low quality. Three reviews concluded that mHealth or eHealth interventions were effective in increasing physical activity. One review found that the evidence was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: There is low to moderate evidence that interventions delivered via mHealth or eHealth approaches may be effective in increasing physical activity in older adults in the short term. Components of successful interventions include self-monitoring, incorporation of theory and behavior change techniques, and social and professional support.","McGarrigle, Lisa; Todd, Chris",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372894/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22201,59

Résultats Durant le confinement, 91 patientes ont été vues pour une demande de prise en charge, contre 159 durant la période contrôle, soit une baisse de 43,5 %. Les patientes étaient plus âgées (62,9 contre 60,9ans), sans que cette différence soit significative (p = 0,339). Le stade tumoral n’était pas modifié. En sénologie, le délai entre la biopsie et la première consultation a été allongé de 5,5jours (différence non significative). Parmi les 51 patientes ayant une indication opératoire durant le confinement, 16 (31,4 %) ont été reportés après la levée du confinement. Malgré tout, le délai entre la consultation et le début des traitements n’a pas été impacté. Nous n’avons pas non plus mis en évidence de modification statistiquement significative des pratiques.

Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, the containment measures and the recommendations of several societies in oncology may have impacted the request for initial care for cancers. Methods In this monocentric retrospective study, the number and the characteristics of patients received for a first consultation for a breast or gynecologic tumor were compared between the containment period and a control period. The times from diagnosis to treatment and the type of initial care were compared too. Results During the outbreak, 91 patients were seen for a new request, versus 159 during the control period, a decrease of 43.5 %. Patients were older (62.9 versus 60.9 years old) but this difference was not significant. Tumor stage was not modified. Concerning senology, the time from the biopsy to the first consultation was 5.5 days longer during the outbreak (difference statistically insignificant). Among the 51 patients requiring a surgical treatment during the outbreak, 16 (31.48 %) were postponed after the end of the containment measures. After all, the average time from the consultation to the treatment was not modified. No modification of type of treatment was observed. Discussion At the height of the pandemic, benefits and risks of the cancer treatment had to be daily balanced against the risk of exposition to the COVID-19.

647083,Refinement of long-term toxicity and carcinogenesis studies(),2004-09-27,"COVID-19, a disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has produced a serious emergency for global public health, placing enormous stress on national health systems in many countries. Several studies suggest that cytokine storms (interleukins) may play an important role in severe cases of COVID-19. Neutralizing key inflammatory factors in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) could therefore be of great value in reducing the mortality rate. Tocilizumab (TCZ) in its intravenous (IV) form of administration -RoActemra® 20 mg/mL (Roche)- is indicated for treatment of severe CRS patients. Preliminary investigations have concluded that inhibition of IL-6 with TCZ appears to be efficacious and safe, with several ongoing clinical trials. This has led to a huge increase in demand for IV TCZ for treating severe COVID-19 patients in hospitals, which has resulted in shortages. Here, we present a comparability study assessing the main critical physicochemical attributes of TCZ solutions used for infusion, at 6 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL, prepared from RoActeram® 20 mg/mL (IV form) and from RoActemra® 162 mg (0.9 mL solution pre-filled syringe, subcutaneous form), to evaluate the use of the latter for preparing clinical solutions required for IV administration, so that in a situation of shortage of the IV medicine, the SC form could be used to prepare the solutions for IV delivery of TCZ. It is important to remember that during the current pandemic all the medicines are used off-label, since none of them has yet been approved for the treatment of COVID-19.","Navas, Natalia; Hermosilla, Jesús; Torrente-López, Anabel; Hernández, José; Cabeza, Jose; Pérez-Robles, Raquel; Salmerón-García, Antonio",J Pharm Anal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095177920304895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837741/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095177920304895?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpha.2020.06.003,59

648861,Responses to Herman Cappelen and Jennifer Nado,2020-10-30,"SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious respiratory virus causing adult atypical pneumonia COVID-19 with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (+RNA) genome of ~ 29.9 kb and exhibits significant genetic shift from different isolates. After entering the susceptible cells expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly functions as an mRNA to translate two polyproteins from the ORF1a and ORF1b region, which are cleaved by two viral proteases into sixteen non-structural proteins (nsp1-16) to initiate viral genome replication and transcription. The SARS-CoV-2 genome also encodes four structural (S, E, M and N) and up to six accessory (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, and 9b) proteins, but their translation requires newly synthesized individual subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) in the infected cells. Synthesis of the full-length viral genomic RNA (gRNA) and sgRNAs are conducted inside double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) by the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC), which comprises nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and a short RNA primer. To produce sgRNAs, RTC starts RNA synthesis from the highly structured gRNA 3' end and switches template at various transcription regulatory sequence (TRS(B)) sites along the gRNA body probably mediated by a long-distance RNA–RNA interaction. The TRS motif in the gRNA 5' leader (TRS(L)) is responsible for the RNA–RNA interaction with the TRS(B) upstream of each ORF and skipping of the viral genome in between them to produce individual sgRNAs. Abundance of individual sgRNAs and viral gRNA synthesized in the infected cells depend on the location and read-through efficiency of each TRS(B). Although more studies are needed, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has taught the world a painful lesson that is to invest and proactively prepare future emergence of other types of coronaviruses and any other possible biological horrors.","Brant, Ayslan Castro; Tian, Wei; Majerciak, Vladimir; Yang, Wei; Zheng, Zhi-Ming",Cell Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281608/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13578-021-00643-z,59
649419,Pandemic planning: plotting a course through the coronawars,2020-06-11,"Abstract Ride-sourcing has recently been at the centre of attention as the most disruptive mode of transport associated with the so-called shared mobility era. Drivers, riders, the platform, policymakers, and the general public are considered as the main stakeholders of the system. While ride-sourcing platforms have been growing, so did the heightened tension between them and their drivers. That is why understanding drivers' behaviour and preferences is of key importance to ride-sourcing companies in managing their relationship with drivers (also known as driver-partners) and in retaining them in the presence of competence. Ride-sourcing drivers are not only chauffeurs but fleet owners. They can make various operational and tactical decisions that directly influence other stakeholders and the transport system performance as a whole. Conducting a series of focus groups with ride-sourcing drivers in the Netherlands, we have studied their opinions about the system functionalities as well as their possible interactions with the platform and wishes for changes. The focus group results suggest that the main decisions of drivers, which are ride acceptance, relocation strategies, working shift and area in which to work, could be affected by many elements depending on platform strategies, drivers' characteristics, riders' attributes, and exogenous factors. We find that part-time and full-time drivers, as well as experienced and beginning drivers, are characterized by distinctive behaviour. Flexibility and freedom were mentioned as the key reasons for joining the platform while an unfair reputation system, unreliable navigation algorithm, high competition between drivers, passenger-oriented platform, high-commission fee, and misleading guidance were acknowledged as being the main system drawbacks. Based on our findings, we propose a conceptual model that frames the relationship between the tactical and operational decisions of drivers and related factors.","Ashkrof, Peyman; Correia, Gonçalo Homem de Almeida; Cats, Oded; van Arem, Bart",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221053952030078X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221053952030078X,59
649680,The effect of semen collection location and time to processing on sperm parameters and early IVF/ICSI outcomes,2021-03-11,"Autophagic dysfunction is one of the main mechanisms by which the environmental pollutant cadmium (Cd) induces cell injury. Puerarin (Pue, a monomeric Chinese herbal medicine extract) has been reported to alleviate Cd-induced cell injury by regulating autophagy pathways; however, its detailed mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, to investigate the detailed mechanisms by which Pue targets autophagy to alleviate Cd hepatotoxicity, alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) cells were used to construct a model of Cd-induced hepatocyte injury in vitro. First, the protective effect of Pue on Cd-induced cell injury was confirmed by changes in cell proliferation, cell morphology, and cell ultrastructure. Next, we found that Pue activated autophagy and mitigated Cd-induced autophagy blockade. In this process, the lysosome was further activated and the lysosomal degradation capacity was strengthened. We also found that Pue restored the autophagosome-lysosome fusion and the expression of Rab7 in Cd-exposed hepatocytes. However, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and autophagic flux were inhibited after knocking down Rab7, and were further inhibited after combined treatment with Cd. In addition, after knocking down Rab7, the protective effects of Pue on restoring autophagosome-lysosome fusion and alleviating autophagy blockade in Cd-exposed cells were inhibited. In conclusion, Pue-mediated alleviation of Cd-induced hepatocyte injury was related to the activation of autophagy and the alleviation of autophagy blockade. Pue also restored the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes by restoring the protein expression of Rab7, thereby alleviating Cd-induced autophagy blockade in hepatocytes.","Wang, Tao; Wang, Li; Zhang, Yi; Sun, Jian; Xie, Yilin; Yuan, Yan; Gu, Jianhong; Bian, Jianchun; Liu, Zongping; Zou, Hui",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.632825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935722/,59

Our objective was to assess patterns and perspectives towards virtual oncology appointments during the pandemic among patients with cancer undergoing active treatment. We conducted an international Internet-based cross-sectional survey. Participants were eligible if they (1) were ≥18 years of age; (2) had been diagnosed with cancer (3) were currently undergoing cancer treatment, and (4) spoke English or French. Between 23 April 2020 and 9 June 2020, 381 individuals accessed the survey, with 212 actively undergoing treatment for cancer, including 27% with colorectal, 21% with breast, 7% with prostate and 7% with lung cancer. A total of 52% of respondents were from Canada and 35% were from the United States. Many participants (129, 62%) indicated having had a virtual oncology appointment during the COVID-19 pandemic and most were satisfied with their experience (83%). We found older participants (≥50 years; adjusted OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.85 compared to <50 years) and those with shortest duration of treatment (≤3 months; adjusted OR 0.06; 95% CI 0 to 0.69 compared to >12 months) were less likely to be satisfied with virtual oncology appointments. Virtual health platforms used differed across countries with higher telephone use in Canada (87%) and other countries (86%) as compared to the United States (54%; p-value < 0.05), where there was higher use of video conferencing. Altogether, our findings demonstrate favorable patient perspectives towards virtual oncology appointments experienced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Loree, Jonathan M.; Dau, Hallie; Rebić, Nevena; Howren, Alyssa; Gastonguay, Louise; McTaggart-Cowan, Helen; Gill, Sharlene; Raghav, Kanwal; De Vera, Mary A.",Curr Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499380/; https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol28010065,59
649956,Bovine whey proteins – Overview on their main biological properties,2007-08-03,"Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, MEL) is a hormone produced by the pineal gland that was discovered many years ago. The physiological roles of this hormone in the body are varied. The beneficial effects of MEL administration may be related to its influence on mitochondrial physiology. Mitochondrial dysfunction is considered an important factor in various physiological and pathological processes, such as the development of neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, various forms of liver disease, skeletal muscle disorders, and aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction induces an increase in the permeability of the inner membrane, which leads to the formation of a permeability transition pore (mPTP) in the mitochondria. The long-term administration of MEL has been shown to improve the functional state of mitochondria and inhibit the opening of the mPTP during aging. It is known that MEL is able to suppress the initiation, progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer as well as the sensitization of malignant cells to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This review summarizes the studies carried out by our group on the combined effect of MEL with chemotherapeutic agents (retinoic acid, cytarabine, and navitoclax) on the HL-60 cells used as a model of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Data on the effects of MEL on oxidative stress, aging, and heart failure are also reported.","Baburina, Yulia; Lomovsky, Alexey; Krestinina, Olga",J Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33917344/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11040274,59

The CINL scale was found to have two dimensions: frequency and comprehension, as well as good reliability and validity. A formal study explored the mediating effect of cognitive flexibility on the relationship between CINL and mental health. The results showed that CINL positively predicted mental health when it was mediated by cognitive flexibility.

Their applications as vectors of nucleic acids (NAs), from long DNA and mRNA to short interfering RNA (siRNA), have been pursued for decades to realize the promise of gene therapy, with approvals of the siRNA therapeutic patisiran and two mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 as recent milestones. The long-term goal of developing optimized CL-based NA carriers for a broad range of medical applications requires a comprehensive understanding of the structure of these vectors and their interactions with cell membranes and components that lead to the release and activity of the NAs within the cell. Structure–activity relationships of lipids for CL-based NA and drug delivery must take into account that these lipids act not individually but as components of an assembly of many molecules. This review summarizes our current understanding of how the choice of the constituting lipids governs the structure of their CL–NA self-assemblies, which constitute distinct liquid crystalline phases, and the relation of these structures to their efficacy for delivery. In addition, we review progress toward CL–NA nanoparticles for targeted NA delivery in vivo and close with an outlook on CL-based carriers of hydrophobic drugs, which may eventually lead to combination therapies with NAs and drugs for cancer and other diseases.","Ewert, Kai K.; Scodeller, Pablo; Simón-Gracia, Lorena; Steffes, Victoria M.; Wonder, Emily A.; Teesalu, Tambet; Safinya, Cyrus R.",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13091365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575441/,59

The purpose of this research was to determine CL use, compliance and patient-practitioner communication during a 3-month long COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. METHODS: An online survey (developed using Google Forms) retrospectively evaluated CL compliance during the 3-month lockdown (responses captured between 15th July and 10th August, 2020), with particular emphasis on patient-practitioner communication, handwashing practices and CL case hygiene and replacement. RESULTS: A total of 247 responses were collected and analysed. Most participants used monthly replacement soft lenses (64.8 %) and multipurpose solutions (75.7 %), with 86.6 % of them owning a storage case for their lenses. During lockdown, a significant percentage of participants ceased lens wear (28.4 %) or reduced wearing time (49.2 %). Regarding patient-practitioner communication, 54.3 % of respondents received specific instructions, mostly about handwashing (93.3 %) and storage case hygiene (48.5 %). The most frequent non-compliant practices were inadequate handwashing (36.4 %), and overextending monthly or two-weekly replacement lenses (35.2 %). Many respondents never cleaned (23.0 %) nor replaced (16.3 %) their storage case, and 27.8 % of them reported not having been informed about case hygiene by their practitioners. CONCLUSION: Contact lens compliance, particularly in terms of handwashing and storage case hygiene, was poor during a prolonged COVID-19 lockdown, thus stressing the need to foster patient-practitioner communication strategies to curtail the possibility of ocular transmission and the risk of virus tropism.","Cardona, Genis; Alonso, Silvia; Busquets, Anna",Cont Lens Anterior Eye,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clae.2021.02.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367048421000333?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33685823/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1367048421000333,59

Detail on the mechanics of large-scale programs is often missing from empirical research studies, but is a crucial aspect of organizational learning and development. Moreover, by focusing on the complex ways in which capacity-building is being institutionalized through an embedded model of in-service mentorship, this article bridges research and practice. We point to a number of areas that require further research as well as considerations for program managers designing comparable workforce strengthening programs.

RECENT FINDINGS: Despite multiple postulated mechanisms by which exercise may be harmful during active inflammation of the myocardium or pericardium, the exact pathophysiology remains largely unknown. The inclusion of multi-modality cardiac imaging may play a role in further elucidating the relationship of exercise with outcomes in pericarditis. More recently, the prevalence of COVID-19 cardiac involvement in athletes prior to returning to play appears lower than previously reported; however, current recommendations are consistent with those for other etiologies of pericarditis.

The leader-coding sequences at the 5'-end of genomic RNA are at least 72 nucleotides in length and are joined to the viral mRNAs by a unique mechanism. Utilizing a leader-specific cDNA probe, we have detected several free leader RNA species ranging from 70 to 82 nucleotides in length. The predominant leader RNA was approximately 75 nucleotides. In addition, larger distinct leader-containing RNAs were also detected ranging from 130 to 250 nucleotides in length. The 70–82-nucleotide leader-related RNAs were present in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of infected cells. They were also detected only in the small RNA fractions but not associated with the replicative-intermediate RNA. These data suggest that the leader RNAs were associated with the membrane-bound transcription complex but at least part of them were dissociated from the RNA template. We have also identified a temperature-sensitive mutant, which synthesizes only leader RNA but not mRNAs at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that leader RNA synthesis is distinct from the transcription of mRNAs. These data support the leader-primed mechanism for coronavirus transcription and suggest that one or more free leader RNAs are used as primers of mRNA synthesis.","Baric, Ralph S.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Razavi, Mahmood K.; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virus Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170285900383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2992183/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170285900383,59

The course is taught in a traditional manner, with weekly lectures, fortnightly tutorials and three practical sessions. In response to the growing numbers of COVID‐19 cases, in mid‐March the University leadership moved to cease face‐to‐face teaching. By this time, 58 of 96 students had completed the first two (of three) face‐to‐face laboratory practicals. In response to this decision, teaching of all practical based content was moved online for all students. The first question was, how do we teach practical content online? And secondly, how do we teach hands‐on skills? The first question was addressed using a suite of online simulations, progressively developed since 2013. Simulations are widely used and shown to be useful as teaching aids in STEM. A total of five simulations were introduced each covering key aspects of laboratory practice, including fundamental mathematical skills, reading, and setting a pipette, basic Biochemistry assays, protein quantification, and enzyme kinetics. The second issue of teaching hands on skills was addressed once restrictions were eased. Students were invited to attend the laboratory to learn the kinesthetic skills with instructor guidance. Both approaches used proved to be highly effective and can be readily adapted not only to teaching Biochemistry, but any aspect of science education.","Costabile, Maurizio",Biochem Mol Biol Educ,https://doi.org/10.1002/bmb.21427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812682/,59

Importantly, this presumption provides the rationale for utilization of therapy, until recently reserved mostly for autoimmune diseases (ADs), in the management of COVID-19 hyperinflammation condition and has led to an extensive discussion for the potential benefits and detriments of immunosuppression. Our paper intends to examine the available recommendations, complexities in diagnosis and management when dealing with patients with ADs amidst the COVID-19 crisis.

657780,Immune-mediated approaches against COVID-19,2020-07-13,"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a devastating effect on human lives. Recent reports have shown that majority of the individuals recovered from COVID-19 have serious health complications, which is going to be a huge economic burden globally. Given the wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test every individual in densely populated countries. Recent reports have shown that sewage-based surveillance can be used as holistic approach to understand the spread of the pandemic within a population or area. Here we have estimated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India, which is a home for nearly 10 million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR method. Interestingly, inlet samples of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets were negative, which indicates that the standard sewage treatment methods are efficient in eliminating the SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. Based on the detected viral gene copies per litre and viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 was estimated. Through this study we suggest that sewage-based surveillance is an effective approach to study the infection dynamics, which helps in efficient management of the SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Hemalatha, Manupati; Kiran, Uday; Kuncha, Santosh Kumar; Kopperi, Harishankar; Gokulan, C.

659804,Efficacy of Zinc Against Common Cold Viruses: An Overview,2015-12-23,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated from China.

This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data, mental health measurements, and stress-related questionnaires from workers in 2 hospitals in Yokohama, Japan, from March 23, 2020, to April 6, 2020. The prevalence rates of general psychological distress and event-related distress were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the 26-item stress-related questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes for workers both at high- and low-risk for infection of COVID-19. A questionnaire was distributed to 4133 hospital workers, and 2697 (65.3%) valid questionnaires were used for analyses. Overall, 536 (20.0%) were high-risk workers, 944 (35.0%) of all hospital workers showed general distress, and 189 (7.0%) demonstrated event-related distress. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that ‘Feeling of being isolated and discriminated’ was associated with both the general and event-related distress for both the high- and low-risk workers. In this survey, not only high-risk workers but also low-risk workers in the hospitals admitting COVID-19 patients reported experiencing psychological distress at the beginning of the outbreak.","Ide, Keiko; Asami, Takeshi; Suda, Akira; Yoshimi, Asuka; Fujita, Junichi; Nomoto, Munetaka; Roppongi, Tomohide; Hino, Kousuke; Takahashi, Yuichi; Watanabe, Kaori; Shimada, Tomoko; Hamasaki, Toyoko; Endo, Emi; Kaneko, Tomoko; Suzuki, Michiko; Kubota, Kazumi; Saigusa, Yusuke; Kato, Hideaki; Odawara, Toshinari; Nakajima, Hideaki; Takeuchi, Ichiro; Goto, Takahisa; Aihara, Michiko; Hishimoto, Akitoyo",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428676/,59

661670,Cancer in corona times,2020-09-24,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) identified in 2003 has infected ∼8000 people worldwide, killing nearly 10% of them. The infection of target cells by the SARS CoV is mediated through the interaction of the viral Spike (S) protein (1255 amino acids) and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (amino acids N318–T509 of S protein) harbors an extended excursion along its periphery that contacts ACE2 and is designated the receptor-binding motif (RBM, amino acids S432–T486). In addition, the RBM is a major antigenic determinant, able to elicit production of neutralizing antibodies. Hence, the role of the RBM is a bi-functional bioactive surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody (mAb) 80R which targets the RBM and competes with the ACE2 receptor for binding. Here, we employ phage-display peptide-libraries to reconstitute a functional RBM. This is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate RBM peptides that present a diversity of conformations. Screening such ‘Conformer Libraries’ with corresponding ligands has produced short RBM constructs (ca. 40 amino acids) that can bind both the ACE2 receptor and the neutralizing mAb 80R.","Freund, Natalia T.; Roitburd-Berman, Anna; Sui, Jianhua; Marasco, Wayne A.; Gershoni, Jonathan M.",Protein Eng Des Sel,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487711/; https://doi.org/10.1093/protein/gzv052,59

We envision this notion to help us gain a more nuanced understanding of the entanglements of the political, social, and affective dimensions of belonging and their effects on health, illness, and healing. A focus on embodied belonging, we argue, reveals how displacement, exclusion, and marginalization cause existential and health-related ruptures in people’s lives and bodies, and how affected people, in the struggle for re/emplacement and re/integration, may regain health and sustain their well-being. Covering a variety of regional contexts (Germany/Vietnam, Norway, the UK, Japan), the contributions to this special issue examine how embodied non/belonging is experienced, re/imagined, negotiated, practiced, disrupted, contested, and achieved (or not) by their protagonists, who are excluded and marginalized in diverse ways. Each article highlights the intricate trajectories of how dynamics of non/belonging inscribe themselves in human bodies. They also reveal how belonging can be utilized and drawn on as a forceful means and resource of social resilience, if not (self-)therapy and healing.","Mattes, Dominik; Lang, Claudia",Cult Med Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219905/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11013-020-09693-3,59

This proposal is supported by the observation that (i) macrophages and T cells (including NK cells, cytotoxic killer cells and other immunocytes) release AA and other BALs especially in the lungs to inactivate various microbes; (ii) pro-inflammatory metabolites prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotrienes (LTs) and anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4 (LXA4) derived from AA (similarly, resolvins, protectins and maresins derived from eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA and docosahexaenoic acid :DHA) facilitate the generation of M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) macrophages respectively; (iii) AA, PGE2, LXA4 and other BALs inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) synthesis; (iv) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are of benefit in COVID-19 elaborate LXA4 to bring about their beneficial actions and (v) subjects with insulin resistance, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease and the elderly have significantly low plasma concentrations of AA and LXA4 that may render them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine storm that is associated with increased mortality seen in COVID-19. Statins, colchicine, and corticosteroids that appear to be of benefit in COVID-19 can influence BALs metabolism. AA, and other BALs influence cell membrane fluidity and thus, regulate ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2) receptors (the ligand through which SARS-CoV2 enters the cell) receptors. These observations lend support to the contention that administration of BALs especially, AA could be of significant benefit in prevention and management of COVI-19 and other enveloped viruses.","Das, Undurti N.",Arch Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32981754/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920312637; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920312637?v=s5,59
664043,Evidence of antigenic imprinting in sequential Sarbecovirus immunization,2020-10-15,"PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the degree to which reasons for primary care visits changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We used data from the University of Toronto Practice Based Research Network (UTOPIAN) to compare the most common reasons for primary care visits before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the number of visits and the number of patients seen for each of the 25 most common diagnostic codes. The proportion of visits involving virtual care was assessed as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: UTOPIAN family physicians (N = 379) conducted 702,093 visits, involving 264,942 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2019 (pre-pandemic period), and 667,612 visits, involving 218,335 patients between March 14 and December 31, 2020 (pandemic period). Anxiety was the most common reason for visit, accounting for 9.2% of the total visit volume during the pandemic compared to 6.5% the year before. Diabetes and hypertension remained among the top 5 reasons for visit during the pandemic, but there were 23.7% and 26.2% fewer visits and 19.5% and 28.8% fewer individual patients accessing care for diabetes and hypertension, respectively. Preventive care visits were substantially reduced, with 89.0% fewer periodic health exams and 16.2% fewer well-baby visits. During the pandemic, virtual care became the dominant care format (77.5% virtual visits). Visits for anxiety and depression were the most common reasons for a virtual visit (90.6% virtual visits). CONCLUSION: The decrease in primary care visit volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied based on the reason for the visit, with increases in visits for anxiety and decreases for preventive care and visits for chronic diseases. Implications of increased demands for mental health services and gaps in preventive care and chronic disease management may require focused efforts in primary care.","Stephenson, Ellen; Butt, Debra A.; Gronsbell, Jessica; Ji, Catherine; O’Neill, Braden; Crampton, Noah; Tu, Karen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383844/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255992,59

As cervical cancer screening programmes were adjusting to the new situation, we evaluated the intensity, quality, and outcomes of cervical cancer screening in Slovenia in the first seven months of the pandemic. METHODS: Historical observational study on data from a population-based cervical cancer screening registry. Number of cervical cytopathology (screening and follow-up), histopathology (diagnostic procedures, invasive procedures and number of newly diagnosed CIN2+ cases) and HPV test results from the entire Slovenian women population between January 1st and September 30th 2020 were compared to a three-year average of the years 2017–19. FINDINGS: A two-month screening lock-down between March 12th and May 8th 2020 resulted in an epidemic deficit of screening (-92%), follow-up (-70%), and HPV triage tests (-68%), as well as invasive diagnostic (-47%) and treatment (-15%) of cervical lesions. Time to diagnosis and treatment did not increase; times to laboratory results fluctuated but stayed within standards. Slovenia has entered the second epidemic intending to add as little as possible to the pandemic deficit of screening smears (-23%) and yearly CIN2+ cases (-10%). Women aged 30–39 were most affected, with the highest pandemic deficit of screening smears (-26%) and yearly CIN2+ cases (-19%). INTERPRETATION: The pandemic has deeply affected all levels of our lives. New vulnerable groups and inequalities have emerged that require recognition and action. To prevent long-term increases in the cervical cancer burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that organised screening is maintained and monitored in settings where it can be safely and comprehensively provided.

Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities. PURPOSE: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. BASIC PROCEDURES: We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. MAIN FINDINGS: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average (standard deviation) hourly value of -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur.

Anxiety has been associated with poor diet quality and weight gain, which may lead to obesity, a risk factor for adverse COVID-19 outcomes. The present study was designed to examine associations between diet quality and anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This cross-sectional, international online study was conducted between March 30 and April 25, 2020 and available in seven languages: Arabic (7.6%), English (43.7%), French (0.8%), Hebrew (42.1%), Italian (3%), Russian (1.1%), and Spanish (1.6%). Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score (possible range: 0–17 points) and anxiety scored using the General Anxiety Disorder 7-point scale (GAD-7). The Google Survey platform was used to conduct the survey. RESULTS: A total of 3797 persons were included in the present analysis. More than 75% of respondents were female; most completed the survey in English or Hebrew. Median age was 31 (IQ = 18) years. Almost 60% indicated that their pre-pandemic diet was healthier than their current diet. The median Mediterranean diet score was 9 (IQ = 3).

Methods We prospectively collected data on thoracic malignancies surgeries from January 1 to April 30, 2020. We included patients from six high-volume thoracic surgery departments: Nancy and Strasbourg (France), Freiburg (Germany), Milano and Torino (Italy), and Montreal (Canada). The centers involved in this research are all located in the most impacted regions of the countries concerned. An assessment of COVID-19-related symptoms, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 infection, rates of hospital and intensive care unit admissions and deaths was performed for each patient. Every death was tested for COVID-19 by PCR. Results In the study period, 731 patients who underwent 734 surgical procedures were included. In the whole cohort, 9 cases (1.2%) of COVID-19 were confirmed by PCR, including 5 in-hospital contaminants. Four patients (0.5%) needed readmission for oxygen requirements. In this subgroup, two patients (0.3%) needed ICU and mechanical ventilatory support. The total number of deaths in the whole cohort was 22 (3%). A single death was related to COVID-19 (0.14%).

666612,"Whaling, Bullfighting, and the Conditional Value of Tradition",2020-11-19,"Camels are livestock that exhibit unique morphological, biochemical, and behavioral traits, which arose by natural and artificial selection. Investigating the molecular basis of camel traits has been limited by: (1) the absence of a comprehensive record of morphological trait variation (e.g., diseases) and the associated mode of inheritance, (2) the lack of extended pedigrees of specific trait(s), and (3) the long reproductive cycle of the camel, which makes the cost of establishing and maintaining a breeding colony (i.e., monitoring crosses) prohibitively high. Overcoming these challenges requires (1) detailed documentation of phenotypes/genetic diseases and their likely mode of inheritance (and collection of related DNA samples), (2) conducting association studies to identify phenotypes/genetic diseases causing genetic variants (instead of classical linkage analysis, which requires extended pedigrees), and (3) validating likely causative variants by screening a large number of camel samples from different populations. We attempt to address these issues by establishing a systematic way of collecting camel DNA samples, and associated phenotypic information, which we call the “Cdrom Archive.” Here, we outline the process of building this archive to introduce it to other camel researchers (as an example). Additionally, we discuss the use of this archive to study the phenotypic traits of Arabian Peninsula camel breeds (the “Mezayen” camels).

The economic costs to health during the 5 years were estimated to lie between US$1670 and $3655 million annually, accounting for about 6.55% of Beijing's gross domestic product each year. The total costs were apportioned into two parts caused by: the local emissions and long-range transported pollution. The contribution from local emissions dominated the total costs, accounting on average for 3.60% of GDP. However, the contributions from transported pollution cannot be neglected, and the relative percentage to the total costs from the other regions could account for about 45%. An energy policy and effective measures should be proposed to reduce particulate matter, especially PM(2.5) pollution in Beijing to protect public health. The Beijing government also needs to cooperate with the other local governments to reduce high background level of particulate air pollution.","Zhang, Minsi; Song, Yu; Cai, Xuhui",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969707001544; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969707001544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17316765/,59
668372,Stability Analysis in COVID-19 Within-Host Model with Immune Response,2020-11-03,"INTRODUCTION: The global 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is setting unprecedented demands on the nation and the military and surgical services. Surgical demands include a large backlog of surgical cases, strain on available resources, and the need for additional measures to prevent exposure. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the feasibility, duration, adverse events, and potential gains associated with using a Turbett Sterilization Pod (TSP) for total joint replacements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary team used the Plan–Do–Study–Act model to guide this project. A time–motion study was completed in the operating room (OR) to measure the average time required to set up surgical instrumentation for total joint replacement cases that required 12 or more instrument trays. We compared the amount of time it took to complete the setting up of instrumentation using the traditional method versus the TSP method. The traditional method consisted of unwrapping each surgical tray, checking for holes in the blue wrapper, and placing the tray on the back table. In the case of the TSP, the door of the pod was opened, and the instrument trays were transferred directly to the back table. We measured the time the staff took to perform the task using each of these methods. RESULTS: When compared to the traditional method, the use of the TSP resulted in improved turnover time, decreased room setup time, reduced environmental waste, and eliminated both the effect of damage to wrappers and the time previously spent wrapping surgical trays. CONCLUSION: The TSP minimizes the time needed by the staff to set up an OR suite for a total joint replacement, therefore permitting them to focus more on direct patient care. This time improvement suggests that all surgical specialties, including those requiring greater than 12 traditional instrument sets, may experience reduced turnover time between cases. The use of the TSP is one means to help rectify the OR backlog brought on by COVID-19.","Bradley, David F; Romito, Kenneth; Dockery, James; Taylor, Lance; ONeel, Nicholas; Rodriguez, Jose; Talbot, Laura A",Mil Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34469530/,59
668724,Starting a lab during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-02-23,"Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) plays a crucial role in B-cell receptor and Fc receptor signaling pathways. BTK is also involved in the regulation of Toll-like receptors and chemokine receptors. Given the central role of BTK in immunity, BTK inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Great efforts have been made in developing BTK inhibitors for potential clinical applications in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This review covers the recent development of BTK inhibitors at preclinical and clinical stages in treating these diseases. Individual examples of three types of inhibitors, namely covalent irreversible inhibitors, covalent reversible inhibitors, and non-covalent reversible inhibitors, are discussed with a focus on their structure, bioactivity and selectivity. Contrary to expectations, reversible BTK inhibitors have not yielded a significant breakthrough so far. The development of covalent, irreversible BTK inhibitors has progressed more rapidly. Many candidates entered different stages of clinical trials; tolebrutinib and evobrutinib are undergoing phase 3 clinical evaluation. Rilzabrutinib, a covalent reversible BTK inhibitor, is now in phase 3 clinical trials and also offers a promising future. An analysis of the protein–inhibitor interactions based on published co-crystal structures provides useful clues for the rational design of safe and effective small-molecule BTK inhibitors.","Zhang, Datong; Gong, He; Meng, Fancui",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26164907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443496/,59

While research efforts to develop a vaccine are on-going, others have suggested the use of available vaccines to boost innate immunity. Objective: We analysed three databases: UNICEF Immunization Coverage, Worldometer Corona Virus Updates and World Bank List of Economies to establish the association, if any, between vaccination for various diseases and COVID-19 death rates and recoveries across world economies. Results: Mean percentage death rates were lower in countries that vaccinated for Hepatitis-B birth dose (2.53% vs 3.79%, p = 0.001), Bacille Calmette-Guerin Vaccine (2.93% vs 5.10%, p = 0.025) and Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose (2.8% vs 4.01%, p = 0.022) than those which did not report vaccination. In high income countries, a significant negative correlation with death rates was observed with vaccination for Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose (r = -0.290, p = 0.032), Rubella- containing vaccine 1st dose (r= -0.325, p = 0.015), Hepatitis B 3rd dose (r = -0.562, p = 3.3 x10-5), Inactivated Polio vaccine 1st dose (r = -0.720, p = 0.008). Inactivated Polio Vaccine 1st dose and Measles-containing vaccine 2nd dose also correlated with better recoveries. In Low Income countries, only Rubella-containing vaccine correlated with lower deaths while Yellow fever vaccine was associated with poorer recoveries. Conclusion: Our analysis corroborates the potential benefit of vaccination and warrant further research to explore the rationale for repurposing other vaccines to fight COVID-19.","Gobe, I.; Koto, G.

To mitigate the risks and capitalise on opportunities for positive change, we must understand how the impact has been mediated by sociodemographics, mental disorders, personality traits, life circumstances and the coping measures people choose to take. METHODS Data were collected from 376,987 members of the general public, predominantly in the UK, between late December 2019 and May 2020. Interaction models examined differences in sociodemographic distributions of mood and anxiety for 233,268 people in January vs. 109,749 in May. Factor analysis of a comprehensive instrument determined the dimensionality of self-perceived pandemic-driven change in wellbeing, outlook and behaviour for 74,830 participants in May. Linear modelling identified demographic, contextual, clinical, and trait predictors of pandemic impact. Topic modelling distilled prevalent advice from free-text responses. RESULTS Anxiety, depression and insomnia changed markedly in demographically-mediated ways. Untoward changes were larger for older adults. Benefits were greater for younger adults. Social connectedness was negatively affected across most mental and neurological conditions. There were disorder-specific changes in other domains, e.g., heightened conflict at home for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and heightened anxiety for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, occupational variables and living conditions were amongst the strongest predictors of pandemic impact. Frontline health workers, carers of vulnerable older adults, and disabled or sheltered adults were disproportionately affected. Fifty advice topics were identified from free-text, the prevalence of which covaried with subpopulation, context and traits. CONCLUSIONS The general public report positive and negative consequences of the pandemic. Particular subsets of people have heightened risk of untoward effects whereas other groups appear resilient. To be valid and effective, studies seeking to quantify, predict or mitigate the impact of pandemics on mental health should apply holistic approaches, combining multiple psycho-socio-economic factors.","Hampshire, A.; Hellyer, P.; Soreq, E.; Trender, W.; Mehta, M.

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Individuals >10 years receiving influenza immunisations from 22 pharmacies and 90 non-pharmacy (general practice and other clinic) sites between March and October 2020 in Western Australia. Active vaccine safety surveillance was conducted using short message service and smartphone technology, via an opt-out system. OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the primary outcome: differences in proportions of AEFI between participants immunised in pharmacies compared with non-pharmacy sites, adjusting for confounders of age, sex and influenza vaccine brand. A subgroup analysis of participants over 65 years was also performed. RESULTS: Of 101 440 participants (6992 from pharmacies; 94 448 from non-pharmacy sites), 77 498 (76.4%) responded; 96.1% (n=74 448) within 24 hours. Overall, 4.8% (n=247) pharmacy participants reported any AEFI, compared with 6% (n=4356) non-pharmacy participants (adjusted OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.76 to 0.99; p=0.039). Similar proportions of AEFIs were reported in pharmacy (5.8%; n=31) and non-pharmacy participants (6; n=1617) aged over 65 years (adjusted OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.35; p=0.725). The most common AEFIs in pharmacy were: pain (2%; n=104), tiredness (1.9%; n=95) and headache (1.7%; n=88); and in non-pharmacy sites: pain (2.3%; n=1660), tiredness (1.9%; n=1362) and swelling (1.5%; n=1121). CONCLUSIONS: High and rapid response rates demonstrate good participant engagement with active surveillance in both pharmacy and non-pharmacy participants. Significantly fewer AEFIs reported after pharmacist immunisations compared with non-pharmacy immunisations, with no difference in older adults, may suggest different cohorts attend pharmacy versus non-pharmacy immunisers. The integrated pharmacy system is rapidly scalable across Australia with global potential.","Salter, Sandra; Singh, Gurkamal; Nissen, Lisa; Trentino, Kevin; Murray, Kevin; Lee, Kenneth; Kop, Benjamin; Peters, Ian; Leeb, Alan",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103321/,59
671054,Adult diet in England: Where is more support needed to achieve dietary recommendations?,2021-06-23,"Geographical variations in cardiovascular disease rates have been linked to individual air pollutants. Investigating the relation between cardiovascular disease and exposure to a complex mixture of air pollutants requires holistic approaches. We assessed the relationship between exposure to multiple air pollutants and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a general population sample. We collected data in the Lille MONICA registry (2008–2011) on 3268 incident cases (age range: 35–74). Based on 20 indicators, we derived a composite environmental score (SEnv) for cumulative exposure to air pollution. Poisson regression models were used to analyse associations between CHD rates on one hand and SEnv and each single indicator on the other (considered in tertiles, where T3 is the most contaminated). We adjusted models for age, sex, area-level social deprivation, and neighbourhood spatial structure. The incidence of CHD was a spatially heterogeneous (p=0.006). There was a significant positive association between SEnv and CHD incidence (trend p=0.0151). The relative risks [95%CI] of CHD were 1.08 [0.98–1.18] and 1.16 [1.04–1.29] for the 2nd and 3rd tertile of SEnv exposure. In the single pollutant analysis, PM(10), NO(2), cadmium, copper, nickel, and palladium were significantly associated with CHD rates. Multiple air pollution was associated with an increased risk of CHD. Single pollutants reflecting road traffic pollution were the most strongly associated with CHD. Our present results are consistent with the literature data on the impact of road traffic on the CHD risk in urban areas.","Occelli, Florent; Lanier, Caroline; Cuny, Damien; Deram, Annabelle; Dumont, Julie; Amouyel, Philippe; Montaye, Michèle; Dauchet, Luc; Dallongeville, Jean; Genin, Michaël",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32018947/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720301182; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.136608; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720301182,59

The virus originally came from Central African simian reservoirs and, from there, expanded rapidly across the Pacific to South America. The disease is an example of exantematic fever usually mild. Mortality is very low and mainly limited to secondary Guillain-Barré or fetal microcephaly cases. Diagnostic confirmation requires a RT-PCR in blood up to the 5th day from the onset or in urine up to the 10-14th day. Specific IgM are identifiable from the 5th symptomatic day. Clinically, a suspected case should comply with: a) a journey to epidemic areas; b) a clinically compatible appearance with fever and skin rash, and c) a generally normal blood count/basic biochemistry. There is some evidence that causally relates Zika virus infection with fetal microcephaly.

672919,The Role of Working Memory on Writing Processes,2021-08-27,"BACKGROUND: Microbial forensics is important in tracking the source of a pathogen, whether the disease is a naturally occurring outbreak or part of a criminal investigation. RESULTS: A method and SPR Opt (SNP and PCR-RFLP Optimization) software to perform a comprehensive, whole-genome analysis to forensically discriminate multiple sequences is presented. Tools for the optimization of forensic typing using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analyses across multiple isolate sequences of a species are described. The PCR-RFLP analysis includes prediction and selection of optimal primers and restriction enzymes to enable maximum isolate discrimination based on sequence information. SPR Opt calculates all SNP or PCR-RFLP variations present in the sequences, groups them into haplotypes according to their co-segregation across those sequences, and performs combinatoric analyses to determine which sets of haplotypes provide maximal discrimination among all the input sequences. Those set combinations requiring that membership in the fewest haplotypes be queried (i.e. the fewest assays be performed) are found. These analyses highlight variable regions based on existing sequence data. These markers may be heterogeneous among unsequenced isolates as well, and thus may be useful for characterizing the relationships among unsequenced as well as sequenced isolates. The predictions are multi-locus. Analyses of mumps and SARS viruses are summarized. Phylogenetic trees created based on SNPs, PCR-RFLPs, and full genomes are compared for SARS virus, illustrating that purported phylogenies based only on SNP or PCR-RFLP variations do not match those based on multiple sequence alignment of the full genomes. CONCLUSION: This is the first software to optimize the selection of forensic markers to maximize information gained from the fewest assays, accepting whole or partial genome sequence data as input. As more sequence data becomes available for multiple strains and isolates of a species, automated, computational approaches such as those described here will be essential to make sense of large amounts of information, and to guide and optimize efforts in the laboratory.

Using geographical analysis, we evaluated the impact of the distance from patients’ homes to the hospital on their participation in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (OCR). METHODS: All patients hospitalized for percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, valvular surgery, congestive heart failure, and aortic diseases were advised to participate in an OCR program after discharge. Using the dataset of our cohort study of OCR from 2004 to 2015 (n = 9,019), we used geographical analysis to investigate the impact of the distance from patients’ homes to hospital on their participation in our OCR program. RESULTS: Patients whose road distance from home to hospital was 0–10 km, 10–20 km, and 20–30 km participated more in OCR than those whose road distance was ≧ 30 km (OR 4.34, 95% CI 3.80–4.96; OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.61–3.40; and OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.61–2.23, respectively). Especially in patients with heart failure, the longer the distance, the lesser the participation rate (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Using geographical analysis, we successfully evaluated the factors influencing patients’ participation in OCR. This illustrates the importance of using geographical analysis in future epidemiological and clinical studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000028435.

To date, no study has been published on viral kinetics during the preclinical and clinical periods of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A confirmed case was defined as a patient with positive results by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients. Asymptomatic patients who had been screened for COVID-19 due to a strong epidemiologic link were also enrolled. The study population included 54 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 shows a very high viral load on the day of symptom development which then decreases overall. Rapid viral proliferation was observed 0–5 days before symptoms developed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value was lowest in clinical course from 5 days before symptoms to 10 days after symptoms occurred(Ct < 30). The rRT-PCR results were negative approximately 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, there was a continuous pattern that was negative and positive for up to 6 weeks and more. CONCLUSION: Considering the characteristic that COVID-19 has a high viral load before symptoms appear, it is necessary to consider to expand the scope of epidemiological investigations. Since there is very low possibility of transmission after 10 days of symptom occurrence, it may be considered to release isolation after 10 days of symptom occurrence in limited resource situations. This study allows for the planning of epidemiological investigations, patient's ward supply, and follow-up of patients through sequential changes in viral loads over the entire clinical course. In addition, it is possible to estimate the clinical time at which the patient is present.","Jang, Sukbin; Rhee, Ji-Young; Wi, Yu Mi; Jung, Bo Kyeung",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S120197122032302X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160066/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122032302X?v=s5,59

Postintensive care syndrome-family reduces the quality of life of the families of critically ill patients and may impede the recovery of such patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy has become a first-line nonpharmacological treatment of many psychological symptoms and disorders, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. With regard to managing mild-to-moderate symptoms, the delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy via mobile technology without input from a clinician has been found to be feasible and well accepted, and its efficacy rivals that of face-to-face therapy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our pilot study is to examine the efficacy of using a smartphone mobile health (mHealth) app to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy and diminish the severity and prevalence of PICS-F symptoms in family members of critically ill patients. METHODS: For our pilot study, 60 family members of critically ill patients will be recruited. A repeated-measures longitudinal study design that involves the randomization of participants to 2 groups (the control and intervention groups) will be used. The intervention group will receive cognitive behavioral therapy, which will be delivered via a smartphone mHealth app. Bandura’s social cognitive theory and an emphasis on mental health self-efficacy form the theoretical framework of the study. RESULTS: Recruitment for the study began in August 2020. Data collection and analysis are expected to be completed by March 2022.

In this context, betweenness centrality has demonstrated to be a very effective measure to identify nodes that act as focus of congestion, or bottlenecks, in the network. However, there is not a way to define betweenness outside the network framework. By analytically linking dynamical systems and network theory, we provide a trajectory-based formulation of betweenness, called Lagrangian betweenness, as a function of Lyapunov exponents. This extends the concept of betweenness beyond the context of network theory relating hyperbolic points and heteroclinic connections in any dynamical system to the structural bottlenecks of the network associated with it. Using modeled and observational velocity fields, we show that such bottlenecks are present and surprisingly persistent in the oceanic circulation across different spatio-temporal scales and we illustrate the role of these areas in driving fluid transport over vast oceanic regions.

676272,Mortality containment vs. Economics Opening: Optimal policies in a SEIARD model(),2021-02-14,"Genomic DNA is the best “unique identifier” for organisms. Alignment-free phylogenomic analysis, simple, fast, and efficient method to compare genome sequences, relies on looking at the distribution of small DNA sequence of a particular length, referred to as k-mer. The k-mer approach has been explored as a basis for sequence analysis applications, including assembly, phylogenetic tree inference, and classification. Although this approach is not novel, selecting the appropriate k-mer length to obtain the optimal resolution is rather arbitrary. However, it is a very important parameter for achieving the appropriate resolution for genome/sequence distances to infer biologically meaningful phylogenetic relationships. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach to identify the appropriate k-mer from whole-genome sequences. We present K-mer–length Iterative Selection for UNbiased Ecophylogenomics (KITSUNE), a tool for assessing the empirically optimal k-mer length of any given set of genomes of interest for phylogenomic analysis via a three-step approach based on (1) cumulative relative entropy (CRE), (2) average number of common features (ACF), and (3) observed common features (OCF). Using KITSUNE, we demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of these measurements to obtain empirically optimal k-mer lengths of 11, 17, and ∼34 from large genome datasets of viruses, bacteria, and fungi, respectively.

Bats are known to be the primary animal reservoir for coronaviruses. However, in the past few decades, the virus has been able to mutate and adapt to infect humans, resulting in an animal-to-human species barrier jump. The emergence of a novel coronavirus poses a serious global public health threat and possibly carries the potential of causing a major pandemic outbreak in the naïve human population. The recent outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has infected over 36.5 million individuals and claimed over one million lives worldwide, as of 8 October 2020. The novel virus is rapidly spreading across China and has been transmitted to 213 other countries/territories across the globe. Researchers have reported that the virus is constantly evolving and spreading through asymptomatic carriers, further suggesting a high global health threat. To this end, current up-to-date information on the coronavirus evolution and SARS-CoV-2 modes of transmission, detection techniques and current control and prevention strategies are summarized in this review.","Sharma, Anshika; Ahmad Farouk, Isra; Lal, Sunil Kumar",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13020202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572857/,59

The goals of this systematic review are to determine the impact of levels of physical activity on the prognoses of colorectal cancer patients and to suggest recommended guidelines for levels of physical activity. Methods: This systematic review was conducted along PRISMA guidelines. Per the inclusion criteria, papers published in academic journals in English from 2010 to 2019 were selected. A literature search was performed on PubMed (Medline), and the results of the selected studies were qualitatively synthesized. Results: Of the 13 cohort studies included in this systematic review, most studies were conducted in the United States (N = 7). Immobility or low levels of physical activity adversely affected the prognoses of colorectal cancer patients. Contrarily, high levels of physical activity increased the survival rate in people with colorectal cancer. Conclusion: For colorectal cancer patients, a level of physical activity of 17.5 to 35 MET hours per week is strongly recommended, which has been shown to reduce mortality by approximately 30 to 40%. Patients with limited physical capacity should maintain a minimum level of physical activity (≥3.5 MET hours/week).","Hong, Jineui; Park, Jungmin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18062896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33809006/,59
678435,Closing the circle of reverse genetics in reproductive medicine,2020-10-27,"Introduction. There are growing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. Ultimately, this could potentially lead to unmet needs of individuals requiring mental health support. Methods. Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional, descriptive timeseries was conducted using data from 1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020 across five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (n = 171,823) and appointments taking place (n = 865,902). Results. The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the 9 weeks after lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK. As referrals began to increase again, there was a relatively faster increase in referrals from Black, Asian, and ethnic minority groups as well an increase in referrals from more densely populated areas. Despite a reduction in access, service providers adapted to infection control guidance by rapidly shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation. Services were able to rapidly adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced dramatically, potentially placing a future burden on service providers to treat a likely backlog of patients in addition to a possible excess of patients as the long-term consequences of the pandemic become more apparent. Despite the observational nature of the data, which should be noted, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy.","Bauer-Staeb, C. M. M.; Davis, A.; Smith, T.

However, the perceived changes in psychological adjustment during home confinement with respect to the period before the pandemic have not been addressed yet. Moreover, little is known about the role of coparenting and specific COVID‐19 contextual variables on parental stress and children's behavioral difficulties in the Italian context. Using a cross‐sectional survey, we collected data on 841 Italian parents of children aged 3–11 years with typical development during the home confinement (20th April–18th May). We analyzed levels of parental stress, coparenting, and child externalizing behaviors before and during the home confinement. Additionally, hierarchical regressions were performed to investigate predictors of parental stress and child externalizing behaviors during the lockdown. Results showed that parental stress (especially in mothers) and child externalizing behaviors increased during the lockdown period. Coparenting was a strong predictor of parental stress, together with being a mother, younger child age, less time dedicated to the child, and scarce feasibility of remote working. Besides, child externalizing behaviors were predicted by male gender, less parental time dedicated to the child, higher parental stress, and child distance learning workload. Our findings indicate a negative impact of COVID‐19 lockdown in both parents and children, suggesting that positive coparenting and time dedicated to children may help to reduce the detrimental effect of pandemic restrictions on family adjustment.","Giannotti, Michele; Mazzoni, Noemi; Bentenuto, Arianna; Venuti, Paola; de Falco, Simona",Fam Process,https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195986/,59
679125,Digital pathology in the time of corona,2020-07-22,"Caprine parainfluenza virus type 3 (CPIV3) is an emerging respiratory pathogen that affects the sheep and goat industry in China and possibly other countries around the world. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs play important roles in regulating virus-host interactions and can suppress or facilitate viral replication. In this study, we showed that CPIV3 infection induced apoptosis in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, as determined by morphological changes and flow cytometry. Caspase activity and the expression of pro-apoptotic genes further indicated that CPIV3 induced apoptosis by activating both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. We also demonstrated the involvement of bta-microRNA-98 (bta-miR-98) in regulating CPIV3-induced apoptosis. Bta-miR-98 was downregulated in MDBK cells infected with CPIV3. Overexpression of bta-miR-98 significantly decreased the activities of caspase-3, −8, and −9. Conversely, inhibition of bta-miR-98 had completely opposite effects. Furthermore, our data showed that bta-miR-98 markedly affected CPIV3 replication by regulating apoptosis. Importantly, we found that bta-miR-98 modulated CPIV3-induced apoptosis by targeting caspase-3, an effector of apoptosis. Collectively, our results may suggest that CPIV3 infection induced apoptosis and downregulated the levels of bta-miR-98, and this miRNA regulated viral replication through effected apoptosis. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CPIV3 pathogenesis.","Li, Jizong; Zhong, Chunyan; Liao, Zheng; Mao, Li; Li, Wenliang; Sun, Min; Liu, Maojun; Ji, Xinqin; Liu, Chuanmin; Xue, Tao; Yang, Leilei; Zhang, Wenwen",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983081/,59

The aim of our study was to determine COVID-19 syndromic phenotypes in a data driven manner using survey results extracted from Carnegie Mellon University's Delphi Group. Methods Monthly survey results (>1 million responders per month; 320.326 responders with positive COVID-19 test and disease duration <30 days were included in this study) were used sequentially in identifying and validating COVID-19 syndromic phenotypes. Logistic Regression Weighted Multiple Correspondence Analysis (LRW MCA) was used as a preprocessing procedure, in order to weight and transform symptoms recorded by the survey to eigenspace coordinates (i.e. object scores per case / dimension), with a goal of capturing a total variance of >75%. These scores along with symptom duration were subsequently used by the Two Step Clustering algorithm to produce symptom clusters. Post-hoc logistic regression models adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities and confirmatory linear principal components analyses were used to further explore the data. The model created from 66.165 included responders in August, was subsequently validated in data from March to December 2020. Results Five validated COVID 19 syndromes were identified in August: 1. Afebrile (0%), Non-Coughing (0%), Oligosymptomatic (ANCOS) 2. Febrile (100%) Multisymptomatic (FMS) 3. Afebrile (0%) Coughing (100%) Oligosymptomatic (ACOS), 4. Oligosymptomatic with additional self-described symptoms (100%; OSDS) and 5. Olfaction / Gustatory Impairment Predominant (100%; OGIP). Discussion We present 5 distinct symptom phenotypes within the COVID-19 spectrum that remain stable within 9 to 12 days of first symptom onset.

Additionally, it has a poorly defined clinical presentation, and no known treatment or prevention methods. Collectively, these factors underscore the need for early diagnosis. Molecular tests have been developed to detect SARS coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) RNA using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) with varying levels of sensitivity. However, RNA amplification methods have been demonstrated to be more sensitive for the detection of some RNA viruses. We therefore developed a real‐time nucleic acid sequence‐based amplification (NASBA) test for SARS‐CoV. A number of primer/beacon sets were designed to target different regions of the SARS‐CoV genome, and were tested for sensitivity and specificity. The performance of the assays was compared with RT‐PCR assays. A multi‐target real‐time NASBA application was developed for detection of SARS‐CoV polymerase (Pol) and nucleocapsid (N) genes. The N targets were found to be consistently more sensitive than the Pol targets, and the real‐time NASBA assay demonstrates equivalent sensitivity when compared to testing by real‐time RT‐PCR. A multi‐target real‐time NASBA assay has been successfully developed for the sensitive detection of SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

681749,One size does not fit all: Assuming the same normal body temperature for everyone is not justified,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is leading to social (physical) distancing policies worldwide, including in the USA. Some of the first actions taken by governments are the closing of schools. The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce the number of cases and, ultimately, mortality comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the effect of school closure on the health-care labour force. The potential benefits from school closures need to be weighed against costs of health-care worker absenteeism associated with additional child-care obligations. In this study, we aimed to measure child-care obligations for US health-care workers arising from school closures when these are used as a social distancing measure. We then assessed how important the contribution of health-care workers would have to be in reducing mortality for their absenteeism due to child-care obligations to undo the benefits of school closures in reducing the number of cases. METHODS: For this modelling analysis, we used data from the monthly releases of the US Current Population Survey to characterise the family structure and probable within-household child-care options of US health-care workers. We accounted for the occupation within the health-care sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the health-care workforce that are most exposed to child-care obligations from school closures. We used these estimates to identify the critical level at which the importance of health-care labour supply in increasing the survival probability of a patient with COVID-19 would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. FINDINGS: Between January, 2018, and January, 2020, the US Current Population Survey included information on more than 3·1 million individuals across 1·3 million households. We found that the US health-care sector has some of the highest child-care obligations in the USA, with 28·8% (95% CI 28·5–29·1) of the health-care workforce needing to provide care for children aged 3–12 years. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling aged 13 years or older can provide child care, 15·0% (14·8–15·2) of the health-care workforce would still be in need of child care during a school closure. We observed substantial variation within the health-care system. We estimated that, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15·0% case reduction from school closings and 2·0% baseline mortality rate, a 15·0% decrease in the health-care labour force would need to decrease the survival probability per percent health-care worker lost by 17·6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. Our model estimates that if the infection mortality rate of COVID-19 increases from 2·00% to 2·35% when the health-care workforce declines by 15·0%, school closures could lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. INTERPRETATION: School closures come with many trade-offs, and can create unintended child-care obligations. Our results suggest that the potential contagion prevention from school closures needs to be carefully weighted with the potential loss of health-care workers from the standpoint of reducing cumulative mortality due to COVID-19, in the absence of mitigating measures.

The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune response is complex because it is regulated by various processes taking part at the intracellular, tissue, and host levels. To gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19, we formulate a multiscale model that integrate the main mechanisms which regulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 across multiple scales. The model describes the effect of type I interferon on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside cells. At the tissue level, we simulate the interactions between infected cells and immune cells using a hybrid agent-based representation. At the same time, we model the dynamics of virus spread and adaptive immune response in the host organism. After model validation, we demonstrate that a moderately weak inhibition of virus replication by type I IFN could elicit a strong adaptive immune response which accelerates the clearance of the virus. Furthermore, numerical simulations suggest that the deficiency of lymphocytes and not dendritic cells could lead to unfavourable outcomes in the elderly population.","Bouchnita, Anass; Tokarev, Alexey; Volpert, Vitaly",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.25.427896,59

Each microorganism can exert a different effect on the ENS, including phenotypical neuronal changes or the induction of chemical transmitters that interact with ENS neurons. Some pathogenic bacteria take advantage of the ENS to create a more suitable environment for their growth or to promote the effects of their toxins. In addition, some commensal bacteria can affect the central nervous system (CNS) by locally interacting with the ENS.

At the same time, bleeding complications have been observed in some patients. Better understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. Objective: To evaluate fibrinolysis among a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods: 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot lysis assays. Results: We found markedly elevated levels of tPA and PAI-1 among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated a strong correlation with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation, but not with D-dimer. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were also strongly correlated with mortality and with a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clot lysis. Conclusion: While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis and suggests that further study of tPA as a potential biomarker is warranted.","Zuo, Y.; Warnock, M.; Harbaugh, A.; Yalavarthi, S.; Gockman, K.; Zuo, M.; Madison, J.

Deficits in olfaction may be conductive or neurosensory in nature, with varying degrees of impairment resulting in a diminished quality of life and an increased risk for personal injury among patients. The aim of this research is to evaluate the results of the subjective and objective quantitative examinations of olfactory function in a group of patients with post-traumatic anosmia in order to predict its value in identifying olfactory deficits in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: The present study included 38 patients who reported anosmia or hyposmia caused by a traumatic head injury, and a group of 31 age- and sex-matched controls without olfactory dysfunction or prior history of head injury. The comparison of odor perception and identification of two oils (mint and anise) was assessed with the use of blast olfactometry with cortical olfactory event-related potentials. Results: Subjective olfactory tests revealed anosmia or hyposmia in 94% of patients with head injury-related olfactory dysfunction. Objective tests revealed olfactory event-related potentials from cranial nerve I produced by the stimulation with both mint and anise in 20 patients (52.6%). Olfactory event-related potentials from cranial nerve V produced by the stimulation with mint were registered in 26 patients (68.4%). The lack of any responses, from both cranial nerve I and V, was found in 12 patients (32% of cases). Conclusions: Findings from our study indicate the application of both subjective and objective examinations in the evaluation of patients with olfactory impairment. In the diagnosis of post-traumatic anosmia or hyposmia, objective examinations are particularly useful when the patients' level of cognition may be impaired or when subjects may be exaggerating their olfactory defects for a secondary gain. The diagnosis of damage to the olfactory system, specifically in the receptive part of the olfactory pathway, can be established in patients who showed reduced amplitudes or absent cortical responses in addition to absent odor identification and perception threshold in the subjective examination.","Limphaibool, Nattakarn; Iwanowski, Piotr; Kozubski, Wojciech; Swidziński, Teodor; Frankowska, Anna; Kamińska, Ilona; Linkowska-Swidzińska, Kamila; Sekula, Alicja; Swidziński, Piotr; Maciejewska-Szaniec, Zofia; Maciejewska, Barbara",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982956/,59

South Carolina is one of the US states that reopened early, following which it experienced a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility data to predict daily new cases at both the state and county level in South Carolina. METHODS: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020, in South Carolina and its five counties with the largest number of cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. Population mobility was assessed based on the number of Twitter users with a travel distance greater than 0.5 miles. A Poisson count time series model was employed for COVID-19 forecasting. RESULTS: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19 incidence as well as incidence in the top five counties (ie, Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland). At the state level, the final model with a time window within the last 7 days had the smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6% for the next 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in the last 9, 14, 28, 20, and 9 days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from 60.3%-74.5%.

687063,Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN) News page,2020-10-31,"Regarding the crucial role of deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes in many viruses, in particular, Adenovirus, HSV-1, coxsackievirus, and SARS-CoV-2, DUB inhibition was reported as an effective new approach to find new effective antiviral agents. In the present study, a new wave of 4-(2-nitrophenoxy)benzamide derivatives was designed and synthesized to fulfill the basic pharmacophoric features of DUB inhibitors. The molecular docking of the designed compounds against deubiquitinase enzymes of the aforementioned viruses was carried out. Significant molecular docking results directed us to conduct in vitro antiviral screening against the aforementioned viruses. The biological data showed very strong to strong antiviral activities with IC50 values ranging from 10.22 to 44.68 μM against Adenovirus, HSV-1, and coxsackievirus. Compounds 8c, 8d, 10b, and 8a were found to be the most potent against Adenovirus, HSV-1, coxsackievirus, and SAR-CoV-2, respectively. Also, the CC50 values of the examined compounds ranged from 72.93 to 120.50 μM. Finally, the in silico ADMET and toxicity studies demonstrated that the tested members have a good profile of drug-like properties. Furthermore, we concluded the structure–activity relationship (SAR) of the newly designed and synthesized compounds regarding their in vitro results, which may help medicinal chemists in further optimization to obtain more potential antiviral candidates in the near future as well.","Abdallah, Abdallah E.; Alesawy, Mohamed S.; Eissa, Sally I.; El-Fakharany, Esmail M.; Kalaba, Mohamed H.; Sharaf, Mohamed H.; Abo Shama, Noura M.; Mahmoud, Sara H.; Ahmed, Mostafa Al-Karmalawy Ahmed A.; Elkady, Hazem",New Journal of Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1nj02710g,59
687996,Increasing the efficiency of mechanical ventilators during pandemics through additive manufacturing,2021-04-11,"Replacements are the future of the dairy industry. Focusing on improving health management of replacements will yield tremendous returns through decreased losses of animals with the greatest genetic potential on the dairy, decreased costs of medication, improved growth rates, improved feed efficiency and earlier entry into the milking herd. Health management begins before replacements are born with attention to the nutrition of lactating and dry cows, the vaccination of lactating and dry cows, control of length of the dry period and both control of the disease status of the dams and the cleanliness of the calving environment. Adequate consumption of colostrums by newborn calves is very important. Attention must be paid to biosecurity to prevent introduction of diseases into the herd and to digestive disorders such as diarrhea, internal parasites and appropriate vaccination programs for the calves. Health management of replacements is often overlooked because producers do not see the immediate returns for their efforts.","Franklin, S.T.; Jackson, J.A.",Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744074004477; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744074004477,59
688107,Delta dawn,2021,"The COVID‐19 pandemic is seen as the biggest crisis since World War II. What started out as a public health issue, has quickly morphed into a political, economic, and societal crisis of epic proportions. Administrative capacity is a major factor in determining whether societies will emerge from this unprecedented situation with resilience and optimism, or despair and disconnectedness, and whether trust in government will increase or decrease. Autonomous and competent public managers are key producers of such administrative capacity. This paper addresses those public managers, the unsung administrative heroes leading us through times of crisis from behind the scenes. Translating the state of the art in public administration literature, with a particular emphasis on publications in this journal, into accessible practitioner recommendations, it identifies three key competencies paramount to public managers in times of crisis: managing stakeholders, political masters, and collaborative networks.

In Pakistan, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in February 2020. The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate people’s risk perception and protective behavior during the lockdown. Twenty-two (22) participants from eight big cities across Pakistan were interviewed. A six-step reflective thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The study focused on risk perception and protective behaviors. Our main analytical goal was to understand how risk perception shapes human behavior in the context of lockdown, pandemic-related information flow, and corresponding meaning-making. The study revealed that people influenced by information and advice campaigns form a perception of risk that has shaped their protective behavior. They used familiar means of coping with distress, including the search for strength through religious belief practices and following the precautions recommended by health professionals through the media.","Siddiqui, Salma; Qamar, Azher Hameed",Asian Bioeth Rev,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-021-00181-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367345/,59

689267,Reuse of N95 Masks,2020-04-13,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak is now a pandemic disease reaching as much as 210 countries worldwide with more than 2.5 million infected people and nearly 200.000 deaths. Amplification of viral RNA by RT-PCR represents the gold standard for confirmation of infection, yet it showed false-negative rates as large as 15-20% which may jeopardize the effect of the restrictive measures taken by governments. We previously showed that several hematological parameters were significantly different between COVID-19 positive and negative patients. Among them aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase had predictive values as large as 90%. Thus a combination of RT-PCR and blood tests could reduce the false-negative rate of the genetic test. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 24 patients showing multiple and inconsistent RT-PCR, test during their first hospitalization period, and compared the genetic tests results with their AST and LDH levels. RESULTS: We showed that when considering the hematological parameters, the RT-PCR false-negative rates were reduced by almost 4-fold. CONCLUSIONS: The study represents a preliminary work aiming at the development of strategies that, by combining RT-PCR tests with routine blood tests, will lower or even abolish the rate of RT-PCR false-negative results and thus will identify, with high accuracy, patients infected by COVID-19.
