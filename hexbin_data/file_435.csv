4205,Understanding the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders: the potential role of genomic regulatory blocks,2019-10-15,"Recent genome-wide association studies have identified numerous loci associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. The majority of these are in non-coding regions, and are commonly assigned to the nearest gene along the genome. However, this approach neglects the three-dimensional organisation of the genome, and the fact that the genome contains arrays of extremely conserved non-coding elements termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), which can be utilized to detect genes under long-range developmental regulation. Here we review a GRB-based approach to assign loci in non-coding regions to potential target genes, and apply it to reanalyse the results of one of the largest schizophrenia GWAS (SWG PGC, 2014). We further apply this approach to GWAS data from two related neuropsychiatric disorders—autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder—to show that it is applicable to developmental disorders in general. We find that disease-associated SNPs are overrepresented in GRBs and that the GRB model is a powerful tool for linking these SNPs to their correct target genes under long-range regulation. Our analysis identifies novel genes not previously implicated in schizophrenia and corroborates a number of predicted targets from the original study. The results are available as an online resource in which the genomic context and the strength of enhancer–promoter associations can be browsed for each schizophrenia-associated SNP.","Barešić, Anja; Nash, Alexander Jolyon; Dahoun, Tarik; Howes, Oliver; Lenhard, Boris",Mol Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6906185/,435
4539,A genetic analysis identifies a haplotype at adiponectin locus: Association with obesity and type 2 diabetes,2020-02-19,"BACKGROUND: A key focus of health systems strengthening in low- and middle-income countries is increasing reach and access through task-shifting. As such models become more common, it is critical to understand the experiences of lay providers because they are on the forefront for delivering care services. A greater understanding would improve lay provider support and help them provide high-quality care. This is especially the case for those providing mental health services, as providing psychological care may pose unique stressors. We sought to understand experiences of lay counselors, focusing on identity, motivation, self-efficacy, stress, and burnout. The goal was to understand how taking on a new provider role influences their lives beyond simply assuming a new task, which would in turn help identify actionable steps to improve interventions with task-shifting components. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews (n = 20) and focus group discussions (n = 3) were conducted with three lay counselor groups with varying levels of experience delivering a community-based family therapy intervention in Eldoret, Kenya. Thematic analysis was conducted, including intercoder reliability checks. A Stress Map was created to visualize stress profiles using free-listing and pile-sorting data collected during interviews and focus group discussions. RESULTS: Counselors described high intrinsic motivation to become counselors and high self-efficacy after training. They reported positive experiences in the counselor role, with new skills improving their counseling and personal lives. As challenges arose, including client engagement difficulties and balancing many responsibilities, stress and burnout increased, dampening motivation and self-efficacy. In response, counselors described coping strategies, including seeking peer and supervisor support, that restored their motivation to persevere. At case completion, they again experienced high self-efficacy and a desire to continue. CONCLUSIONS: Findings informed suggestions for ways to incorporate support for lay providers into task-shifting interventions at initiation, during training, and throughout implementation. These include acknowledging and preparing counselors for challenges during training, increasing explicit attention to counselor stress in supervision, fostering peer support among lay providers, and ensuring a fair balance between workload and compensation. Improving and building an evidence base around practices for supporting lay providers will improve the effectiveness and sustainability of lay provider-delivered interventions.","Wall, Jonathan T.; Kaiser, Bonnie N.; Friis-Healy, Elsa A.; Ayuku, David; Puffer, Eve S.",Int J Ment Health Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7031864/,435

DESIGN: Retrospective review of previously prospectively gathered data. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary care referral hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-three children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in place. INTERVENTIONS: TCD evaluation of the middle cerebral arteries was performed daily. CPP at the time of the TCD examination was recorded. For method 1, estimated cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPe) was calculated as: CPPe = MAP × (diastolic flow (Vd)/mean flow (Vm)) + 14. For method 2, critical closing pressure (CrCP) was identified as the intercept point on the x-axis of the linear regression line of blood pressure and flow velocity parameters. CrCP/CPPe was then calculated as MAP-CrCP. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred eight paired measurements were available. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CPPe was significant (r = 0.78, p = < 0.001). However, on Bland-Altman plots, bias was 3.7 mmHg with 95% limits of agreement of − 17 to + 25 for CPPe. Using patient averaged data, correlation between CPP and CrCP/CPPe was significant (r = 0.59, p = < 0.001), but again bias was high at 11 mmHg with wide 95% limits of agreement of − 15 to + 38 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: CPPe and CrCP/CPPe do not have clinical value to estimate the absolute CPP in pediatric patients with TBI.","O’Brien, Nicole F; Lovett, Marlina E.; Chung, Melissa; Maa, Tensing",Childs Nerv Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223617/,435

Here, we describe a novel population of lateral septum neurons expressing neurotensin (LS(Nts)) in mice that are selectively tuned to specific types of stress. LS(Nts) neurons increase their activity during active escape, responding to stress when flight is a viable option, but not when associated with freezing or immobility. Chemogenetic activation of LS(Nts) neurons decreases food intake and body weight, without altering locomotion and anxiety. LS(Nts) neurons co-express several molecules including Glp1r (glucagon-like peptide one receptor) and manipulations of Glp1r signaling in the LS recapitulates the behavioral effects of LS(Nts) activation. Activation of LS(Nts) terminals in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) also decreases food intake. These results show that LS(Nts) neurons are selectively tuned to active escape stress and can reduce food consumption via effects on hypothalamic pathways.","Azevedo, Estefania P; Tan, Bowen; Pomeranz, Lisa E; Ivan, Violet; Fetcho, Robert; Schneeberger, Marc; Doerig, Katherine R; Liston, Conor; Friedman, Jeffrey M; Stern, Sarah A",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7476759/,435

METHODS: MEDLINE, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to November 2019. English language randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of pre, pro or synbiotics on the feeding tolerance of enterally fed critically ill adult patients were included. RESULTS: Overall, 15 papers were selected for review. Among six studies reporting the energy intake, only two studies showed significantly higher energy intake in the prebiotic-receiving groups. Among four RCTs reporting frequency or time to achieve the target calorie, only one found a significant effect of probiotics to reduce the time to achieve a target dose of calorie. About the prevalence or duration of diarrhea, 7 out of 12 RCTs reported a beneficial effect. All but one study found no beneficial effects for gut microbiota manipulation on clinical endpoints including length of stay (LOS) in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU). CONCLUSION: It should be noticed that the heterogeneity in study designs, product format, and ICU patient populations makes it difficult to draw any general conclusion. Overall, it seems that pre, pro, or synbiotics have no significant beneficial effect on feeding tolerance and clinical endpoints in critically ill adults, but they may reduce the prevalence or duration of diarrhea.

16721,"News Journalists and Postruamatic Stress Disorder: a Review of Literature, 2011–2020",2021-04-10,"RATIONALE: Wrist-hand extension function rehabilitation is a vital and difficult part of hand function recovery in spastic stroke patients. Although botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) injection plus post injection therapy was applied to the wrist-hand rehabilitation in previous reports, conclusion was inconsistent in promoting function. For this phenomenon, proper selection of patients for BoNTA injection and correct choice of post-injection intervention could be the crucial factors for the function recovery. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a 46-year-old male suffered a spastic hemiplegia with wrist- hand extension deficit. DIAGNOSES: Computed tomography showed cerebral hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia region. INTERVENTIONS: Four hundred units of BoNTA were injected into the spasticity flexors, and four-week post injection surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback therapy was applied to the patient. OUTCOMES: The patient exhibited post-intervention improvement in wrist-hand extensors performance (strength, range of motion, sEMG signals), the flexors spasticity, and upper extremity function. LESSONS: The present case showed that 4-week of BoNTA injection plus sEMG biofeedback exercise improved the performance and function of wrist-hand extensors in the patient for short- and long-term. Proper selection of patients for BoNTA injection and correct choice of post injection exercise could play a vital role in the hand rehabilitation for patient with spastic hemiplegia.","Wu, Zhang-xiang; Wang, Chao; Huang, Zheng; Liu, Xue-han; Shen, Mei",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8036039/,435

A qualitative study",2021-06-11,"Globally, infection by seasonal influenza viruses causes 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000–650,000 respiratory deaths each year. Various influenza vaccines, including inactivated split‐ and subunit‐type, recombinant and live attenuated vaccines, have been developed since the 1930s when it was discovered that influenza viruses could be cultivated in embryonated eggs. However, the protection rate offered by these vaccines is rather low, especially in very young children and the elderly. In this review, we describe the history of influenza vaccine development, the immune responses induced by the vaccines and the adjuvants applied. Further, we suggest future directions for improving the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in all age groups. This includes the development of an influenza vaccine that induces a balanced T helper cell type 1 and type 2 immune responses based on the understanding of the immune system, and the development of a broad‐spectrum influenza vaccine that can increase effectiveness despite antigen shifts and drifts, which are characteristics of the influenza virus. A brighter future can be envisaged if the development of an adjuvant that is safe and effective is realized.","Kim, Yun‐Hee; Hong, Kee‐Jong; Kim, Hun; Nam, Jae‐Hwan",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209895/,435
18642,Association between psychological resilience and cognitive function in older adults: effect modification by inflammatory status,2021-06-29,"Biological nitrogen (N)-fixation is the most important source of N for soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], with considerable implications for sustainable intensification. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relevance of environmental factors driving N-fixation and to develop predictive models defining the role of N-fixation for improved productivity and increased seed protein concentration. Using the elastic net regularization of multiple linear regression, we analyzed 40 environmental factors related to weather, soil, and crop management. We selected the most important factors associated with the relative abundance of ureides (RAU) as an indicator of the fraction of N derived from N-fixation. The most relevant RAU predictors were N fertilization, atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation during early reproductive growth (R1–R4 stages), sowing date, drought stress during seed filling (R5–R6), soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), and soil sulfate concentration before sowing. Soybean N-fixation ranged from 60 to 98% across locations and years (n = 95). The predictive model for RAU showed relative mean square error (RRMSE) of 4.5% and an R(2) value of 0.69, estimated via cross-validation. In addition, we built similar predictive models of yield and seed protein to assess the association of RAU and these plant traits. The variable RAU was selected as a covariable for the models predicting yield and seed protein, but with a small magnitude relative to the sowing date for yield or soil sulfate for protein. The early-reproductive period VPD affected all independent variables, namely RAU, yield, and seed protein. The elastic net algorithm successfully depicted some otherwise challenging empirical relationships to assess with bivariate associations in observational data. This approach provides inference about environmental variables while predicting N-fixation. The outcomes of this study will provide a foundation for improving the understanding of N-fixation within the context of sustainable intensification of soybean production.","de Borja Reis, André Froes; Moro Rosso, Luiz; Purcell, Larry C.; Naeve, Seth; Casteel, Shaun N.; Kovács, Péter; Archontoulis, Sotirios; Davidson, Dan; Ciampitti, Ignacio A.",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239404/,435
18898,Six-minute walk test protocol variations in low-resource settings – A scoping review,2021-06-24,"Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, is the aetiological agent of toxoplasmosis, a disease that affects approximately 25% – 30% of the world’s population. At present, no safe and effective vaccine exists for the prevention of toxoplasmosis. Current treatment options for toxoplasmosis are active only against tachyzoites and may also cause bone marrow toxicity. To contribute to the global search for novel agents for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, we herein report the in vitro activities of previously synthesised benzyltriazole derivatives. The effects of these compounds against T. gondii in vitro were evaluated by using a expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) type I strain parasite (RH-GFP) and a type II cyst-forming strain of parasite (PruΔku80Δhxgprt). The frontline antitubercular drug isoniazid, designated as Frans J. Smit -isoniazid (FJS-INH), was also included in the screening as a preliminary test in view of future repurposing of this agent. Of the compounds screened, FJS-302, FJS-303, FJS-403 and FJS-INH demonstrated > 80% parasite growth inhibition with IC(50) values of 5.6 µg/mL, 6.8 µg/µL, 7.0 µg/mL and 19.8 µg/mL, respectively. FJS-302, FJS-303 and FJS-403 inhibited parasite invasion and replication, whereas, sulphadiazine (SFZ), the positive control, was only effective against parasite replication. In addition, SFZ induced bradyzoite differentiation in vitro, whilst FJS-302, FJS-303 and FJS-403 did not increase the bradyzoite number. These results indicate that FJS-302, FJS-303 and FJS-403 have the potential to act as a viable source of antiparasitic therapeutic agents.","Guo, Huanping; Gao, Yang; N’Da, David D.; Xuan, Xuenan",Onderstepoort J Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252180/,435

The most active extract was selected to profile the phytoconstituents by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS technique. Among the tested extracts, the 80% hydroethanolic extract exhibited the maximum levels of total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) with a contribution of 201.3 ± 2.6 mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram of extract (GAE/g extract), and 116.3 ± 2.4 mg of rutin equivalent per gram of extract (RE/g extract), respectively. The same extract also showed promising 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and PL inhibitory activity with an IC(50) (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of 30.5 ± 2.8 µg/mL and 17.31 ± 1.18 μg/mL, respectively. The phytochemical profiling of 80% hydroethanolic extract confirmed the presence of 23 metabolites of immense medicinal significance. Docking studies were conducted to investigate the potential interactions of compounds identified in the study. The docking study-based binding energy data and the interaction scheme both revealed the possible role of the identified compounds towards PL inhibitor. Moreover, energies of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), ionization potentials (IP), electron affinities (EA) and molecular electrostatic potentials (MEP) were also explored.

METHODS: A database for spatial analysis of cataract surgery in China in 2013–2017 was established using ArcGIS10.0 software as a platform for data management and presentation. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of cataract surgery was undertaken, and temporal and spatial scan analysis was done using SaTScan 9.5 software. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2017, annual cataract surgery rates (CSRs) in China were 1200, 1400, 1782, 2070, and 2205 per 1 million population, indicating a gradually increasing trend. Local Moran’s I autocorrelation analysis showed that there was spatial clustering of CSR in China, with Anhui being a low-high clustering region. Findings of global hotspot analysis Getis-Ord General G showed that General G index of national CSR was <0.01, Z = 1.12, P = 0.26. Findings of staged spatial-temporal scan analysis indicated that 18 areas of aggregation were found in 2 stages. Observed differences in each clustering area were statistically significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CSRs in China showed increasing trend year by year and were randomly distributed, with spatial clustering, and Anhui was reported as a low-high clustering region.

This layer contributes to biological defense by eliminating irritants, but excessive MUC5AC secretion by the airway epithelial cells exacerbates asthma. Therefore, regulating mucin production is important for asthma treatment. In this study, the effects of integrin β1 subunit on MUC5AC and MUC5B production were examined in NCI–H292 human lung cancer epithelial cells. When integrin β1 was overexpressed, cellular and secreted MUC5AC levels were decreased, whereas cellular MUC5B production was increased. Conversely, integrin β1 depletion using siRNA increased cellular and secreted MUC5AC production, but decreased cellular MUC5B production. Further, the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which promotes MUC5AC production, was decreased by integrin β1 overexpression and increased by its depletion. These results suggest that integrin β1 suppresses MUC5AC production and promotes MUC5B production by downregulating ERK.","Iwashita, Jun; Murata, Jun",Biochem Biophys Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8416645/,435

However, an important limitation of that problem is that it is assumed that trends remain stable over time. But in real-life, trends may change in different time intervals due to specific events. To identify time intervals where itemsets have increasing/decreasing trends in terms of utility, this paper proposes the problem of mining Locally Trending High Utility Itemsets (LTHUIs) and their Trending High Utility Periods (THUPs). Properties of the problem are studied and an efficient algorithm named LTHUI-Miner is proposed to enumerate all the LTHUIs and their THUPs.

CONCLUSION: The Konferenz Onkologischer Kranken- und Kinderkrankenpflege (KOK), a working group of Section B in the German Cancer Society, is working intensively on strengthening the role of oncological nursing so that oncological nurses and advanced practice nurses specialising in oncology, as an integral part of the multidisciplinary team, can contribute valuable nursing aspects, taking into account the individual patient perspective, and thus improve the quality of oncological care.","Knötgen, G.",Onkologe (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7517068/,435
40589,The Impact of App-Delivered Mindfulness Meditation on Functional Connectivity and Self-Reported Mindfulness Among Health Profession Trainees,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent delivery of tidal mechanical energy (ME) inflicts ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) when stress and strain exceed the limits of tissue tolerance. Mechanical power (MP) is the mathematical description of the ME delivered to the respiratory system over time. It is unknown how ME relates to underlying lung pathology and outcome in mechanically ventilated children. We therefore tested the hypothesis that ME per breath with tidal volume (Vt) normalized to bodyweight correlates with underlying lung pathology and to study the effect of resistance on the ME dissipated to the lung. METHODS: We analyzed routinely collected demographic, physiological, and laboratory data from deeply sedated and/or paralyzed children < 18 years with and without lung injury. Patients were stratified into respiratory system mechanic subgroups according to the Pediatric Mechanical Ventilation Consensus Conference (PEMVECC) definition. The association between MP, ME, lung pathology, and duration of mechanical ventilation as a primary outcome measure was analyzed adjusting for confounding variables and effect modifiers. The effect of endotracheal tube diameter (ETT) and airway resistance on energy dissipation to the lung was analyzed in a bench model with different lung compliance settings. RESULTS: Data of 312 patients with a median age of 7.8 (1.7–44.2) months was analyzed. Age (p < 0.001), RR p < 0.001), and Vt < 0.001) were independently associated with MPrs. ME but not MP correlated significantly (p < 0.001) better with lung pathology. Competing risk regression analysis adjusting for PRISM III 24 h score and PEMVECC stratification showed that ME on day 1 or day 2 of MV but not MP was independently associated with the duration of mechanical ventilation. About 33% of all energy generated by the ventilator was transferred to the lung and highly dependent on lung compliance and airway resistance but not on endotracheal tube size (ETT) during pressure control (PC) ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: ME better related to underlying lung pathology and patient outcome than MP. The delivery of generated energy to the lung was not dependent on ETT size during PC ventilation. Further studies are needed to identify injurious MErs thresholds in ventilated children.","Kneyber, Martin C.

The advent and approval of first small interference RNA (siRNA) -based treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis for clinical use has raised the hopes to test this approach against highly susceptible viruses like HCV. We investigated the antiviral potential of consensus siRNAs targeted to stem-loops (SLs) II and III nucleotide motifs of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) structure within 5′ UTR of HCV sub-genotype 4a isolates from the Saudi population. siRNA inhibitory effects on viral replication and translation of full-length HCV genome were determined in a competent, persistent, and reproducible Huh-7 cell culture system maintained for one month. Maximal inhibition of RNA transcript levels of HCV-IRES clones and silencing of viral replication and translation of full-length virus genome was demonstrated by siRNAs targeted to SL-III nucleotide motifs of IRES in Huh-7 cells. siRNA Usi-169 decreased 5′ UTR RNA transcript levels of HCV-IRES clones up to 75% (P < 0.001) at 24 h post-transfection and 80% (P < 0.001) at 48 h treatment in Huh-7 cells. 5′ UTR-tagged GFP protein expression was significantly decreased from 70 to 80% in Huh-7 cells co-transfected with constructed vectors (i.e. pCR3.1/GFP/5′ UTR) and siRNA Usi-169 at 24 h and 48 h time-span. Viral replication was inhibited by more than 90% (P < 0.001) and HCV core (C) and hypervariable envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) expression was also significantly degraded by intracytoplasmic siRNA Usi-169 activity in persistent Huh-7 cell culture system. The findings unveil that siRNAs targeted to 5′ UTR-IRES of HCV sub-genotype 4a Saudi isolates show potent silencing of HCV replication and blocking of viral translation in a persistent in-vitro Huh-7 tissue culture system. Furthermore, we also elucidated that siRNA silencing of viral mRNA not only inhibits viral replication but also blocks viral translation. The results suggest that siRNA potent antiviral activity should be considered as an effective anti-mRNA based treatment strategies for further in-vivo investigations against less studied and harder-to-treat HCV sub-genotype 4a isolates in Saudi Arabia.","AlMalki, Waleed H.; Shahid, Imran; Abdalla, Ashraf N.; Johargy, Ayman K.; Ahmed, Muhammad; Hassan, Sajida",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7785429/,435

His was not a typical business career and that unorthodox experience helped shape an equally unorthodox presidency. Trump’s success at building a business empire is instructive for his efforts to build its political equivalent. There are similarities—ambition, a can-do spirit, vision, courage, determination, flexibility, an astute sense of timing, and discipline. There are also lessons to be carried into this presidency regarding resilience and successfully coming back from an almost catastrophic business failure. These experiences are likely to be helpful as he navigates the national consequences connected with the Coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath. However, Trump did have to learn how to be a possibly successful president and move on from the many sobering surprises about the office that he found on assuming it, and for which he was not prepared by his CEO experience. The chapter concludes by examining the large range of Trump’s presidential interests, his presidential work patterns, and his approach to the core function of any presidency—his decision making style and judgment.","Renshon, Stanley",The Real Psychology of the Trump Presidency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991541/,435

Attaining the best drugs to treat COVID-19 at the shortest possible time is one of the most critical issues in this urgent situation. Molecular docking investigation of the therapeutic potential of marketed drugs is a fast and cost-effective approach to provide a solution to this problem. The recent research efforts have led to the resolving of the 3CLpro structure as a key protease in the lifecycle of coronavirus, which could facilitate in silico evaluation of drug candidates. Herein, the similarity between the SARS-CoV-2-3CL main protease and the other SARS-CoV receptors was evaluated via multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. The reported structure of the 3CLpro was considered as a target to identify potential inhibitors for treating COVID-19 using molecular docking based virtual screening protocol. Accordingly, a database of 50 synthetic compounds with various pharmacological usage such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-human immunodeficiency viruses, antimalarial, antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant including approved drugs and those undergoing clinical trials, and 40 natural compounds particularly those employed in traditional Iranian medicine was constructed. The output of multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 main protease shares a similarity of 96% with SARS-CoV. Also, the docking results indicated that the licofelone acyl glucuronide as an anti-inflammatory drug and delta-bilirubin as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent as well as kappa-carrageenan conformer, beta-D-galactopyranosyl and calycosin 7-O-glucoside as natural compounds with minimal side-effects, according to in vitro studies, are good candidates to block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Moreover, the compound 1 with the highest negative binding energy is a chemical compound that due to its favorable interactions with the 3CLpro can be identified as a representative potential drug candidate for COVID-19.

This change will be analyzed by looking at three trends in mathematics education: the use of digital technology, philosophy of mathematics education, and critical mathematics education. Digital technology became a trend in mathematics education in response to the arrival of a different kind of artifact to the mathematics classroom. It was thrust into the spotlight as the pandemic suddenly moved classrooms online around the world. Challenges specific to mathematics education in this context must be addressed. The link between the COVID-19 pandemic and digital technology in education also raises epistemological issues highlighted by philosophy of mathematics education and critical mathematics education. Using the notion that the basic unit of knowledge production throughout history is humans-with-media, I discuss how humans are connected to the virus, how it has laid bare social inequality, and how it will change the agendas of these three trends in mathematics education. I highlight the urgent need to study how mathematics education happens online for children when the home environment and inequalities in access to digital technologies assume such significant roles as classes move on-line. We need to understand the political role of agency of artifacts such as home in collectives of humans-with-media-things, and finally we need to learn how to implement curricula that address social inequalities.

We report the first documented case of surgical resection of an advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with extensive invasion to distal stomach, atrium and hepatic vasculatures. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present a case of 48-years old man with abdominal mass accompanying shortness of breath after activities. DIAGNOSES: Preoperative examination revealed giant HCC with tumor thrombi extending into portal vein, HVs, inferior vena cava, and atrium. INTERVENTIONS: Distal stomach involvement was confirmed at surgery and, distal gastrectomy, atrial reconstruction and ante-situm liver resection and autotransplantation under cardio-pulmonary bypass were performed. OUTCOMES: The operation time was 490 minutes, extracorporeal circulation time 124 minutes, and anhepatic time 40 minutes. Postoperative follow-up revealed normal hepatic and cardiac function with no sign of recurrence. LESSONS: This case illustrates that the extensive invasion of HCC to major vasculature and adjacent organs may not necessarily preclude the liver autotransplantation with multi-visceral resection as the treatment option of extremely advanced HCC patients.","Tuxun, Tuerhongjiang; Apaer, Shadike; Yao, Gang; Wang, Zhipeng; Gu, Shensen; Zeng, Qi; Aizezijiang, Aidan; Wu, Jing; Anweier, Nuerzhatijiang; Zhao, Jinming; Li, Tao",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8133267/,435
53218,1017 Audit of Sore Throat Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been announced as a pandemic worldwide. The respiratory tract is a target organ-system which can result in serious complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Management of this condition is more challenging in diabetes who developed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Clinical Case: We report a case of a 59-year-old male who presented with 4 days of productive cough with blood-tinged sputum, shortness of breath, and chills. Patient had decreased oral intake and had not been compliant with his medication. He had underlying disease significant for type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension, obesity (BMI 32 kg/m2), history of pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis. His diabetes medications included insulin degludec 126 units with insulin lispro sliding scale, dulaglutide, metformin, and sitagliptin. On examination, the patient was lethargic. Initial vital signs included a temperature of 36.8°C, respiratory rate 24/min, heart rate 65 bpm, BP 140/67 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 91% on room air. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral widespread crackles. Laboratory was significant for glucose 387 mg/dL (70–139), pH 7.25 (7.35-7.28), anion gap 15.8 mEq/L (6–14) and concurrent normal gap acidosis, urine ketones 15 mg/dL (negative), and LDH 325 U/L (140–171). An initial chest x-ray showed bilateral peripheral pulmonary infiltrates. Workup was negative for influenza, pneumococcus, and legionella. The patient was subsequently intubated on the first day for worsening hypoxia due to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 71). He was concomitantly treated for DKA and hypotension with intravenous insulin, initially started at 12 units/hour with subsequent titration down to average of 5 units/hour, fluid resuscitation (approximate 34 ml/kg actual body weight) and, potassium repletion on the first day. On the same day, his hypoxia worsened with an increase in pulmonary infiltrates, so we stopped intravenous fluids and initiated norepinephrine for 24 hours. His mechanical ventilation settings followed ARDS guidelines. Positive COVID-19 was detected from real-time RT-PCR. After maintaining a negative fluid balance, we were able to extubate in 72 hours. Intravenous insulin was continued for 46 hours then was switched to subcutaneous basal-bolus regimen. He was discharged with insulin degludec 100 units with insulin lispro sliding scale, metformin, and sitagliptin. Dulaglutide was held. Conclusion: Type 2 diabetes are rarely affected by DKA but can be found in up to 27% of the cases. There are reports of ARDS as a serious complication in severe DKA in adults and children, yet no data for concomitant DKA and ARDS has been published. We propose that the management of DKA in COVID-19 patients with ARDS may be similar to the paradigm utilized for other volume restriction in patients with congestive heart failure and end-stage renal failure.","Panjawatanan, Panadeekarn; Jha, Samir; Hughes, Joseph; Riesenfeld, Erik",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135288/,435
53269,883 Modified Framework for The Management of Acute Gallstone Disease During The COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims In 2017 an audit and survey of giant-cell arteritis (GCA) services were conducted across northwest England (reported previously). This re-survey in 2020, following publication of revised BSR guidance, sought to identify what changes were made in the intervening period, and provided the opportunity to assess the impact of COVID-19. Methods Rheumatologists from 16 hospitals in northwest England were invited to complete a survey in July 2020. Questions focused on service provision for GCA, including pathways, diagnostics and steroid prescription. Results Responses were received from 14/16 sites in 2017, and 15/16 in 2020. 9/15 (60%) sites reported that the 2017 audit and survey prompted changes to GCA services, with two (13%) stating that it clarified the need for implementation of existing plans. Two sites had a GCA pathway in 2017. Four of the seven sites who committed to introducing one have now done so, bringing the total in 2020 to six. Eight of the nine remaining sites plan to implement one, six with a specific date within six months. Six (40%) have completed additional local audit/QI since 2017. Temporal artery (TA) ultrasound (US) is now available in an additional four sites, bringing the total to 6/15 (40%) in 2020. Two sites reported improvement in both time between first rheumatology consultation and TA biopsy, and time to receive results (now <7 days for each task in 6/15 (40%)). Six additional sites reported providing leaflets on steroids routinely, bringing the total in 2020 to 12/15 (80%), versus 6/14 (43%) previously. Four sites (27%) now have a database of GCA patients (one in 2017). There was no major change in sites having a standard protocol for steroid taper (n = 8 2017; n = 7 2020, 89% and 100% of whom respectively use BSR guidance), nor in the number of patients routinely provided steroid cards (six in 2017; five in 2020). The three sites who do not report giving leaflets on steroids routinely, all had a pathway. 8/15 (53%) reported COVID-19 having an adverse effect upon services, including: reduced access to diagnostics (n = 7: TA US, biopsy, and PET-CT); delayed appointments (n = 4); delayed referrals (n = 3). The tertiary referral centre reported an improvement because access to tocilizumab was facilitated by a relaxation of rules by NHS England. Conclusion The original audit and survey of current GCA practice in 2017 highlighted areas for improvement for each site, and regionally. Sites contributing to this re-survey report that the exercise stimulated them to improve their current care. The 2017 exercise showed a strong correlation between reported practice (survey) and actual practice (audit), leading us to have confidence that responses provided a true picture of care. This work demonstrates the power of audit to drive improvement, at a regional level. Disclosure C.A. Sharp: None. J. Little: None. A. Shahbaz: None. E.F. Wood: None. S. Wig: None. P. Watson: None. S.

Case Presentation: We present a case of 73 year old male COVID-19 positive patient. In 2017 transnasal hypophysectomy was performed due to prolactinoma. He receives therapy (hydrocortisone 20 + 10 mg/day, levothyroxine 75/50 µg/day, bromocriptine 2.5 mg twice/day). He suffers also from arterial hypertension. Present illness started with intensive dry cough, fever (37.5(◦)C), diarrhoea and loss of smell. On the first day patient was febrile up to 38.4◦C and later afebrile. Laboratory parameters showed abnormalities in several parameters: D-dimers 13.45 (RR:< 0.50) mg/L, creatinine 110 (49-90) µmol/L, ALT 73 (12-28) U/L, LDH 531 (25-241) U/L, creatine kinase 549 (<177) U/L, GGT 277 (9-35) U/L, CRP 38 (<5 mg/L), sedimentation rate 40 (5-28) mm/3.6ks, procalcitonine 0.07 (<0.05) ng/ml, sodium 128 (137-146) mmol/L, hs-TroponinT 18 (< 14) ng/L, neutrophils 8.56 (2.06-6.49 x10(9)/L), lymphocytes 0.52 (1.19-3.35 x10(9)/L) and pO(2) 6.1 (11.0-14.4) kPa. At the admission X-ray showed normal presentation, while four days later on the right side pneumonia was noticed as spotty inhomogeneous shading. He was treated with azithromycin, hydrocortisone (50 mg twice/day) and oxygen supplementation. At the beginning of hospitalization he was addicted to O(2) 10-12 L/min. After 22 days of hospitalization he was discharged without any symptom but with still positive SARS-CoV2 swabs. After a 30 days of follow-up, his swabs are now negative with no laboratory abnormalities. In the meantime, his two brothers, born in 1945 and 1940 died due to COVID-19 infection. They did not receive substitutional corticosteroid therapy. Conclusion: The main pathophysiological mechanism of infection is explained by cytokine storm. Hypercytokinemia causes myelosuppression and vascular endothelium damage. Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. High-doses of corticosteroids might beneficially modulate the host immune response to SARS-CoV2 virus and have protective role in this patient.","Kurir, Tina Ticinovic; Mizdrak, Maja; Krnić, Mladen",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135467/,435
53300,594 Optimising Hand Trauma Care at a Major Trauma Centre (MTC) During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent and young patients with chronic diseases is likely to be multi-factorial, and influenced by various aspects, such as age, sex, education, ethnicity, as well as disease control or personal coping strategies. Adolescents and young adults are at a time in their live when disruption in their education and social life, as well as uncertainty related to professional prospects and long-term disease outcomes are all associated with significant personal concerns. The aim of this survey was to assess the main determinants of COVID-19 associated concern in adolescent and young adults with JSLE and JDM as well as their well-being and resilience. Methods Questionnaires comprising of questions related to patient and disease characteristics, wellbeing, resilience and concern about the COVID-19 pandemic were disseminated through hospital contacts and patient charities social media platforms. Participation was voluntary and implied consent. The preliminary results of this ongoing survey have been analysed using descriptive statistics and linear regression (R). Results The main patient and disease characteristics, self-reported well-being, resilience and perceived concern about the COVID-19 pandemic are presented in comparison in male vs. female patients. Linear regression showed that the strongest determinant of COVID-19 concern was self-reported disease activity (p < 0.0003). The self-reported disease activity was associated with the COVID-19 concern level in both female (P = 0.003) and male patients (p = 0.004) and also with disease duration in males (P = 0.018). The COVID concern was not affected by any other factors such as, employment, education, well-being or resilience. Conclusion The preliminary analysis of our survey showed that patient-reported COVID-19 concern during the pandemic was strongly determined by the self-reported disease activity irrespective of patients’ sex, despite significantly increased concern in the female compared to male patients, and association with disease duration in male patients only. We propose that further strategies for better patient support during the pandemic should focus on their optimal disease control as well as take into consideration the sex-biased patient concerns.

53307,6 Improving Patient Flow in a Multi-Specialty Assessment Area by Introducing Referral Pathways for Orthopaedics and Plastic Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-04,"FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Type of funding sources: None. Background/Introduction: The optimal choice of the thrombolytic drug for emergency revascularization in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) still remains to be defined. Percutaneous coronary intervention is a more safe and effective method of reperfusion compared with thrombolytic therapy, that’s why the last is relatively not common nowadays. But in the COVID-19 era in a number of cases some patients with ACS can’t be quickly hospitalized due to different reasons like the absence of the nearest available cardiovascular center, or lack of an ambulance. A long period of chest pain forces the doctors to use systemic thrombolytic therapy. PURPOSE: This study investigates the efficacy and safety of Alteplase, Prourokinase, Tenecteplase, and Streptokinase in patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: A retrospective, open, non-randomized cohort study was conducted. We have analysed 600 patients with ACS, who underwent systemic thrombolytic therapy at the prehospital and in-hospital stages from 2009 to 2011. Patients were divided into several groups according to the thrombolytic agent administered: Alteplase (254 patients), Prourokinase (309 patients), Tenecteplase (6 patients), Streptokinase (31 patients). Treatments were to be given as soon as possible. The ECG reperfusion criterion was a decrease in the ST segment by 50% or more from the initial elevation. RESULTS: Among 600 patients (mean age, 61 years (SD = 20); 119 women [19.7%]), 440 had successful reperfusion. The median time from chest pain onset to the start of treatment was 3 hours (P < 0.001). The percentages of successful thrombolysis for each agent were similar: Alteplase 74,4% Prourokinase 71,2%, Tenecteplase 83%, Streptokinase 74,2%. No statistical differences were observed in thrombolytic results among these groups (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0,2868 to 1,217; P = 0.17). At the same time, the hospital treatment with prourokinase was more effective than prehospital care with prourokinase: 110 successful reperfusions in 138 patients (79.7%) and 110 successful reperfusions in 171 patients (64.3%), respectively. Regardless of the onset of the attack (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0,2004 to 0,9913; P = 0.05). The effectiveness of the other thrombolytics cannot be compared between prehospital care and hospital treatment due to the rare use at the hospital stage in our cases. In the study, there was also no statistical difference in complication rates among the treatment groups. Among all patients, there were 9 fatal outcomes (1.5%): Alteplase 3,15% Prourokinase 1,9%, Streptokinase 3,22%. Conclusion(s): In patients with ACS, all thrombolytic drugs showed similar effectiveness. There is no difference in the safety and efficacy among the agents in our study, but there is a difference in cost and route of administration. However, upcoming prospective trials with long follow-up periods might be expected to determine the most appropriate systemic thrombolytic drug.","Vasin, A; Mironova, O; Fomin, V",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135524/,435

56365,Exploring the System Determinants Associated with Senior Women’s Access to Medical Care in Rural Bangladesh,2021-08-02,"This paper examines the multi-actor and multi-sited character of global labour migration governance as a sphere in which various organisations seek influence on the direction of global policy via various methods. We focus on the relational dynamics between the two key organisations which engage in the governance of labour migration, yet which have fundamentally different mandates and modes for governing: the ILO and the IOM. This paper contributes to the existing literature on global migration governance and the role of international organisations by applying the concept of ‘global partnerships’ to our examination of the relationship between those two key international organisations in the field of migration. We characterise the evolving ILO–IOM global partnership as an uneasy alliance along a “competition/clash-cooperation spectrum” and argue that, in order to manage the competing-cooperating dynamics, a type of strategic ILO–IOM partnership has emerged, an alliance which has also been driven by the blurring of public and private realms in new global migration governing forms and formats. The ultimate question raised by these developments is whether this global partnership will promote or obstruct the advancement of the decent work policy agenda for migrant workers.","Piper, Nicola; Foley, Laura",GPPG,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8315254/,435
56586,26189 Patient Satisfaction with Teledermatology during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021-08-07,"Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) suffer significant psychological distress, which may activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and further affect their physiological state. They often experience elevated levels of testosterone and triglycerides. Considering reports of psychological distress among women with PCOS, this study aimed to develop a psychosocial intervention to improve their emotional and physical health, particularly in Chinese society. This pilot study employed the Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit (I-BMS) intervention model for women with PCOS in China. After a 2 h health information session, 18 participants were randomly assigned to the I-BMS group (9) or the control group (9). The intervention group received 6 weekly, 3 h I-BMS sessions. Pre- and post-blood tests and psychosocial questionnaires were collected from all participants. Retention to treatment was high with 79.6% treatment adherence gained and an overall average of five sessions completed. Compared with the control group, depression and anxiety symptoms reduced significantly for those in the intervention group (d = −1.24, p < 0.05 and d = –1.33, p < 0.01), their health-related quality of life improved significantly (d = 1.02, p < 0.01) both at post-intervention and 3 month follow-up, and their testosterone and triglycerides levels reduced significantly (d = −0.97, p < 0.001 and d = –0.41, p < 0.05) after joining the intervention. The I-BMS model is feasible and appears promising in improving psychological health, and reducing testosterone and triglyceride levels, in women with PCOS in China.

56696,Patients With Lower Limb Deformity Report Worse Quality of Life Than Control Subjects Regardless of Degree of Deformity,2021-08-10,"This article analyses the governance of migration and the Covid-19 pandemic on precarious Syrian refugees in Istanbul. Drawing from a review of state policies and interviews with refugees before and after the pandemic, we argue that the intersecting governance of migration and the pandemic compounded inequalities. While refugees initially lost their employment without notice in lockdown periods, their partial lifting revealed unequal expectations towards their labour, as they were reincorporated within even more hyper-precarious labour relations. Unlike citizens who were somewhat protected by the state, refugees were under the limited care of international funders and subject to the whims of the market. Pandemic governance resulted in increased hyper-precarity and the need to rely on individual coping mechanisms for refugees. This research shows how shifting inclusion and exclusion shapes refugees' hyper-precarity related to Covid-19 governance, transforming Syrians into ‘market buffers’ to prevent or delay bankruptcies.","Nimer, Maissam; Rottmann, Susan Beth",J Refug Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344718/,435

These oligosaccharides and polysaccharides play important roles in a variety of normal physiological and pathological processes, such as cell metastasis, signal transduction, intercellular adhesion, inflammation, and immune response. However, the heterogeneity of naturally occurring glycans and glycoconjugates complicates detailed structure-activity relationship studies resulting in an incomplete understanding of their mechanisms of action and hindering further applications. Therefore, the synthesis of homogeneous, or nearly homogeneous, structurally defined glycans is of great significance for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs. One-pot synthesis represents the fastest strategy to assemble oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, although unfortunately, typically relies on random assembly. In this review, we examine the progress that has been made in the controlled one-pot synthesis of homogeneous or nearly homogeneous oligosaccharides and polysaccharides providing a broad spectrum of options to access size-controlled glycan products.","Xu, Han; Shen, Baoxing; Qiao, Meng; Linhardt, Robert J; Zhang, Xing",Carbohydrate polymers,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2021.117672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593549/,435
61971,COVID-19 in older adults: Typically atypical.,2020-12-06,"BACKGROUND The accuracy of end-expiratory lung volume measurement by the modified nitrogen wash-out/wash-in method (EELV-N(2)) depends on the precise determination of carbon dioxide elimination (V(CO(2))), which is affected by alveolar dead space (V(D-alv)). The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of V(D-alv) on EELV-N(2). METHODS Six piglets with lavage-induced acute lung injury were mechanically ventilated in a decremental PEEP trial that was reduced from 20 to 4 cm H(2)O in steps of 4 cm H(2)O every 10 min. EELV was measured by the modified EELV-N(2) method and computed tomography scan (EELV-CT), volumetric capnography, blood gas measurements, and hemodynamic data were recorded at each PEEP level. The data were divided into higher and lower PEEP groups. RESULTS During the decremental PEEP trial, EELV-N(2) exhibited a high correlation (r(2) = 0.86, P < .001) with EELV-CT, with a bias of -48.6 ± 150.7 mL (1 ± 18%). In the higher PEEP group, EELV-N(2) was not correlated with EELV-CT, with a bias of -168.1 ± 171.5 mL (-14 ± 14%). However, in the lower PEEP group, EELV-N(2) exhibited a high correlation (r(2) = 0.86, P < .001) with EELV-CT, with a bias of 11.2 ± 97.2 mL (6 ± 17%). The measurement bias was negatively correlated with V(D-alv) (r(2) = 0.44, P = .04) and V(CO(2)) (r(2) = 0.47, P = .03) in the higher PEEP group. CONCLUSIONS In this surfactant-depleted model, EELV measurement by the modified EELV-N(2) method reveals a systematic underestimation at high PEEP levels that is partly due to an increase in V(D-alv).","Tang, Rui; Huang, Yingzi; Chen, Qiuhua; Hui, Xia; Li, Yang; Yu, Qing; Zhao, Hongjie; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Haibo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22613077/,435

63110,Caring with compassion during COVID-19.,2020-07-30,"Genome Relationship Applied to Virus Taxonomy (GRAViTy) is a genetics-based tool that computes sequence relatedness between viruses. Composite generalized Jaccard (CGJ) distances combine measures of homology between encoded viral genes and similarities in genome organizational features (gene orders and orientations). This scoring framework effectively recapitulates the current, largely morphology and phenotypic-based, family-level classification of eukaryotic viruses. Eukaryotic virus families typically formed monophyletic groups with consistent CGJ distance cut-off dividing between and within family divergence ranges. In the current study, a parallel analysis of prokaryotic virus families revealed quite different sequence relationships, particularly those of tailed phage families (Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae), where members of the same family were generally far more divergent and often not detectably homologous to each other. Analysis of the 20 currently classified prokaryotic virus families indeed split them into 70 separate clusters of tailed phages genetically equivalent to family-level assignments of eukaryotic viruses. It further divided several bacterial (Sphaerolipoviridae, Tectiviridae) and archaeal (Lipothrixviridae) families. We also found that the subfamily-level groupings of tailed phages were generally more consistent with the family assignments of eukaryotic viruses, and this supports ongoing reclassifications, including Spounavirinae and Vi1virus taxa as new virus families. The current study applied a common benchmark with which to compare taxonomies of eukaryotic and prokaryotic viruses. The findings support the planned shift away from traditional morphology-based classifications of prokaryotic viruses towards a genome-based taxonomy. They demonstrate the feasibility of a unified taxonomy of viruses into which the vast body of metagenomic viral sequences may be consistently assigned.","Aiewsakun, Pakorn; Adriaenssens, Evelien M; Lavigne, Rob; Kropinski, Andrew M; Simmonds, Peter",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30016225/,435

In March 2020, more than 300,000 cases have been reported all over Iraq. This study aims to represent data analysis, modelling and forecasting approaches to the presented data in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODOLOGY The project involves mathematical models for forecasting and artificial simulations using particles. In the study, time series models including Simple Exponential Model, Holt's Method and Brown's Models have been used for the forecasting of the future potential rates in the area. A series of simulations have been conducted to observe the possibilities of virus spread rates in a virtual world which represents a quarter of Erbil. RESULTS The outcome of the study shows how the disease have spread in Kurdistan, and what are the current rates to compare with neighbour regions. The modelling clearly shows that with cases still sporadically appearing, the risk of second and third waves of infections is high. CONCLUSIONS Therefore, the regional government must reduce unnecessary gatherings to the lowest possible level. A scientific registry system of disease statistics must be put in place and rigorously updated all the times. We recommend the officials use a nationwide database provided to the public to monitor movement of every infected individual, to prevent further spread.","Abdullah, Milad; Kolo, Kamal; Aspoukeh, Peyman; Hamad, Rahel; Bailey, James R",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33839712/,435

These include narcolepsy types 1 and 2, idiopathic hypersomnia, Kleine-Levin syndrome, and hypersomnia due to or associated with medical disease, neurologic disease, psychiatric disease, medications or substances, and insufficient sleep durations. This chapter focuses on the treatment of nonnarcoleptic hypersomnia syndromes, from those that are commonly encountered in neurologic practice, such as hypersomnia due to Parkinson's disease, to those that are exceedingly rare but present with dramatic manifestations, such as Kleine-Levin syndrome. The level of evidence for the treatment of sleepiness in these disorders is generally lower than in the well-characterized syndrome of narcolepsy, but available clinical and randomized, controlled trial data can provide guidance for the management of each of these disorders. Treatments vary by diagnosis but may include modafinil/armodafinil, traditional psychostimulants, solriamfetol, pitolisant, clarithromycin, flumazenil, sodium oxybate, melatonin, methylprednisolone, and lithium.","Trotti, Lynn Marie; Arnulf, Isabelle",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13311-020-00919-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901432/,435
63835,The norepinephrine transporter in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder investigated with positron emission tomography.,2014,"Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, making antidepressant drugs the most used psychiatric drugs in the USA. Withdrawal effects and rebound symptoms frequently occur after the reduction and/or discontinuation of these drugs. Although these phenomena have been investigated with respect to the clinical symptomatology, no studies have systematically investigated the effects of withdrawal/rebound on general cognition. We present a novel framework based on the idea of allostatic adaptation, which allows to predict how different antidepressants likely impair different cognitive processes as a result of withdrawal and rebound effects. This framework relies on the assumptions that the type of cognitive impairments evoked by an antidepressant is determined by the targeted neurotransmitter systems, while the severity of deficits depends on its half-life. Our model predicts that the severity of detrimental cognitive withdrawal and rebound effects increases with a shorter half-life of the discontinued antidepressant drug. It further proposes drug-specific effects: antidepressants mainly targeting serotonin should primarily impair aversive and emotional processing, those targeting norepinephrine should impair the processing of alerting signals, those targeting dopamine should impair motivational processes and reward processing, and those targeting acetylcholine should impair spatial learning and memory. We hope that this framework will motivate further research to better understand and explain cognitive changes as a consequence of antidepressant discontinuation.","Colzato, Lorenza; Zhang, Wenxin; Walter, Henrik; Beste, Christian; Stock, Ann-Kathrin",Pharmacopsychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1520-4784; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293810/,435

66504,Mental Disorder and Suicide: What's the Connection?,2021-08-09,"Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) often lack insight into the nature of their perceived appearance flaws that are slight, if they exist at all. Despite the generally held assumption that insight fluctuates over time within individuals with BDD, its temporal instability and associated features remain unstudied. We examined insight as a multidimensional, contextually embedded, and dynamic factor using ecological momentary assessment (EMA), further assessing affect and self-esteem as potentially associated states. Thirty individuals with BDD and 30 mentally healthy controls (HCs) completed 6 days of EMA (M = 8.54 assessments per day, N = 3075 assessments in total). Multilevel analyses revealed substantial intraindividual fluctuations of insight dimensions (across 30 min to hours) that were more pronounced for individuals with BDD than for HCs. Poorer insight correlated with higher negative affect, lower positive affect, and lower self-esteem at concurrent time points in the BDD group. Considering all predictors at the same time point, poorer insight was characterized by lower self-esteem and, partly, negative affect in the BDD group. Across time, self-esteem and insight influenced each other reciprocally, with comparatively stronger effects for the prediction of poorer insight by previously lower self-esteem. These findings demonstrate that insight is a highly variable phenomenon in BDD, further suggesting a clinically and etiologically relevant link between self-esteem and insight in symptom maintenance.

However, considering the possible desorption of the target oxyanion during change of the surrounding environment, the detailed removal mechanisms remain unclear and the long-term efficiency of different INPs cannot be predicted. In this study, different BC/Fe composites were synthesized by controlling the pyrolysis temperatures (500-800 °C). BC/Fe3O4 composite synthesized at 500 °C (BC/Fe500) possessed the strongest surface acidity thus with the best SeO42- removal performance, and BC/Fe0/Fe3O4 composite synthesized at 650 °C (BC/Fe650) possessed the best reducing ability toward SeO42-. Through the co-removal experiments (SeO42- and common competing oxyanions co-existed) and the investigation of Se stability loaded on BC/Fe composites, the removal of SeO42- by BC/Fe500 through highly reversible adsorption could not achieve long-term immobilization of Se, making it an appropriate adsorbent for pre-treatment only, while the efficient reduction of SeO42- to Se0 by BC/Fe650 could largely improve its long-term stability.

68346,A multifactorial intervention to lower potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults in Argentina.,2020-05-09,"BACKGROUND Antibiotic therapy has been proposed as an alternative to surgery for the treatment of appendicitis. METHODS We conducted a pragmatic, nonblinded, noninferiority, randomized trial comparing antibiotic therapy (10-day course) with appendectomy in patients with appendicitis at 25 U.S. centers. The primary outcome was 30-day health status, as assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire (scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better health status; noninferiority margin, 0.05 points). Secondary outcomes included appendectomy in the antibiotics group and complications through 90 days; analyses were prespecified in subgroups defined according to the presence or absence of an appendicolith. RESULTS In total, 1552 adults (414 with an appendicolith) underwent randomization; 776 were assigned to receive antibiotics (47% of whom were not hospitalized for the index treatment) and 776 to undergo appendectomy (96% of whom underwent a laparoscopic procedure). Antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of 30-day EQ-5D scores (mean difference, 0.01 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.001 to 0.03). In the antibiotics group, 29% had undergone appendectomy by 90 days, including 41% of those with an appendicolith and 25% of those without an appendicolith. Complications were more common in the antibiotics group than in the appendectomy group (8.1 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.30 to 3.98); the higher rate in the antibiotics group could be attributed to those with an appendicolith (20.2 vs. 3.6 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 5.69; 95% CI, 2.11 to 15.38) and not to those without an appendicolith (3.7 vs. 3.5 per 100 participants; rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.43). The rate of serious adverse events was 4.0 per 100 participants in the antibiotics group and 3.0 per 100 participants in the appendectomy group (rate ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.67 to 2.50). CONCLUSIONS For the treatment of appendicitis, antibiotics were noninferior to appendectomy on the basis of results of a standard health-status measure. In the antibiotics group, nearly 3 in 10 participants had undergone appendectomy by 90 days.

70588,Managing COVID-19 related psychological distress in health workers: field experience in northern Italy.,2020-10-20,"Estimating the size and infection severity of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is made challenging by inconsistencies in available data. The number of COVID-19 deaths is often used as a key indicator for the epidemic size, but observed deaths represent only a minority of all infections1,2. Additionally, the heterogeneous burden in nursing homes and variable reporting of deaths in elderly individuals can hamper direct comparisons across countries of the underlying level of transmission and mortality rates3. Here we use age-specific COVID-19 death data from 45 countries and the results of 22 seroprevalence studies to investigate the consistency of infection and fatality patterns across multiple countries. We find that the age distribution of deaths in younger age groups (<65 years) is very consistent across different settings and demonstrate how this data can provide robust estimates of the share of the population that has been infected. We estimate that the infection-to-fatality ratio (IFR) is lowest among 5-9 years old, with a log-linear increase by age among individuals older than 30 years. Population age-structures and heterogeneous burdens in nursing homes explain some but not all of the heterogeneity between countries in infection-fatality ratios. Among the 45 countries included in our analysis, we estimate approximately 5% of these populations had been infected by the 1st of September 2020, with much higher transmission likely to have occurred in a number of Latin American countries. This simple modelling framework can help countries assess the progression of the pandemic and can be applied wherever reliable age-specific death data exists.","O'Driscoll, Megan; Dos Santos, Gabriel Ribeiro; Wang, Lin; Cummings, Derek A T; Azman, Andrew S; Paireau, Juliette; Fontanet, Arnaud; Cauchemez, Simon; Salje, Henrik",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2918-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137809/,435
70657,Paediatric ED utilisation in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-12-03,"INTRODUCTION Patients diagnosed with penile cancer and clinically impalpable inguinal lymph nodes (cN0), normally undergo dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSNB) at the same time as the primary penile surgery. The aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and clinical outcomes of performing DSNB in patients who have already undergone surgery for the primary penile cancer. METHODS Ninety-two patients with unilateral or bilateral impalpable inguinal lymph nodes (LNs) who had already undergone primary resection of the penile tumour (stage ≥ T1G2) were included in this study. All patients underwent a preoperative USS of the groin(s) with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Provided that the FNAC was clear, DSNB was performed. Radical inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed if the histological analysis of the SLN confirmed the presence of micrometastatic disease. RESULTS DSNB was undertaken in 165 groins with a nonvisualisation rate of 4.8 % (8/165 groins). The SLN was positive for micrometastatic disease in nine groins (5.5 %) from a total of eight patients (8.7 %). One patient developed regional recurrence in a prepubic LN after excision of bilateral negative SLN (1.1 %). The three-year disease-specific survival for patients with negative and positive SLN was 98.8 and 87.5 %, respectively (p = 0.042). Using DSNB, occult LN metastases in penile cancer can be detected with a sensitivity of 88.9 % and specificity of 100 %. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated that DSNB is feasible as a delayed procedure to localise the SLN. Surgical resection of the primary penile lesion does not appear to change the lymphatic drainage.","Omorphos, Savvas; Saad, Zia; Arya, Manit; Freeman, Alex; Malone, Peter; Nigam, Raj; Bomanji, Jamshed; Muneer, Asif",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-015-1577-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26060137/,435

Methotrexate has a narrow treatment index and is associated with numerous side effects.In thisresearch, for the first time a double-solvent supramolecular system (DSS) was developed as an extractant without disperser solvent for dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME). DSS - DLLME was applied to the extraction of methotrexate in plasma of children with acute leukemiaprior to itsdetermination by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC - UV). In the present method, two long normal chain alcohols are mixed in a particular ratio, and then it is injected into the sample solution, which is on the magnetic stirrer. In this case, the mixture of the two alcohol changes to new supramolecular aggregate. This new supermolecule is used as an extractant, which has a higher extraction power than any of its components alone. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration graph was linear in the rage of 0.1-150 µg L-1 with detection limit of 0.03 µg L-1. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) including intra-day and inter-day of method based on7 replicate determinations of 100.0 µg L-1of methotrexate were 2.6% and 4.8%,respectively. The results proved that DSS - DLLME is a sensitive, very simple, inexpensive, environmental friendly, rapid and efficient method for the preconcentration of trace amount of drugs in biological samples.","Akramipour, Reza; Fattahi, Nazir; Golpayegani, Mohammad Reza","Journal of chromatography.

This extreme behaviour counters the conventional wisdom that reptilian muscle is incapable of powering high-endurance behaviours. We conducted in situ experiments in which the jaw-adductor muscles of lizards were stimulated directly while bite force was measured simultaneously. Fatigue tests were performed by stimulating the muscles with a series of tetanic trains. Our results show that a substantial sustained force gradually develops during the fatigue test. This sustained force persists after peak tetanic forces have declined to a fraction of their initial magnitude. The observed sustained force during in situ fatigue tests is consistent with the courtship behaviour of these lizards and probably reflects physiological specialization. The results of molecular analysis reveal that the jaw muscles contain masticatory and tonic myosin fibres. We propose that the presence of tonic fibres may explain the unusual sustained force properties during mate-holding behaviour. The characterization of muscle properties that facilitate extreme performance during specialized behaviours may reveal general mechanisms of muscle function, especially when done in light of convergently evolved systems exhibiting similar performance characteristics.","Nguyen, Allyn; Balaban, Jordan P; Azizi, Emanuel; Talmadge, Robert J; Lappin, A Kristopher",Proceedings.

We aimed to study the accuracy of real-time tracheal ultrasound (US) to confirm ETT placement in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. METHODS This work was a prospective study completed at 2 academic tertiary care centers. Patients in the adult ICU requiring emergent intubation were enrolled in the trial. During the intubation process, a US team performed a tracheal US examination to determine, in real time, whether the ETT was placed into the trachea or the esophagus. RESULTS A total of 75 patients were enrolled in the study and were available for analysis. There were 12 (16%) esophageal intubations and 63 (84%) tracheal intubations. One hundred percent of the tracheal intubations and 83% of the esophageal intubations were correctly identified. The positive and negative predictive values of US to detect an esophageal intubation were 100% and 97%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Tracheal US can be highly accurate in identifying the location of the ETT, in real time, in ICU patients undergoing emergent intubation. Although our study shows a great potential of real-time US use during emergent intubations, larger studies would be needed to further evaluate the accuracy of this technique.","Arya, Rohan; Schrift, David; Choe, Carol; Al-Jaghbeer, Mohammed",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jum.14723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30058190/,435

73715,[Problems of mental health in the situation of COVID-19 pandemic].,2020,"Since the first description of adenoviruses in bats in 2006, a number of micro- and megabat species in Europe, Africa, and Asia have been shown to carry a wide diversity of adenoviruses. Here, we report on the evolutionary, biological, and structural characterization of a novel bat adenovirus (BtAdV) recovered from a Rafinesque's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) in Kentucky, USA, which is the first adenovirus isolated from North American bats. This virus (BtAdV 250-A) exhibits a close phylogenetic relationship with Canine mastadenovirus A (CAdV A), as previously observed with other BtAdVs. To further investigate the relationships between BtAdVs and CAdVs, we conducted mass spectrometric analysis and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of the BtAdV 250-A capsid and also analyzed the in vitro host ranges of both viruses. Our results demonstrate that BtAdV 250-A represents a new mastadenovirus species that, in contrast to CAdV, has a unique capsid morphology that contains more prominent extensions of protein IX and can replicate efficiently in a phylogenetically diverse range of species. These findings, in addition to the recognition that both the genetic diversity of BtAdVs and the number of different bat species from disparate geographic regions infected with BtAdVs appears to be extensive, tentatively suggest that bats may have served as a potential reservoir for the cross-species transfer of adenoviruses to other hosts, as theorized for CAdV. IMPORTANCE Although many adenoviruses are host specific and likely codiverged with their hosts over millions of years, other adenoviruses appear to have emerged through successful cross-species transmission events on more recent time scales. The wide geographic distribution and genetic diversity of adenoviruses in bats and their close phylogenetic relationship to Canine mastadenovirus A (CAdV A) has raised important questions about how CAdV A, and possibly other mammalian adenoviruses, may have emerged. Although most adenoviruses tend to cause limited disease in their natural hosts, CAdV A is unusual in that it may cause high morbidity and sometimes fatal infections in immunocompetent hosts and is thus an important pathogen of carnivores. Here, we performed a comparative evolutionary and structural study of representative bat and canine adenoviruses to better understand the relationship between these two viral groups.","Hackenbrack, Nicole; Rogers, Matthew B; Ashley, Robert E; Keel, M Kevin; Kubiski, Steven V; Bryan, John A; Ghedin, Elodie; Holmes, Edward C; Hafenstein, Susan L; Allison, Andrew B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01504-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807242/,435

These methods have also been used to predict gene mutations from pathology images, but no comprehensive evaluation of their potential for extracting molecular features from histology slides has yet been performed. We show that HE2RNA, a model based on the integration of multiple data modes, can be trained to systematically predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images alone, without expert annotation. Through its interpretable design, HE2RNA provides virtual spatialization of gene expression, as validated by CD3- and CD20-staining on an independent dataset. The transcriptomic representation learned by HE2RNA can also be transferred on other datasets, even of small size, to increase prediction performance for specific molecular phenotypes.

Furthermore, novel findings indicate that specifically visceral obesity and characteristics of impaired metabolic health such as hyperglycaemia, hypertension and subclinical inflammation are associated with a high risk of severe COVID-19. In this Review, we highlight how obesity and impaired metabolic health increase complications and mortality in COVID-19. We also summarize the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection for organ function and risk of NCDs. In addition, we discuss data indicating that the COVID-19 pandemic could have serious consequences for the obesity epidemic.

In early fetuses (7-8 weeks), the IO was restricted at an antero-infero-medial angle of the future orbit. In contrast to extraocular recti, the IO appeared to extend along the mediolateral axis and had no definite tendon. At midterm, the IO tendon became evident. Sometimes, the IO muscle belly attached to the inferior rectus or, the IO tendon divided into two laminae to enclose the lateral rectus. At late-term, a multilayered sheath was evident around the sclera and, via one or some of the fascial layers, the IO was communicated with a fascia enclosing the inferior rectus. At midterm and late-term, the IO originated not only from the maxilla near the orbicularis oculi origin but also from a vein-rich fibrous tissue around the lacrimal sac. Both origins were muscular without intermittent tendon or ligament. Therefore, the fascial connection as well as a direct contact between the IO and the inferior or lateral rectus seemed to provide variant muscular bridges as reported in adults. Moreover, the two attachment sites at the origin seemed to provide double muscle bellies of the adult IO. Consequently, the present specimens contained seeds of any types of adult variations. The muscle fibers from the lacrimal sac might play a role for the lacrimal drainage.","Jin, Z W; Umeki, S; Takeuchi, Y; Yamamoto, M; Murakami, G; Abe, S; Rodríguez-Vázquez, J F",Folia morphologica,https://doi.org/10.5603/fm.a2021.0043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954958/,435

The present review examined the prevalence of complex pharmacotherapy regimens in bipolar disorder patients and sought to characterize factors that most influence polypharmacy prescribing patterns. Data Sources: The authors independently systematically searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase databases for English-language observational/naturalistic or randomized controlled polypharmacy trials, using the keywords bipolar and polypharmacy or bipolar and combination treatment and pharmacotherapy. Study Selection: From among 3,566 publications, 49 ultimately met study inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Information was obtained regarding prevalence rates of extensive polypharmacy as well as clinical characteristics and naturalistic outcomes for patients with simple (≤ 2) or complex (≥ 3) regimens of psychotropic agents. Results: A weighted mean percentage of 32.7% of bipolar outpatients (4,535/13,863) taking ≥ 3 psychotropic medications was identified. Factors associated with complex polypharmacy use include female sex, White race, age > 50 years, history of psychosis, greater burden of depressive illness, subtherapeutic dosing, lower treatment adherence, more extensive psychiatric comorbidity, and a greater history of suicide attempts. Conclusions: Extensive or complex combination pharmacotherapy regimens are common in many patients with bipolar disorder and often reflect greater overall illness severity. Naturalistic studies do not point to better outcomes for patients receiving more complex drug regimens, suggesting likely confounding by indication, high severity, or comorbid conditions. Formal clinical trials are needed to identify optimal drug combinations and durations when using ≥ 3 psychotropic medications to treat patients with bipolar disorder.","Kim, Anna M; Salstein, Lisa; Goldberg, Joseph F",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.20r13263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077034/,435

This paper aims to evaluate sound level exposure in a densely populated environmental justice city in close proximity to major roadways, a nearby airport and high levels of industrial activity. In this study we collected various sound level metrics to evaluate the loudness and frequency composition of the acoustical environment in Chelsea, Massachusetts, USA. A total of 29 week-long sites were collected from October 2019 to June 2020, a time period that also included the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically altered activity patterns and corresponding sound level exposures. We found that Chelsea is exposed to high levels of sound, both day and night (65 dB (A), and 80 dB and 90 dB for low frequency, and infrasound sound levels). A spectral analysis shows that 63 Hz was the dominant frequency. Distance to major roads and flight activity (both arrivals and departures) were most strongly correlated with all metrics, most notably with metrics describing contributing from lower frequencies. Overall, we found similar patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic but at levels up to 10 decibels lower. Our results demonstrate the importance of noise exposure assessments in environmental justice communities and the importance of using additional metrics to describe communities inundated with significant air, road, and industrial sound levels. It also provides a snapshot of how much quieter communities can be with careful and intentional urban and environmental policy and planning.","Walker, Erica D; Lee, Nina F; Scammell, Madeleine K; Feuer, Arielle P; Power, Maria B; Lane, Kevin J; Adamkiewicz, Gary; Levy, Jonathan I",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048746/,435

This information may be used to guide resuscitation efforts and may carry relevant early prognostic information. METHODS We prospectively investigated non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients on scene. NIRS was started either during CPR or shortly after (<2 min) return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) by emergency medical service (EMS). Outcome was determined at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and 6 months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS A total of 29 OHCA patients were included. In 23 patients NIRS was started during CPR and in 6 patients immediately after ROSC. 18 (62.1%) patients did not reach ROSC. Initial rSO2 during CPR was very low (<50% in all 23 patients, < 30% in 19 of 23 patients) with no significant difference between patients achieving ROSC and those who did not. Of five patients with ROSC, in whom NIRS was recorded during CPR, two reached a good six-months outcome (initial rSO2 22%) and three died during the ICU stay (initial rSO2 15, 16 and 46%). In six patients with NIRS started immediately after ROSC (<2 min), rSO2 was substantially higher (54-85 %) than in patients during CPR (p = 0.006). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Initial frontal brain rSO2 determined by NIRS during CPR was generally very low and recovered rapidly after ROSC. Very low initial rSO2 during CPR was compatible with good neurological outcome in our limited cohort of patients. Further studies are needed to assess in larger cohorts and more detail the implications of very low initial rSO2 during CPR on scene.","Storm, Christian; Wutzler, Alexander; Trenkmann, Lars; Krannich, Alexander; von Rheinbarben, Sabrina; Luckenbach, Fridolin; Nee, Jens; Otto, Natalie; Schroeder, Tim; Leithner, Christoph","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13049-016-0234-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27048406/,435

Resident memory T (TRM) cells are parked within single organs, share properties with terminal effectors and contribute to rapid host protection. We observed that reactivated TRM cells rejoined the circulating pool. Epigenetic analyses revealed that TRM cells align closely with conventional memory T cell populations, bearing little resemblance to recently activated effectors. Fully differentiated TRM cells isolated from small intestine epithelium exhibited the potential to differentiate into TCM cells, effector memory T cells and TRM cells on recall. Ex-TRM cells, former intestinal TRM cells that rejoined the circulating pool, heritably maintained a predilection for homing back to their tissue of origin on subsequent reactivation and a heightened capacity to redifferentiate into TRM cells. Thus, TRM cells can rejoin the circulation but are advantaged to re-form local TRM when called on.","Fonseca, Raissa; Beura, Lalit K; Quarnstrom, Clare F; Ghoneim, Hazem E; Fan, Yiping; Zebley, Caitlin C; Scott, Milcah C; Fares-Frederickson, Nancy J; Wijeyesinghe, Sathi; Thompson, Emily A; Borges da Silva, Henrique; Vezys, Vaiva; Youngblood, Benjamin; Masopust, David",Nature immunology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-020-0607-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32066954/,435

The epidemiology and management of childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) have changed over time, prompting the need to reassess expected outcomes. The purpose of this study is to use the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) prospective registry to validate historical principles of LN in a contemporary, real-world cohort. After an extensive literature review, six principles of LN in cSLE were identified. The CARRA registry was queried to evaluate these principles in determining the rate of LN in cSLE, median time from cSLE diagnosis to LN, short-term renal outcomes, and frequency of rituximab as an induction therapy. Of the 677 cSLE patients in the CARRA registry, 32% had documented LN. Decline in kidney function was more common in Black cSLE patients than non-Black patients (p = 0.04). Black race was associated with worse short-term renal outcomes. In short-term follow up, most children with LN had unchanged or improved kidney function, and end stage kidney disease (ESKD) was rare. Ongoing follow-up of cSLE patients in the CARRA registry will be necessary to evaluate long-term outcomes to inform risk, management, and prognosis of LN in cSLE.","Vazzana, Kathleen M; Daga, Ankana; Goilav, Beatrice; Ogbu, Ekemini A; Okamura, Daryl M; Park, Catherine; Sadun, Rebecca E; Smitherman, Emily A; Stotter, Brian R; Dasgupta, Abhijit; Knight, Andrea M; Hersh, Aimee O; Wenderfer, Scott E; Lewandowski, Laura B",Lupus,https://doi.org/10.1177/09612033211028658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219529/,435

METHOD Cross-sectional, descriptive-analytical study conducted with adults living in the state of Paraíba through an online instrument from April to May 2020, through the Face Mask Use Scale of Faculdades Metropolitanas Unidas da Paraíba. RESULTS The participants amounted to 1,307 (100.0%) individuals, who were predominantly female (78.0%), aged 35 to 45 (32.3%), married (53.3%) and post-graduates (46.9%). The mean score for the practice of using masks was 18.7 (SD = 8.0; minimum 6.00; maximum 30). The use of masks for self-protection scored 9.8 (DP = 3.9; minimum 3.0; maximum 15.0), whereas the score for protection of others was 8.9 (SD = 4.5; minimum 3.0; maximum 15.0). In the comparison between the scores of the practice of using masks, there was a significant statistical difference for gender, education, age group, and income (p ≤ 0.01). The practice of using masks was more frequent in health environments, 7.3 (DP = 3.2). CONCLUSION The practice of using masks was predominant among women, people over 35, married, with an income higher than seven minimum wages, and post-graduation. The use of masks for self-protection was higher than for the protection of others and its use in health environments was higher than in the others.","Pereira-Ávila, Fernanda Maria Vieira; Lam, Simon Ching; Gir, Elucir; Góes, Fernanda Garcia Bezerra; Freire, Maria Eliane Moreira; Silva, Ana Cristina de Oliveira E",Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da U S P,https://doi.org/10.1590/s1980-220x2020029403735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105686/,435
80468,Occlusion and face masks: issues with sunscreen use among healthcare workers during COVID-19.,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with subsequent recurrent wheeze. Observational studies cannot determine whether RSV infection is the cause of recurrent wheeze or the first indication of preexistent pulmonary vulnerability in preterm infants. The monoclonal antibody palivizumab has shown efficacy in preventing severe RSV infection in high-risk infants. METHODS In the double-blind, placebo-controlled MAKI trial, we randomly assigned 429 otherwise healthy preterm infants born at a gestational age of 33 to 35 weeks to receive either monthly palivizumab injections (214 infants) or placebo (215 infants) during the RSV season. The prespecified primary outcome was the total number of parent-reported wheezing days in the first year of life. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken during respiratory episodes for viral analysis. RESULTS Palivizumab treatment resulted in a relative reduction of 61% (95% confidence interval, 56 to 65) in the total number of wheezing days during the first year of life (930 of 53,075 days in the RSV-prevention group [1.8%] vs. 2309 of 51,726 days [4.5%] in the placebo group). During this time, the proportion of infants with recurrent wheeze was 10 percentage points lower in patients treated with palivizumab (11% vs. 21%, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS In otherwise healthy preterm infants, palivizumab treatment resulted in a significant reduction in wheezing days during the first year of life, even after the end of treatment. These findings implicate RSV infection as an important mechanism of recurrent wheeze during the first year of life in such infants.

Clinician Perspectives on Implementation of Crisis Standards of Care.",2020-05-05,"PURPOSE We aimed to assess whether insulating covers and warming systems cause artifacts in fluoroscopy, and whether they alter the radiation dose. METHODS Eight insulating and warming systems were wrapped around the phantom in order to obtain images in fluoroscopy, and to measure the absorbed and scattered radiation dose. A dosimeter, endovascular catheters, and stents were placed into a phantom. The other dosimeter was placed outside of a C-arm table, at the operator's and anesthesiologist's locations. RESULTS Most of the insulating covers did not cause artifacts in the fluoroscopy and led to a significant decrease in both the absorbed and scattered radiation dose. The highest decrease in the absorbed dose was observed with metalized foil (- 2.09%; p = 0.001) and in the scattered dose with Helios cover (- 55%; p < 0.001). Only one heating system (Ready Heat combined with Hypothermia Prevention and Management Kit cover) caused significant artifacts and increased radiation up to 99% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Thermal insulation may be maintained during X-ray-guided emergency endovascular procedures in trauma victims. Self-heating blankets should be replaced with another warming system.","Podsiadło, Paweł; Liszka, Grzegorz; Popiela, Tadeusz; Sanak, Tomasz; Kosiński, Sylweriusz; Darocha, Tomasz",Emergency radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-020-01798-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32474733/,435

To this end, it is important to stress the way in which difficult situations and vulnerability faced by professionals can have an impact on their performance of work. This article pursue two objectives. First, I focus on understanding and making visible shared vulnerability that arises in clinical settings from a triple perspective: patient and family, health professionals, and institutions. Second, to address this challenge for professionalism, in this paper I articulate the term ""relational centered-patient professionalism"", which has two main axes. The relational approach means taking into account how the relationships among professionals, patients and institutions determine the constitution and evolution of those professional values. The focus on patient centered care is indispensable, because it is the ultimate goal pursued by the development of these professional values, and must always be at the center.","Delgado, Janet","Medicine, health care, and philosophy",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11019-020-09995-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423192/,435

As of June 2020, there is no FDA approved antiviral therapy to eradicate this dreadful virus. In this study, drug re-purposing and computational approaches were employed to identify high affinity inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (3CLpro), Papain-like protease (PLpro) and the receptor domain of Spike protein. Molecular docking on 40 derivatives of standard drugs (Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Theophylline) led to the identification of R10, R2 and L9 as potential inhibitors of 3CLpro, PLpro and Spike protein, respectively. The binding affinity of R10, R2 and L9 towards 3CLpro, PLpro and Spike protein were 4.03 × 106, 3.72 × 104 and 1.31 × 104 M -1, respectively. These inhibitors interact with the active site or catalytic amino acid residues of 3CLpro, PLpro and Spike protein. We also examined the stability and dynamic behavior of protein-inhibitor complex by employing molecular dynamics simulation. RMSDs, RMSFs and variation in secondary structure of target proteins alone or in complex with their respective inhibitors were used to ascertain the integrity of proteins' structure during simulation. Moreover, physicochemical and ADMET properties of R10, R2 and L9 along with Remdesivir, Lopinavir and Theophylline were determined. In vitro and In vivo studies are needed to further validate the potential of these derivatives before they can be developed into potential drug molecules. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

84086,Enhance care continuity post COVID-19.,2021-04-01,"The dynamic signal encoding paradigm suggests that information flows from the extracellular environment into specific signaling patterns (encoding) that are then read by downstream effectors to control cellular behavior. Previous work empirically quantified the information content of dynamic signaling patterns. However, whether this information can be faithfully transmitted to the gene expression level is unclear. Here we used NFkB signaling as a model to understand the accuracy of information transmission from signaling dynamics into gene expression. Using a detailed mathematical model, we simulated realistic NFkB signaling patterns with different degrees of variability. The NFkB patterns were used as an input to a simple gene expression model. Analysis of information transmission between ligand and NFkB and ligand and gene expression allows us to determine information loss in transmission between receptors to dynamic signaling patterns and between signaling dynamics to gene expression. Information loss could occur due to biochemical noise or due to a lack of specificity. We found that noise-free gene expression has very little information loss suggesting that gene expression can preserve specificity in NFkB patterns. As expected, the addition of noise to the gene expression model results in information loss. Interestingly, this effect can be mitigated by a specific choice of parameters that can substantially reduce information loss due to biochemical noise during gene expression. Overall our results show that the cellular capacity for information transmission from dynamic signaling patterns to gene expression can be high enough to preserve ligand specificity and thereby the accuracy of cellular response to environmental cues.","Maity, Alok; Wollman, Roy",PLoS computational biology,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797040/,435

Monitoring of MM and/or muscle metabolism in HD patients is of paramount importance for timely detection of muscle loss and to intervene adequately. In this study we assessed the reliability and reproducibility of a simplified creatinine index (SCI) as a surrogate marker of MM and explored its predictive value on outcome. METHOD We included all in-centre HD patients from 16 European countries with at least one SCI. The baseline period was defined as 30 days before and after the first multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy measurement; the subsequent 7 years constituted the follow-up. SCI was calculated by the Canaud equation. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were applied to assess the association of SCI with all-cause mortality. Using backward analysis, we explored the trends of SCI before death. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to analyse the agreement between estimated and measured MM. RESULTS We included 23 495 HD patients; 3662 were incident. Females and older patients have lower baseline SCI. Higher SCI was associated with a lower risk of mortality [hazard ratio 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.79-0.82)]. SCI decline accelerated ∼5-7 months before death. Lean tissue index (LTI) estimated by SCI was correlated with measured LTI in both sexes (males: R2 = 0.94; females: R2 = 0.92; both P < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed that measured LTI was 4.71 kg/m2 (±2 SD: -12.54-3.12) lower than estimated LTI. CONCLUSION SCI is a simple, easily obtainable and clinically relevant surrogate marker of MM in HD patients.","Canaud, Bernard; Ye, Xiaoling; Usvyat, Len; Kooman, Jeroen; van der Sande, Frank; Raimann, Jochen; Wang, Yuedong; Kotanko, Peter","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfaa098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830264/,435

These differences start in the retina and continue all the way to the visual cortex. Despite these differences in processing, the perceptual experience of humans is remarkably stable and continuous across the visual field. Research in the last decade has shown that processing in peripheral and foveal vision is not independent, but is more directly connected than previously thought. We address three core questions on how peripheral and foveal vision interact, and review recent findings on potentially related phenomena that could provide answers to these questions. First, how is the processing of peripheral and foveal signals related during fixation? Peripheral signals seem to be processed in foveal retinotopic areas to facilitate peripheral object recognition, and foveal information seems to be extrapolated toward the periphery to generate a homogeneous representation of the environment. Second, how are peripheral and foveal signals re-calibrated? Transsaccadic changes in object features lead to a reduction in the discrepancy between peripheral and foveal appearance. Third, how is peripheral and foveal information stitched together across saccades? Peripheral and foveal signals are integrated across saccadic eye movements to average percepts and to reduce uncertainty. Together, these findings illustrate that peripheral and foveal processing are closely connected, mastering the compromise between a large peripheral visual field and high resolution at the fovea.","Stewart, Emma E M; Valsecchi, Matteo; Schütz, Alexander C",Journal of vision,https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.20.12.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141171/,435

However, there is minimal evidence from these services underpinning this. It is also unknown how many service users subsequently 'detransition'. AIMS To describe service users' access to care and patterns of service use, specifically, interventions accessed, reasons for discharge and re-referrals; to identify factors associated with access; and to quantify 'detransitioning'. METHOD A retrospective case-note review was performed as a service evaluation for 175 service users consecutively discharged by a tertiary National Health Service adult GIC between 1 September 2017 and 31 August 2018. Descriptive statistics were used for rates of accessing interventions sought, reasons for discharge, re-referral and frequency of detransitioning. Using multivariate analysis, we sought associations between several variables and 'accessing care' or 'other outcome'. RESULTS The treatment pathway was completed by 56.1%. All interventions initially sought were accessed by 58%; 94% accessed hormones but only 47.7% accessed gender reassignment surgery; 21.7% disengaged; and 19.4% were re-referred. Multivariate analysis identified coexisting neurodevelopmental disorders (odds ratio [OR] = 5.7, 95% CI = 1.7-19), previous adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) per reported ACE (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-1.9), substance misuse during treatment (OR = 4.3, 95% CI = 1.1-17.6) and mental health concerns during treatment (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.4) as independently associated with accessing care. Twelve people (6.9%) met our case definition of detransitioning. CONCLUSIONS Service users may have unmet needs.

As these compounds were designed to provide PET ligands with high metabolic stability, they are now radiolabeled with fluorine-18 and investigated in vivo. METHODS BFR precursors were synthesized and reacted with fluorine-18 in dry MeCN in the presence of 2,2,2-kryptofix and K(2)CO(3). In rats, biodistribution and PET studies were performed using [(18)F]5a, [(18)F]5b and [(18)F]5c. The binding specificity was determined by administration of non-labeled WAY-100635 prior to the radiolabeled ligands. RESULTS [(18)F]5 ligands were synthesized in overall radiochemical yields of 24%-45%, respectively with a radiochemical purity of >98%. Relatively good hippocampus to cerebellum ratios of 5.55, 4.79 and 5.45, respectively were reached at 45 min pi. However, PET studies indicated defluorination of the radioligands by showing high accumulation of radioactivity in the bones in the order of [(18)F]5a≈[(18)F]5b>[(18)F]5c. CONCLUSION Also in vivo, the radioligands bind preferentially to the 5-HT(1A) receptor. Unfortunately, no metabolic stability with regard to defluorination was observed in rats.","Al Hussainy, Rana; Verbeek, Joost; van der Born, Dion; Molthoff, Carla; Booij, Jan; Herscheid, J Koos D M",Nuclear medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2012.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22609028/,435

Understand the evidence regarding the timing of expander/implant breast reconstruction in the setting of radiation therapy. 2. Discuss the implications of a patient's risk factors for possible outcomes and complications of expander/implant breast reconstruction. 3. Implement proper prophylactic antibiotic protocols. 4. Use the guidelines to improve their own clinical outcomes and reduce complications. SUMMARY In March of 2013, the Executive Committee of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons approved an evidence-based guideline on breast reconstruction with expanders and implants, as developed by a guideline-specific work group commissioned by the society's Health Policy Committee. The guideline addresses ten clinical questions: patient education, immediate versus delayed reconstruction, risk factors, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, antibiotic prophylaxis, acellular dermal matrix, monitoring for cancer recurrence, and oncologic outcomes associated with implant-based reconstruction. The evidence indicates that patients undergoing mastectomy should be offered a preoperative referral to a plastic surgeon. Evidence varies regarding the association between postoperative complications and timing of postmastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction. Evidence is limited regarding the optimal timing of expand/implant reconstruction in the setting of radiation therapy but suggests that irradiation to the expander or implant is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications. Evidence also varies regarding the association between acellular dermal matrix and surgical complications in the setting of postmastectomy expander/implant reconstruction. Data support the use of an appropriate preoperative antibiotic, but antibiotics should be discontinued within 24 hours of the procedure, unless a surgical drain is present. Furthermore, postmastectomy expander/implant breast reconstruction does not adversely affect oncologic outcomes.","Alderman, Amy; Gutowski, Karol; Ahuja, Amy; Gray, Diedra",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000000541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25357060/,435
90973,Medication Management Frameworks in the Context of Self-Management: A Scoping Review.,2021,"Sporadic Colorectal Cancer (sCRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death in the Western world, and the sCRC patients presenting with synchronic metastasis have the poorest prognosis. Genetic alterations accumulated in sCRC tumor cells translate into mutated proteins and/or abnormal protein expression levels, which contribute to the development of sCRC. Then, the tumor-associated proteins (TAAs) might induce the production of auto-antibodies (aAb) via humoral immune response. Here, Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Arrays (NAPPArray) are employed to identify aAb in plasma samples from a set of 50 sCRC patients compared to seven healthy donors. Our goal was to establish a systematic workflow based on NAPPArray to define differential aAb profiles between healthy individuals and sCRC patients as well as between non-metastatic (n = 38) and metastatic (n = 12) sCRC, in order to gain insight into the role of the humoral immune system in controlling the development and progression of sCRC. Our results showed aAb profile based on 141 TAA including TAAs associated with biological cellular processes altered in genesis and progress of sCRC (e.g., FSCN1, VTI2 and RPS28) that discriminated healthy donors vs. sCRC patients. In addition, the potential capacity of discrimination (between non-metastatic vs. metastatic sCRC) of 7 TAAs (USP5, ML4, MARCKSL1, CKMT1B, HMOX2, VTI2, TP53) have been analyzed individually in an independent cohort of sCRC patients, where two of them (VTI2 and TP53) were validated (AUC ~75%). In turn, these findings provided novel insights into the immunome of sCRC, in combination with transcriptomics profiles and protein antigenicity characterizations, wich might lead to the identification of novel sCRC biomarkers that might be of clinical utility for early diagnosis of the tumor. These results explore the immunomic analysis as potent source for biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic value in CRC. Additional prospective studies in larger series of patients are required to confirm the clinical utility of these novel sCRC immunomic biomarkers.","González-González, María; Sayagués, José María; Muñoz-Bellvís, Luis; Pedreira, Carlos Eduardo; de Campos, Marcello L R; García, Jacinto; Alcázar, José Antonio; Braz, Patrick F; Galves, Breno L; González, Luis Miguel; Bengoechea, Oscar; Abad, María Del Mar; Cruz, Juan Jesús; Bellido, Lorena; Fonseca, Emilio; Díez, Paula; Juanes-Velasco, Pablo; Landeira-Viñuela, Alicia; Lecrevisse, Quentin; Montalvillo, Enrique; Góngora, Rafael; Blanco, Oscar; Sánchez-Santos, José Manuel; LaBaer, Joshua; Orfao, Alberto; Fuentes, Manuel",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13112718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072782/,435

There have been neither instances of permanent contour deformity due to suture placement nor any instances of suture extrusion through the skin. Thus, this technique appears to be safe and effective and should be considered when surgeons are faced with an IMF asymmetry.","Hirsch, Elliot M; Seth, Akhil K; Fine, Neil A",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0b013e318268a81d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24618739/,435

91855,Cancer and severe mental illness: Bi-directional problems and potential solutions.,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND The breakdown of skin microcirculation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of chemical burns. Available data for alkali and acid injuries are rare. To determine the pathophysiological similarities and differences, two comparable in vivo acid and alkali burn models were developed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Deep partial-thickness acid burns (32% hydrochloric acid) or alkali burns (11% sodium hydroxide solution) were inflicted to the ears of hairless mice (n = 17). Intravital fluorescent microscopy was used to assess microcirculation, angiogenesis, and leukocyte-endothelium interaction over a 21-d period. RESULTS The angiogenesis occurred significantly faster after acid burns than after alkali burns in the first 3 days (nonperfused area day 3, 80% ± 9% [acid] versus 94% ± 17% [alkali]; P = 0.045) and then a significant acceleration occurs in the alkali group: nonperfused area day 14, 27% (alkali) versus 57% (acid), P = 0.004. The loss of functional vessel density was more pronounced after acid burns (directly after trauma, 87% [alkali] versus 79% [acid], P = 0.049). The other parameters such as rolling and sticking leukocytes, edema formation, and arteriolar and venular red blood cell velocities and diameters showed similar results. CONCLUSIONS The comparison of analogous intravital acid and alkali burns shows that despite many similarities in the microcirculatory parameters, there was a marked difference particularly in the course of the tissue regeneration by angiogenesis. The longer lasting destruction by alkali burns stands in contrast to the later onset but faster regeneration by angiogenesis compared with that by acid burns.","Goertz, Ole; Popp, Anette; Kolbenschlag, Jonas; Vogelpohl, Julian; Daigeler, Adrien; Ring, Andrej; Lehnhardt, Marcus; Hirsch, Tobias",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2012.10.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23127282/,435

The distinctive phenotype of each cell is determined by molecular mechanisms such as epigenetic changes that occur throughout the lifetime of an individual. Recently, technologies that enable modification of the fate of somatic cells have been developed, and the number of studies using these technologies has increased drastically in the last decade. Various cell types, including neuronal cells, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes, have been generated using these technologies. Although most direct reprogramming methods employ forced transduction of a defined sets of transcription factors to reprogram cells in a manner similar to induced pluripotent cell technology, many other strategies, such as methods utilizing chemical compounds and microRNAs to change the fate of somatic cells, have also been developed.

To gain adequate visualization of relevant structures, surgical assistants often assume awkward positioning with inadequate stability of handheld retractors. Additionally, the lead surgeon is typically the only member of the surgical team who can adequately visualize the procedure being performed. To that end, devices have been manufactured with aims of optimizing both visualization and workspace while reducing the need of handheld retractors during vaginal surgery. This video presents one of those retractors: a reusable, self-retaining, vaginal Magrina-Bookwalter, with details to help achieve the optimal visualization and workspace with its use. METHODS A narrated video provides a brief history, components and proper assembly of the retractor with stepwise application of components demonstrated during a vaginal hysterectomy. CONCLUSION The self-retaining, vaginal Magrina-Bookwalter retractor is a helpful tool to optimize the visualization and workspace while reducing the need for handheld retractors during vaginal procedures deeper into the pelvis.","Cope, Zebulun S; Francis, Sean; Cardenas-Trowers, Olivia; Gupta, Ankita",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-020-04492-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803343/,435

To predict these diseases early, monitoring the health condition of the human body due to the influence of thermoregulation disorders is important. Although extensive works are performed on sweat-rate detection by constructing microfluidic channels, skin-moisture evaporation before sweating remains unknown. This work proposes a wireless and flexible sensor sheet to investigate the thermoregulatory responses of different people under cold stimulation and exercise by measuring the temperature and moisture variations on the finger skin. An integrated flexible sensor system consists of a ZnIn2 S4 nanosheet-based humidity sensor and carbon nanotube/SnO2 temperature sensor. The results exhibit distinct thermoregulation abilities of five volunteers. Interestingly, the sudden increase in finger moisture that results from the excitation by the sympathetic nerve is observed during the cold-stimulus test. Although further studies are required to predict the potential diseases resulted from thermoregulation disorders in human body, this study provides a possibility of continuous and real-time monitoring of thermoregulatory activities via skin moisture and temperature detection using a flexible sensor sheet.","Lu, Yuyao; Fujita, Yusuke; Honda, Satoko; Yang, Shin-Hsin; Xuan, Yan; Xu, Kaichen; Arie, Takayuki; Akita, Seiji; Takei, Kuniharu",Advanced healthcare materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202100103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955182/,435

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides information on cerebral oxygenation but its relevance during post-resuscitation care is undefined. We investigated whether cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) measured with NIRS correlates with the serum concentration of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a marker of neurological injury, and with clinical outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. METHODS We performed a post hoc analysis of a randomised clinical trial (COMACARE, NCT02698917) comparing two different levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and arterial pressure after resuscitation from OHCA with ventricular fibrillation as the initial rhythm. We measured rSO2 in 118 OHCA patients with NIRS during the first 36 h of intensive care. We determined the NSE concentrations from serum samples at 48 h after cardiac arrest and assessed neurological outcome with the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale at 6 months. We evaluated the association between rSO2 and serum NSE concentrations and the association between rSO2 and good (CPC 1-2) and poor (CPC 3-5) neurological outcome. RESULTS The median (inter-quartile range (IQR)) NSE concentration at 48 h was 17.5 (13.4-25.0) μg/l in patients with good neurological outcome and 35.2 (22.6-95.8) μg/l in those with poor outcome, p < 0.001. We found no significant correlation between median rSO2 and NSE at 48 h, rs = - 0.08, p = 0.392. The median (IQR) rSO2 during the first 36 h of intensive care was 70.0% (63.5-77.0%) in patients with good outcome and 71.8% (63.3-74.0%) in patients with poor outcome, p = 0.943. There was no significant association between rSO2 over time and neurological outcome. In a binary logistic regression model, rSO2 was not a statistically significant predictor of good neurological outcome (odds ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.04, p = 0.635). CONCLUSIONS We found no association between cerebral oxygenation measured with NIRS and NSE concentrations or outcome in patients resuscitated from OHCA.

97213,[The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Health and Coping Behaviors of Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression].,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Garden-based interventions have the potential to impact young children's health in a number of ways, including enhancing dietary intake, increasing outdoor physical activity, diversifying the gut microbiome, and promoting general wellbeing. A number of recent systematic reviews have either included or focused on garden-based interventions for young children. However, most prior reviews including young children only focus on one health outcome or one setting, making a full summary of prior research assessing the impact of garden-based interventions nonexistent. As such, this umbrella systematic review aims to synthesize the literature on health outcomes of garden-based interventions for young children. METHODS This protocol outlines the systematic steps we will take to conduct an umbrella review on health-related outcomes of garden-based interventions in children younger than 6 years of age. We will systematically search PubMed, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, OVID-Agricola, and CAB Direct, including all systematic reviews and meta-analyses fitting the pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. We will double screen at each phase of the review: title/abstract, full text, data extraction, and quality appraisal. We will assess the quality of included reviews using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2). Based on the potential for stark variability in what how reviews report child health outcomes, we will analyze the reviews both narratively and quantitatively, reporting summary of findings tables and iteratively mapping the results. This protocol aligns with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols statement (PRISMA-P). DISCUSSION This umbrella review aims to summarize the role that garden-based interventions play in health promotion for young children. We will focus on a number of diverse child health outcomes in an effort to comprehensively synthesize the evidence to inform future garden-based interventions, research, and policy.

The PS-PICCSBs mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) have successfully fabricated and characterized based on spectral and microscopic analyses, porosity, zeta potential, water contact angle, and water uptake (wettability) measurements. The PWF, fouling-resistance against bovine serum albumin (BSA), as well as ion exchange capacity (IEC) against nitrate anion were studied. The wettability, hydrophilicity and overall porosity of new MMMs have greatly increased, in comparison to a pristine PS membrane (M0). In addition, blending of PS with PICCSBs resulted in switching its surface from negatively- to positively-charged. The PWF of MMMs has increased to reach a maximum value of 238.6 L/m2 h for MMM1 (9.3-fold higher than M0). Meanwhile, BSA rejection has declined from 96.62% for M0 to 41.9% for MMM1. The fouling parameters results of MMMs indicated their low fouling propensity. The IEC of nitrate anions revealed that the nitrate uptake by MMM1 is higher than that for M0 and MMM2 by 34% and 14%, respectively.","Elshaarawy, Reda F M; Abd El-Aal, Reda M; Mustafa, Fatma H A; Borai, Ahmed E; Schmidt, Stephan; Janiak, Christoph",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385455/,435

METHODS Patients with any type of seizure or epilepsy syndrome were recruited in 16 neurological and neuropediatric centers in Germany if the treating physician decided to administer LCM-iv for any reason. Observation time per patient was 10 days with daily documentation of LCM-iv administration, type and frequency of seizures, currently used drugs and doses, and adverse events. Treatment efficacy, tolerability, and handling of LCM-iv were assessed using a five-step scale. RESULTS In 119 patients treating physicians classified epilepsies as focal in 66.1% and generalized in 17.4% (16.5% unclassifiable). Most common etiologies of seizures were tumors (36.1%) and cerebrovascular diseases (21.8%). Reasons for LCM-iv treatment included preparation for surgery (25.2%), convulsive (24.4%) and non-convulsive (18.5%) status epilepticus (SE), series of seizures (16.0%), gastrointestinal causes (5.9%), and acute seizures (4.2%). The median dose of LCM-iv was 300mg per day. In 45 of 64 patients (70.3%) with SE or series of seizures, epileptic activity ceased during observation time. Five patients showed abnormalities in ECG prior to the infusion and one patient afterwards, but during infusion no abnormalities were reported. Treating physicians rated efficacy and tolerability as very good or good in 77.6% and 93.1% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This large and independent multicenter registry on the use of LCM-iv in clinical practice demonstrates that LCM-iv is well-tolerated and highly efficacious when given in emergency situations, including patients experiencing SE.

99194,End-expiratory lung volume recovers more slowly after closed endotracheal suctioning than after open suctioning: a randomized crossover study.,2012,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) profoundly influences T-cell immunity. The counts of total T cells and T-cell subsets, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are decreased in patients with COVID-19. Also, the function of these cells becomes less effective as the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, such as Tim3 and PD-1, increases over time during the disease. Kinetic analyses show that the T-cell profile changes dynamically, so does the COVID-19 stages. As COVID-19 continues to deteriorate and progresses to severe/critical condition, the lymphocyte count steadily decreases. Therefore, the ability of COVID-19 to escape the immune system might lie in its power to profoundly diminish T-cell effective function, which is necessary for the establishment of a robust antiviral immunity. Also, COVID-19 is associated with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, and as the disease progresses from a mild form to a severe/critical condition, the macrophage population becomes denser. Monitoring the expression of cytokines associated with macrophage activation, mainly interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, indicates that the course of COVID-19 consists of two stages and the transition between disease stages occurs by the end of the first week after onset of symptoms. At the initial stage, the immune military recognizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as nonself and thus fires macrophages at the lungs against the virus. The first flame can control disease progression effectively. However, a trained immunocompetent system would maintain the fire of macrophages over an extended time. It lies in its immune memory in tissue-resident macrophages, especially alveolar macrophages, making a professionally trained immune system more likely to be feared by COVID-19 than an untrained immune system. In this manner, the trained immunocompetent system commits such a failure that causes the lungs to come down rapidly. The fact that younger age groups, including neonates and children, are less susceptible to COVID-19 than older age groups reflects that the natural affinities of the immune system that has not been trained thoroughly would be standard in combatting against COVID-19 whereas the higher affinities of the trained immune system for rapid activation of immune responses might raise faults - the lungs come down.","Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973176/,435

We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization in the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we included 31 adult patients with moderate COVID-19 who were admitted to the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning (Nanning, China) between January 22, 2020 and February 17, 2020. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (standard care group) and group B (M. vaccae in combination with standard care group). The primary outcome was the time interval from admission to viral RNA negative conversion (oropharyngeal swabs were used in this study). Secondary outcomes included chest computed tomography (CT), mortality, length of hospital stay, complications during treatment, and so on. Patients were followed up to 4 weeks after discharge (reexamination of viral RNA, chest CT, etc.). Results: Nucleic acid test negative conversion time in group B was shorter than that in group A (2.9 days [2.7-8.7] vs. 6.8 days [3.3-13.8]; p = 0.045). No death and no conversion to severe or critical cases were observed in both groups. Two weeks after discharge, neither ""relapse"" nor ""return to positive"" cases were found. Four weeks after discharge, it was found that there was no case of "" relapse "" or ""return to positive"" in group B, and 1 patient in group A showed ""return to positive"", but there was no clinical manifestation and imaging progression. No adverse reactions related to M. vaccae were found during observation period.

A rising number of elderly IBD patients with contraindications to established therapies and a growing group of patients losing response to anti-TNF therapy compel us to find safer, better-tolerated, and, ideally, personalized treatment options. However, in order to choose the right drug to fit a patient, it is indispensable to understand the pathomechanism involved in IBD. Summary The aim of this review is to explain the inflammatory signaling pathways in IBD and how to inhibit them with current and future therapeutic approaches. Next to biologic agents targeting inflammatory cytokines (anti-TNF agents, anti-IL-12/-23 agents, and specific inhibitors of IL-23), biologics blocking leukocyte trafficking to the gut (anti-integrin antibodies) are available nowadays. More recently, small molecules inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway (JAK inhibitors) or preventing lymphocyte trafficking (sphingosine-1-phosphate modulators) have been approved or are under investigation. Furthermore, modifying the microbiota has potential therapeutic effects on IBD, and autologous hematopoietic or mesenchymal stem cell transplantation may be considered for a highly selected group of IBD patients. Key Message Physicians should understand the different mechanisms of action of the potential therapies for IBD to select the right drug for the right patient.","Schreiner, Philipp; Neurath, Markus F; Ng, Siew C; El-Omar, Emad M; Sharara, Ala I; Kobayashi, Taku; Hisamatsu, Tadakazu; Hibi, Toshifumi; Rogler, Gerhard",Inflammatory intestinal diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000500721; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31559260/,435

A scoping review on head-out aquatic cycling.,2017,"BACKGROUND During the COVID-19, community mental health care workers (CMHWs) faced much heavier workloads, which make them vulnerable to mental problems. AIM This study aims to investigate coronavirus disease-related occupational stress and its single and cumulative effect on mental health and self-efficacy among CMHWs. METHODS A quick-response online cross-sectional survey WA conducted during the coronavirus disease outbreak. A total of 536 CMHWs were recruited in March 2020, in China. Demographics, occupational stress, depression, anxiety, positive and negative emotions, and self-efficacy were collected. Logistic regression analysis was employed to test the single and cumulative effect of occupational stress on mental health and self-efficacy. RESULTS CMHWs did not show high level of depression or anxiety in this study. Those who provided service for suspected people who were quarantined reported higher risk of depression and anxiety. Staying out for more than 3 days was a risk factor of depression while cleaning/sterilising streets or communities was a protective factor of depression. Those who received psychiatric training showed higher positive emotion and self-efficacy, and providing psychological assistance online increased the self-efficacy. CMHWs with two different types of work had 0.996 times more risk of depression than those with only one type of work.

Treatment of mice with anti-CXCL10 neutralizing antibody results in limited CD4+ T cell infiltration into the CNS accompanied by a reduction in white matter damage. The current study determines the antigen-specificity of the T lymphocytes present during chronic disease and evaluates how blocking CXCL10 signaling affects retention of virus-specific T cells within the CNS. CXCL10 neutralization selectively reduced accumulation and/or retention of virus-specific CD4+ T cells, yet exhibited limited effect on virus-specific CD8+ T cells. The response of CXCL10 neutralization on virus-specific T cell subsets is not due to differential expression of the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 on T cells as there was no appreciable difference in receptor expression on virus-specific T cells during either acute or chronic disease. These findings emphasize the importance of virus-specific CD4+ T cells in amplifying demyelination in JHMV-infected mice. In addition, differential signals are required for trafficking and retention of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during chronic demyelination in JHMV-infected mice.","Stiles, Linda N; Liu, Michael T; Kane, Joy A C; Lane, Thomas E",Autoimmunity,https://doi.org/10.1080/08916930902810708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19626487/,435

In this study, three hybridoma cell lines secreting specific monoclonal antibodies against the RBD of the S protein were generated and their exact binding sites were identified. Using yeast surface display, the binding sites of these antibodies were defined to two linear regions on the RBD: S(337-360) and S(380-399). Using these monoclonal antibodies in phage peptide library screening identified 10 distinct mimotopes 12 amino acids in length. Sequence comparison between native epitopes and these mimotopes further confirmed the binding sites, and revealed key amino acid residues involved in antibody binding. None of these antibodies could neutralize the murine leukemia virus pseudotyped expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein (MLV/SARS-CoV). However, these mAbs could be useful in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV due to their exclusive reactivity with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, this study established a feasible platform for epitope mapping. Yeast surface display combined with phage peptide library screening provides a convenient strategy for the identification of epitope peptides from certain antigenic proteins.","Zhang, Xiaoping; Wang, Jingxue; Wen, Kun; Mou, Zhirong; Zou, Liyun; Che, Xiaoyan; Ni, Bing; Wu, Yuzhang",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2009.0046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19951177/,435

Such monitoring is possible due to advances in soft and flexible materials, devices and bioelectronics systems. Compared to other flexible platforms, multi-filament textile fibers or threads offer superior flexibility, material diversity, and simple ambient processing to realize a wide range of flexible devices such as sensors, electronics, and microfluidics. In this paper, we realize unique flexible transistors on threads and interconnect them to realize logic gates and small-scale integrated circuits. Compared to prior textile-based transistors, the proposed thread-based transistors (TBTs) are realized with a readily shaped, colloidally dispersed gel consisting of silica nanoparticles and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI TFSI) ionic liquid for all-around electrolyte gating of a carbon nanotube (CNT) semiconducting network assembled on the thread. We interconnect TBTs with thread-based electrochemical sensors (TBEs) to realize an all-thread based multiplexed diagnostic device. All-thread based platforms are thin, super flexible and conformal, allowing them to be worn directly on the skin without any polymeric substrate, or sutured transdermally using a needle.","Owyeung, Rachel E; Terse-Thakoor, Trupti; Rezaei Nejad, Hojatollah; Panzer, Matthew J; Sonkusale, Sameer R",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b09522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31381299/,435

Bereaved Families' Perceptions of End-of-Life Communication During COVID-19.",2020-12-15,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Surgeons use a variety of sutures and knot-tying methods during pelvic reconstructive procedures. We hypothesized that knot-strength integrity will be similar with regards to type of knot, type of suture, and the knot-tying process. METHODS Using six different suture materials, flat square knots and slip knots were tied robotically and by hand by two surgeons. Knot integrity was evaluated using an Instron 5544 machine. We measured force and elongation at suture failure or knot slippage (whichever came first) as well as force at 3-mm displacement. RESULTS Four hundred and thirty-two knots were tie; one unraveled before the analysis, and 431 were tested. Three hundred and ninety-two knots reached or surpassed tensile strength of 30 N, the force at which tissue itself will fail. Knots tied with polyglyconate suture achieved the greatest tensile strength and those with OO-polydioxanone had the lowest. Hand-tied knots, regardless of technique and suture material, had greater tensile strength but greater elongation than robotically tied knots. Slip knots and flat square knots have similar integrity regardless of the tying technique. CONCLUSION Hand-tied knots had greater tensile strength than robotic knots, but the strength to break all knots required supraphysiological conditions. The decision to use a specific type of suture based on strength is not supported by our results, suggesting that surgeons may choose sutures based on other characteristics and personal comfort.","Dueñas-Garcia, Omar F; Sullivan, Gina M; Leung, Katherine; Billiar, Kristen L; Flynn, Michael K",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-017-3393-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28634623/,435
102008,[Challenges and Opportunities: The Impact of COVID-19 in Palliative Care in Portugal].,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND The currently recommended regimen for focal radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus (BE) comprises 2 applications of energy, cleaning of the device and ablation zone, and 2 additional applications of energy. A simplified regimen may be of clinical utility if it is faster, easier, and equally safe and effective. OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of 2 focal RFA regimens. SETTING Three tertiary referral centers. PATIENTS Consecutive patients scheduled for focal RFA of BE with flat type BE with at least 2 BE islands or mosaic groups of islands were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS BE areas were paired: 1 area was randomized to the ""standard"" regimen (2 × 15 J/cm(2)-clean-2 × 15 J/cm(2)) or to the ""simplified"" regimen (3 × 15 J/cm(2)-no clean), allocating the second area automatically to the other regimen. The percentage of surface area regression of each area was scored at 2 months by the endoscopist (blinded). OUTCOME MEASURE Proportion of completely removed BE areas at 2 months. Calculated sample size was 46 pairs of BE areas using a noninferiority design. Noninferiority was defined as <20% difference in the paired proportions. RESULTS Forty-five equivalent pairs of BE areas were included in 41 patients. The proportion of completely removed BE areas at 2 months after focal RFA was 30 (67%) for standard and 33 (73%) for simplified. Noninferiority was demonstrated by a 7% difference (95% CI, -10.6 to +20.9). LIMITATIONS Tertiary referral centers. CONCLUSIONS The results of this multicenter randomized trial suggest that a simplified 3 × 15 J/cm(2) focal ablation regimen is not inferior to the standard regimen, regarding the endoscopic removal of residual Barrett islands.","van Vilsteren, Frederike G I; Phoa, K Nadine; Alvarez Herrero, Lorenza; Pouw, Roos E; Sondermeijer, Carine M T; Visser, Mike; Ten Kate, Fiebo J W; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I; Weusten, Bas L A M; Schoon, Erik J; Bergman, Jacques J G H M",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2013.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23528655/,435

Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in dysmenorrhea; however, there are large interindividual differences in patients' responses to acupuncture treatment. Fifty-four patients with PDM were recruited and randomized into real or sham acupuncture treatment groups (over the course of three menstrual cycles). Pain-related functional connectivity (FC) matrices were constructed at baseline and post-treatment period. The different neural mechanisms altered by real and sham acupuncture were detected with multivariate analysis of variance. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) based on a machine learning approach was used to explore whether the different FC patterns predicted the acupuncture treatment response in the PDM patients. The results showed that real but not sham acupuncture significantly relieved pain severity in PDM patients. Real and sham acupuncture displayed differences in FC alterations between the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS) and sensorimotor network (SMN), the salience network (SN) and SMN, and the SN and default mode network (DMN). Furthermore, MVPA found that these FC patterns at baseline could predict the acupuncture treatment response in PDM patients. The present study verified differentially altered brain mechanisms underlying real and sham acupuncture in PDM patients and supported the use of neuroimaging biomarkers for individual-based precise acupuncture treatment in patients with PDM.","Yu, Siyi; Xie, Mingguo; Liu, Shuqin; Guo, Xiaoli; Tian, Jin; Wei, Wei; Zhang, Qi; Zeng, Fang; Liang, Fanrong; Yang, Jie",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.559191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013312/,435

104484,COVID-19 prevalence and presenting symptoms in a college student population: A retrospective chart review.,2021-06-16,"The enzyme cGAS functions as a sensor that recognizes the cytosolic DNA from foreign pathogen. The activation of the protein triggers the transcription of inflammatory genes, leading into the establishment of an antipathogen state. An interesting new discovery is that the detection of DNA by cGAS induced the formation of liquid-like droplets. However how cells regulate the formation of these droplets is still not fully understood. In order to unravel the molecular mechanism beneath the DNA-mediated phase separation of cGAS, we developed a polymer-based coarse-grained model which takes into accounts the basic structural organization in DNA and cGAS, as well as the binding properties between these biomolecules. This model was further integrated into a hybrid simulation algorithm. With this computational method, a multi-step kinetic process of aggregation between cGAS and DNA was observed. Moreover, we systematically tested the model under different concentrations and binding parameters. Our simulation results show that phase separation requires both cGAS dimerization and protein-DNA interactions, whereas polymers can be kinetically trapped in small aggregates under strong binding affinities. Additionally, we demonstrated that supramolecular assembly can be facilitated by increasing the number of functional modules in protein or DNA polymers, suggesting that multivalency and intrinsic disordered regions play positive roles in regulating phase separation. This is consistent to previous experimental evidences. Taken together, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational model to study condensation of cGAS-DNA complexes. While the method can reach the timescale beyond the capability of atomic-level MD simulations, it still includes information about spatial arrangement of functional modules in biopolymers that is missing in the mean-field theory. Our work thereby adds a useful dimension to a suite of existing experimental and computational techniques to study the dynamics of phase separation in biological systems.","Su, Zhaoqian; Dhusia, Kalyani; Wu, Yinghao",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2021.109001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352244/,435

105048,The Challenge of Identifying Pediatric Abusive Head Trauma During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-04-20,"UNLABELLED We discovered a novel Betacoronavirus lineage A coronavirus, China Rattus coronavirus (ChRCoV) HKU24, from Norway rats in China. ChRCoV HKU24 occupied a deep branch at the root of members of Betacoronavirus 1, being distinct from murine coronavirus and human coronavirus HKU1. Its unique putative cleavage sites between nonstructural proteins 1 and 2 and in the spike (S) protein and low sequence identities to other lineage A betacoronaviruses (βCoVs) in conserved replicase domains support ChRCoV HKU24 as a separate species. ChRCoV HKU24 possessed genome features that resemble those of both Betacoronavirus 1 and murine coronavirus, being closer to Betacoronavirus 1 in most predicted proteins but closer to murine coronavirus by G+C content, the presence of a single nonstructural protein (NS4), and an absent transcription regulatory sequence for the envelope (E) protein. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) demonstrated higher sequence identity to the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) NTD than to the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NTD, with 3 of 4 critical sugar-binding residues in BCoV and 2 of 14 contact residues at the MHV NTD/murine CEACAM1a interface being conserved. Molecular clock analysis dated the time of the most recent common ancestor of ChRCoV HKU24, Betacoronavirus 1, and rabbit coronavirus HKU14 to about the year 1400. Cross-reactivities between other lineage A and B βCoVs and ChRCoV HKU24 nucleocapsid but not spike polypeptide were demonstrated. Using the spike polypeptide-based Western blot assay, we showed that only Norway rats and two oriental house rats from Guangzhou, China, were infected by ChRCoV HKU24. Other rats, including Norway rats from Hong Kong, possessed antibodies only against N protein and not against the spike polypeptide, suggesting infection by βCoVs different from ChRCoV HKU24. ChRCoV HKU24 may represent the murine origin of Betacoronavirus 1, and rodents are likely an important reservoir for ancestors of lineage A βCoVs. IMPORTANCE While bats and birds are hosts for ancestors of most coronaviruses (CoVs), lineage A βCoVs have never been found in these animals and the origin of Betacoronavirus lineage A remains obscure. We discovered a novel lineage A βCoV, China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV HKU24), from Norway rats in China with a high seroprevalence. The unique genome features and phylogenetic analysis supported the suggestion that ChRCoV HKU24 represents a novel CoV species, occupying a deep branch at the root of members of Betacoronavirus 1 and being distinct from murine coronavirus. Nevertheless, ChRCoV HKU24 possessed genome characteristics that resemble those of both Betacoronavirus 1 and murine coronavirus. Our data suggest that ChRCoV HKU24 represents the murine origin of Betacoronavirus 1, with interspecies transmission from rodents to other mammals having occurred centuries ago, before the emergence of human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 in the late 1800s. Rodents are likely an important reservoir for ancestors of lineage A βCoVs.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Li, Kenneth S M; Tsang, Alan K L; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Luk, Hayes K H; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Wang, Ming; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02420-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25552712/,435

We assessed the physiological consequences of variable ventilation in the immature lung. METHODS Lambs delivered at 129 days (term = 150 days) were euthanised (n = 9) or anaesthetised, tracheostomised and suctioned prior to prophylactic intra-tracheal surfactant instillation (Curosurf(®), 100 mg/kg) and commencement of controlled ventilation (50 breaths/min, tidal volume 7.7 ± 0.8 mL/kg). Volume history was standardised at 20 min with two sustained (3 s) inflations to 30 cmH(2)O followed immediately by measurement of baseline dynamic lung mechanics (FlexiVent, Scireq, Canada). Ventilation was continued according to prior randomisation (variable or conventional ventilation). For variable ventilation (n = 9), breath-to-breath tidal volume and respiratory rate varied but intra-breath minute volume (MV) and average tidal volume were equivalent to the conventional ventilation group with fixed tidal volume and rate (n = 7). Lung mechanics and gas exchange were measured at intervals. Lambs were euthanised at 2 h. Inflammatory cell counts and protein from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue cytokine mRNA were quantified. RESULTS At study completion, PaCO(2) (p = 0.026) and mean airway pressure (p = 0.002) were lower and pH (p = 0.047), ventilation efficiency index (p = 0.021) and dynamic compliance were higher (p = 0.003) in lambs on variable rather than conventional ventilation. However, oxygenation indices and post-mortem static compliances were not different between groups. CONCLUSION Variable ventilation improves ventilation efficiency and in vivo lung compliance in the preterm lung, but unlike adult models, had no effect on arterial oxygenation.","Pillow, J Jane; Musk, Gabrielle C; McLean, Carryn M; Polglase, Graeme R; Dalton, Richard G B; Jobe, Alan H; Suki, Béla",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-011-2237-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21567115/,435

BACKGROUND Thrombosis of the SVC and of the innominate vein is a potentially life threatening complication in infants during intensive care treatment following major surgical procedures. To avoid reoperations, we evaluated interventional revascularization by stent-retriever thrombectomy. METHODS From 2015 to 2017, five infants were diagnosed with acute thrombosis of the SVC and innominate vein following major cardiac or pediatric surgery. Using a femoral venous access and 4 or 5 French guiding catheters stent-retriever systems (4/20 mm or 6/30 mm) were placed into the thrombus and retrieved under suction. We aimed to revascularize not only the SVC but also the innominate, jugular, and subclavian veins. RESULTS Following repeated stent retrieving manoeuvers, we were able to reestablish flow in the major veins of all patients. Due to significant residual thrombotic material, we decided to perform additional balloon dilatation of the SVC and innominate vein in 3/5 patients. There were no complications related to the procedure and none of our patients required blood transfusion. Following the intervention, the patients received treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin. Interventional treatment achieved persistent patency of the SVC and innominate vein in all patients. CONCLUSION Stent-retriever thrombectomy is a safe and effective method for interventional treatment of acute thrombosis of the central veins in infants. Due to the large amount of thrombotic material, it is frequently required to combine this method with balloon compression of residual thrombotic material.","Hanser, Anja; Sieverding, Ludger; Hauser, Till-Karsten; Wiegand, Gesa; Hofbeck, Michael",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30737974/,435

METHODS A survey was distributed via REDCap through state orthopedic organizations between April and July 2020. The 22-question digital survey collected information regarding restrictions on elective procedures, location of care, utilization of telehealth, and estimated reductions in annual income. RESULTS In this study, 192 participants responded to the survey (average age 49.9 ± 11.0 years, 92.7% male). Responses primarily originated from Alabama (30.2%), Georgia (30.2%), and Missouri (16.1%). The remainder of the responses were grouped into the category ""other."" Respondents did not vary significantly by state in operative setting or income type (salary, work relative value units, or collections). Most of the participants documented elective procedure restrictions in hospital and ambulatory settings. The highest frequency of closures occurred between March 18 and 20 (47% in hospital, 51% in ambulatory). Of the participants, financial loss estimates varied across states (P = 0.005), with 50% of physicians claiming >50% losses of income in Alabama (24% Georgia, 10% Missouri, 31% other). Regarding telehealth, practices set up for these services before 2020 varied across states. None of the orthopedic practices in Alabama had telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic (Missouri 25%, Georgia 9%, other 8%, P = 0.06); however, respondents generally were split when considering the anticipation of implementing telehealth into routine practice. CONCLUSIONS Most practices did implement restrictions for elective clinic visits and procedures early during the pandemic. COVID-19 ultimately will result in a large revenue loss for elective orthopedic practices. Services such as telehealth may help offset these losses and help deliver orthopedic care to patients remotely.","Paul, Kyle D; Levitt, Eli; McGwin, Gerald; Brabston, Eugene W; Gilbert, Shawn R; Ponce, Brent A; Momaya, Amit M",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000001249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942117/,435

We conducted a literature search to identify publications of robotic surgical procedures in all specialties performed with either ELS or robotic staplers. Twenty-nine manuscripts and six abstracts with relevant information on operative outcomes published from January 2011 to September 2017 were identified. Given the relatively recent market release of robotic staplers in 2014, comparative perioperative clinical outcomes data on the performance of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is very sparse in the published literature. Only three comparative studies of surgeries with the da Vinci robotic system plus ELS vs. da Vinci plus robotic staplers were identified; two in robotic colorectal surgery and the other in robotic gastric bypass surgery. These comparative studies illustrate some nuances in device design and usability, which may impact outcomes and cost, and therefore may be important to consider when selecting the appropriate stapling technologies/technique for different robotic surgeries. Comparative perioperative data on the use of ELS vs. robotic staplers in robotic surgery is scarce (three studies), and current literature identifies both types of devices as safe and effective. Given the longer clinical history of ELS and its relatively more robust evidence base, there may be trade-offs to consider before switching to robotic staplers in certain robotic procedures.

109622,Quantitative measures of health policy implementation determinants and outcomes: a systematic review.,2020-06-19,"BACKGROUND Large radial tears that disrupt the circumferential fibers of the meniscus are associated with reduced meniscal function and increased risk of joint degeneration. Electrospun fibrous scaffolds can mimic the topography and mechanics of fibrocartilaginous tissues and simultaneously serve as carriers of cells and growth factors, yet their incorporation into clinically relevant suture repair techniques for radial meniscus tears is unexplored. The purposes of this study were to (1) evaluate the effect of fiber orientation on the tensile properties and suture-retention strength of multilayered electrospun scaffolds and (2) determine the mechanical effects of scaffold inclusion within a surgical repair of a simulated radial meniscal tear. The experimental hypothesis was that augmentation with a multilayered scaffold would not compromise the strength of the repair. METHODS Three multilayered electrospun scaffolds with different fiber orientations were fabricated-aligned, random, and biomimetic. The biomimetic scaffold was comprised of four layers in the following order (deep to superficial)-aligned longitudinal, aligned transverse, aligned longitudinal, and random-respectively corresponding to circumferential, radial, circumferential, and superficial collagen fibers of the native meniscus. Material properties (i.e., ultimate stress, modulus, etc.) of the scaffolds were determined in the parallel and perpendicular directions, as was suture retention strength. Complete radial tears of lateral bovine meniscus explants were repaired with a double horizontal mattress suture technique, with or without inclusion of the biomimetic scaffold sheath. Both repair groups, as well as native controls, were cyclically loaded between 5 and 20 N for 500 cycles and then loaded to failure. Clamp-to-clamp distance (i.e., residual elongation) was measured following various cycles. Ultimate load, ultimate elongation, and stiffness, were also determined. Group differences were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or Student's t-test where appropriate. RESULTS Aligned scaffolds possessed the most anisotropic mechanical properties, whereas random scaffolds showed uniform properties in the parallel and perpendicular directions. In comparison, the biomimetic scaffold possessed moduli in the parallel (68.7 ± 14.7 MPa) and perpendicular (39.4 ± 11.6 MPa) directions that respectively approximate the reported circumferential and radial tensile properties of native menisci. The ultimate suture retention load of the biomimetic scaffold in the parallel direction (7.2 ± 1.6 N) was significantly higher than all other conditions (p < 0.001). Biomimetic scaffold augmentation did not compromise mechanical properties when compared against suture repair in terms of residual elongation after 500 cycles (scaffold: 5.05 ± 0.89 mm vs. repair: 4.78 ± 1.24 mm), ultimate failure load (137.1 ± 31.0 N vs. 124.4 ± 21.4 N), ultimate elongation (12.09 ± 5.89 mm vs. 10.14 ± 4.61 mm), and stiffness (20.8 ± 3.6 vs. 18.4 ± 4.7 N/mm). CONCLUSIONS While multilayered scaffold sheets were successfully fabricated to mimic the ultrastructure and anisotropic tensile properties of native menisci, improvements in suture retention strength or adoption of superior surgical techniques will be needed to further enhance the mechanical strength of repairs of radial meniscal tears.","Rothrauff, Benjamin B; Numpaisal, Piya-On; Lauro, Brian B; Alexander, Peter G; Debski, Richard E; Musahl, Volker; Tuan, Rocky S",Journal of experimental orthopaedics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40634-016-0058-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27624439/,435

This case report demonstrates the potential of emerging noninvasive monitoring methods to assist in both detection and therapeutic management to improve neurologic outcomes of the very low birth weight neonate.","Rhee, Christopher J; Kibler, Kathleen K; Brady, Ken M; Everett, Allen D; Graham, Ernest M; Andropoulos, Dean B; Easley, R Blaine",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-1702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23420921/,435

The objective of the present study is to validate if such an approach, targeting the ankle, could specifically promote an increased activation of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles that are of key importance for the rehabilitation of foot drop. METHODS 12 adults, with no gait deficit, walked on a treadmill for three periods of 5min: before, during and after exposure to a torque perturbation applied by a robotized ankle-foot orthosis that tended to plantarflex the ankle during the swing phase. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, ankle and knee kinematics, and the electromyographic activity of five lower limb muscle groups were recorded. RESULTS The perturbation initially caused a deviation of the ankle towards plantarflexion. This movement error was rapidly reduced and associated with a large increase (78.2%; p<0.001) in tibialis anterior (ankle dorsiflexor; TA) activation, specifically in the stance-to-swing burst. This increase carried over to post-perturbation walking, gradually disappearing over several strides. Interestingly, these aftereffects led to an increase in peak ankle dorsiflexion of approximately 7° during the swing phase. CONCLUSIONS Walking while resisting a torque perturbation applied at the ankle during swing promotes an increase in TA muscle activation that carries over after perturbation removal, leading to an increased ankle dorsiflexion. Training based on this approach may have the potential of improving the gait of persons with foot drop.","Blanchette, Andreanne; Lambert, Sebastien; Richards, Carol L; Bouyer, Laurent J",Gait & posture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2011.06.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21733695/,435

Inappropriate disposal of wasted face masks has already caused the pollution of the environment. As made from plastic nonwoven fabrics, disposable face masks could be a potential source of microplastics for the environment. In this study, we evaluated the ability of new and used disposable face masks of different types to release microplastics into the water. The microplastic release capacity of the used masks increased significantly from 183.00 ± 78.42 particles/piece for the new masks to 1246.62 ± 403.50 particles/piece. Most microplastics released from the face masks were medium size transparent polypropylene fibers originated from the nonwoven fabrics. The abrasion and aging during the using of face masks enhanced the releasing of microplastics since the increasing of medium size and blue microplastics. The face masks could also accumulate airborne microplastics during use. Our results indicated that used disposable masks without effective disposal could be a critical source of microplastics in the environment. The efficient allocation of mask resources and the proper disposal of wasted masks are not only beneficial to pandemic control but also to environmental safety.","Chen, Xianchuan; Chen, Xiaofei; Liu, Qian; Zhao, Qichao; Xiong, Xiong; Wu, Chenxi",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34087638/,435

EASY-NET (NET-2016-02364191) is a network project, started in April 2019, co-funded by the Italian Ministry of Health and the participating regions. Within the general project, centred on the evaluation of Audit and Feedback (A&F) strategies in improving quality and equity in different health care contexts, the Piedmont region is responsible of the work package 3 (WP3) on specific oncology pathways and procedures. After a thorough evaluation of the impact of the CoViD-19 emergency on the WP3 activities, at the beginning of March 2020, the decision was to continue, with some adaptations, the audits already started, and to delay those in the early planning phase. The provisional availability of part of the time-persons involved in EASY-NET on one side, and the urgency of acquiring data on the management of the large number of CoViD-19 patients admitted to the study coordinator hospital on the other side, determined the personnel responsible of the WP3, in accordance with the hospital management, to invest these resources in monitoring the CoViD-19 hospitalized patients with both A&F activity and research objectives. Besides periodic reports, a web site, with restricted access to the involved health care personnel, was developed to allow a direct and timely consultation of graphics describing the flow of the patients, their management, and outcomes. This experience was made possible thanks to a favourable combination of different factors: the presence within the hospital of a group of experienced epidemiologists in A&F, the availability of extra resources, the strong support and collaboration by the hospital management and the readiness for authorisation by the Ethics Committee. We underline the need to provide a certain degree of flexibility in the long-term projects funded by the Ministry of Health, the extraordinary adaptability of the A&F approach also to emergency situations and the possibility of combining audit activities and research objectives in the same project.","Pagano, Eva; Castiglione, Anna; Scozzari, Gitana; La Valle, Giovanni; Angelone, Lorenzo; Agabiti, Nera; Scarmozzino, Antonio; Ciccone, Giovannino",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3421.34061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32914776/,435
119322,Retraction to: Gender Differences in Alcohol Treatment.,2020-09-09,"INTRODUCTION Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) is a ""threshold"" load that must be overcome to trigger conventional pneumatically-controlled pressure support (PSP) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Application of extrinsic PEEP (PEEPe) reduces trigger delays and mechanical inspiratory efforts. Using the diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi), neurally controlled pressure support (PSN) could hypothetically eliminate asynchrony and reduce mechanical inspiratory effort, hence substituting the need for PEEPe. The primary objective of this study was to show that PSN can reduce the need for PEEPe to improve patient-ventilator interaction and to reduce both the ""pre-trigger"" and ""total inspiratory"" neural and mechanical efforts in COPD patients with PEEPi. A secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of applying PSN on breathing pattern. METHODS Twelve intubated and mechanically ventilated COPD patients with PEEPi ≥ 5 cm H2O underwent comparisons of PSP and PSN at different levels of PEEPe (at 0 %, 40 %, 80 %, and 120 % of static PEEPi, for 12 minutes at each level on average), at matching peak airway pressure. We measured flow, airway pressure, esophageal pressure, and EAdi, and analyzed neural and mechanical efforts for triggering and total inspiration. Patient-ventilator interaction was analyzed with the NeuroSync index. RESULTS Mean airway pressure and PEEPe were comparable for PSP and PSN at same target levels. During PSP, the NeuroSync index was 29 % at zero PEEPe and improved to 21 % at optimal PEEPe (P < 0.05). During PSN, the NeuroSync index was lower (<7 %, P < 0.05) regardless of PEEPe. Both pre-trigger (P < 0.05) and total inspiratory mechanical efforts (P < 0.05) were consistently higher during PSP compared to PSN at same PEEPe. The change in total mechanical efforts between PSP at PEEPe0% and PSN at PEEPe0% was not different from the change between PSP at PEEPe0% and PSP at PEEPe80%. CONCLUSION PSN abolishes the need for PEEPe in COPD patients, improves patient-ventilator interaction, and reduces the inspiratory mechanical effort to breathe.

There is an increased incidence of associated thyroid disorders in patients with thyroid hemiagenesis. CASE PRESENTATION A 32-year-old Ugandan woman presented with a complaint of painless neck swelling of 3-months duration. The swelling was associated with a globus sensation. There was no history of thyroid - related problems or treatment prior to this presentation. Physical examination demonstrated a mobile right thyroid swelling without an obvious nodular contour. Neck ultrasound showed an absent left lobe of thyroid gland, a right lobe with a solitary nodule scoring two points on the Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) and an isthmus in situ. Extensive search for possible ectopic thyroid tissue was negative. She was biochemically euthyroid. The patient was counseled about thyroid hemiagenesis and was put on a regular follow up in the clinic for the TI-RADS 2 nodule. CONCLUSION Thyroid hemiagenesis is often associated with other thyroid disorders. Its diagnosis should prompt an active search for other associated morphological or functional thyroid abnormalities.","Sereke, Senai Goitom; Oriekot, Anthony; Bongomin, Felix",Thyroid research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13044-021-00101-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931088/,435

PATIENTS AND METHOD From 2001 to 2009, 89 patients with genital prolapse of grade greater than or equal to 2 (POP-Q classification) were operated on by laparoscopy including 47 patients with the suture of the posterior mesh (group suture) and 39 patients with staplin (group staples). Complications per- and postoperative were assessed. Quality of life was evaluated using the questionnaires Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI 20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PISQ 7) and Pelvic Organ Prolaps/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ 12). RESULTS Except for the mean parity that was higher in the group staples, no difference was found between the groups in the mean age, prior surgery, and genital prolapsed stage. Operating time was shorter in the group staples (P=0.005). No difference was found between the groups in the rate of intra- and postoperative complications. Hospital stay was shorter for the group staples (P=0.007). No difference between the groups was found in de novo symptoms, as well as in the improvement of quality of life. CONCLUSION Our results support that stapling of the posterior mesh for the laparoscopic promontofixation is associated with decrease in operating time and hospital stay compared to the suture without affecting functional results and quality of life.","Bui, C; Ballester, M; Chéreau, E; Guillo, E; Daraï, E","Gynecologie, obstetrique & fertilite",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gyobfe.2010.10.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21111654/,435

This manuscript assessed the hippocampus involvement in acquiring and maintaining long-term conditioned place avoidance (CPA) induced by a gastric malaise-inducing agent, LiCl. Our results demonstrate that a reliable induction of CPA is possible after one acquisition trial. However, CPA establishment requires a 20-min confinement in the compartment associated with LiCl administration. Interestingly, both hippocampal regions seem to be necessary for CPA establishment; nonetheless, inactivation of the ventral hippocampus results in a reversion of avoidance and turns it into preference. Moreover, we demonstrate that activation of dorsal/ventral hippocampal NMDA receptors after CS-US association is required for long-term CPA memory maintenance.","Hernández-Matias, Arturo; Bermúdez-Rattoni, Federico; Osorio-Gómez, Daniel",Learning & memory,https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.052720.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400528/,435

Empirical studies and epidemiological models are informative for the understanding of evolutionary processes that promote pathogen emergence, but rarely are these approaches combined in the same study. Here, we used an epidemiology model containing observations of pathogen productivity in reservoirs, as a means to predict which pathogens should be most prone to emerge in a primary host such as humans. We employed as a model system a collection of vesicular stomatitis virus populations that had previously diverged in host-use strategy: specialists, directly selected generalists and indirectly selected (fortuitous) generalists. Using data from experiments where these viral strategists were challenged to grow on unencountered novel hosts in vitro, logistic growth models determined that the directly selected generalist viruses tended to grow best on model reservoirs. Furthermore, when we used the growth data to estimate average reproductive rate across secondary reservoirs, we showed that the combined approach could be used to estimate relative success of the differing virus strategists when encountering a primary host. Our study suggests that synergistic approaches combining epidemiological modelling with empirical data from experimental evolution may be useful for developing efforts to predict which types of pathogens pose the greatest probability of emerging in the future.","Ogbunugafor, C Brandon; Basu, Sanjay; Morales, Nadya M; Turner, Paul E","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

122632,Three-fold increase in admissions for paediatric febrile convulsions during COVID-19 pandemic could indicate alternative virus symptoms.,2020-11-03,"UNLABELLED In addition to transporting ions, the multisubunit Na(+),K(+)-ATPase also functions by relaying cardiotonic steroid (CTS)-binding-induced signals into cells. In this study, we analyzed the role of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and, in particular, of its ATP1A1 α subunit during coronavirus (CoV) infection. As controls, the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza A virus (IAV) were included. Using gene silencing, the ATP1A1 protein was shown to be critical for infection of cells with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and VSV but not with IAV. Lack of ATP1A1 did not affect virus binding to host cells but resulted in inhibited entry of MHV and VSV. Consistently, nanomolar concentrations of the cardiotonic steroids ouabain and bufalin, which are known not to affect the transport function of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, inhibited infection of cells with MHV, FIPV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and VSV, but not IAV, when the compounds were present during virus inoculation. Cardiotonic steroids were shown to inhibit entry of MHV at an early stage, resulting in accumulation of virions close to the cell surface and, as a consequence, in reduced fusion. In agreement with an early block in infection, the inhibition of VSV by CTSs could be bypassed by low-pH shock. Viral RNA replication was not affected when these compounds were added after virus entry. The antiviral effect of ouabain could be relieved by the addition of different Src kinase inhibitors, indicating that Src signaling mediated via ATP1A1 plays a crucial role in the inhibition of CoV and VSV infections. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) are important pathogens of animals and humans, as demonstrated by the recent emergence of new human CoVs of zoonotic origin. Antiviral drugs targeting CoV infections are lacking. In the present study, we show that the ATP1A1 subunit of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, an ion transporter and signaling transducer, supports CoV infection. Targeting ATP1A1 either by gene silencing or by low concentrations of the ATP1A1-binding cardiotonic steroids ouabain and bufalin resulted in inhibition of infection with murine, feline, and MERS-CoVs at an early entry stage. Infection with the control virus VSV was also inhibited. Src signaling mediated by ATP1A1 was shown to play a crucial role in the inhibition of virus entry by ouabain and bufalin. These results suggest that targeting the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase using cardiotonic steroids, several of which are FDA-approved compounds, may be an attractive therapeutic approach against CoV and VSV infections.","Burkard, Christine; Verheije, Monique H; Haagmans, Bart L; van Kuppeveld, Frank J; Rottier, Peter J M; Bosch, Berend-Jan; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03274-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25653449/,435

It is unclear how much opiates should be prescribed to ensure adequate analgesia at home without overprescription. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for requiring opiates following admission for tibial fractures and to estimate opiate requirements for children being discharged directly from the emergency department (ED). METHODS All children aged 4 to 16 years admitted with closed tibial fractures being treated in a molded circumferential above-knee plaster cast between October 2015 and April 2020 were included. Case notes were reviewed to identify demographics, analgesic prescriptions, and complications. Risk factors were analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 75 children were included, of which 64% were males. The mean age was 9.5 (SD 3.4) years. Opiates were required by 36 (48%) children in the first 24 hours following admission. The median number of opiate doses in the first 48 hours was 0 (range: 0 to 5), with 93% of children receiving ≤3 doses. The odds of requiring opiates in the first 24 hours were unchanged for age above 10 years [odds ratio (OR)=0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33-2.23], male sex (OR=1.58, 95% CI: 0.59-4.19), high-energy injury (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 0.45-6.04), presence of a fibula fracture (OR=2.21, 95% CI: 0.72-6.76), or need for fracture reduction in the ED (OR=0.57, 95% CI: 0.20-1.65). No children developed compartment syndrome, and the mean length of stay was 1.4 (SD 1.2) days. No children were readmitted following discharge. CONCLUSIONS We have found no cases of compartment syndrome or extensive requirement for opiates following closed tibial fractures treated in plaster cast. These children are candidates to be discharged directly from the ED. We have not identified any specific risk factors for the targeting of opiate analgesics. We recommend a guideline prescription of 6 doses of opiates for direct discharge from the ED to ensure adequate analgesia without overprescription.

Treatment of the facial skin of volunteers in a clinical trial with an RPE-containing formulation enhanced skin brightness (L* value) significantly. The underlying mechanism responsible was determined to be associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. In addition, RPE exhibited anti-wrinkle formation activity of human dermal fibroblasts by suppressing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 level. In vivo study, RPE also inhibited solar ultraviolet-stimulated MMP-1 level by c-Jun regulation.

This type of technology relies largely on electrical stimulation to provide neuromodulation of organ function or pain. One example is sacral nerve stimulation to treat overactive bladder, urinary incontinence and interstitial cystitis (also known as bladder pain syndrome)4,6,7. Conventional, continuous stimulation protocols, however, can cause discomfort and pain, particularly when treating symptoms that can be intermittent (for example, sudden urinary urgency)8. Direct physical coupling of electrodes to the nerve can lead to injury and inflammation9-11. Furthermore, typical therapeutic stimulators target large nerve bundles that innervate multiple structures, resulting in a lack of organ specificity. Here we introduce a miniaturized bio-optoelectronic implant that avoids these limitations by using (1) an optical stimulation interface that exploits microscale inorganic light-emitting diodes to activate opsins; (2) a soft, high-precision biophysical sensor system that allows continuous measurements of organ function; and (3) a control module and data analytics approach that enables coordinated, closed-loop operation of the system to eliminate pathological behaviours as they occur in real-time. In the example reported here, a soft strain gauge yields real-time information on bladder function in a rat model.

126684,Prevalence and associated factors of alcohol use patterns among university students in Uganda.,2020,"Planning organ at risk volume (PRV) estimates have been reported as methods for sparing organs at risk (OARs) during radiation therapy, especially for hypofractioned and/or dose-escalated protocols. The objectives of this retrospective, analytical, observational study were to evaluate peri-ocular OAR shifts and derive PRVs in a sample of dogs undergoing radiation therapy for periocular tumors. Inclusion criteria were as follows: dogs irradiated for periocular tumors, with 3D-image-guidance and at least four cone-beam CTs (CBCTs) used for position verification, and positioning in a rigid bite block immobilization device. Peri-ocular OARs were contoured on each CBCT and the systematic and random error of the shifts in relation to the planning CT position computed. The formula 1.3×Σ+0.5xσ was used to generate a PRV of each OAR in the dorsoventral, mediolateral, and craniocaudal axis. A total of 30 dogs were sampled, with 450 OARs contoured, and 2145 shifts assessed. The PRV expansion was qualitatively different for each organ (1-4 mm for the dorsoventral and 1-2 mm for the mediolateral and craniocaudal axes). Maximal PRV expansion was ≤4 mm and directional for the majority; most pronounced for corneas and retinas. Findings from the current study may help improve awareness of and minimization of radiation dose in peri-ocular OARs for future canine patients. Because some OARs were difficult to visualize on CBCTs and/ or to delineate on the planning CT, authors recommend that PRV estimates be institution-specific and applied with caution.","Wolf, Friederike; Rohrer Bley, Carla; Besserer, Jürgen; Meier, Valeria",Veterinary radiology & ultrasound : the official journal of the American College of Veterinary Radiology and the International Veterinary Radiology Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/vru.12955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33460237/,435
126733,Anesthesia Considerations and Infection Precautions for Trauma and Acute Care Cases During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Recommendations From a Task Force of the Chinese Society of Anesthesiology.,2020-08-01,"The distributions of most infectious agents causing disease in humans are poorly resolved or unknown. However, poorly known and unknown agents contribute to the global burden of disease and will underlie many future disease risks. Existing patterns of infectious disease co-occurrence could thus play a critical role in resolving or anticipating current and future disease threats. We analyzed the global occurrence patterns of 187 human infectious diseases across 225 countries and seven epidemiological classes (human-specific, zoonotic, vector-borne, non-vector-borne, bacterial, viral, and parasitic) to show that human infectious diseases exhibit distinct spatial grouping patterns at a global scale. We demonstrate, using outbreaks of Ebola virus as a test case, that this spatial structuring provides an untapped source of prior information that could be used to tighten the focus of a range of health-related research and management activities at early stages or in data-poor settings, including disease surveillance, outbreak responses, or optimizing pathogen discovery. In examining the correlates of these spatial patterns, among a range of geographic, epidemiological, environmental, and social factors, mammalian biodiversity was the strongest predictor of infectious disease co-occurrence overall and for six of the seven disease classes examined, giving rise to a striking congruence between global pathogeographic and ""Wallacean"" zoogeographic patterns. This clear biogeographic signal suggests that infectious disease assemblages remain fundamentally constrained in their distributions by ecological barriers to dispersal or establishment, despite the homogenizing forces of globalization. Pathogeography thus provides an overarching context in which other factors promoting infectious disease emergence and spread are set.","Murray, Kris A; Preston, Nicholas; Allen, Toph; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Hosseini, Parviez R; Daszak, Peter",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1507442112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26417098/,435

130037,Patient-Reported Experiences After Hysterectomy: A Cross-Sectional Study of the Views of Over 2300 Women.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES This study was designed to derive and validate a score to predict early ischemic events and major bleedings after an acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. METHODS The derivation cohort consisted of 854 patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation included in prospective series between January 2012 and March 2014. Older age (hazard ratio 1.06 for each additional year; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.11) and severe atrial enlargement (hazard ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.87) were predictors for ischemic outcome events (stroke, transient ischemic attack, and systemic embolism) at 90 days from acute stroke. Small lesions (≤1.5 cm) were inversely correlated with both major bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.39; P=0.03) and ischemic outcome events (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-1.00). We assigned to age ≥80 years 2 points and between 70 and 79 years 1 point; ischemic index lesion >1.5 cm, 1 point; severe atrial enlargement, 1 point (ALESSA score). A logistic regression with the receiver-operating characteristic graph procedure (C statistic) showed an area under the curve of 0.697 (0.632-0.763; P=0.0001) for ischemic outcome events and 0.585 (0.493-0.678; P=0.10) for major bleedings. RESULTS The validation cohort consisted of 994 patients included in prospective series between April 2014 and June 2016. Logistic regression with the receiver-operating characteristic graph procedure showed an area under the curve of 0.646 (0.529-0.763; P=0.009) for ischemic outcome events and 0.407 (0.275-0.540; P=0.14) for hemorrhagic outcome events. CONCLUSIONS In acute stroke patients with atrial fibrillation, high ALESSA scores were associated with a high risk of ischemic events but not of major bleedings.","Paciaroni, Maurizio; Agnelli, Giancarlo; Caso, Valeria; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Furie, Karen L; Tadi, Prasanna; Becattini, Cecilia; Falocci, Nicola; Zedde, Marialuisa; Abdul-Rahim, Azmil H; Lees, Kennedy R; Alberti, Andrea; Venti, Michele; Acciarresi, Monica; D'Amore, Cataldo; Mosconi, Maria Giulia; Cimini, Ludovica Anna; Procopio, Antonio; Bovi, Paolo; Carletti, Monica; Rigatelli, Alberto; Cappellari, Manuel; Putaala, Jukka; Tomppo, Liisa; Tatlisumak, Turgut; Bandini, Fabio; Marcheselli, Simona; Pezzini, Alessandro; Poli, Loris; Padovani, Alessandro; Masotti, Luca; Vannucchi, Vieri; Sohn, Sung-Il; Lorenzini, Gianni; Tassi, Rossana; Guideri, Francesca; Acampa, Maurizio; Martini, Giuseppe; Ntaios, George; Karagkiozi, Efstathia; Athanasakis, George; Makaritsis, Kostantinos; Vadikolias, Kostantinos; Liantinioti, Chrysoula; Chondrogianni, Maria; Mumoli, Nicola; Consoli, Domenico; Galati, Franco; Sacco, Simona; Carolei, Antonio; Tiseo, Cindy; Corea, Francesco; Ageno, Walter; Bellesini, Marta; Colombo, Giovanna; Silvestrelli, Giorgio; Ciccone, Alfonso; Scoditti, Umberto; Denti, Licia; Mancuso, Michelangelo; Maccarrone, Miriam; Orlandi, Giovanni; Giannini, Nicola; Gialdini, Gino; Tassinari, Tiziana; De Lodovici, Maria Luisa; Bono, Giorgio; Rueckert, Christina; Baldi, Antonio; D'Anna, Sebastiano; Toni, Danilo; Letteri, Federica; Giuntini, Martina; Lotti, Enrico Maria; Flomin, Yuriy; Pieroni, Alessio; Kargiotis, Odysseas; Karapanayiotides, Theodore; Monaco, Serena; Baronello, Mario Maimone; Csiba, Laszló; Szabó, Lilla; Chiti, Alberto; Giorli, Elisa; Del Sette, Massimo; Imberti, Davide; Zabzuni, Dorjan; Doronin, Boris; Volodina, Vera; Michel, Patrik; Vanacker, Peter; Barlinn, Kristian; Pallesen, Lars-Peder; Kepplinger, Jessica; Bodechtel, Ulf; Gerber, Johannes; Deleu, Dirk; Melikyan, Gayane; Ibrahim, Faisal; Akhtar, Naveed; Gourbali, Vanessa; Yaghi, Shadi",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.015770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28183856/,435
131290,"Postpartum depression and anxiety: a community-based study on risk factors before, during and after pregnancy.",2021-03-04,"Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale. Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization, aided by TMPRSS2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVDI-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced ACE2 down regulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heightened angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyper stimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation, and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as the elderly and those with CV risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multi-organ failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, particularly in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as IL-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome and thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated. To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history.","Liu, Peter P; Blet, Alice; Smyth, David; Li, Hongliang",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.047549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32293910/,435

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive, experimental study. ANIMALS Healthy, adult horses (n = 6). METHODS Laparoscopic portals to approach the EF were identified in standing horses. Under laparoscopic observation, the gastropancreatic fold and right lobe of the pancreas were grasped with Babcock forceps and secured to the caudate hepatic lobe using helical titanium coils to obliterate the EF. Surgical procedure time and intra- and postoperative complications were recorded. Serial analysis of select serum enzymes was used as an indication of involvement of the pancreas and liver. Closure was reevaluated at 4 weeks using repeat laparoscopy, and necropsy was performed immediately after. RESULTS At initial surgery, EF closure was successful in all 6 horses; median surgical time was 40.5 minutes (range, 22-110 minutes). Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) were not significantly altered by the surgical procedure; however, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and amylase (AMY) were transiently increased. At repeat laparoscopic reevaluation, closure was complete in 5 horses, with partial closure of the EF observed in 1 horse. No complications related to the procedure were noted during or after surgery in any horse. CONCLUSIONS EF closure in the standing horse can be accomplished without complications to the surrounding organs and vessels.","Munsterman, Amelia S; Hanson, Russell Reid; Cattley, Russell C; Barrett, Elizabeth J; Albanese, Valeria",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2013.12116.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491232/,435

132322,Exploring Patterns of Disturbed Eating in Psychosis: A Scoping Review.,2020-12-18,"PURPOSE Although evidence from observational studies in a variety of clinical settings supports the utility of cerebral oximetry as a predictor of outcomes, prospective clinical trials thus far have reported conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the influence of management associated with intraoperative cerebral oximetry on postoperative outcomes. The primary outcome was postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), with secondary outcomes that included postoperative delirium, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital length of stay (LOS). SOURCE After searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the impact of intraoperative cerebral oximetry-guided management on clinical outcomes following surgery were identified. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Fifteen RCTs comprising 2,057 patients (1,018 in the intervention group and 1,039 in control group) were included. Intraoperative management guided by the use of cerebral oximetry was associated with a reduction in the incidence of POCD (risk ratio [RR] 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 0.90; P = 0.02; I2 = 85%) and a significantly shorter length of ICU stay (standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.21 hr; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.05; P = 0.009; I2 = 48%). In addition, overall hospital LOS (SMD, -0.06 days; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.06; P = 0.29; I2 = 0%) and incidence of postoperative delirium (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.32; P = 0.27; I2 = 0%) were not impacted by the use of intraoperative cerebral oximetry. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative cerebral oximetry appears to be associated with a reduction in POCD, although this result should be interpreted with caution given the significant heterogeneity in the studies examined. Further large (ideally multicentre) RCTs are needed to clarify whether POCD can be favourably impacted by the use of cerebral oximetry-guided management.","Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Healy, Ryan; Grant, Michael C; Joshi, Brijen; Rivera-Lara, Lucia; Brown, Charles; Mirski, Marek A",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-018-1065-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427259/,435

133164,Supporting our Fellows and Members through COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"A systematic investigation of the factors affecting the suture retention test is performed. The specimen width w and the distance a of the suture bite from the specimen free edge emerge as the most influential geometrical parameters. A conservative approach for the quantification of suture retention strength is identified, based on the use of a camera to monitor the incipient failure and detect the instant of earliest crack propagation. The corresponding critical force, called break starting strength, is extremely robust against test parameter variations and its dependence on the specimen geometry becomes negligible when a≥ 2mm and w≥ 10mm. Comparison of suture retention and mode I crack opening tests reveals a linear correlation between break starting strength and tearing energy. This suggests that the defect created by the needle and the load applied by the suture thread lead to a fracture mechanics problem, which dominates the initiation of failure.","Pensalfini, M; Meneghello, S; Lintas, V; Bircher, K; Ehret, A E; Mazza, E",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.08.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28867371/,435

Compound 1 has an activating methylene group, so it was directed toward some specific reactions. Thus, aryldiazonium chlorides reacted with compound 1 affording hydrazono derivatives 2a-c. Also, aromatic aldehydes reacted with compound 1 to produce compounds 3a,b. Furthermore, cyclic ketones were subjected to the synthesis of fused thiophene derivatives 4a,b via reaction with compound 1 in the presence of elemental sulfur. In addition, 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivative 1, when reacted with isothiocyanates, salicylaldehyde or 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, formed thiazole derivatives 5a,b, coumarin derivative 6 and alkenyl derivatives 7a,b resp. Compound 7b underwent cyclization to afford pyridine derivative 8. Arylhydrazono derivatives 9a,b were produced through the reaction of compound 7a with aryldiazonium chlorides. Products 9a,b underwent cyclization to produce pyridazine derivatives 10a,b. Finally, 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivative 1 was directed toward reaction with hydrazine derivatives, bromoacetophenone and ethylchloroacetate affording compounds 11a,b, 12 and 13, resp.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort study of 628 patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer who underwent up-front TORS from 2007 to 2017. Patients were stratified into two cohorts based on early-stage (cT1/2) versus locally-advanced (cT3/4) tumor at presentation. RESULTS We identified 589 patients who presented with early-stage tumors, and 39 patients with locally-advanced tumors. Of these, 73% of patients required adjuvant radiation, and 33% required adjuvant chemoradiation. There was no significant difference in the administration of adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation between the two cohorts. Patients in the locally-advanced disease cohort were significantly more likely to have Stage II/III disease by clinical and pathologic criteria by American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition criteria (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in 5-year overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) based on Kaplan-Meier survival estimates between the two cohorts (p = 0.75, 0.6, respectively), with estimated OS of 91% at 5 years, and estimated RFS of 86% at 5 years across the study population. CONCLUSIONS Up-front TORS offers favorable survival outcomes for appropriately selected locally-advanced cases of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer. Furthermore, up-front TORS is comparably effective in allowing avoidance of adjuvant therapy, particularly chemotherapy, in both cT1/T2 and locally-advanced HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. In the absence of clear technical contraindication to surgery, cT3/T4 classification should not be considered an absolute contraindication to surgery.","Yver, Christina M; Shimunov, David; Weinstein, Gregory S; Rajasekaran, Karthik; Cannady, Steven B; Lukens, John N; Lin, Alexander; Swisher-McClure, Samuel; Cohen, Roger B; Aggarwal, Charu; Bauml, Joshua M; Loevner, Laurie A; Newman, Jason G; Chalian, Ara A; Rassekh, Christopher H; Basu, Devraj; O'Malley, Bert W; Brody, Robert M",Oral oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932874/,435

The concentrations of NaCl for complete inhibition of Fe2+ oxidation by cells initially grown with ferrous iron sulfate, or tetrathionate, or pyrite as energy sources were 525 mM, 725 mM, and 800 mM, respectively. Noticeably, regardless of NaCl concentrations, oxygen consumption rates of S. thermosulfidooxidans with 20 mM tetrathionate were higher than with 50 mM FeSO4. NaCl concentrations of higher than 400 mM strongly inhibited the iron respiration of S. thermosulfidooxidans. In contrast, the presence of NaCl was shown to stimulate tetrathionate oxidation. This trend was especially pronounced in NaCl-adapted cells where respiration rates at 200 mM NaCl were threefold of those in the absence of NaCl. In NaCl-adapted cultures greater respiration rates for tetrathionate were observed than in non-NaCl-adapted cultures, especially at concentrations ≥ 200 mM NaCl. At concentrations of ≤ 200 mM NaCl, cell growth and iron oxidation were enhanced with the addition of increasing concentrations of yeast extract. Thus, cell numbers in cultures with 0.05% yeast extract were ∼ 5 times higher than without yeast extract addition. At NaCl concentration as high as 400 mM, however, iron oxidation rates improved compared to control assays without yeast extract, but there was no clear dependence on yeast extract concentrations. The initial growth of bacteria with and without yeast extract in the presence of different NaCl concentrations was shown to impact leaching of copper from chalcopyrite. Copper dissolution was enhanced in the presence of 200 mM NaCl and absence of yeast extract, while the addition of 0.02 % yeast extract was shown to promote copper solubilization in the presence of 500 mM NaCl.","Huynh, Dieu; Kaschabek, Stefan R; Schlömann, Michael",Research in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resmic.2020.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916217/,435

The profile of patients experiencing ischemic stroke was different from the other patients with abnormal brain imaging since the former had less frequently acute respiratory distress syndrome (p=0·006) and more frequently corticospinal tract signs (p=0·02). Patients with encephalitis were younger (p=0·007), whereas agitation was more frequent for patients with leptomeningeal enhancement (p=0·009). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients may develop a wide range of neurological symptoms, which can be associated with severe and fatal complications, such as ischemic stroke or encephalitis. Concerning the meningoencephalitis involvement, even if a direct effect of the virus cannot be excluded, the pathophysiology rather seems to involve an immune and/or inflammatory process given the presence of signs of inflammation in both cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging but the lack of virus in cerebrospinal fluid.","Kremer, Stéphane; Lersy, François; Anheim, Mathieu; Merdji, Hamid; Schenck, Maleka; Oesterlé, Hélène; Bolognini, Federico; Messie, Julien; Henri-Feugeas, Marie-Cécile; Khalil, Antoine; Gaudemer, Augustin; Carré, Sophie; Alleg, Manel; Lecocq, Claire; Schmitt, Emmanuelle; Anxionnat, René; Zhu, François; Jager, Lavinia; Nesser, Patrick; Mba, Yannick Talla; Hmeydia, Ghazi; Benzakoun, Joseph; Oppenheim, Catherine; Ferré, Jean-Christophe; Maamar, Adel; Carsin-Nicol, Béatrice; Comby, Pierre-Olivier; Ricolfi, Frédéric; Thouant, Pierre; Boutet, Claire; Fabre, Xavier; Forestier, Géraud; de Beaurepaire, Isaure; Bornet, Grégoire; Desal, Hubert; Boulouis, Grégoire; Berge, Jérome; Kazémi, Apolline; Pyatigorskaya, Nadya; Lecler, Augustin; Saleme, Suzana; Edjlali-Goujon, Myriam; Kerleroux, Basile; Constans, Jean Marc; Zorn, Pierre-Emmanuel; Mathieu, Muriel; Baloglu, Seyyid; Ardellier, François-Daniel; Willaume, Thibault; Brisset, Jean Christophe; Caillard, Sophie; Collange, Olivier; Mertes, Michel; Schneider, Francis; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Ohana, Mickael; Meziani, Ferhat; Meyer, Nicolas; Helms, Julie; Cotton, François",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680942/,435

Methods: The study included COPD with and without sarcopenia, of both sexes who were over 50 years old. Participants were assessed for lung function, body composition, grip strength, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), 5-repetition, 10-repetition and 30-seconds sit-to-stand tests (5STS, 10STS and 30STS, respectively). In addition, six-minute walking test, respiratory muscular strength, and physical activity level were tested. Results: The study had 35 participants, 24 men (68.6%) and moderate COPD (51.4 %). COPD-sarcopenia showed lower values in lean mass, body fat and body mass alongside lower performance in 10 and 30 STS tests, SPPB and gait speed compared to non-sarcopenic group. The cut-off points with better sensitivity and specificity to identify sarcopenia were 10.88 and 34.14 seconds, 15 repetitions and 10 points in the 5STS, 10STS, 30STS and SPPB, respectively. The comparison of the receiver operating curves evidenced no differences between the functional tests. Only 30STS and SPPB showed acceptable discriminatory power. Conclusion: Functional tests, especially 30STS and SPPB, are simple and affordable tools for screening sarcopenia in COPD with moderate obstruction.","Lage, Vanessa Kelly da Silva; Silva, Guilherme Pinto da; Lacerda, Ana Cristina Rodrigues; Paula, Fabiana Angélica de; Lima, Liliana Pereira; Santos, Joyce Noelly Vítor; Almeida, Hellen Cristina de; Pinto, Anna Gabrielle Fernandes; Figueiredo, Pedro Henrique Scheidt; Costa, Henrique Silveira; Bernardo-Filho, Mario; Sá-Caputo, Danúbia da Cunha de; Taiar, Redha; Leite, Hércules Ribeiro; Teixeira, Antônio Lúcio; Mendonça, Vanessa Amaral",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1850276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197358/,435

We found that RVFV was restricted by IFITM-2 and -3 but not by IFITM-1, whereas the remaining viruses were equally restricted by all IFITMs. Indeed, at low doses of alpha interferon (IFN-α), IFITM-2 and -3 mediated more than half of the antiviral activity of IFN-α against RVFV. IFITM-2 and -3 restricted RVFV infection mostly by preventing virus membrane fusion with endosomes, while they had no effect on virion attachment to cells, endocytosis, or viral replication kinetics. We found that large fractions of IFITM-2 and IFITM-3 occupy vesicular compartments that are distinct from the vesicles coated by IFITM-1. In addition, although overexpression of all IFITMs expanded vesicular and acidified compartments within cells, there were marked phenotypic differences among the vesicular compartments occupied by IFITMs. Collectively, our data provide new insights into the possible mechanisms by which the IFITM family members restrict distinct viruses.","Mudhasani, Rajini; Tran, Julie P; Retterer, Cary; Radoshitzky, Sheli R; Kota, Krishna P; Altamura, Louis A; Smith, Jeffrey M; Packard, Beverly Z; Kuhn, Jens H; Costantino, Julie; Garrison, Aura R; Schmaljohn, Connie S; Huang, I-Chueh; Farzan, Michael; Bavari, Sina",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03382-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23720721/,435

The main difficulties in achieving progress are related to the incapacity to deliver drugs in therapeutic amounts into the central nervous system and the associated severe side effects. Indeed, to obtain effective treatments, the drugs should be able to cross the intended biological barriers and not being inactivated before reaching the specific therapeutic target. To overcome these challenges the development of synthetic nanocarriers has been widely explored for brain tumor treatment but unfortunately with no clinical translation until date. The use of cell-derived nanocarriers or biomimetic nanocarriers has been studied in the last few years, considering their innate bio-interfacing properties. The ability to carry therapeutic agents and a higher selectivity towards brain tumors would bring new hope for the development of safe and effective treatments. In this review, we explore the biological barriers that need to be crossed for effective delivery in brain tumors, and the types and properties of cell-based nanocarriers (extracellular vesicles and cell-membrane coated nanocarriers) currently under investigation.","Mendanha, D; Vieira de Castro, J; Ferreira, H; Neves, N M",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.07.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352316/,435

We analyzed trends in chromosome number, genome size, and leaf traits for the woody angiosperm clade Viburnum to examine the evolutionary associations, functional implications, and possible drivers of genome size. METHODS Chromosome counts and genome size estimates were mapped onto a Viburnum phylogeny to infer the location and frequency of polyploidization events and trends in genome size evolution. Genome size was analyzed with leaf anatomical and physiological data to evaluate the influence of genome size on plant function. RESULTS We discovered nine independent polyploidization events, two reductions in base chromosome number, and substantial variation in genome size with a slight trend toward genome size reduction in polyploids. We did not find strong relationships between genome size and the functional and morphological traits that have been highlighted at broader phylogenetic scales. CONCLUSIONS Polyploidization events were sometimes associated with rapid radiations, demonstrating that polyploid lineages can be highly successful. Relationships between genome size and plant physiological function observed at broad phylogenetic scales may be largely irrelevant to the evolutionary dynamics of genome size at smaller scales. The view that plants readily tolerate changes in ploidy and genome size, and often do so, appears to apply to Viburnum.","Moeglein, Morgan K; Chatelet, David S; Donoghue, Michael J; Edwards, Erika J",American journal of botany,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079383/,435

After safely performing transvaginal cholecystectomy in an IACUC-approved porcine model, the authors embarked on an institution review board (IRB)-approved protocol for ultimate performance of pure NOTES cholecystectomy in humans. They describe their experience performing a true NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy after safely accomplishing three laparoscopically assisted or hybrid procedures in humans. One of the patients was a 35-year-old woman presenting with symptoms of biliary colic. Ultrasound confirmed gallstones, and her liver enzymes were normal. Pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg was obtained via a transvaginal trocar placed through a colpotomy made under direct vision. A double-channel endoscope then was advanced into the abdomen. To overcome the retracting limitations of currently available endoscopes, the authors used an extra-long 5-mm articulating retractor placed into the abdomen via a separate colpotomy made under direct vision using the flexible endoscope in a retroflexed position. Endoscopically placed clips were used for control of both the cystic duct and the artery. These techniques obviated the need for any transabdominally placed instruments or needles. This patient was the first to undergo a completely NOTES cholecystectomy at the authors' institution, and to their knowledge, in the United States. She was discharged on the day of surgery and at this writing has not experienced any complication after 1 month of follow-up evaluation. Performance of NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy without aid of laparoscopic or needleoscopic instruments is feasible and safe for humans. Additional experience with this technique are required before studies comparing it with standard laparoscopy and hybrid techniques are appropriate.","Bessler, Marc; Gumbs, Andrew A; Milone, Luca; Evanko, John C; Stevens, Peter; Fowler, Dennis",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-0918-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20177936/,435

During daily fluctuations, no change in oxygen consumption in the short-term, but a significant increase in the long-term during hyperthermia conditions was registered, whereas a significant decrease during hypoxia was observed during all the bioassay. On the other hand, HSP70 and HSP90 gene expression increased in gills under thermal stress but was down-regulated under hypoxia, in both the short- and the long-term.

142353,Covid-19: risks to healthcare workers and their families.,2020-10-28,"Patients with major mental illness are at high risk of relapse if they discontinue acute or continuation phase pharmacotherapy. This may explain the high rates of relapse after the termination of an effective course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or after the discontinuation of effective maintenance ECT (M-ECT). Two moderately large studies prospectively examined predictors of relapse in the context of ECT. The first study, conducted in 61 depressed patients who had remitted with ECT and who were maintained on individualized pharmacotherapy, found that 39% of the patients relapsed within a year, with most of the relapses occurring during the first 6 months. Older age and the presence of psychotic symptoms before ECT predicted a lower risk of relapse, and a bipolar II diagnosis and a larger number of previous depressive episodes predicted a higher risk of relapse. Lithium appeared to protect against relapse. The second study, conducted in 81 patients with different diagnoses, found that 44% of patients relapsed within 6 months of the abrupt, unplanned discontinuation of M-ECT; the median time to relapse was 8 weeks. Predictors of relapse were psychosis, receipt of a larger number of previous courses of ECT, and need for more frequent M-ECT. The methods and results of these studies are critically examined. Special mention is made of overfitting and confounding in data analysis in follow-up studies such as these. Overfitting happens when investigators use more predictor variables in their statistical model than the sample size allows for; overfitting results in overly optimistic models. Confounding happens when the statistical model excludes important explanatory variables, including variables such as the appropriateness and adequacy of maintenance pharmacotherapy, adherence to maintenance pharmacotherapy, the stress-support dimension, and interactions between important explanatory variables.","Andrade, Chittaranjan",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.21f14174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383392/,435

While eucarids' incursion onto land consists of mainly freshwater and littoral grounds, some peracarids have evolved fully terrestrial ground-crawling ecologies, inhabiting even our gardens in temperate regions (e.g. pillbugs and sowbugs). Their fossil record extends back to the Carboniferous and consists mainly of marine occurrences. Here, we provide a complete re-analysis of a fossil arthropod-Oxyuropoda-reported in 1908 from the Late Devonian floodplains of Ireland, and left with unresolved systematic affinities despite a century of attempts at identification. Known from a single specimen preserved in two dimensions, we analysed its anatomy using digital microscopy and multispectral macroimaging to enhance the contrast of morphological structures. The new anatomical characters and completeness of Oxyuropoda, together with a phylogenetic analysis with representatives of all major Eumalacostraca groups, indicate that Oxyuropoda is a crown peracarid, part of a clade including amphipods and isopods. As such, Oxyuropoda is the oldest known species Peracarida, and provides evidence that derived peracarids had an incursion into freshwater and terrestrial environments as early as the Famennian, more than 360 Ma.","Robin, N; Gueriau, P; Luque, J; Jarvis, D; Daley, A C; Vonk, R",Biology letters,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129798/,435

142879,Overdose-Related Cardiac Arrests Observed by Emergency Medical Services During the US COVID-19 Epidemic.,2020-12-03,"INTRODUCTION Residential fires account for the majority of burn-related injuries and fatalities. Established risk factors for burn injury include male gender, racial minority, children and elderly individuals, poverty, and substandard housing characteristics. In North Carolina, the rate of residential fire injuries and deaths is higher than the national average. Therefore, we sought to describe residential fire hospitalizations at a large regional burn center and describe the neighborhoods in which they live. We hypothesized that patients living in areas with higher Area Deprivation Index (ADI) are more likely to have major residential burns. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of burn admissions from January 2002 to December 2015. We dichotomized patients into two cohorts: residential and non-residential burns and performed a bivariate analysis. Multivariate Poisson regression models were utilized to determine if ADI was associated with inhalation injury and ≥20% total body surface area burn. RESULTS Of the 10,506 patients presented during the study period. Of these, 10,016 (95.3%) patients resided in North Carolina, and 7894 (78.8%) had a residential burn. Of the overall cohort, 6.0% (n=458) of patients had ≥20% TBSA burns and 6.4% (n=506) had inhalation injury. The majority of patients were in the highest (most disadvantaged) ADI quartile (n=3050, 39.5%), and only 6.8% of patients (n=525) were in the lowest (least disadvantaged) ADI quartile. In the Poisson multivariate regressions to determine if the ADI was associated with severe burns, patients in the highest ADI quartile had an increased relative risk of ≥20% TBSA burn (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.02-1.68) and inhalation injury (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09-1.76) when compared to patients in the second-lowest ADI quartile when controlled for pertinent covariates. CONCLUSION Residential structure fires represent the major source of burns and fatalities. People who reside in the highest ADI quartile are more like to present with higher burn injury severity in terms of burn size and the presence of inhalation injury. The use of the ADI to target neighborhoods for burn prevention is imperative.","Purcell, Laura N; Bartley, Coleen; Purcell, Michael E; Cairns, Bruce A; King, Booker T; Charles, Anthony",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.burns.2020.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830002/,435
143033,"Editorial Appointments, JTT Statistics and Acknowledgements.",2021-04-01,"PURPOSE Children should attend well child visits (WCVs) during early childhood so that developmental disorders may be identified as early as possible, so treatment can begin. The aim of this research was to determine if rurality impacts access to WCV during early childhood, and if altering rurality measurement methods impacts outcomes. DESIGN AND METHODS We utilized a longitudinal correlational design with early childhood data gathered from the Virginia All Payer Claims Database, which contains claims data from Medicaid and the majority of Virginia commercial insurance payers (n = 6349). WCV attendance was evaluated against three rurality metrics: a traditional metric using Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes, a developed land variable, and a distance to care variable, at a zip code level. RESULTS Two of the rurality methods revealed that rural children attend fewer WCVs than their urban counterparts, (67% vs. 50% respectively, using a traditional metric; and a 0.035 increase in WCV attendance for every percent increase in developed land). Differences were attenuated by insurance payer; children with Medicaid attend fewer WCVs than those with private insurance. CONCLUSIONS Young children in rural Virginia attend fewer WCVs than their non-rural counterparts, placing them at higher risk for missing timely developmental disorder screenings. The coronavirus disease pandemic has been associated with an abrupt and significant reduction in vaccination rates, which likely indicates fewer WCVs and concomitant developmental screenings. Pediatric nurses should encourage families of young children to develop a plan for continued WCVs, so that early identification of developmental disorders can be achieved.","DeGuzman, Pamela B; Huang, Guoping; Lyons, Genevieve; Snitzer, Joseph; Keim-Malpass, Jessica",Journal of pediatric nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2020.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370620/,435

In this paper, we will conduct a phenomenological argument that proposes both phenomena can be explained by Paul Ricoeur's courses of recognition. In cases of violence, patients and their family members reacting because they feel betrayed for a real or alleged injustice-primarily not to be listened to by health professionals. Nurses and other professionals are often unable to take the right grade of involvement for understanding patient's needs.

143344,Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the fracture demographics: Data from a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.,2020-07-01,"OBJECTIVES To describe patient characteristics, clinical manifestations, disease course including viral replication patterns, and outcomes of critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory infection from the Middle East respiratory syndrome and to compare these features with patients with severe acute respiratory infection due to other etiologies. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Patients admitted to ICUs in 14 Saudi Arabian hospitals. PATIENTS Critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (n = 330) admitted between September 2012 and October 2015 were compared to consecutive critically ill patients with community-acquired severe acute respiratory infection of non-Middle East respiratory syndrome etiology (non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection) (n = 222). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Although Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection patients were younger than those with non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (median [quartile 1, quartile 3] 58 yr [44, 69] vs 70 [52, 78]; p < 0.001), clinical presentations and comorbidities overlapped substantially. Patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection had more severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (PaO2/FIO2: 106 [66, 160] vs 176 [104, 252]; p < 0.001) and more frequent nonrespiratory organ failure (nonrespiratory Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score: 6 [4, 9] vs 5 [3, 7]; p = 0.002), thus required more frequently invasive mechanical ventilation (85.2% vs 73.0%; p < 0.001), oxygen rescue therapies (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 5.8% vs 0.9%; p = 0.003), vasopressor support (79.4% vs 55.0%; p < 0.001), and renal replacement therapy (48.8% vs 22.1%; p < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, Middle East respiratory syndrome was independently associated with death compared to non-Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection (adjusted odds ratio, 5.87; 95% CI, 4.02-8.56; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Substantial overlap exists in the clinical presentation and comorbidities among patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory infection from other etiologies; therefore, a high index of suspicion combined with diagnostic testing is essential component of severe acute respiratory infection investigation for at-risk patients. The lack of distinguishing clinical features, the need to rely on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from respiratory samples, variability in viral shedding duration, lack of effective therapy, and high mortality represent substantial clinical challenges and help guide ongoing clinical research efforts.","Arabi, Yaseen M; Al-Omari, Awad; Mandourah, Yasser; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Sindi, Anees A; Alraddadi, Basem; Shalhoub, Sarah; Almotairi, Abdullah; Al Khatib, Kasim; Abdulmomen, Ahmed; Qushmaq, Ismael; Mady, Ahmed; Solaiman, Othman; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M; Al-Raddadi, Rajaa; Ragab, Ahmed; Al Mekhlafi, Ghaleb A; Al Harthy, Abdulrahman; Kharaba, Ayman; Ahmadi, Mashael Al; Sadat, Musharaf; Mutairi, Hanan Al; Qasim, Eman Al; Jose, Jesna; Nasim, Maliha; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Merson, Laura; Fowler, Robert; Hayden, Frederick G; Balkhy, Hanan H",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000002621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28953042/,435

143755,Effects of COVID-19 pandemic curfew on orthopedic trauma in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Volume coils were developed to improve occlusion rates of intracranial aneurysms. Previous studies have shown increased packing density and comparable occlusion rates, but subgroup analyses of aneurysm size have not been carried out. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Penumbra Coil 400 (PC400) system in treating intracranial aneurysms compared with standard diameter coils. METHODS A monocentric retrospective case review of 260 aneurysms in 233 patients was carried out. In 37 aneurysms the PC400 system was used, while 223 aneurysms were treated with conventional coils. Previously treated aneurysms and aneurysms treated with flow diverters were excluded. Aneurysm and procedure characteristics, packing density, postprocedural and follow-up occlusion grades as well as coil compaction were evaluated. RESULTS Aneurysms treated with PC400 coils had higher volume (218.9 vs 47.1 mm(3), p<0.001), wider necks (3.0 vs 2.5 mm, p=0.005), and greater dome/neck ratio (2.0 vs 1.6, p=0.001) in comparison with aneurysms treated with conventional coils. Compared with controls, in the PC400 group we achieved higher packing densities (43.2% vs 34.4%, p<0.001; in aneurysms ≥7 mm 42.2% vs 27.8%, p<0.001). On follow-up angiography we observed less coil compaction (23.8% vs 64.3%, p=0.003) and less aneurysm recurrence (14.3% vs 40.5%, p=0.046) in aneurysms ≥7 mm when using the PC400 system. CONCLUSIONS Use of the PC400 system as opposed to conventional coils suggests that the PC400 system is safe and effective in treating intracranial aneurysms. Despite having been applied in a potentially more difficult-to-treat group, the use of PC400 was associated with less coil compaction and aneurysm recurrence in aneurysms ≥7 mm.","Kaesmacher, Johannes; Müller-Leisse, Christina; Huber, Thomas; Boeckh-Behrens, Tobias; Haller, Bernhard; Shiban, Ehab; Friedrich, Benjamin; Zimmer, Claus; Dorn, Franziska; Prothmann, Sascha",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491040/,435

145075,[Preparing For the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Perspective of a Department of Anesthesiology in a Tertiary Hospital in Portugal].,2020-07-21,"Semi-arid regions often face severe drought events that reduce agricultural and livestock production. In recent years, some international studies have used multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approaches combined with geographic information systems (GIS-MCDA) to support decision-makers in assessing the suitability of agricultural land for irrigation in semi-arid regions. Unlike previous studies, which have only considered a single source of water for crop irrigation, this study proposes a GIS-MCDA approach that considers all potentially available local water sources (e.g., groundwater, surface water, and wastewater) as possible alternatives for better multisource water resource management (MWRM) in regions facing water shortages. The geospatial multicriteria evaluation implemented in this study considers a series of technical, environmental, and agricultural productivity criteria using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Three independent baseline maps were generated, showing the spatial distribution of suitable areas for crop irrigation for each considered water source in the studied area. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater offered suitable crop irrigation for 83%, 70%, and 26% of the study area, respectively. Overlapping these areas produced a final map showing all the feasible areas for each crop irrigation alternative at the same time. The MWRM approach considering all water sources increased the coverage of suitable areas to be irrigated in the study area by 2.2%, 20.4%, and more than 225% compared to considering surface water, groundwater, and wastewater, respectively, independently. The GIS-MCDA framework proposed in this study provides better support for decision-makers and stakeholders, favouring a reduction in possible conflicts over water scarcity, the diversification of irrigated crops, and an improvement in the quality-quantitative management of water resources in semi-arid regions.","da S Alves, Suênio Anderson F; Coelho, Victor Hugo R; Tsuyuguchi, Bárbara Barbosa; de O Galvão, Carlos; Rêgo, Janiro C; Almeida, Cristiano das N; Abels, Anna; Pinnekamp, Johannes; Rufino, Iana A A",Journal of environmental management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34351300/,435

By following this protocol, a functional experimental rig for automated whole-cell patch clamping can be set up in 1 week. High-quality surgical preparation of mice takes ∼1 h, and each autopatching experiment can be carried out over periods lasting several hours.

DESIGN Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study. SETTING Single-center. SUBJECTS Nondependent recreational opioid users. INTERVENTIONS Orally administered crushed MSN (120-mg morphine sulfate and 4.8-mg naltrexone hydrochloride), crushed 120-mg morphine sulfate CR, and placebo. OUTCOME MEASURES Subjective ratings (100-point visual analog scales) of positive drug effects (drug liking, high, good effects, take drug again, and overall drug liking), any effects, and negative effects (bad effects, feel sick, nausea, sleepy, and dizzy), along with pupillometry, pharmacokinetic (PK), and safety assessments. RESULTS Crushed morphine sulfate CR significantly increased ratings of all positive subjective measures relative to placebo (P < 0.0001). Crushed MSN significantly decreased all positive subjective ratings compared with morphine sulfate CR (P ≤ 0.005), but significantly increased ratings compared with placebo (P < 0.03). Peak pupil diameter was significantly larger for MSN than morphine sulfate (P < 0.0001). PK analysis of morphine plasma concentrations indicated that Cmax was significantly lower and tmax significantly longer for crushed MSN compared with crushed morphine sulfate CR. Plasma concentrations of naltrexone and 6-β-naltrexol were present following crushed MSN. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that when crushed and administered orally to nondependent recreational opioid users, MSN was associated with significantly lower scores on all positive subjective measures including drug liking and high, and significantly less pupil constriction compared with crushed morphine sulfate CR.","Setnik, Beatrice; Sommerville, Kenneth; Goli, Veeraindar; Han, Ling; Webster, Lynn",Pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/pme.12148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23745947/,435

147183,Introducing the HL-PIVOT Network: PROMOTING HUMAN RESILIENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH HEALTHY LIVING INITIATIVES.,2020-11-01,"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome with multisystem involvement which leads to foetal, neonatal, and maternal morbidity and mortality. This syndrome characterizes by the onset of clinical signs and symptoms and delivery before (early-onset preeclampsia, eoPE) or after (late-onset preeclampsia, loPE) the 34 weeks of gestation. Preeclampsia is a mitochondrial disorder where differential involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in eoPE and loPE is unclear. Mitochondria regulate cell metabolism and are a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The syncytiotrophoblast in eoPE and loPE show with altered mitochondria structure and function resulting in ROS overproduction, oxidative stress, and cell damage and death. Mitochondria dysfunction may result from different alterations in eoPE where an altered expression of several molecules, including dynamin-related protein 1 and mitofusins, compared with loPE where these factors are either reduced or unaltered. Equally, mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics seem differentially modulated in eoPE and loPE. However, it is unclear whether the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation are differentially altered in these two subgroups of preeclampsia. However, the activity of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) and expression of essential proteins involved in the electron transport chain is reduced, leading to lower oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiration in the placenta in preeclampsia. Interventional studies in patients with preeclampsia using the coenzyme Q10, a key molecule in the electron transport chain, suggest that agents increasing the antioxidant capacity of the placenta may be protective of developing preeclampsia. In this review, the mitochondrial dysfunction in both eoPE and loPE is summarized. Therapeutical approaches are discussed in the context of contributing to the understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in eoPE and loPE.","Marín, Reinaldo; Chiarello, Delia I; Abad, Cilia; Rojas, Deliana; Toledo, Fernando; Sobrevia, Luis",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Population-level effects of COVID-19 on patients with ESKD in the United States are uncertain. METHODS We identified patients with ESKD from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data during epidemiologic weeks 3-27 of 2017-2020 and corresponding weeks of 2017-2019, stratifying them by kidney replacement therapy. Outcomes comprised hospitalization for COVID-19, all-cause death, and hospitalization for reasons other than COVID-19. We estimated adjusted relative rates (ARRs) of death and non-COVID-19 hospitalization during epidemiologic weeks 13-27 of 2020 (March 22 to July 4) versus corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. RESULTS Among patients on dialysis, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization peaked between March 22 and April 25 2020. Non-Hispanic Black race and Hispanic ethnicity associated with higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, whereas peritoneal dialysis was associated with lower rates. During weeks 13-27, ARRs of death in 2020 versus 2017-2019 were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 1.19) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36) among patients undergoing dialysis or with a functioning transplant, respectively. Excess mortality was higher among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients. Among patients on dialysis, the rate of non-COVID-19 hospitalization during weeks 13-27 in 2020 was 17% lower versus hospitalization rates for corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. CONCLUSIONS During the first half of 2020, the clinical outcomes of patients with ESKD were greatly affected by COVID-19, and racial and ethnic disparities were apparent.

PURPOSE To compare the insertion torque (IT) and temporal implant stability quotients (ISQ) of implants placed via OD or subtractive drilling (SD). MATERIALS AND METHODS This multicenter controlled clinical trial enrolled 56 patients, whom were in need of at least 2 implants (n = 150 implants). Patients were treated with narrow, regular, or wide implants and short, regular, or long implants in the anterior or posterior region of the maxilla or in the posterior region of the mandible. Osteotomies were performed following manufacturers recommendation. IT was recorded with a torque indicator. ISQ was recorded with resonance frequency analysis immediately after surgery, 3 and 6 weeks. RESULTS Data complied as a function of osteotomy indicated significantly higher IT for OD relative to SD. OD outperformed conventional SD for all pairwise comparisons of arches (maxilla and mandible) and areas operated (anterior and posterior), diameters and lengths of the implants, except for short implants. Overall, ISQ data also demonstrated significantly higher values for OD compared to SD regardless of the healing period. Relative to immediate readings, ISQ values significantly decreased at 3 weeks, returning to immediate levels at 6 weeks; however, ISQ values strictly remained above 68 throughout healing time for OD. Data as a function of arch operated and osteotomy, area operated and osteotomy, implant dimensions and osteotomy, also exhibited higher ISQ values for OD relative to SD on pairwise comparisons, except for short implants. CONCLUSIONS OD demonstrated higher IT and temporal ISQ values relative to SD, irrespective of arch and area operated as well as implant design and dimension, with an exception for short implants.

In this study, we investigated the seroepidemiology of protein antigens to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) in Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) in Adelaide, Australia sampled between September 2015 and February 2018. A total of 301 serum samples were collected and evaluated using a multiplex Luminex binding assay and median fluorescence intensity thresholds were determined using finite mixture modelling. We found evidence of antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-1 or a related antigen with 42.5% (CI: 34.3%-51.2%) seroprevalence but insufficient evidence of reactivity to MERS-CoV antigen. This study provides evidence that the Grey-headed flying foxes sampled in Adelaide have been exposed to a SARS-like coronavirus.","Boardman, Wayne S J; Baker, Michelle L; Boyd, Victoria; Crameri, Gary; Peck, Grantley R; Reardon, Terry; Smith, Ian G; Carague, Charles G B; Prowse, Thomas A A",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142031/,435

This scoping review aimed to provide insight into what is already known about parental loneliness and give directions for further applied and methodological research. METHODS Searches for peer-reviewed articles were undertaken in six databases: PsycINFO, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus, during May 2019 to February 2020. We searched for English studies which examined loneliness experienced during parenthood, including studies that involved parents with children under 16 years and living at home and excluding studies on pregnancy, childbirth or postbirth hospital care. RESULTS From 2566 studies retrieved, 133 were included for analysis. Most studies (n = 80) examined the experience of loneliness in specific groups of parents, for example, teenage parents, parents of a disabled child. Other studies examined theoretical issues (n = 6) or health and wellbeing impacts on parents (n = 16) and their offspring (n = 17). There were 14 intervention studies with parents that measured loneliness as an outcome. Insights indicate that parental loneliness may be different to loneliness experienced in other cohorts. There is evidence that parental loneliness has direct and intergenerational impacts on parent and child mental health. Some parents (e.g. with children with chronic illness or disability, immigrant or ethnic minority parents) also appear to be at increased risk of loneliness although evidence is not conclusive. CONCLUSION This work has identified key gaps with further international, comparative and conceptual research needed.","Nowland, R; Thomson, G; McNally, L; Smith, T; Whittaker, K",Perspectives in public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/17579139211018243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286652/,435

However, the participation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in different exocytosis stages has not been defined. Here we demonstrate that PTP-MEG2 controls multiple steps of catecholamine secretion. Biochemical and crystallographic analyses reveal key residues that govern the interaction between PTP-MEG2 and its substrate, a peptide containing the phosphorylated NSF-pY83 site, specify PTP-MEG2 substrate selectivity, and modulate the fusion of catecholamine-containing vesicles. Unexpectedly, delineation of PTP-MEG2 mutants along with the NSF binding interface reveals that PTP-MEG2 controls the fusion pore opening through NSF independent mechanisms. Utilizing bioinformatics search and biochemical and electrochemical screening approaches, we uncover that PTP-MEG2 regulates the opening and extension of the fusion pore by dephosphorylating the DYNAMIN2-pY125 and MUNC18-1-pY145 sites. Further structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the interaction of PTP-MEG2 with MUNC18-1-pY145 or DYNAMIN2-pY125 through a distinct structural basis compared with that of the NSF-pY83 site. Our studies thus provide mechanistic insights in complex exocytosis processes.","Xu, Yun-Fei; Chen, Xu; Yang, Zhao; Xiao, Peng; Liu, Chun-Hua; Li, Kang-Shuai; Yang, Xiao-Zhen; Wang, Yi-Jing; Zhu, Zhong-Liang; Xu, Zhi-Gang; Zhang, Sheng; Wang, Chuan; Song, You-Chen; Zhao, Wei-Dong; Wang, Chang-He; Ji, Zhi-Liang; Zhang, Zhong-Yin; Cui, Min; Sun, Jin-Peng; Yu, Xiao",EMBO reports,https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.202052141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764618/,435

Vaccines are recognized as highly effective tools to mitigate antimicrobial resistance; however, the selection of bacterial antigens as vaccine candidates remains challenging. In recent years, advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have led to the development of so-called immunopeptidomics approaches that allow the untargeted discovery of bacterial epitopes that are presented on the surface of infected cells. Especially for intracellular bacterial pathogens, immunopeptidomics holds great promise to uncover antigens that can be encoded in viral vector- or nucleic acid-based vaccines. This review provides an overview of immunopeptidomics studies on intracellular bacterial pathogens and considers future directions and challenges in advancing towards next-generation vaccines.","Mayer, Rupert L; Impens, Francis",Trends in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2021.04.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030969/,435

Coronaviruses developed varied mechanisms to repress host mRNA translation to allow the translation of viral mRNAs and concomitantly block the cellular innate immune response2,3. Although different SARS-CoV-2 proteins are implicated in host expression shutoff4-7, a comprehensive picture of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cellular gene expression is lacking. Here, we combine RNA-sequencing, ribosome profiling and metabolic labeling of newly synthesized RNA, to comprehensively define the mechanisms that are utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to shutoff cellular protein synthesis. We show that infection leads to a global reduction in translation, but viral transcripts are not preferentially translated. Instead, we find that infection leads to accelerated degradation of cytosolic cellular mRNAs which facilitates viral takeover of the mRNA pool in infected cells. Moreover, we reveal that the translation of transcripts whose expression is induced in response to infection, including innate immune genes, is impaired. We demonstrate this impairment is likely mediated by inhibition of nuclear mRNA export, preventing newly transcribed cellular mRNAs from accessing ribosomes. Overall, our results uncover the multipronged strategy employed by SARS-CoV-2 to commandeer the translation machinery and to suppress host defenses.","Finkel, Yaara; Gluck, Avi; Nachshon, Aharon; Winkler, Roni; Fisher, Tal; Rozman, Batsheva; Mizrahi, Orel; Lubelsky, Yoav; Zuckerman, Binyamin; Slobodin, Boris; Yahalom-Ronen, Yfat; Tamir, Hadas; Ulitsky, Igor; Israely, Tomer; Paran, Nir; Schwartz, Michal; Stern-Ginossar, Noam",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03610-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979833/,435

This study was designed to assess the adhesive properties of a medium-chain (n-butyl) cyanoacrylate glue applied as drops or as a spray in a biomechanical and histologic study. Both forms of glue application were compared to the use of simple-loose or continuous-running polypropylene sutures for mesh fixation. Eighteen adult New Zealand White rabbits were used. For mechanical tests in an ex vivo and in vivo study, patches of polypropylene mesh were fixed to an excised fragment of healthy abdominal tissue or used to repair a partial abdominal wall defect in the rabbit respectively. Depending on the fixation method used, four groups of 12 implants each or 10 implants each respectively for the ex vivo and in vivo studies were established: Glue-Drops, Glue-Spray, Suture-Simple and Suture-Continuous. Biomechanical resistance in the ex vivo implants was tested five minutes after mesh fixation. In vivo implants for biomechanical and histologic assessment were collected at 14 days postimplant. In the ex vivo study, the continuous suture implants showed the highest failure sample tension, while the implants fixed with glue showed lower failure sample tension values. However, the simple and continuous suture implants returned the highest stretch values. In the in vivo implants, failure sample tension values were similar among groups while the implants fixed with a continuous running suture had the higher stretch values, and the glue-fixed implants the lower stretch values. All meshes showed good tissue integration within the host tissue regardless of the fixation method used. Our histologic study revealed the generation of a denser, more mature repair tissue when the cyanoacrylate glue was applied as a spray rather than as drops.","Ortillés, Á; Pascual, G; Peña, E; Rodríguez, M; Pérez-Köhler, B; Mesa-Ciller, C; Calvo, B; Bellón, J M",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2017.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28810210/,435

OBJECTIVE To determine the overall complication rate (permanent and transient) associated with the use of this new device from a single institution. METHODS We retrospectively examined a prospectively maintained database of our patients treated with the PED since its availability to the current time. 126 patients (24 men, 102 women; age range 14-83 years, mean 59.8 years) were treated for a total of 137 intracranial aneurysms, one cervical internal carotid artery dissection, one cervical vertebral artery dissection, and one carotid-cavernous fistula with a total of 217 PEDs (1.72 PED/patient). RESULTS A total of 40 complications were experienced by 33 patients in our cohort. Four complications (4/126, 3.2%) in four patients were permanent, resulting in three deaths and one permanent disability. The other 36 complications (28.6%) occurred in 29 patients, all of whom went on to recover completely. The total complication rate associated with the use of the PED was 31.7% (40/126). CONCLUSIONS Despite a low rate of permanent complications associated with the PED in this series, the total complication rate was high. This finding supports the conclusion that this device should be reserved for the most challenging aneurysms. Patients should be advised of this higher rate of transient periprocedural complications.

Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue were reported through surveys; productivity was operationalized by typing speed and typing error; postural risks were assessed by RULA for seated work, and REBA for standing work. RESULTS Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue did not vary significantly between configurations. Postural risks for seated and standing work were significantly lower for Ergo-Fit configuration; productivity was significantly higher for Self-Adjusted configuration. CONCLUSION Use of Ergo-Fit configuration for a sit-stand-walk intervention can facilitate postural transitions and increase physical activity, while enabling neutral postures in seated and standing work to minimize postural risks.","Kar, Gourab; Hedge, Alan",Applied ergonomics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818838/,435

158822,A systematic evaluation of digital nutrition promotion websites and apps for supporting parents to influence children's nutrition.,2020-02-10,"BACKGROUND Portal vein embolization is performed weeks before extended hepatic resections to increase the future liver remnant and prevent posthepatectomy liver failure. Portal vein embolization performed closer to the operation also could be protective, but worsening of portal hyper-perfusion is a major concern. We determined the hepatic hemodynamic effects of a portal vein embolization performed 24 hours prior to hepatic operation. METHODS An extended (90%) hepatectomy was performed in swine undergoing (portal vein embolization) or not undergoing (control) a portal vein embolization 24 hours earlier (n = 10/group). Blood tests, hepatic and systemic hemodynamics, hepatic function (plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green), liver histology, and volumetry (computed tomographic scanning) were assessed before and after the hepatectomy. Hepatocyte proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and hepatic gene expression also were evaluated. RESULTS Swine in the control and portal vein embolization groups maintained stable systemic hemodynamics and developed similar increases of portal blood flow (302 ± 72% vs 486 ± 92%, P = .13). Portal pressure drastically increased in Controls (from 9.4 ± 1.3 mm Hg to 20.9 ± 1.4 mm Hg, P < .001), while being markedly attenuated in the portal vein embolization group (from 11.4 ± 1.5 mm Hg to 16.1 ± 1.3 mm Hg, P = .061). The procedure also improved the preservation of the hepatic artery blood flow, liver function, and periportal edema. These effects occurred in the absence of hepatocyte proliferation or hepatic growth and were associated with the induction of the vasoprotective gene Klf2. CONCLUSION Portal vein embolization preconditioning represents a potential hepato-protective strategy for extended hepatic resections. Further preclinical studies should assess its medium-term effects, including survival. Our study also supports the relevance of hepatic hemodynamics as the main pathogenetic factor of post-hepatectomy liver failure.","Asencio, José M; García-Sabrido, José L; López-Baena, José A; Olmedilla, Luis; Peligros, Isabel; Lozano, Pablo; Morales-Taboada, Álvaro; Fernández-Mena, Carolina; Steiner, Miguel A; Sola, Emma; Perez-Peña, José M; Herrero, Miriam; Laso, Juan; Lisbona, Cristina; Bañares, Rafael; Casanova, Javier; Vaquero, Javier",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2016.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28117095/,435

However, classical and widely used aluminum-based adjuvants have limited capacity to induce cellular response. There are increasing needs for appropriate adjuvants with improved profiles for vaccine development towards emerging pathogens. Carbohydrate-containing nanoparticles (NPs) with immunomodulatory activity and particulate nanocarriers for effective antigen presentation are capable of eliciting a more balanced humoral and cellular immune response. AREAS COVERED We reviewed several carbohydrates with immunomodulatory properties. They include chitosan, β-glucan, mannan, and saponins, which have been used in vaccine formulations. The mode of action, the preparation methods, characterization of these carbohydrate-containing NPs and the corresponding vaccines are presented. EXPERT OPINION Several carbohydrate-containing NPs have entered the clinical stage or have been used in licensed vaccines for human use. Saponin-containing NPs are being evaluated in a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing the on-going worldwide pandemic. Vaccines with carbohydrate-containing NPs are in different stages of development, from preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials. A better understanding of the mode of action for carbohydrate-containing NPs as vaccine carriers and as immunostimulators will likely contribute to the design and development of new generation vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases.","Zhang, Xinyuan; Zhang, Zhigang; Xia, Ningshao; Zhao, Qinjian",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1939688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101528/,435

After perturbation removal, the increased TA activation persisted temporarily and was associated with a more dorsiflexed ankle during swing. The objective of the present case-series study was to verify if these results can be reproduced in persons post-stroke. METHODS Six participants who sustained a stroke walked on a treadmill before, during and after exposure to a torque perturbation applied at the ankle by a robotized ankle-foot orthosis. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, ankle and knee kinematics, and the electromyographic activity of TA and Soleus were recorded. Mean amplitude of the TA burst located around toe off and peak ankle dorsiflexion angle during swing were compared across the 3 walking periods for each participant. RESULTS At the end of the walking period with the perturbation, TA mean amplitude was significantly increased in 4 of the 6 participants. Among these 4 participants, modifications in TA activation persisted after perturbation removal in 3 of them, and led to a statistically significant increase in peak dorsiflexion during swing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS This approach may be helpful to evaluate the residual adaptive capacity in the ankle dorsiflexors after a stroke and guide decision-making for the selection of optimal rehabilitation interventions. Future work will investigate the clinical impact of a multiple-session gait training based on this approach in persons presenting a reduced ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase of walking.","Blanchette, Andreanne K; Noël, Martin; Richards, Carol L; Nadeau, Sylvie; Bouyer, Laurent J",Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-0003-11-98; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24912626/,435

The aim of this study is to investigate the utility of plasma D-dimer levels determining the severity of inflammation and prognosis in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS We retrospectively chart reviewed medical records of pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) admitted to Istanbul Fcaulty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics Infectious Disease Service between March 11, and June 30, 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, biochemical and radiographic data. RESULTS A hundred and seventy-one pediatric patients (1 - 216 months of age) admitted to pediatric infecitous disease service included in this study. Patients were classified into 4 categories; 1) COVID-19 infection confirmed by PCR, 2) Suspected COVID-19 infection due to close exposure history and radiographic findings, 3) Lower respiratory tract infection other than COVID-19 confirmed with multiplex respiratory viral panel, and 4) Systemic infections other than lower respiratory tract infection. Lymphopenia was observed significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 infection compared to patients with other respiratory viral infections (p=0.06). In patients with radiographic findings concerning for COVID-19 infection, elevated serum D-dimer levels were detected significantly higher than lymphopenia (p=0.07).

SLV213 (K777) is an orally administered small molecule protease inhibitor that exhibits in vitro activity against a range of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. To confirm efficacy in vivo, K777 was evaluated in an African green monkey (AGM) model of COVID-19. A pilot experiment was designed to test K777 in a prophylactic setting, animals were pre-treated with 100mg/kg K777 (N=4) or vehicle (N=2) before inoculation with SARS-CoV-2. Initial data demonstrated that K777 treatment reduced pulmonary pathology compared to vehicle-treated animals. A second study was designed to test activity in a therapeutic setting, with K777 treatment (33 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg) initiated 8 hours after exposure to the virus. In both experiments, animals received K777 daily via oral gavage for 7 days. Vehicle-treated animals exhibited higher lung weights, pleuritis, and diffuse alveolar damage. In contrast, lung pathology was reduced in K777-treated monkeys, and histopathological analyses confirmed the lack of diffuse alveolar damage. Antiviral effects were further demonstrated by quantitative reductions in viral load of samples collected from upper and lower airways. These preclinical data support the potential for early SLV213 treatment in COVID-19 patients to prevent severe lung pathology and disease progression.","Frueh, Felix W.; Maneval, Daniel C.; Bohm, Rudolf P.; Dufour, Jason P.; Blair, Robert V.; Powell, Kathy; Aye, Pyone P.; Golden, Nadia A.; Roy, Chad J; Spencer, Sky; Russsell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Plante, Kenneth S.; Plante, Jessica A.; McKerrow, James; Rappaport, Jay",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.20.453127,435

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing from the social exchange theory, this study conceptualized the benefits of using technologies for social distancing, health risks, social rewards and privacy concerns as antecedents of value of using technologies for social distancing in hotels. The structural model was validated by using data from more than 1,000 nationwide US consumers. Findings: Benefits and consumers’ privacy concerns of using technologies for social distancing in hotels were the strongest predictors of value. Social rewards also had a significant but relatively lower effect on value. Health risks was found to have no influence on value. Originality/value: The study is the first to examine the role of technologies in mitigating the effects of coronavirus.

While several vaccines are under various stage of development, effective screening procedures that help detect the disease at early stages in a non-invasive and resource-optimized manner are the need of the hour. X-ray imaging is fairly accessible in most healthcare institutions and can prove useful in diagnosing this respiratory disease. Although a chest X-ray scan is a viable method to detect the presence of this disease, the scans must be analyzed by trained experts accurately and quickly if large numbers of tests are to be processed. In this paper, a benchmarking study of different preprocessing techniques and state-of-the-art deep learning models is presented to provide comprehensive insights into both the objective and subjective evaluation of their performance. To analyze and prevent possible sources of bias, we preprocessed the dataset in two ways-first, we segmented the lungs alone, and secondly, we formed a bounding box around the lung and used only this area to train. Among the models chosen to benchmark, which were DenseNet201, EfficientNetB7, and VGG-16, DenseNet201 performed better for all three datasets. © 2021 IEEE.","Nedumkunnel, I.

Design/methodology/approach: The research uses the interpretative structural modelling (ISM) for assessing the powerful measures amongst the recognized ones, whereas to establish the cause-and-effect relations amongst the variables, the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is used. Both approaches utilized in the study aid in the comprehension of the relationship amongst the assessed measures. Findings: According to the ISM model, international support measures have the most important role in reducing the risk of COVID-19. There has also been a suggestion of a relationship between economic and risk measures. Surprisingly, no linkage factor (unstable one) was reported in the research. The study indicates social welfare measures, R&D measures, centralized power and decentralized governance measures and universal healthcare measures as independent factors. The DEMATEL analysis reveals that the net causes are social welfare measures, centralized power and decentralized government, universal health coverage measure and R&D measures, while the net effects are economic measures, green recovery measures, risk measures and international support measures. Originality/value: The study includes a list of numerous government measures deployed throughout the world to mitigate the risk of COVID-19, as well as the structural links amongst the identified government measures. The Matrice d'Impacts croises-multiplication applique and classment analysis can help the policymakers in understanding measures used in combatting COVID-19 based on their driving and dependence power.

Mostly pivoting around assumptions of human-controlled processes of manufacturing and spreading of the virus, these theories are not only expressive of some anxieties of the postmodern age, which has developed a growing distrust in science and in powerful elites;they also reveal people’s attempts to make sense of diseases by concocting human agents of malevolence, whose plotting is less terrifying than the prospect of being at the mercy of unknown natural pathogens. These cultural mechanisms are evident in a number of cultural products, such as literary works, films and TV series, which use gothic paraphernalia to create stories of conspiracy revolving around human-generated infections. By analysing two recent TV series, Helix and Fortitude, the article sheds lights onto the above-mentioned mechanisms, which are currently resurfacing in many Internet-blooming theories about Coronavirus masterminds and spreaders.","Costantini, Mariaconcetta",The Critical Quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1111/criq.12578,435

HDF increases the proportion of circulating granulocytes and enhances mosquito cellular immunity. We found that Evokin is constitutively produced by hemocytes and fat-body cells, but expression increases in response to infection. Insects synthesize lipoxins, but lack lipoxygenases. Here, we show that the Double Peroxidase (DBLOX) enzyme, present in insects but not in vertebrates, is essential for HDF synthesis. DBLOX is highly expressed in oenocytes in the fat body tissue, and these cells proliferate in response to Plasmodium challenge. We provide direct evidence that modifications mediated by the histone acetyltransferase AgTip60 (AGAP01539) are essential for sustained oenocyte proliferation, HDF synthesis and immune priming. We propose that oenocytes function as a population of “memory” cells that continuously release lipoxin to orchestrate and maintain a broad, systemic and long-lasting state of enhanced immune surveillance.","Gomes, Fabio M.; Tyner, Miles D.W.; Barletta, Ana Beatriz F.; Yenkoidiok-Douti, Lampougin; Canepa, Gaspar E.; Molina-Cruz, Alvaro; Barillas-Mury, Carolina",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.290312,435

Depending on the increasing demand, many types of masks have been used in the pandemic process between health-care professionals and the community. Aims and Objectives: In our study, it was planned to evaluate N95, green, white surgical, and fabric woven masks with a fluorescent angiography (SPY (R)) device for protection. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the effectiveness of the masks, models with and without mannequins are used. In both study models, indocyanine green was squeezed from the masks at a distance of 50 cm and the staining values of masks and mannequin faces were evaluated with fluorescent angiography (SPY (R)) device. Results: The most dyeing fabric was observed in the woven mask, while the least dyeing was observed in the N95 mask. In the model without mannequin, it was observed that the highest protection was in the N95 mask and the least protection was in the fabric woven mask. The most dyeing on the face was observed on the mannequin in which the woven mask was removed, and the least dyeing on the face was observed on the mannequin in which the N95 mask was removed. Green and white surgical masks were found to have similar protective rates. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, where the effectiveness of the mask was evaluated for the first time by using a fluorescent angiography (SPY (R)) device from a plastic surgery perspective, it was found that the N95 mask had the highest protection, the green and white surgical masks were similar, and the fabric woven mask had the least protection.","Deniz, E.; Sibar, S.; Kilic, O.; Ayhan, S.",Turkish Journal of Plastic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/tjps.tjps_105_20,435

Education, occupation, and age were the strongest sociodemographic predictors of GDPR awareness, with little influence of gender, subjective economic well-being, or locality size. Digital experience was significantly and positively correlated with GDPR awareness in a linear model, but this relationship proved to be more complex when we examined it through a typological analysis. Using an exploratory k-means cluster analysis we identified four clusters of digital citizenship, across both dimensions of digital experience and GDPR awareness: the off-line citizens (22%), the social netizens (32%), the web citizens (17%), and the data citizens (29%). The off-line citizens ranked lowest in internet use and GDPR awareness; the web citizens ranked at about average values, while the data citizens ranked highest in both digital experience and GDPR knowledge and use. The fourth identified cluster, the social netizens, had a discordant profile, with remarkably high social network use, below average online shopping experiences, and low GDPR awareness. Digitalization in human capital and general internet use is a strong country-level correlate of the national frequency of the data citizen type. Our results confirm previous studies of the low privacy awareness and skills associated with intense social media consumption, but we found that young generations are evenly divided between the rather carefree social netizens and the strongly invested data citizens.","Rughinis, Razvan; Rughinis, Cosima; Vulpe, Simona Nicoleta; Rosner, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07721v1.pdf,435

Remote communication by phone calls and WhatsApp messages became available in the past years. However, the current need to avoid face-to-face meetings necessitates further expansion of telemedicine services. There are limited data whether the option of virtual meetings is a preferred therapeutic modality for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Objective: To assess in a cohort of T1D patients, their preference and perception of telemedicine. Methods: T1D patients who are followed in a hospital-affiliated diabetes clinic were asked to fill a structured questionnaire aimed to determine their attitude towards telemedicine and their preference of virtual versus conventional visits. The questionnaire was offered to consecutive T1D patients who visited the clinic between August to October 2020. Results: Seventy one T1D patients that fulfilled the questionnaire were included. Mean age was 42±15 years, 39% were male, and the mean duration of diabetes was 21±14 years. Fourteen percent of the participants preferred only virtual visits, 24% only conventional visits and 62% preferred a combination of these modalities. Sex, origin, education, duration of diabetes, mode of insulin treatment and distance from the clinic were not associated with patients' preference, but older patients (≥ 61 years) tended to prefer conventional visits. Sixtyseven percent felt confident in their ability to download data from their personal medical devices. Conclusions: Patients from a wide range of treatment modalities are willing to use telemedicine. However, virtual meetings cannot fully replace conventional visits in T1D especially in the older age group.","Kirzhner, A.; Zornitzki, T.; Ostrovsky, V.; Knobler, H.; Schiller, T.",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-876-p,435

Finally, CAV1 depletion using knockdown or pharmacologic approaches was shown to increase HER2-directed immunoPET uptake and TDM1 efficacy in GC with incomplete HER2 membranous reactivity. In support of these findings, background statin use in patients is associated with enhanced antibody efficacy. Together, this work provides mechanistic justification and clinical evidence that require prospective investigation of HER2-targeted therapies combined with statins to delay drug resistance in GC. SIGNIFICANCE This study identifies how CAV1 protein expression and statin use relate to GC response in HER2-targeted imaging and therapeutic approaches. In addition, to support the synergy of CAV1 depletion with TDM1 observed in mouse models, we demonstrate that statin users had better clinical responses to antibody-based therapies in HER2+ GC.","Pereira, Patrícia M.

177772,"Awareness and commitment towards precautionary measures against COVID-19 among residents of Majmaah City, Saudi Arabia",2021,"The coronavirus pandemic and the crisis it has brought about has resulted in inaction on the part of the individual. Not only the current crisis, but also the crises of the last century caused a passivity that was also noticeable in the artist, as the content of the artistic creation is not directly related to the current crisis, but rather is used as an escape route. In times of crisis the creative process does not process the material that is available under the given circumstances, instead art represents a means of accepting life as it is. The definition of art as a form of comforting illusion became a central theme in Nietzsche's work towards the end of the 19th century as a result of crises. This essay deals with the question of whether the relevance of art for society will remain as long as it continues to function as a passive place of escape and cheer. In order to be able to examine this, the present study deals with Nietzsche's The birth of tragedy because the work includes Nietzsche's systematic reflections on aesthetics on which modern art is based. As a result, it was found that the current crisis could give rise to a crisis in abstract art that has been dominating the cultural milieu at the same time as pleading for inaction. In a new phase in which new concepts are being sought all over the world, it can hardly be expected that aesthetic principles will be preserved as they have prevailed for more than a hundred years.","Bayir, P.

Physical gatherings such as conferences, classes, and other social activities have been greatly reduced in favor of virtual meetings on Zoom, Webex or similar video-conferencing platforms. However, video-conferencing is quite limited in its ability to create meeting spaces that capture the authentic feel of a real-world meeting. Without the aid of body language cues, meeting participants have a harder time paying attention and keeping themselves engaged in virtual meetings. Video-conferencing, as it currently stands, falls short of providing a familiar environment that fosters personal connection between meeting participants. This paper explores an alternative approach to virtual meetings through the use of extended reality (XR) and embodied interactions. We present an application that leverages the full-body tracking capabilities of the Azure Kinect and the immersive affordances of XR to create more vibrant and engaging remote meeting environments. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Manuel, M.; Dongre, P.; Alhamadani, A.; Gračanin, D.","13th International Conference on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, VAMR 2021, Held as Part of the 23rd HCI International Conference, HCII 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77599-5_44,435

Instead of the growing demand and need for capacity expansion warring against environmental concerns, the sector is now facing a slump in demand and the continuing uncertainty about the impacts of the pandemic on people?s willingness to fly. To shed light on consumer attitudes toward air travel during and post the pandemic, this study presents an analysis that draws on recently collected survey data (April?July 2020), including both revealed and stated preference components, of 388 respondents who traveled from one of the six London, U.K., airports in 2019. Several travel scenarios considering the circumstances and attitudes related to COVID-19 are explored. The data is analyzed using a hybrid choice model to integrate latent constructs related to attitudinal characteristics. The analysis confirms the impact of consumers? health concerns on their willingness to travel, as a function of travel characteristics, that is, cost and number of transfers. It also provides insights into preference heterogeneity as a function of sociodemographic characteristics. However, no significant effects are observed concerning perceptions of safety arising from wearing a mask, or concerns over the necessity to quarantine. Results also suggest that some respondents may perceive virtual substitutes for business travel, for example video calls and similar software, as only a temporary measure, and seek to return to traveling as soon as it is possible to do so safely.","Manca, Francesco Sivakumar Aruna Pawlak Jacek Brodzinski Norbert J.",Transportation Research Record,https://doi.org/10.1177/03611981211025287,435

Home confinement, physical and social isolation, the spread of false news through social media, fear of contracting the disease, lack of physical activity, and work-from-home situations have affected the mental status and sleep quality of individuals during the lockdown. We intended to identify the effect of belly breathing exercise in reducing the depression, anxiety and stress levels in individuals who work-from-home during the lockdown. A hundred participants were identified through snowball sampling and were divided into two equal groups. Group A received a health education program and belly breathing techniques, whereas group B was provided with a health education program alone. DASS 21 and single item Sleep Quality Scale was assessed before recruitment and after three weeks of intervention in both groups. Signiicant reduction in depression, anxiety, and stress levels were observed in group A (p&lt;0.001) than that of group B. Participants who underwent belly breathing also reported signiicant improvement in sleep quality after three weeks of intervention. Belly breathing has found to be an effective and simple technique to instruct and perform, which significantly reduces depression, anxiety and stress levels in individuals who work from home and are in need of medical advice for their mental health status. We suggest the use of belly breathing in improving the mental status in any black swan events such as home quarantine or strict physical isolation measures, and even during any stressful situations.","Prakash, J.; James, T.

182917,Eye care where there are no ophthalmologists: the Uganda experience,2020-12-31,"Representation learning over temporal networks has drawn considerable attention in recent years. Efforts are mainly focused on modeling structural dependencies and temporal evolving regularities in Euclidean space which, however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in many real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To explore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic temporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. More specially, HTGN maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and incorporates hyperbolic graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network, to capture the evolving behaviors and implicitly preserve hierarchical information simultaneously. Furthermore, in the hyperbolic space, we propose two important modules that enable HTGN to successfully model temporal networks: (1) hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention (HTA) module to attend to historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency (HTC) module to ensure stability and generalization. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTGN for temporal graph embedding, as it consistently outperforms competing methods by significant margins in various temporal link prediction tasks. Specifically, HTGN achieves AUC improvement up to 9.98% for link prediction and 11.4% for new link prediction. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the representational ability of hyperbolic geometry and the effectiveness of the proposed HTA and HTC modules.","Yang, Menglin; Zhou, Min; Kalander, Marcus; Huang, Zengfeng; King, Irwin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03767v1.pdf,435

While COVID-19 patients are known to exhibit a variety of symptoms, the major symptoms include fever, cough, and fatigue. Since these symptoms also appear in pneumonia patients, this creates complications in COVID-19 detection especially during the flu season. Early studies identified abnormalities in chest X-ray images of COVID-19 infected patients that could be beneficial for disease diagnosis. Therefore, chest X-ray image-based disease classification has emerged as an alternative to aid medical diagnosis. However, manual detection of COVID-19 from a set of chest X-ray images comprising both COVID-19 and pneumonia cases is cumbersome and prone to human error. Thus, artificial intelligence techniques powered by deep learning algorithms, which learn from radiography images and predict presence of COVID-19 have potential to enhance current diagnosis process. Towards this purpose, here we implemented a set of deep learning pre-trained models such as ResNet, VGG, Inception and EfficientNet in conjunction with developing a computer vision AI system based on our own convolutional neural network (CNN) model: Deep Learning in Healthcare (DLH)-COVID. All these CNN models cater to image classification exercise. We used publicly available resources of 6,432 images and further strengthened our model by tuning hyperparameters to provide better generalization during the model validation phase. Our final DLH-COVID model yielded the highest accuracy of 96% in detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images when compared to images of both pneumonia-affected and healthy individuals. Given the practicality of acquiring chest X-ray images by patients, we also developed a web application (link: https://toad.li/xray) based on our model to directly enable users to upload chest X-ray images and detect the presence of COVID-19 within a few seconds. Taken together, here we introduce a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based system for efficient COVID-19 detection and a user-friendly application that has the capacity to become a rapid COVID-19 diagnosis method in the near future.","Dey, S.; Bacellar, G.

As an initial step toward provision of an oral vaccine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we have expressed a partial spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV in the cytosol of nuclear-transformed plants and in the chloroplasts of plastid-transformed plants. In the construction of both nuclear and plastid transformation vectors, a 2-kilobase nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 1-658 of the SARS-CoV spike protein (S1) was modified with nucleotide changes, but not amino acid changes, to optimize codon usage for expression in plants. To investigate the subcellular localization of S1 during transient expression in tobacco leaves, a translational fusion consisting of S1 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated. Following agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves, analysis by laser confocal scanning microscopy revealed that the S1:GFP fusion protein was localized to the cytosol. In stable transgenic tobacco plants and lettuce plants generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, tobacco and lettuce leaves were observed to express the S1 at high levels from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter with Northern blot analysis. When the S1 was expressed in transplastomic tobacco, S1 messenger RNA and its corresponding protein were detected on Northern and Western blot analyses, respectively. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of producing S1 in nuclear- and chloroplast-transformed plants, indicating its potential in subsequent development of a plant-derived and safe oral recombinant subunit vaccine against the SARS-CoV in edible plants.","Li, Hong-Ye; Ramalingam, Sathishkumar; Chye, Mee-Len",Experimental biology and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16946403/,435

Viral RNAs isolated from the brains of animals 5 to 7 days after infection were compared by Northern blot analysis with the RNAs produced during the lytic infection of Sac(-) or DBT cells with wild-type MHV-JHM (wt virus). Reproducibly, the subgenomic mRNAs 2 and 3 but no other viral RNAs were significantly larger in the brain-derived material. All viruses isolated from infected brain material displayed and maintained this altered mRNA profile when cultivated in Sac(-) or DBT cells. A virus isolated from the infected brain material, MHV-JHM clone 2 (cl-2 virus), has been further characterized. This isolate grew in tissue culture and induced cytopathic effects comparable to those induced by wt virus. However, the mRNAs 2 and 3 produced in cl-2 virus-infected cells had molecular weights ca. 150,000 larger than those produced in cells infected with wt virus. There was no detectable difference in genome-sized RNA (mRNA 1) or subgenomic mRNAs 4, 5, 6, and 7 as determined by electrophoresis in agarose gels. T1-resistant oligonucleotide analysis of genomic RNA revealed one additional and one missing oligonucleotide in the fingerprint of cl-2 virus compared with wt virus. The oligonucleotide fingerprints of intracellular mRNA 3 were identical for both viruses. Pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine in the presence of tunicamycin showed that the primary translation product of mRNA 3, the E2 apoprotein, was ca. 15,000 larger in molecular weight in cl-2 virus-infected cells. These data show that viruses with larger mRNAs 2 and 3 (the latter encoding an altered E2 glycoprotein) are selected for multiplication in rat brains.

Therefore, we used a novel peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (G peptide-ELISA) to compare immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG subclass antibody responses against the G protein with the antibody response against the F protein, as measured by a conventional BRSV ELISA (F-ELISA). Experimental infection of cattle induced significantly lower antibody titers than did natural infection. After natural primary infection, G peptide-specific antibodies declined more rapidly and to lower levels than the F protein-specific antibodies. As a consequence, the G peptide-ELISA detected more reinfections than did the F-ELISA. Ratios of G- and F-specific IgG1/IgG2 antibody titers did not differ markedly after infection or vaccination. Interestingly, after natural infection calves did not develop an IgG2 response to the complete G protein. In contrast, adult cattle had high IgG2 titers against this protein. Vaccination with a live vaccine induced low antibody titers, similar to the titers after experimental infection, whereas vaccination with an inactivated vaccine induced high titers. The results indicate that the kinetics of the G- and F-specific antibody responses differ.

A total of 51 patients were evaluated in this study (n = 25, nonabsorbable tack (NAT) and n = 26, absorbable tack (AT) groups). A visual analogue scale (VAS) was performed on both groups preoperatively and on the postoperative (PO) first day, second week, and sixth month. All patients were followed for recurrence by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and/or abdominal computed tomography. The median follow-up time was 31 months (15-45). The mean age and the mean body mass index (BMI) of the patients were 53.1 ± 11 years and 34 ± 5 kg/m(2), respectively. The median defect size was 60 cm(2) (35-150) and median operation time was 110 minutes (40-360). In 2 patients from AT group and 2 from NAT group (7.8%), recurrence occurred. The 2 groups had similar features regarding demographics, operation time, postoperative hospital stay, morbidity, and VAS scores. The 2 fixation methods were found similar for PO pain and recurrence. In our opinion, the choice of either of these fixation methods during surgery should not be based on the concerns of pain or recurrence. AT may be the preferable option in LVIHR due to the lower cost.","Colak, Elif; Ozlem, Nuraydin; Kucuk, Gultekin Ozan; Aktimur, Recep; Kesmer, Sadik; Yildirim, Kadir",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26885113/,435

MATERIAL AND METHODS Cross-sectional analysis of a case series including patients coming to an emergency department in March and April 2020 with mild-moderate respiratory symptoms suspected to be caused by SARS-CoV-2. A point-of-care ultrasound examination of the lungs was performed on all participants as part of routine clinical care. Ultrasound findings were compared according to the results of SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients with a median (interquartile range) age of 44.5 (34-67) years were enrolled; 42 (72.4%) were women. Twenty-seven (46.5%) had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ultrasound findings were consistent with interstitial pneumonia due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 33 (56.9%). Most were in cases with testconfirmed COVID-19 (100% vs 22.2% of cases with no confirmation; P < .001). The most common ultrasound findings in confirmed COVID-19 cases were focal and confluent B-lines in the basal and posterior regions of the lung (R1, 85.2%; R2, 77.8%; L1, 88.9%; and L2, 88.9%) and associated pleural involvement (70.4%, 70.4%, 81.5%, and 85.2%, respectively). The sensitivity of point-of-care ultrasound in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 92.6% (95% CI, 75.7%-99.1%). Specificity was 85.2% (95% CI, 66.3%-95.8%); positive predictive value, 75.8% (95% CI, 59.6%- 91.9%); negative predictive value, 92% (95% CI, 74.0%-99.0%); and positive and negative likelihood ratios, 6.2 (95% CI, 6.0-6.5) and 0.1 (95% CI, 0.1-0.1), respectively. CONCLUSION Point-of-care lung ultrasound could be useful for the diagnosis of noncritical SARS-CoV-2 infection when chest radiographs are inconclusive.","Gil-Rodrigo, Adriana; Llorens, Pere; Martínez-Buendía, Carmen; Luque-Hernández, María-José; Espinosa, Begoña; Ramos-Rincón, José Manuel",Emergencias : revista de la Sociedad Espanola de Medicina de Emergencias,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006834/,435

People working inside airports face every day challenges and difficulties that not insiders cannot even imagine, but which have to be considered in strategic training projects, where people has to be placed at the centre of the training action. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The GHA project (Genius Handling and Academy) was born with the aim of increasing the quality of the professional commitment made by airport professionals, preparing them to adequately face not only the technical-operational challenges but also the psychological ones underlying a complex and particular environment. such as the airport one. The year 2018 has been the starting point of this training project, the bettering of professional qualification has been the goal during the year 2019, up to the first part of 2020 (March). The headquarters of the pilot project was the 'Leonardo Da Vinci' Rome International Airport. The sample was composed by 25 employees of the 'Genius Handling' , a company operating inside the airport. RESULTS The results collected at the end of the training period recorded a 37% increase in the quality of professional performance compared to the previous period in which no training activity was carried out. CONCLUSIONS When the airport world had to stop in order to take the restrictive measures for containing contagion, the importance of the airport reality in everyone's economic and professional life has become immediately evident. So, it has become even more urgent to work in implementation and encouraging research and experimentation, with the aim not only to promote the well-being of people who are in transit, but of its 'permanent residents' as well, that is, people who spend their working days there.","Spurio, Maria Grazia",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890365/,435
192985,Neurology at the crossroads.,1952,"P68 (DDX5) and p72 (DDX17) are members of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. They can unwind double-stranded RNA and also contribute to the remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes. These activities of p68/p72 are required for efficient RNA splicing and microRNA processing. In addition, p68/p72 perform functions that are independent of their enzymatic activity. This is especially common to their role in gene regulation, where p68/p72 coactivate various transcription factors, including the tumor suppressor p53, estrogen receptor alpha and beta-catenin. P68/p72 are posttranslationally modified by SUMO attachment and phosphorylation that regulate their coactivation potential, binding to known interactants or protein stability. Knock-out mouse models revealed that both DDX5 and DDX17 are essential genes during development. Furthermore, together with their ability to stimulate cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis, the reported overexpression of p68/p72 in three of the major human cancers (colon, breast, prostate) strongly suggests that p68/p72 promote tumorigenesis and might even represent proto-oncoproteins. If so, their inhibition holds promise as a novel way to contain or cure various carcinomas.","Janknecht, Ralf",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20589163/,435

Collectively, these type III effector proteins function to optimize the host cell environment for bacterial growth. Type III effector proteins are essential for the virulence of Pseudomonas syringae, Xanthomonas spp., Ralstonia solanacearum and Erwinia species. Type III secretion systems are also found in nonpathogenic pseudomonads and in species of symbiotic nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium. We discuss the functions of type III effector proteins of plant-associated bacteria, with an emphasis on pathogens. Plant pathogens tend to carry diverse collections of type III effectors that likely share overlapping functions. Several effectors inhibit host defense responses. The eukaryotic host targets of only a few type III effector proteins are currently known. We also discuss possible mechanisms for diversification of the suite of type III effector proteins carried by a given bacterial strain.","Grant, Sarah R; Fisher, Emily J; Chang, Jeff H; Mole, Beth M; Dangl, Jeffery L",Annual review of microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16753033/,435

Here, we investigated the influence of SARS-CoV infection on CXCL8 (interleukin 8) and CXCL10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10) in human intestinal epithelial (Caco2) cells. RT-PCR and ELISA showed time-dependent up-regulation of both chemokines after SARS-CoV infection. Electric mobility shift assay revealed increased DNA binding activity of the cellular transcription factors activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor (B (NF-kappaB) in SARS-CoV infected cells. High hydrocortisone concentrations (> or =50 microg/ml) completely prevented increased DNA binding activity of AP-1 and NF-kappaB and inhibited up-regulation of CXCL8 and CXCL10, but did not reduce chemokine expression to basal levels. Ribavirin that does not inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Caco2 cells at therapeutical concentrations. Hydrocortisone neither influenced SARS-CoV titres alone nor in combination with ribavirin. Our results show that corticosteroids may be of limited benefit in the suppression of chemokine production by SARS-CoV-infected cells.","Cinatl, Jindrich; Michaelis, Martin; Morgenstern, Birgit; Doerr, Hans Wilhelm",International journal of molecular medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15647850/,435

A location where a fatal avian influenza outbreak had occurred 1 year previously was selected for the present study. A total of 3,884 C. nigribarbis were collected, 1,915 of which were marked and released from 4 different collection sites during 2 successive days. The recapture rate of the released C. nigribarbis ranged from 0.014 to 0.029 among the collection sites, and the overall recapture rate was calculated as 0.022. Based on the distance between the released site and the recaptured site, the dispersal rate of C. nigribarbis was estimated as 256 m/h on the 1st day and 179 m/h on the 2nd day of the experiment, and the maximum dispersal rate observed in this study was estimated as 500 m/h. Taking into account the active period of C. nigribarbis on a fine day (7 h/day), the distance traveled by C. nigribarbis within a day was estimated as 1,789 and 1,250 m/day on average for the 1st and 2nd days, respectively, and the maximum distance was 3,500 m/day. These results suggest that C. nigribarbis could play a role in the mechanical dissemination of avian influenza virus and spread of the outbreak in Japan.","Tsuda, Yoshio; Hayashi, Toshihiko; Higa, Yukiko; Hoshino, Keita; Kasai, Shinji; Tomita, Takashi; Kurahashi, Hiromu; Kobayashi, Mutsuo",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19628908/,435

In the past, doctrine dictated that children with URIs have their surgery postponed until the child was symptom free. This practice was based on the empirically supported premise that anesthesia increased the risk of serious complications and complicated the child's postoperative course. Although recent clinical data confirm that some children with URIs are at increased risk of perioperative complications, these complications can, for the most part, be anticipated, recognized, and treated. Although the child with a URI still presents a challenge, anesthesiologists are now in a better position to make informed decisions regarding the assessment and management of these children, such that blanket cancellation has now become a thing of the past.","Tait, Alan R; Malviya, Shobha",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15616052/,435

The recent hospital-based outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has once again highlighted the vulnerability of HCWs. The new epidemic of the 21st century resulted in tremendous economic and psychological impact with its high rates of mortality and nosocomial transmission. Even as the epidemic was brought under control within months, many details about the SARS coronavirus remained a mystery. The threat of another potential global outbreak continues to lurk in the background. Many valuable lessons have been learned through the SARS epidemic. It is, therefore, timely for us to review some of the respiratory pathogens that are well-known to cause nosocomial outbreaks. We need to be better armed to deal with future potential outbreaks and biohazardous situations. The importance of safeguarding the health of our medical staff and the community cannot be over-emphasised.

201335,Mental Disorders Associated with COVID-19 Related Unemployment,2021,"Infection of SCID mice with a recombinant murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]) expressing the T-cell chemoattractant CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) resulted in increased survival and reduced viral burden within the brain and liver compared to those of mice infected with an isogenic control virus (MHV), supporting an important role for CXCL10 in innate immune responses following viral infection. Enhanced protection in MHV-CXCL10-infected mice correlated with increased gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by infiltrating natural killer (NK) cells within the brain and reduced liver pathology. To explore the underlying mechanisms associated with protection from disease in MHV-CXCL10-infected mice, the functional contributions of the NK cell-activating receptor NKG2D in host defense were examined. The administration of an NKG2D-blocking antibody to MHV-CXCL10-infected mice did not reduce survival, dampen IFN-gamma production in the brain, or affect liver pathology. However, NKG2D neutralization increased viral titers within the liver, suggesting a protective role for NKG2D signaling in this organ. These data indicate that (i) CXCL10 enhances innate immune responses, resulting in protection from MHV-induced neurological and liver disease; (ii) elevated NK cell IFN-gamma expression in the brain of MHV-CXCL10-infected mice occurs independently of NKG2D; and (iii) NKG2D signaling promotes antiviral activity within the livers of MHV-infected mice that is not dependent on IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion.","Walsh, Kevin B; Lodoen, Melissa B; Edwards, Robert A; Lanier, Lewis L; Lane, Thomas E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094157/,435

In the present contribution we study, by all-atom equilibrium and enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, the interaction between the SARS Unique Domain and RNA guanine quadruplexes, a process involved in eluding the defensive response of the host thus favoring viral infection of human cells. Our results evidence two stable binding modes involving an interaction site spanning either the protein dimer interface or only one monomer. The free energy profile unequivocally points to the dimer mode as the thermodynamically favored one. The effect of these binding modes in stabilizing the protein dimer was also assessed, being related to its biological role in assisting the SARS viruses to bypass the host protective response. This work also constitutes a first step in the possible rational design of efficient therapeutic agents aiming at perturbing the interaction between SARS Unique Domain and guanine quadruplexes, hence enhancing the host defenses against the virus.","Hognon, Cécilia; Miclot, Tom; Garci A-Iriepa, Cristina; Francés-Monerris, Antonio; Grandemange, Stephanie; Terenzi, Alessio; Marazzi, Marco; Barone, Giampaolo; Monari, Antonio",J Phys Chem Lett,,435

A protein complex (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells; NF-&#954;B) is intricately involved in regulating inflammation and the immune response following viral infections, with a reduction in cytokine production often observed following a decrease in NF-&#954;B activity. An approved asthma drug, montelukast, has been found to modulate the activity of NF-&#954;B, and result in a corresponding decrease in proinflammatory mediators. Herein, we hypothesize that repurposing montelukast to suppress NF-&#954;B activation will result in an attenuation of proinflammatory mediators and a decrease in cytokine production, thereby leading to a reduction in symptom severity and to improved clinical outcomes in patients with Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).","Sanghai, Nitesh; Tranmer, Geoffrey K",Drug discov. today,,435
204673,Managing chronic pain patients at the time of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Bronx has the highest prevalence of asthma in the United States (US), and was also an early COVID-19 epicenter, making it a unique study location Worldwide reports describe significant declines in pediatric emergency department (PED) visits during COVID-19 The ongoing impact of COVID-19 on all PED presentations, including asthma, at an early epicenter has not been studied beyond the pandemic peak and into the early phases of state re-opening OBJECTIVES: To compare PED health-seeking behaviors and clinical characteristics during the 2020 pandemic and subsequent initial New York State (NYS) phased re-opening to the same period in 2019 METHODS: Retrospective chart review of children &lt;21 years utilizing the PED at a high-volume quaternary children's hospital in The Bronx, NY from March 15th 2020 - July 6th 2020 (pandemic cohort) and the same interval in 2019 (comparison cohort) Visits were assigned to pre-determined diagnostic categories Demographic and clinical data were compared RESULTS: 19,981 visits were included Visits declined by 66% during 2020 Proportions of asthma visits (2% vs 7%, p &lt; 0 0001) and minor medical problems (61% vs 67%, p &lt; 0 0001) had significant declines in the pandemic cohort, while major medical problems (13% vs 8%, p &lt; 0 0001), appendicitis (1% vs 0 4%, p &lt; 0 0001) and other surgical complaints (1% vs 0 5%, p &lt; 0 0001) had proportional increases in the pandemic cohort No significant proportional changes were noted among psychosocial and trauma groups between the two cohorts CONCLUSION: The pandemic cohort experienced a substantial decrease in PED volume, but an increase in acuity and admission rates, which was sustained through the NYS phase-II re-opening Despite being located in an asthma hub, the incidence of asthma-related PED visits declined appreciably in the pandemic cohort Future studies examining the effects of indoor allergens in isolation on pediatric asthma are warranted","Levene, R.; Fein, D.

The aim of the study was to develop a prognostic model to predict the severity of COVID-19 at the time of diagnosis and determine risk factors for severe disease. MethodsAll SARS-CoV-2-positive adults in Iceland were prospectively enrolled into a telehealth service at diagnosis. A multivariable proportional-odds logistic regression model was derived from information obtained during the enrollment interview with those diagnosed before May 1, 2020 and validated in those diagnosed between May 1 and December 31, 2020. Outcomes were defined on an ordinal scale; no need for escalation of care during follow-up, need for outpatient visit, hospitalization, and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Risk factors were summarized as odds ratios (OR) adjusted for confounders identified by a directed acyclic graph. ResultsThe prognostic model was derived from and validated in 1,625 and 3,131 individuals, respectively. In total, 375 (7.9%) only required outpatient visits, 188 (4.0%) were hospitalized and 50 (1.1%) were either admitted to ICU or died due to complications of COVID-19. The model included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), current smoking, underlying conditions, and symptoms and clinical severity score at enrollment. Discrimination and calibration were excellent for outpatient visit or worse (C-statistic 0.75, calibration intercept 0.04 and slope 0.93) and hospitalization or worse (C-statistic 0.81, calibration intercept 0.16 and slope 1.03). Age was the strongest risk factor for adverse outcomes with OR of 75-compared to 45-year-olds, ranging from 5.29-17.3. Higher BMI consistently increased the risk and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease correlated with worse outcomes. ConclusionOur prognostic model can accurately predict the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection using information that is available at the time of diagnosis.","Eythorsson, Elias; Bjarnadottir, Valgerdur; Runolfsdottir, Hrafnhildur Linnet; Helgason, Dadi; Ingvarsson, Ragnar Freyr; Bjornsson, Helgi K; Olafsdottir, Lovisa Bjork; Bjarnadottir, Solveig; Agustsson, Arnar Snaer; Oskarsdottir, Kristin; Thorvaldsson, Hrafn Hliddal; Kristjansdottir, Gudrun; Bjornsson, Aron Hjalti; Emilsdottir, Arna R; Armannsdottir, Brynja; Gudlaugsson, Olafur; Hansdottir, Sif; Gottfredsson, Magnus; Bjarnason, Agnar; Sigurdsson, Martin I; Indridason, Olafur S; Palsson, Runolfur",,,435

To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on mental health problems among patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and major influencing factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals. From February 23, 2020, to February 26, 2020, we obtained sociodemographic and clinical characteristics information of COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital (Wuhan, China) and assessed their mental health status and sleep quality. Data were obtained with an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a set of items on demographic characteristics, a set of items on clinical characteristics, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Three hundred seven COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital participated in this study. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 18.6% and 13.4%, respectively. Poor sleep quality and having &#8805; two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms. Female sex, having a family member with confirmed COVID-19, and having &#8805; two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were found to be common among COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital, with some patients being at high risk.","Dai, Ling-Ling; Wang, Xi; Jiang, Tian-Ci; Li, Peng-Fei; Wang, Yu; Wu, Shu-Jun; Jia, Liu-Qun; Liu, Meng; An, Lin; Cheng, Zhe",PLoS One,,435

208971,Dermatology patients' knowledge and concerns regarding their immunomodulatory medication during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been hypothesized to be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer; however, results of epidemiological studies have been mixed. Few studies have investigated these associations among African American women. METHODS: To assess the relation of aspirin use to risk of breast cancer in African American women, we conducted a prospective analysis within the Black Women's Health Study, an ongoing nationwide cohort study of 59,000 African American women. On baseline and follow-up questionnaires, women reported regular use of aspirin (defined as use at least 3 days per week) and years of use. During follow-up from 1995 through 2017, 1919 invasive breast cancers occurred, including 1112 ER+, 569 ER-, and 284 triple-negative (TN) tumors. We used age-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of aspirin use with risk of ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, adjusted for established breast cancer risk factors. RESULTS: Overall, the HR for current regular use of aspirin relative to non-use was 0.92 (95% CI 0.81, 1.04). For ER+, ER-, and TN breast cancer, corresponding HRs were 0.98 (0.84, 1.15), 0.81 (0.64, 1.04), and 0.70 (0.49, 0.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings with regard to ER- and TN breast cancer are consistent with hypothesized inflammatory mechanisms of ER- and TN breast cancer, rather than hormone-dependent pathways. Aspirin may represent a potential opportunity for chemoprevention of ER- and TN breast cancer.","Bertrand, Kimberly A; Bethea, Traci N; Gerlovin, Hanna; Coogan, Patricia F; Barber, Lauren; Rosenberg, Lynn; Palmer, Julie R",Breast Cancer Res,,435

In this study, we examined the clinical outcome of our KTRs with Covid-19 disease, who were treated with a broad-spectrum antiinflammatory protocol. METHOD: Among 809 KTRs, 64 patients diagnosed with Covid-19 disease between April 2020 and February 2021,were evaluated. 29 patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest computed tomography (CCT), were hospitalized. The treatment protocol included high dose intravenous methylprednisolone, favipiravir,enoxaparin and an empirical antibiotics. Patients with pneumonic involvement of more than 25% on CCT with or without respiratory failure,were given a total of 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. Non-responders received tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antibody. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients with pneumonia, 6 were treated in other hospitals. None of them received IVIg and 5 of them deceased. In our center, IVIg treatment was applied to 15 of 23 patients. 7 of them required tocilizumab. Respiratory parameters improved significantly in all but one patients after IVIg ± tocilizumab treatment. The mortality rate was 6.6% in patients who received IVIg therapy and 35.7% in those who did not (p = 0.08). Mortality rate was higher in patients who received treatment in external centers (2.2% vs 26.3%; p=0.0073). CONCLUSION: The treatment of KTRs with severe Covid-19 pneumonia in organ transplant centers with significant experience yields better results. The administration of broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatment in this patient group was safe and provided excellent outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

213774,Reflections on changing times for pediatric integrated primary care during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 has sparked a debate on the vulnerability of densely populated cities. Some studies argue that high-density urban centers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases due to a higher chance of infection in crowded urban environments. Other studies, however, argue that connectivity rather than population density plays a more significant role in the spread of COVID-19. While several studies have examined the role of urban density and connectivity in Europe and the U.S., few studies have been conducted in Asian countries. This study aims to investigate the role of urban spatial structure on COVID-19 by comparing different measures of urban density and connectivity during the first eight months of the outbreak in Korea. Two measures of density were derived from the Korean census, and four measures of connectivity were computed using social network analysis of the Origin-Destination data from the 2020 Korea Transport Database. We fitted both OLS and negative binomial models to the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients and its infection rates at the county level, collected individually from regional government websites in Korea. Results show that both density and connectivity play an important role in the proliferation of the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea. However, we found that the connectivity measure, particularly a measure of network centrality, was a better indicator of COVID-19 proliferation than the density measures. Our findings imply that policies that take into account different types of connectivity between cities might be necessary to contain the outbreak in the early phase.","Jo, Yun; Hong, Andy; Sung, Hyungun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,435
213849,Challenges in control of Covid-19: short doubling time and long delay to effect of interventions,2020-03-31,"Malaria remains a major global health burden, killing hundreds of thousands annually, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In December 2019, a novel illness termed COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, was reported in China. This disease soon spread around the world and was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. Considering that the malaria burden is high in many low-income tropical countries with little capacity to fund malaria control and eradication programs, the fight against malaria in these regions is likely to be hindered by COVID-19. Indeed, access to health care has generally been limited during the pandemic, whereas malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemoprevention, and distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets, have been suspended because of lockdowns. Likewise, the repurposing of antimalarials for the treatment of COVID-19 and a shift in focus from the production of malaria rapid diagnostic tests to COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests are causes for concern in malaria-endemic regions. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected developed countries, threatening their capacity to aid in malaria control efforts. Here, we address impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management and control of malaria in Africa.","Aborode, Abdullahi Tunde; David, Kenneth Bitrus; Uwishema, Olivier; Nathaniel, Agbendeh Lubem; Imisioluwa, Jegede Oluwatoyin; Onigbinde, Sherifdeen Bamidele; Farooq, Fozia",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,435

COVID-19 puts into stark relief the mutual obligations that reflect interdependence among participants in a common society.

Social justice in catastrophe requires strong social insurance structures and legal protections for the most vulnerable people, who would otherwise lack economic resources and political influence to protect their essential interests. Social justice also requires greater and more sustained attention to disaster preparedness and public health infrastructure-both of which are characteristically neglected, in part because the public health enterprise is identified with politically weak and often stigmatized populations.","Pollack, Harold A",J Health Polit Policy Law,,435

Cardiac complications secondary to this infection are common and associated with mortality. This study aimed to evaluate whether subclinical myocardial dysfunction exists in non-hospitalized mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients using left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS). In this cross-sectional, single-center study, data were collected from non-hospitalized mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients between January 01 and February 01, 2021. Fifty (26 male, 24 female) COVID-19 patients and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were included in the study. Apical four-, three-, and two-chamber images were analyzed longitudinally by conventional methods and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) for left ventricle functions. The mean age of the COVID-19 patients was 39.5 ± 8.96, and 52% of them were male. The most prevalent presenting symptoms were fever [in 34 (68%)], asthenia [in 30 (60%)], loss of appetite [in 21 (42%)], myalgia [in 20 (40%)], and cough [in 13 (26%)]. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the controls (10.84 ± 12.44 vs. 4.50 ± 2.81, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of standard echocardiography and Doppler parameters (p > 0.05). Left ventricular longitudinal strain and strain velocity parameters were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals. LV-GLS values (- 21.72 ± 3.85% vs. - 23.11 ± 4.16%; p = 0.003) were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared with the healthy controls. Mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients also have subclinical myocardial dysfunction similar to hospitalized patients. STE has the potential for detecting subclinical LV systolic dysfunction, and can provide useful information regarding cardiac status in mildly symptomatic COVID-19 population.","Gul, Murat; Inci, Sinan; Aktas, Halil; Yildirim, Oguz; Alsancak, Yakup",Int. j. cardiovasc. imaging,,435

We describe outcomes in children with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir. METHODS: Seventy-seven hospitalized patients <18 years old with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection received remdesivir through a compassionate-use program between March 21 and April 22, 2020. The intended remdesivir treatment course was 10 days (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg daily subsequently for children &#8805;40 kg and 5 mg/kg on day 1 and 2.5 mg/kg daily subsequently for children <40 kg, given intravenously). Clinical data through 28 days of follow-up were collected. RESULTS: Median age was 14 years (interquartile range 7-16, range <2 months to 17 years). Seventy-nine percent of patients had &#8805;1 comorbid condition. At baseline, 90% of children required supplemental oxygen and 51% required invasive ventilation. By day 28 of follow-up, 88% of patients had a decreased oxygen-support requirement, 83% recovered, and 73% were discharged. Among children requiring invasive ventilation at baseline, 90% were extubated, 80% recovered, and 67% were discharged. There were 4 deaths, of which 3 were attributed to COVID-19. Remdesivir was well tolerated, with a low incidence of serious adverse events (16%). Most adverse events were related to COVID-19 or comorbid conditions. Laboratory abnormalities, including elevations in transaminase levels, were common; 61% were grades 1 or 2. CONCLUSIONS: Among 77 children treated with remdesivir for severe COVID-19, most recovered and the rate of serious adverse events was low.","Goldman, David L; Aldrich, Margaret L; Hagmann, Stefan H F; Bamford, Alasdair; Camacho-Gonzalez, Andres; Lapadula, Giuseppe; Lee, Philip; Bonfanti, Paolo; Carter, Christoph C; Zhao, Yang; Telep, Laura; Pikora, Cheryl; Naik, Sarjita; Marshall, Neal; Katsarolis, Ioannis; Das, Moupali; DeZure, Adam; Desai, Polly; Cao, Huyen; Chokkalingam, Anand P; Osinusi, Anu; Brainard, Diana M; Méndez-Echevarría, Ana",Pediatrics,,435

219729,Factors Associated With Adherence to COVID-19 Preventive Measures Among Saudi Arabians,2021,"BACKGROUND: Etiopathogenesis of the clinical variability of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains mostly unknown. Here we investigate the role of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)/Human Leukocyte Antigen Class-I (HLA-I) interactions in the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: KIR and HLA-I genotyping and NK cell (NKc) receptors immunophenotyping in 201 symptomatic patients and 210 non-infected controls. RESULTS: NKcs with a distinctive immunophenotype, suggestive of recent activation (KIR2DS4 low CD16 low CD226 low CD56 high TIGIT high NKG2A high), expanded in patients with severe COVID-19. This was associated with a higher frequency of the functional A-telomeric activating KIR2DS4 in severe than mild/moderate patients and controls (83.7%, 55.7% and 36.2%, p&lt;7.7x10 -9). In mild/moderate patients HLA-B*15:01 was associated with higher frequencies of activating B-telomeric KIR3DS1 compared to patients with other HLA-B*15 subtypes and non-infected controls (90.9%, 42.9% and 47.3%, p&lt;0.002, Pc=0.022). This strongly suggests that HLA-B*15:01 specifically presenting SARS-CoV-2 peptides could form a neo-ligand interacting with KIR3DS1. Similarly, a putative neo-ligand for KIR2DS4 could arise from other HLA-I molecules presenting SARS-CoV-2 peptides expressed on infected/activated lung antigen presenting cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a crucial role of NKcs in the clinical variability of COVID-19 with specific KIR/Ligand interactions associated to disease severity.","Bernal, E.; Gimeno, L.; Alcaraz, M.

Heart murmurs are the most common abnormalities detected during the auscultation process. The two widely used publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) datasets are from the PhysioNet/CinC (2016) and PASCAL (2011) challenges. The datasets are significantly different in terms of the tools used for data acquisition, clinical protocols, digital storages and signal qualities, making it challenging to process and analyze. In this work, we have used short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based spectrograms to learn the representative patterns of the normal and abnormal PCG signals. Spectrograms generated from both the datasets are utilized to perform three different studies: (i) train, validate and test different variants of convolutional neural network (CNN) models with PhysioNet dataset, (ii) train, validate and test the best performing CNN structure on combined PhysioNet-PASCAL dataset and (iii) finally, transfer learning technique is employed to train the best performing pre-trained network from the first study with PASCAL dataset. We propose a novel, less complex and relatively light custom CNN model for the classification of PhysioNet, combined and PASCAL datasets. The first study achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 95.4%, 96.3%, 92.4%, 97.6% and 96.98% respectively while the second study shows accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 94.2%, 95.5%, 90.3%, 96.8% and 96.1% respectively. Finally, the third study shows a precision of 98.29% on the noisy PASCAL dataset with transfer learning approach.

This experience seems valuable for further development of telerehabilitation in anticipation of future pandemics or adversarial events since it allows reaching out to patients unable to travel and overcomes the need for regular outpatient visits.","Prada, Valeria; Bellone, Emilia; Schenone, Angelo; Grandis, Marina",Int. j. rehabil. res,,435
223389,"Advantages, limitations and recommendations for online learning during covid-19 pandemic era",2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Virtually all viruses have evolved molecular instruments to circumvent cell mechanisms that may hamper their replication, dissemination, or persistence. Among these is p53, a key gatekeeper for cell division and survival that also regulates innate immune responses. This review summarizes the strategies used by different viruses and discusses the mechanisms deployed by SARS-CoV to target p53 activities. RECENT FINDINGS: We propose a typology for the strategies used by different viruses to address p53 functions: hit and run (e.g. IAV, ZIKV), hide and seek (e.g. HIV1), kidnap and exploit (e.g. EBV, HSV1), dominate and suppress (e.g. HR HPV). We discuss the mechanisms by which SARS nsp3 protein targets p53 for degradation and we speculate on the significance for Covid-19 pathogenesis and risk of cancer. SUMMARY: p53 may operate as an intracellular antiviral defense mechanism. To circumvent it, SARS viruses adopt a kidnap and exploit strategy also shared by several viruses with transforming potential. This raises the question of whether SARS infections may make cells permissive to oncogenic DNA damage.","Cardozo, Camila Martin; Hainaut, Pierre",Curr Opin Oncol,,435

224290,Pragmatic Disease-Focused Checklist for Use During Rounding on Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,2021,"Background: Recently, a large-scale novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak swept China. As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China. Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP. Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies. Method: By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number R 0t proposed by Cori et al. (2013), we use R 0t to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020. In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively. The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results: The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb. 9, 2020. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (R 0t ) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively. After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, R 0t showed a continuous decline trend. On Feb. 9, R 0t has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1. We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R 0t . We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R 0t . Conclusion: The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R 0t is still larger than the threshold 1. The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan. Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP.

227085,Emerging COVID-19-related deaths during home recuperation in Japan,2021,"The expanding scope of physiotherapists has come with an increased level of responsibility to identify 'red flag' signs and symptoms. Red flags can indicate the presence of serious pathology but are notoriously unreliable. This leaves diagnosis heavily reliant on diagnostic investigations which are generally a finite resource within healthcare organisations. The COVID pandemic seems to have further compounded the problem and the possibility of 'missed' or 'delayed' diagnosis is ever-present. This may present a threat to patients' lives, to clinicians' careers and wellbeing, and to organisations' finances and reputations. Although clinical risk in musculoskeletal physiotherapy may never be eliminated, there are opportunities to work towards minimising it. This professional issue will explore the complex problem of identifying serious pathology in musculoskeletal care and will propose strategies to manage the associated risks during the COVID pandemic and beyond.

Cryogels functionalized with amino acids were prepared and characterized through morphological, hydrodynamic, and thermal analyses. The adsorption capacities of cryogel-Phe and cryogel-Trp were evaluated in terms of type (sodium sulfate or sodium phosphate) and concentration (0.02 or 0.10â¯molâL-1) of saline solution, pH (4.0, 5.5, or 7.0), and NaCl concentration (0.0 or 0.5â¯molâL-1). The cryogel-Phe presented a higher adsorptive capacity, achieving its maximum value (qâ¯=â¯92.53â¯mgâg-1) when the crude OPN crude leaf extract was diluted in sodium sulfate 0.02â¯molâL-1â¯+â¯NaCl 0.50â¯molâL-1, at pHâ¯=â¯7.0. The dilution rate significantly (pâ¯<â¯0.05) affected the recovered protein amount after the adsorption and elution processes, reaching 94.45% when the feedstock solution was prepared with a crude extract 5 times.

229965,How governments manage personal assistance schemes in response to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: A Scoping Review,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in severe pressure on the existing medical infrastructure in China. Several Chinese cities began to construct temporary hospitals for the centralized treatment of COVID-19 patients. The harmful exhaust air from the outlets of these hospitals may have a significant adverse impact on the fresh-air intakes and surrounding environment. Owing to the need to rapidly construct these hospitals within 6-10 days, just a few hours are allowed for the analysis of the impact of this exhaust air on the environment. To overcome this difficulty, a high-efficiency simulation framework is proposed in this study. Based on the open-source computational fluid dynamics software, FDS, the proposed framework is adaptive and incorporates building information with different levels of detail during various design phases of the hospital, and has been applied in the design of theWuhan Huoshenshan Hospital, the first typical COVID-19 temporary hospital in China. According to the simulation results, neither the fresh-air intakes nor the surrounding buildings would be polluted by the harmful air discharged from the air outlets of the Huoshenshan hospital. The proposed simulation framework can provide a reference for the design and overall planning of similar hospitals in China and other affected countries.","Gu, Donglian; Zheng, Zhe; Zhao, Pengju; Xie, Linlin; Xu, Zhen; Lu, Xinzheng",Appl.

METHODS: Data were drawn from a prospective cohort study of Los Angeles, California, high school students. At baseline (mean age = 14.6 years), students completed self-report screening measures of problem alcohol, cannabis, and drug use and 6 mental health problems (major depression, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and hypomania or mania). Past 6-month nonmedical prescription opioid use (yes or no) was assessed across 7 semiannual follow-ups. RESULTS: Among baseline never users of nonmedical prescription opioids (N = 3204), average past 6-month prevalence of new nonmedical prescription opioid use across the 42-month follow-up was 4.4% (range 3.5%-6.1%). In a multivariable model co-adjusting for 9 baseline behavioral problems and other factors, major depression, hypomania or mania, cannabis, alcohol, and other drug use problems were associated with increased odds of nonmedical prescription opioid use over follow-ups. Cumulative indices of behavioral health comorbidity showed successively greater odds of subsequent nonmedical prescription opioid use for students with 1 (odds ratio [OR]: 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.79-5.01), 2 (OR: 8.79; 95% CI: 5.95-12.99), or 3 (OR: 9.69; 95% CI: 5.63-16.68) vs 0 baseline substance use problems, and similar increases were associated with increasing number of mental health problems (1 [OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.03-2.88] to all 6 [OR: 3.98; 95% CI: 1.09-14.82] vs 0). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral health problems may be associated with increased risk of subsequent nonmedical prescription opioid use during mid to late adolescence, with successively greater risk for those with greater behavioral health comorbidity. In pediatric clinical practice or school-based prevention, behavioral health screeners may be useful for identifying youth at high risk for nonmedical prescription opioid use.","Cho, Junhan; Kelley-Quon, Lorraine I; Barrington-Trimis, Jessica L; Kechter, Afton; Axeen, Sarah; Leventhal, Adam M",Pediatrics,,435

While declines of most air pollutants have been globally evidenced in most cities worldwide, there is few detailed spatial knowledge at local scale. Therefore, we present here a high resolution mapping of the 2018-2020 evolution of human activities and air pollutants in Wuhan. Human activities were assessed by nighttime light radiance. We measured the air quality index (AQI) as the maximum value among air quality sub-indices of SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and particulate matter. We also compared mean monthly pollutant concentration during January-April in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Mapping results show that variations of nighttime light radiance were heterogenous at local scale, showing both rises and declines in the same district. The radiance decreased in eight districts located mostly in the city center, as a result of lower human activity, but the radiance increased in the five surrounding districts, as a consequence of people staying at home. AQI was low during lockdown, averaging at 57, but showed strong daily variations with a slight pollution around February 5 with AQI rising to 126. During this pollution event, particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO levels were positively correlated, suggesting common sources, but were not correlated with ozone; and particulate matter, SO2, NO2 and CO decreased with relative humidity, suggesting removal by precipitation. Comparison of 2020 data with previous years shows that particulate matter and NO2 were highly reduced, CO was less reduced due to ongoing power industries, SO2 first declined then increased to exceed 2018-19 values due to coal combustion, and ozone levels was more abundant due both to less NOx pollution and the weekend effect.

I combine the European Union's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) with the Stay-at-Home Restriction Index (SHRI) from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) dataset for January-May 2020. The results of a series of difference-in-difference regression models reveal that the severity of stay-at-home restrictions increased overall food prices by 1% in March 2020, compared to January and February 2020. The price level for food continued to rise in the high stay-at-home restriction countries relative to thier counterpart in April but stabilised in May. The food categories that witnessed the most significant surges in prices were meat, fish & seafood, and vegetables. The prices of bread & cereals, fruits, milk, cheese & eggs and oils & fats were not significantly affected. The correlations between food prices and stay-at-home restrictions were significant after controlling for cross-country variations in COVID-19 affectedness and other mitigation and adaptation measures, such as international travel controls, road closures and the size of the economic stimulus packages.

The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children. METHODS: We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild.

Although replication-defective in normal cells, 28 kbp of adenovirus genes is delivered to the cell nucleus alongside the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein gene. METHODS: We used direct RNA sequencing to analyse transcript expression from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 genome in human MRC-5 and A549 cell lines that are non-permissive for vector replication alongside the replication permissive cell line, HEK293. In addition, we used quantitative proteomics to study over time the proteome and phosphoproteome of A549 and MRC5 cells infected with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. RESULTS: The expected SARS-CoV-2 S coding transcript dominated in all cell lines. We also detected rare S transcripts with aberrant splice patterns or polyadenylation site usage. Adenovirus vector transcripts were almost absent in MRC-5 cells, but in A549 cells, there was a broader repertoire of adenoviral gene expression at very low levels. Proteomically, in addition to S glycoprotein, we detected multiple adenovirus proteins in A549 cells compared to just one in MRC5 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine's transcriptomic and proteomic repertoire in cell culture is as expected. The combined transcriptomic and proteomics approaches provide a detailed insight into the behaviour of this important class of vaccine using state-of-the-art techniques and illustrate the potential of this technique to inform future viral vaccine vector design.","Almuqrin, Abdulaziz; Davidson, Andrew D; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Lewis, Philip A; Heesom, Kate J; Morris, Susan; Gilbert, Sarah C; Matthews, David A",Genome Med,,435
240332,Restoring trust: COVID-19 and the future of long-term care in Canada,2020,"MDSC are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that are released by biological stress such as tissue damage and inflammation. Conventionally, MDSC are known for their detrimental role in chronic inflammation and neoplastic conditions. However, their intrinsic functions in immunoregulation, wound healing, and angiogenesis are intended to protect from over-reactive immune responses, maintenance of immunotolerance, tissue repair, and homeostasis. Paradoxically, under certain conditions, MDSC can impair protective immune responses and exacerbate the disease. The transition from protective to harmful MDSC is most likely driven by environmental and epigenetic mechanisms induced by prolonged exposure to unresolved inflammatory triggers. Here, we review several examples of the dual impact of MDSC in conditions such as maternal-fetal tolerance, self-antigens immunotolerance, obesity-associated cancer, sepsis and trauma. Moreover, we also highlighted the evidence indicating that MDSC have a role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Finally, we have summarized the evidence indicating epigenetic mechanisms associated with MDSC function.","Sanchez-Pino, Maria Dulfary; Dean, Matthew J; Ochoa, Augusto C",Cell Immunol,,435
240514,The Connection between Bipolar Spectrum Disorders and Eating Disorders,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants might lead to European border closures, which impact on trade and result in serious economic losses. In April 2020, similar border closures were observed during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave in East Africa. MAIN BODY: Since 2017 the East African Community EAC together with the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine BNITM established a mobile laboratory network integrated into the National Public Health Laboratories of the six Partner States for molecular diagnosis of viral haemorrhagic fevers and SARS-CoV-2. Since May 2020, the National Public Health Laboratories of Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and South Sudan deployed these mobile laboratories to their respective borders, issuing a newly developed ""Electronic EAC COVID-19 Digital Certificate"" to SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative truck drivers, thus assuring regional trade. CONCLUSION: Considering the large financial damages of border closures, such a mobile laboratory network as demonstrated in East Africa is cost-effective, easy to implement and feasible. The East African Community mobile laboratory network could serve as a blueprint for Europe and other countries around the globe.","Gehre, Florian; Lagu, Hakim; Achol, Emmanuel; Katende, Michael; May, Jürgen; Affara, Muna",Global Health,,435

240808,Prevalence of various psychological disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: Systematic review,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to describe time intervals between pessary maintenance visits in racially diverse women receiving care in a U.S. epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We secondarily aimed to determine whether time interval between pessary changes is associated with adverse outcomes and to identify factors associated with adverse pessary outcomes. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of women undergoing pessary care after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Time between the most recent visit before the pandemic and first visit after the pandemic began was recorded. Pessary care data were collected from the latter visit, including vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, and erosion. Patient-reported symptoms and demographics were also recorded. The relationship between time interval between pessary visits and adverse outcomes as well as between adverse outcomes and demographic data was assessed. RESULTS: We identified 104 women undergoing pessary care, of which 35.6% were Hispanic and 32.7% were Black and 26.2% ± 10.5% lived in poverty. The median time to in-person visit was 4.5 months (interquartile range, 3.7-5.3 months). Seven women (8.7%) had vaginal bleeding, 15 (14.6%) had vaginal discharge, and 7 (6.8%) had erosions. There was no significant association between time interval between pessary visits and adverse outcomes or between adverse outcomes and patient characteristics (all P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Longer duration of time between pessary maintenance visits is not associated with increased adverse outcomes in this group of racially diverse women. Extended intervals between pessary visits can be considered to minimize risk and maintain patient safety during challenging circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Halani, Priyanka Kadam; Gelman, Eden; Duchein, Yvette; Roselli, Nicole; Leegant, Ava",Female pelvic med. reconstr. surg.

242240,Look Before You Leap: Interventions Supervised via Telehealth Involving Activities in Weight-Bearing or Standing Positions for People After Stroke-A Scoping Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: The global onset of COVID-19 has resulted in substantial public health and socioeconomic impacts. An immediate medical breakthrough is needed. However, parallel to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the proliferation of information regarding the pandemic, which, if uncontrolled, cannot only mislead the public but also hinder the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders in mitigating the effect of this pandemic. It is known that media communications can affect public perception and attitude toward medical treatment, vaccination, or subject matter, particularly when the population has limited knowledge on the subject. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to systematically scrutinize media communications (Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts) to understand the prevailing sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. METHODS: A total of 637 Twitter posts and 569 Google News headlines or descriptions, retrieved between February 2 and May 5, 2020, were analyzed using three standard computational linguistics models (ie, TextBlob, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, and Word2Vec combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network). RESULTS: Our findings revealed that, contrary to general perceptions, Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts within the stated period were generally passive or positive toward COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. It was possible to understand these patterns in light of increasingly sustained efforts by various media and health actors in ensuring the availability of factual information about the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This type of analysis could contribute to understanding predominant polarities and associated potential attitudinal inclinations. Such knowledge could be critical in informing relevant public health and media engagement policies.","Gbashi, Sefater; Adebo, Oluwafemi Ayodeji; Doorsamy, Wesley; Njobeh, Patrick Berka",JMIR Med Inform,,435

To further understand the disease pathogenesis and, consequently, to develop an additional tool for clinicians to evaluate patients for presumptive intervention, we sought to compare plasma cytokine levels between a range of donor and patient samples grouped by a COVID-19 Severity Score (CSS) based on the need for hospitalization and oxygen requirement. Here we utilize a mutual information algorithm that classifies the information gain for CSS prediction provided by cytokine expression levels and clinical variables. Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness. The variables that were the most predictive of CSS included clinical variables such as age and abnormal chest x-ray as well as cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-inducible protein 10, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a plethora of changes in cytokine profiles and that particularly in severely ill patients, these changes are consistent with the presence of macrophage activation syndrome and could furthermore be used as a biomarker to predict disease severity.","Huntington, Kelsey E; Louie, Anna D; Lee, Chun Geun; Elias, Jack A; Ross, Eric A; El-Deiry, Wafik S",eLife (Cambridge),,435

Here we derive a simple, closed-form formula for the apparent surface charge (ASC), as well as for the electric field generated by a molecular charge distribution in aqueous solution. The approximation, with no fitted parameters, is tested against corresponding numerical solutions of the Poisson equation, where it yields a significant speed-up. For small molecules, the hydration free energies estimated from the closed-form ASC formula are within $0.6$ kcal/mol RMSD from the standard Poisson reference; the electric field at the surface is in quantitative agreement with the reference. Performance of the approximation is also tested on larger structures, including a protein, a DNA fragment, and a protein-protein complex. For all structures tested, a near quantitative agreement with the numerical Poisson reference is achieved, except in regions of high negative curvature, where the new approximation is still qualitatively correct. A unique feature of the proposed ``source-based""closed-form approximation, is that the ASC and the electric field are estimated at any individual point or surface patch, without the need for self-consistent computation over the entire surface or volume.

METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid testing were obtained. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (84.6%) correlated with clustering occurrence. The median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 (8-24 days) and 21.5 days (10-36 days), respectively. The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (nâ =â 16, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2-20 days]) and patients with typical ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT (nâ =â 10, 38.5%; 12.5 days [8-22 days]; Pâ <â .01). Seven patients (70.0%) with initial positive nucleic acid test results had a negative result simultaneously with improved CT findings. Obvious improvement in CT findings was observed in 3 patients (30.0%) despite positive nucleic acid test results. CONCLUSIONS: In asymptomatic patients, changes in biochemical and inflammatory variables are small and changes on chest CT can occur. It is worth noting that the long existence of SARS-CoV-2 in some asymptomatic patients and false-negative results need to be considered in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test.","Pan, Yanfeng; Yu, Xue; Du, Xinwei; Li, Qingqing; Li, Xianyang; Qin, Tao; Wang, Miaomiao; Jiang, Minlin; Li, Jie; Li, Weiguo; Zhang, Qian; Xu, Zhiwei; Zhang, Lu",J Infect Dis,,435

As treatment of COVID-19 modern medicine system, is working on trial and error basis but no specific line of treatment/vaccine has been found till date. Ayurveda is a science of life and its basic concepts were evolved during the Vedic period. These concepts were crystallized, refined and advanced further in Samhita’s. The law of uniformity of nature was established by our Acharya’s, which helped in applying the physical laws to the biological field. The entire nature was their laboratory, and their keen observation and divine vision worked as their instruments to arrive at scientific truths. Disease-free condition is the best sources of virtue, wealth, gratification and emancipation while diseases are destroyers of all these sources, welfare and life itself. Samhita’s are the most popular texts of ancient essence, and very few are available in complete form.

The dynamic range and lowest detected quantity was determined using a SARS-CoV-2 partial N gene RNA transcript dilution series (100,000-1 copy/µl) and verified using 72 nose and throat swabs, 29 of which tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Assay C consistently detected the lowest quantity of partial N gene RNA transcript with all mastermixes. The Takara One Step PrimeScript&#8482; III RT-PCR Kit mastermix enabled all primer pairs to detect the entire dynamic range evaluated, with the Qiagen Quantifast and Thermofisher TaqPath 1-Step kits also performing well. Sequences from all three primer/probe sets tested in this study (assay A, B and C) have 100 % homology to &#8805;97 % of the of SARS-CoV-2 sequences available up to 31st December 2020 (n = 291,483 sequences). CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that specific assays (in this case assay C) can perform well in terms of dynamic range and lowest detected quantity regardless of the mastermix used. However we also show that, by choosing the most appropriate mastermix, poorer performing primer pairs are also able to detect all of the template dilutions investigated. This work increases the potential options when choosing assays for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and provides solutions to enable them to work with optimal analytical sensitivity.","Brown, Julianne R; O039,; Sullivan, Denise M; Shah, Divya; Atkinson, Laura; Pereira, Rui P A; Whale, Alexandra S; Busby, Eloise J; Huggett, Jim F; Harris, Kathryn",J Virol Methods,,435

MethodsThis prospective cohort study was conducted using a self-administrated questionnaire in Japan. SES, personal characteristics, and occupation of recruited workers were surveyed at baseline (December 22-25, 2020); subsequent unemployment was examined at follow-up (February 18-19, 2021). We determined the odds ratios (ORs) of unemployment for SES and other variables using a multilevel logistic model. ResultsAmong all 19,941 participants, 2.3% reported experience of unemployment through negative reasons. Multivariate analysis showed the OR and 95% confidence interval for unemployment associated with age to be 0.66 (0.47-0.92) for 30-39 years, 0.36 (0.25-0.51) for 40-49, 0.36 (0.25-0.53) for 50-59, and 0.43 (0.27-0.67) for more than 60 compared with 20-29 years. The association with annual household income was 2.96 (1.94-4.50) for <2 million yen and 1.51 (1.03-2.22) for 2-4 million yen compared with >10 million yen. The association with marital status was 1.43 (1.04-1.98) for bereaved/divorced compared with married (working spouse). The association with occupation was 1.75 (1.35-2.29) for temporary or contract employees and 2.11 (1.04-4.30) for agriculture, forestry, or fishing compared with general employees. The association with job type was 1.69 (1.34-2.15) for mainly manual labor. ConclusionWe observed a relationship between SES and subsequent unemployment under COVID-19.

In this study, we designed and validated a PREM to assess tolerability of endoscopy using conscious sedation. METHODS: The patient-reported scale for tolerability of endoscopic procedures (PRO-STEP) consists of questions within 2 domains and is administered to outpatients at discharge from the endoscopy unit. Domain 1 (intraprocedural) consists of 2 questions regarding discomfort/pain and awareness, whereas Domain 2 (postprocedural) consists of 4 questions including pain, nausea, distention and either throat or anal pain. All questions are scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 10. Cronbach's alpha was used to measure internal consistency of the questions. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of higher scores, reported using adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 255 patients (91 colonoscopy, 73 gastroscopy, and 91 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) were included. Colonoscopy was the least tolerable procedure by recall, with mean intraprocedural awareness and discomfort scores of 5.1 +/- 3.8, and 2.6 +/- 2.7, respectively. Consistency between intraprocedural awareness and discomfort/pain yielded an acceptable Cronbach's alpha of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62 - 0.78). Higher use of midazolam during colonoscopy was inversely associated with an intraprocedural awareness score of 7 or higher (AOR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.54 per additional mg). CONCLUSIONS: PRO-STEP is a simple PREM that can be administered after multiple endoscopic procedures using conscious sedation. Future work should focus on its performance characteristics in adverse event prediction.","Forbes, Nauzer; Chau, Millie; Koury, Hannah F; Lethebe, B Cord; Smith, Zachary L; Wani, Sachin; Keswani, Rajesh N; Elmunzer, B Joseph; Anderson, John T; Heitman, Steven J; Hilsden, Robert J",Gastrointest. endosc,,435

This has given an incredible impulse to e-commerce;however, the complexity of the topic has not yet been adequately explored in the literature. To fill this gap, this study has a twofold purpose: (1) to investigate how European countries comparatively perform in e-commerce, and (2) to describe what are the most important challenges for the further expansion of e-commerce. To this end, we adopted a hybrid methodology based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and a Likert scale survey. The first method allows to us rank the e-commerce performance of different European countries, while the second one looks at the problems and barriers that characterize online shopping. The results of the study show that European countries have different sensitivities to the issue of cyber-security, and among them it is possible to identify three groups with different levels of attention to the critical issues of e-commerce. The Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark belong to the group of countries most responsive to e-commerce. This request is part of a broader framework of transition toward sustainable development, i.e., a reliable digital environment where citizens and businesses can exercise their rights and freedoms in complete security. Finally, from a theoretical perspective, this paper adds a new baseline to the literature on the state of the art of e-commerce in Europe that addresses the effects of the pandemic. From a managerial point of view, decision makers can find in the results of this analysis a support for the setting of business strategies for the expansion of firms in certain markets and guidance for public authorities when defining regulatory policies for e-commerce.","Idiano, D’Adamo González-Sánchez Rocío Medina-Salgado Maria Sonia Settembre-Blundo Davide",Sustainability,,435

We also present an analytical comparison of BPFroid to other malware detection methods and demonstrate its usage by developing novel signatures to detect suspicious behavior that are based on it. These signatures are then evaluated using real apps. We also demonstrate how BPFroid can be used to capture forensic artifacts for further investigation.

We describe a non-invasive sensor network that is used for sleep monitoring and evaluate the feasibility of an approach for training a machine learning model to detect possible COVID-19-related sleep disturbances. We also discuss a cloud-based approach for the implementation of the proposed system for processing the data streams. Based on the preliminary results, we conclude that sleep disturbances are detectable with affordable and non-invasive sensors.","Dimitrievski, Ace; Zdravevski, Eftim; Lameski, Petre; Villasana, María Vanessa; Miguel Pires, Ivan; Garcia, Nuno M; Flórez-Revuelta, Francisco; Trajkovik, Vladimir",Sensors (Basel),,435

262445,Cognitive consequences of COVID-19 in older adults with cognitive impairment,2021,"Chaplains' unique contribution is to healthcare is to respond to the spiritual, religious and pastoral needs of patients and staff. This is their sole purpose, to provide a presence and space to meet individual need and promote healing, even when cure isn't possible. Their value is priceless to families in desperate times. However, despite growing evidence for their impact, chaplains are commonly undervalued and misunderstood by their organisations, and the global pandemic revealed the consequences of this confusion. Whilst some chaplains were applauded as heroes along with their fellow health colleagues, others were seen as little more than an infection risk. A survey was designed to capture and learn from the full range of chaplain experiences of the impact of the pandemic across the globe. In June 2020, 1657 chaplains responded from 36 countries. They all experienced considerable disruption to their usual practice, with enforced social distancing having the biggest impact. Out of necessity they embraced technology to maintain contact with patients and families, and shifted focus of their support to staff. Whilst some chaplains were viewed as essential employees by their organisations, most were not. Despite the majority thinking that their organisations understood what they did, chaplains themselves were neither clear or unclear about their role during and post pandemic. More surprisingly, they felt similarly unclear about their role before the pandemic. This paper concludes that in general chaplains lack leadership skills, and confusion about their role will persist until this changes.","Snowden, Austyn",J Pastoral Care Counsel,,435

This study evaluates clinical and nutrition characteristics of severely and critically ill patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and investigates the relationship between nutrition risk and clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted at West Campus of Union Hospital in Wuhan. Patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by a nucleic acid-positive test and identified as severely or critically ill were enrolled in this study. Clinical data and outcomes information were collected and nutrition risk was assessed using Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS). RESULTS: In total, 413 patients were enrolled in this study, including 346 severely and 67 critically ill patients. Most patients, especially critically ill patients, had significant changes in nutrition-related parameters and inflammatory markers. As for nutrition risk, the critically ill patients had significantly higher proportion of high NRS scores (P < .001), which were correlated with inflammatory and nutrition-related markers. Among 342 patients with NRS score &#8805;3, only 84 (of 342, 25%) received nutrition support. Critically ill patients and those with higher NRS score had a higher risk of mortality and longer stay in hospital. In logistic regression models, 1-unit increase in NRS score was associated with the risk of mortality increasing by 1.23 times (adjusted odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.10-4.51; P = .026). CONCLUSIONS: Most severely and critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at nutrition risk. The patients with higher nutrition risk have worse outcome and require nutrition therapy.","Zhao, Xiaobo; Li, Yan; Ge, Yanyan; Shi, Yuxin; Lv, Ping; Zhang, Jianchu; Fu, Gui; Zhou, Yanfen; Jiang, Ke; Lin, Nengxing; Bai, Tao; Jin, Runming; Wu, Yuanjue; Yang, Xuefeng; Li, Xin",JPEN J. parenter. enteral nutr,,435

The origin of SARS-Cov-2 and its evolutionary relationship is still ambiguous. Several reports attempted to figure out this critical issue by genome-based phylogenetic analysis, yet limited progress was obtained, principally owing to the disability of these methods to reasonably integrate phylogenetic information from all genes of SARS-CoV-2. Supertree method based on multiple trees can produce the overall reasonable phylogenetic tree. However, the supertree method has been barely used for phylogenetic analysis of viruses. Here we applied the matrix representation with parsimony (MRP) pseudo-sequence supertree analysis to study the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with other phylogenetic analysis methods, the supertree method showed more resolution power for phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses. In particular, the MRP pseudo-sequence supertree analysis firmly disputes bat coronavirus RaTG13 be the last common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, which was implied by other phylogenetic tree analysis based on viral genome sequences. Furthermore, the discovery of evolution and mutation in SARS-CoV-2 was achieved by MRP pseudo-sequence supertree analysis. Taken together, the MRP pseudo-sequence supertree provided more information on the SARS-CoV-2 evolution inference relative to the normal phylogenetic tree based on full-length genomic sequences.","Li, Tingting; Liu, Dongxia; Yang, Yadi; Guo, Jiali; Feng, Yujie; Zhang, Xinmo; Cheng, Shilong; Feng, Jie",Sci Rep,,435

Similarly, the lung injury observed in severe COVID-19 cases appears to be related to a massive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The selective JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has shown promising results in the context of GVHD, and different trials are currently underway in patients with severe COVID-19; nevertheless, no clinical observation of safety or efficacy of treatment with ruxolitinib in this context has been published yet. We describe a first case of severe COVID-19 developed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a patient with a concomitant chronic GVHD (cGVHD), in which a treatment with ruxolitinib was administered with good tolerance and positive outcome.","Saraceni, Francesco; Scortechini, Ilaria; Mancini, Giorgia; Mariani, Marianna; Federici, Irene; Gaetani, Mariana; Barbatelli, Paolo; Minnucci, Maria Luisa; Bagnarelli, Patrizia; Olivieri, Attilio",Transpl Infect Dis,,435

270860,Indoor temperature and relative humidity in hospitals: workplace considerations during the novel coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Ageing has been recognized as one of the most critically important health-care issues worldwide. It is relevant to Asia, where the increasing number of older populations has drawn attention to the paramount need for health-care investment, particularly in end-of-life care. The advocacy of advance care planning is a mean to honor patient autonomy. Since most East Asian countries are influenced by Confucianism and the concept of 'filial piety,' patient autonomy is consequently subordinate to family values and physician authority. The dominance from family members and physicians during a patient's end-of-life decision-making is recognized as a cultural feature in Asia. Physicians often disclose the patient's poor prognosis and corresponding treatment options to the male, family member rather to the patient him/herself. In order to address this ethical and practical dilemma, the concept of 'relational autonomy' and the collectivism paradigm might be ideally used to assist Asian people, especially older adults, to share their preferences on future care and decision-making on certain clinical situations with their families and important others. In this review article, we invited experts in end-of-life care from Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan to briefly report the current status of advance care planning in each country from policy, legal and clinical perspectives. According to the Asian experiences, we have seen different models of advance care planning implementation. The Asian Delphi Taskforce for advance care planning is currently undertaken by six Asian countries and a more detailed, culturally sensitive whitepaper will be published in the near future.","Cheng, Shao-Yi; Lin, Cheng-Pei; Chan, Helen Yue-Lai; Martina, Diah; Mori, Masanori; Kim, Sun-Hyun; Ng, Raymond",Jpn J Clin Oncol,,435

Its clinical manifestations may have similarities to other septic, thoracic, or gastrointestinal post-surgical complications. Additionally, the post-operative period may be a time of increased risk for severe manifestations of COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the frequency of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients who had recently had operations who were undergoing imaging for acute symptoms and the role of chest computed tomography (CT) in this setting. Patients and Methods: We included all patients who had chest CT for acute symptoms in the 15 days after a surgical procedure between March 1 and 31, 2020. Results: Of 46 patients with acute post-operative symptoms requiring chest imaging, eight (17%) were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. Among them, five (62%) required mechanical ventilation and two (25%) died. All had abnormal chest CT with typical findings of COVID-19 in 87%. Computed tomography provided an alternate diagnosis in 53% of patients who did not have COVID-19. The average time between a COVID-19-positive chest CT and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation was 1.2 days (range, 0-4 days). Conclusion: COVID-19 is a serious post-operative condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Chest CT provides prompt diagnosis of COVID-19. In centers with a high prevalence of COVID-19, chest acquisition should be included in CT scans done for acute post-operative symptoms.","Moliere, Sebastien; Veillon, Francis",Surg Infect (Larchmt),,435

However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective. In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting on recent research in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G and beyond networks), various tools (e.g., age of information, federated learning, data analytics), and other promising trends in networked computing (e.g., edge and cloud computing). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment strategies at different industrial communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges and directions to facilitate industrial DT's adoption.","Zeb, Shah; Mahmood, Aamir; Hassan, Syed Ali; Piran, MD.

280837,Applying to dermatology residency during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Dysregulated immune response and abnormal repairment could cause secondary pulmonary fibrosis of varying severity in COVID-19, especially for the elders. The Krebs Von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) as a sensitive marker reflects the degree of fibrosis and this study will focus on analyzing the evaluative efficacy and predictive role of KL-6 in COVID-19 secondary pulmonary fibrosis. The study lasted more than three months and included total 289 COVID-19 patients who were divided into moderate (n=226) and severe groups (n=63) according to the severity of illness. Clinical information such as inflammation indicators, radiological results and lung function tests were collected. The time points of nucleic acid test were also recorded. Furthermore, based on Chest radiology detection, it was identified that 80 (27.7%) patients developed reversible pulmonary fibrosis and 34 (11.8%) patients developed irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that KL-6 could diagnose the severity of COVID-19 (AUC=0.862) and predict the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis (AUC = 0.741) and irreversible pulmonary fibrosis (AUC=0.872). Importantly, the cross-correlation analysis demonstrates that KL-6 rises earlier than the development of lung radiology fibrosis, thus also illuminating the predictive function of KL-6. We set specific values (505U/mL and 674U/mL) for KL-6 in order to assess the risk of pulmonary fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The survival curves for days in hospital show that the higher the KL-6 levels, the longer the hospital stay (P<0.0001). In conclusion, KL-6 could be used as an important predictor to evaluate the secondary pulmonary fibrosis degree for COVID-19.","Xue, Mingshan; Zhang, Teng; Chen, Hao; Zeng, Yifeng; Lin, Runpei; Zhen, Yingjie; Li, Ning; Huang, Zhifeng; Hu, Haisheng; Zhou, Luqian; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Xiaohua Douglas; Sun, Baoqing",Int J Biol Sci,,435
281460,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology department emergency ultrasound utilization,2021,"Early classification of time series has been extensively studied for minimizing class prediction delay in time-sensitive applications such as healthcare and finance. A primary task of an early classification approach is to classify an incomplete time series as soon as possible with some desired level of accuracy. Recent years have witnessed several approaches for early classification of time series. As most of the approaches have solved the early classification problem with different aspects, it becomes very important to make a thorough review of the existing solutions to know the current status of the area. These solutions have demonstrated reasonable performance in a wide range of applications including human activity recognition, gene expression based health diagnostic, industrial monitoring, and so on. In this paper, we present a systematic review of current literature on early classification approaches for both univariate and multivariate time series. We divide various existing approaches into four exclusive categories based on their proposed solution strategies. The four categories include prefix based, shapelet based, model based, and miscellaneous approaches. The authors also discuss the applications of early classification in many areas including industrial monitoring, intelligent transportation, and medical. Finally, we provide a quick summary of the current literature with future research directions.","Gupta, Ashish; Gupta, Hari Prabhat; Biswas, Bhaskar; Dutta, Tanima",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02595v1.pdf,435
281461,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology department emergency ultrasound utilization,2021,"Oxidative/nitrosative stress is a major trigger of cardiac dysfunction, involving the unfolded protein response and mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-protein kinase G signaling by sildenafil improves cardiac mal-remodeling during pressure-overload-induced heart failure. Transcriptome analysis was conducted in failing hearts with or without sildenafil treatment. Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) downstream signaling pathways, EIF2 and NRF2, were significantly altered. Although EIF2 signaling was suppressed, NRF2 signaling was upregulated, inhibiting the maturation of miR 24-3p through EGFR-mediated Ago2 phosphorylation. To study the effect of sildenafil on these pathways, we generated cardiac-specific PERK knockout mice. In these mice, sildenafil could not inhibit the maturations, the nuclear translocation of NRF2 was suppressed, and mitochondrial dysfunction advanced. Altogether, these results show that PERK-mediated suppression of miRNAs by sildenafil is vital for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response.","Shimizu, Takashi; Taguchi, Akashi; Higashijima, Yoshiki; Takubo, Naoko; Kanki, Yasuharu; Urade, Yoshihiro; Wada, Youichiro",iScience,,435

282099,Enhance care continuity post COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has radically altered life, killing hundreds of thousands of people and leading many countries to issue ""stay-at-home"" orders to contain the virus's spread. Based on insights from routine activity theory (Cohen & Felson 1979), it is likely that COVID-19 will influence victimization rates as people alter their routines and spend more time at home and less time in public. Yet, the pandemic may affect victimization differently depending on the type of crime as street crimes appear to be decreasing while domestic crimes may be increasing. We consider a third type of crime: cybercrime. Treating the pandemic as a natural experiment, we investigate how the pandemic has affected rates of cybervictimization. We compare pre-pandemic rates of victimization with post-pandemic rates of victimization using datasets designed to track cybercrime. After considering how the pandemic may alter routines and affect cybervictimization, we find that the pandemic has not radically altered cyberroutines nor changed cybervictimization rates. However, a model using routine activity theory to predict cybervictimization offers clear support for the theory's efficacy both before and after the pandemic. We conclude by considering plausible explanations for our findings.","Hawdon, James; Parti, Katalin; Dearden, Thomas E",Am J Crim Justice,,435
282100,Enhance care continuity post COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted the air transport network (ATN) globally. Policies to restrict international passenger arrivals adopted by many countries are effective responses to control the spread of the virus. This paper studies the impact of two entry restriction policies implemented by some countries against international travelers during COVID-19, i.e., direct flight suspension and complete entry suspension, on the international connectivity (IC) of ATNs. Firstly, the concept of international air transport network (IATN) is defined, and a novel weighted IC index for ATNs is proposed considering flight frequency. Furthermore, to systematically analyze the difference between two policies, the hierarchical structure of the IATN is investigated, followed by studying the change of the IC index assuming different countries impose the two policies. Taking China as an example, this paper evaluates the influence of two policies based on real policy implementation of some countries against travelers from China. Besides, the critical countries affecting the IC are identified, and the network robustness is assessed. Implications for assessing and ranking the impact of different countries under different policies are provided and discussed. Lastly, two extensions are presented to discuss the impact of partial suspension and response actions such as air travel bubble. This work is one of the first to study the impact of country-to-country disconnection on air transport connectivity and deepens our understanding of the performance of ATNs during emergencies.","Li, S.; Zhou, Y.; Kundu, T.; Zhang, F.","Transportation research.

283150,Splitting teams at a hospital pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic: A tertiary hospital experience in Saudi Arabia,2020,"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 elicited a surge in publications. Obstetric reports were with few exceptions characterized by small sample sizes with potentially limited generalizability. In this review, evidence suggests increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in pregnancy; common pregnancy comorbidities may help explain worse outcomes. While the risk of death is low, pregnancy may be associated with increased need for ventilation. Prematurity rates seem to be increased but may be accounted for in part by higher cesarean rates, to a large degree accounted for by elective decision to shorten the course of the labor. Though fetal/neonatal complication rates may be higher in the presence of COVID-19 infection, survival rates seem unaffected and vertical transmission is rare. As the outbreak continues in the USA with resurgence in many other western countries that achieved initial success in suppressing the virus, much remains to be learned. For example, the question related to the degree to pregnancy modifying symptomatology remains open. Currently, routine polymerase chain reaction testing remains limited by supply shortages possibly delaying diagnosis until later in the course of the disorder and thus altering the symptom complex at presentation. To add to the knowledge base, we initiated a regional COVID-19 in pregnancy collaborative observational study with a coordinating center, standardized data collection and a shared database. This was facilitated by a longstanding tradition of collaboration among regional obstetric services. Over an anticipated two-year study duration, we expect to study 400 documented and suspected COVID-19 pregnancies with time and site of services controls for cohort effect and high power to detect several adverse maternal/infant outcomes. We include a complete listing of variables in our database, which, along with our experience in setting up our regional collaborative, we hope and believe will be of use in other settings.","Bahado-Singh, Ray; Hassan, Sonia S; Szymanska, Marta; Sokol, Robert J",J Perinat Med,,435

The objective of this study was to identify migrant workers needs and perceptions regarding lockdown while staying in a shelter home during the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: This exploratory study was conducted with 54 migrants staying in a makeshift shelter home in Chandigarh, India. Three discussions were conducted with groups consisting of 15-20 participants to maintain social distancing. Five discussion questions were designed to facilitate group discussions. Results: One important theme among migrants was their eagerness to return to their native homes. Participants were also concerned about pending agriculture-related work, their families back home, and job insecurity. Most of the migrants supported the government-mandated lockdown and agreed that they would follow all instructions. Conclusions: Physiologic requirements, safety, and security were the predominant needs of the migrant workers while staying in the shelter home during lockdown.

METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we systematically searched for observational studies describing the prevalence of VTE and ATE in COVID-19 up to 30 September 2020. RESULTS: We analysed findings from 102 studies (64 503 patients). The frequency of COVID-19-related VTE was 14.7% (95% CI 12.1% to 17.6%, I2=94%; 56 studies; 16 507 patients). The overall prevalence rates of pulmonary embolism (PE) and leg deep vein thrombosis were 7.8% (95% CI 6.2% to 9.4%, I2=94%; 66 studies; 23 117 patients) and 11.2% (95% CI 8.4% to 14.3%, I2=95%; 48 studies; 13 824 patients), respectively. Few were isolated subsegmental PE. The VTE prevalence was significantly higher in intensive care unit (ICU) (23.2%, 95% CI 17.5% to 29.6%, I2=92%, vs 9.0%, 95% CI 6.9% to 11.4%, I2=95%; pinteraction<0.0001) and in series systematically screening patients compared with series testing symptomatic patients (25.2% vs 12.7%, pinteraction=0.04). The frequency rates of overall ATE, acute coronary syndrome, stroke and other ATE were 3.9% (95% CI 2.0% to to 3.0%, I2=96%; 16 studies; 7939 patients), 1.6% (95% CI 1.0% to 2.2%, I2=93%; 27 studies; 40 597 patients) and 0.9% (95% CI 0.5% to 1.5%, I2=84%; 17 studies; 20 139 patients), respectively. Metaregression and subgroup analyses failed to explain heterogeneity of overall ATE. High heterogeneity limited the value of estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Patients admitted in the ICU for severe COVID-19 had a high risk of VTE. Conversely, further studies are needed to determine the specific effects of COVID-19 on the risk of ATE or VTE in less severe forms of the disease.","Tan, Boun Kim; Mainbourg, Sabine; Friggeri, Arnaud; Bertoletti, Laurent; Douplat, Marion; Dargaud, Yesim; Grange, Claire; Lobbes, Hervé; Provencher, Steeve; Lega, Jean-Christophe",Thorax,,435

We aimed to describe the characteristics of spontaneous symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Database for data from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected prior to or within 7 days after symptomatic ICH. We did a pooled analysis of individual patient data, then combined data from this pooled analysis with aggregate-level data. RESULTS: We included data from 139 patients (98 with individual data and 41 with aggregate-level data). In our pooled individual data analysis, the median age (IQR) was 60 (53-67) years and 64% (95% CI 54-73.7%) were male; 79% (95% CI 70.0-86.9%) had critically severe COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of lobar ICH was 67% (95% CI 56.3-76.0%), and of multifocal ICH was 36% (95% CI 26.4-47.0%). 71% (95% CI 61.0-80.4%) of patients were treated with anticoagulation (58% (95% CI 48-67.8%) therapeutic). The median NIHSS was 28 (IQR 15-28); mortality was 54% (95% CI 43.7-64.2%). Our combined analysis of individual and aggregate data showed similar findings. The pooled incidence of ICH across 12 cohort studies of inpatients with COVID-19 (n = 63,390) was 0.38% (95% CI 0.22-0.58%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ICH associated with COVID-19 has different characteristics compared to ICH not associated with COVID-19, including frequent lobar location and multifocality, a high rate of anticoagulation, and high mortality. These observations suggest different underlying mechanisms of ICH in COVID-19 with potential implications for clinical treatment and trials.","Beyrouti, R; Best, J G; Chandratheva, A; Perry, R J; Werring, D J",J. neurol,,435

OBJECTIVE: In a two-wave longitudinal survey, we investigated the levels of parental stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a sample of parents at two time points; during the implementation of the strictest physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1, N = 2,868) and three months after the discontinuation of the protocols (T2, N = 1,489). Further, we investigated the relationships between parental stress and anxiety and depression relative to relationship quality and anger toward their children at the two aforementioned time points, including subgroups based on age, parental role, cultural background, relationship status, education level, number of children, employment status and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement points. Parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stress that parents experienced during the implementation of the distancing protocols declined when the protocols were phased out. The decrease of perceived parental stress was accompanied by a significant decrease in the symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-offs for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% at T2, respectively. The reduction in depression and anger toward their child(ren) from T1 to T2 was associated with a reduction of parental stress. Relationship quality and anger toward their child(ren) at T1 further predicted a change in the level of parental stress from T1 to T2. CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the negative psychological impacts of the implementation of the distancing protocols on parents' health and well-being. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated with parents and families facing a social crisis such as the ongoing pandemic may contribute to the design of relevant interventions to reduce parental distress and strengthen parental coping and resilience.","Johnson, Miriam S; Skjerdingstad, Nora; Ebrahimi, Omid V; Hoffart, Asle; Urnes Johnson, Sverre",PLoS One,,435
292267,Psychological Burden among Community-dwelling Older Adults with and without a History of a Recent Covid-19 Infection,2021,"Background: Social distancing and restriction measures during the COVID-19 epidemic may have impacts on medication availability and healthcare utilization for COPD patients, and thereby affect standard disease management. We aimed to investigate the change of respiratory symptoms, pharmacological treatment and healthcare utilization of COPD patients during the epidemic in Beijing, China. Methods: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey performed at Peking University Third Hospital and recruited patients with COPD who were interviewed by phone call. Clinical data, including respiratory symptoms, pharmacological treatment, management and healthcare access before and during the COVID-19 epidemic from January 25 to April 25, 2020, were collected. Results: A total of 153 patients were enrolled for analysis. Before the epidemic, 81.7% (125/153) had long-term maintenance medication and ICS/LABA (60.8%) and LAMA (57.5%) were most commonly used. During the epidemic, 75.2% (115/153) maintained their pharmacological treatment and 6.5% (10/153) had to reduce or stop taking medications, with a slight decrease of patients taking ICS/LABA (53.6%) and LAMA (56.9%). Most of the patients [76.5% (117/153)] had a low symptom burden, with a CAT score <10 during the epidemic. Of 153 patients, 45 (29.4%) patients reported worsening of respiratory symptoms but only 15.6% (7/45) sought medical care in hospitals, while the remaining expressed concerns about cross-infection in the hospital (55.5%, 25/45) or had mild symptoms which were managed by themselves (28.8%, 13/45). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing, most of our COPD patients maintained their long-term pharmacological treatment and had mild-to-moderate symptoms. Approximately, 30.0% of the patients experienced worsening of respiratory symptoms, but most of them did not seek medical care in the hospital due to concerns about cross-infection.","Liang, Ying; Chang, Chun; Chen, Yahong; Dong, Fawu; Zhang, Linlin; Sun, Yongchang",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,435

294121,The voice of frontline healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 surge,2021,"Members of family Coronaviridae cause a variety of diseases in birds and mammals. Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a lesser-researched coronavirus, can infect naive pigs of any age, but clinical disease is observed in pigs &#8804;4 weeks of age. No commercial PHEV vaccines are available, and neonatal protection from PHEV-associated disease is presumably dependent on lactogenic immunity. Although subclinical PHEV infections are thought to be common, PHEV ecology in commercial swine herds is unknown. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, a serum IgG antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the S1 protein was developed and evaluated on known-status samples and then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds. Assessment of the diagnostic performance of the PHEV S1 ELISA using serum samples (n = 924) collected from 7-week-old pigs (n = 84; 12 pigs per group) inoculated with PHEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus showed that a sample-to-positive cutoff value of &#8805;0.6 was both sensitive and specific, i.e., all PHEV-inoculated pigs were seropositive from days postinoculation 10 to 42, and no cross-reactivity was observed in samples from other groups. The PHEV S1 ELISA was then used to estimate PHEV seroprevalence in U.S. sow herds (19 states) using 2,756 serum samples from breeding females (>28 weeks old) on commercial farms (n = 104) with no history of PHEV-associated disease. The overall seroprevalence was 53.35% (confidence interval [CI], ±1.86%) and herd seroprevalence was 96.15% (CI, ±3.70%).IMPORTANCE There is a paucity of information concerning the ecology of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) in commercial swine herds. This study provided evidence that PHEV infection is endemic and highly prevalent in U.S. swine herds. These results raised questions for future studies regarding the impact of endemic PHEV on swine health and the mechanisms by which this virus circulates in endemically infected populations. Regardless, the availability of the validated PHEV S1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provides the means for swine producers to detect and monitor PHEV infections, confirm prior exposure to the virus, and to evaluate the immune status of breeding herds.","Mora-Díaz, Juan Carlos; Magtoto, Ronaldo; Houston, Elizabeth; Baum, David; Carrillo-Ávila, José Antonio; Temeeyasen, Gun; Zimmerman, Jeff; Piñeyro, Pablo; Giménez-Lirola, Luis",MSphere,,435

In many countries, new social assistance programs have been introduced or existing programs have been expanded in response to the pandemic. In many cases, however, these measures are not sufficient to mitigate the social consequences of Covid-19. Above all, they are usually too short-term in nature to ensure long-term protection also against future crises.

First reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan province of China, this new RNA virus has several folds higher transmission among humans than its other family member (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). The SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is the region mediating the binding of the virus to host cells via Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a critical step of viral. Here in this study, we have utilized in silico approach for the virtual screening of antiviral library extracted from the Asinex database against the Receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Further, the molecules were ranked based on their binding affinity against RBD, and the top 15 molecules were selected. The affinity of these selected molecules to interrupt the ACE2-Spike interaction was also studied. It was found that the chosen molecules were demonstrating excellent binding affinity against spike protein, and these molecules were also very effectively interrupting the ACE2-RBD interaction. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were utilized to investigate the top 3 selected molecules' stability in the ACE2-RBD complexes. This is the first study where molecules' inhibitory potential against the Receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and their inhibitory potential against the ACE2-Spike has been studied. We believe that these compounds can be further tested as a potential therapeutic option against COVID-19.","Farouk, Abd-ElAziem; Hassan Baig, Mohammad; Imran Khan, Mohd; Tae Hwan, Park; Alotaibi, Saqer S; Dong, Jae-Jun",,,435

NVOCs (natural volatile organic compounds), a major healing factor of forests, have several positive effects on human health. This study specifically researched the NVOC characteristics of bamboo groves. This study revealed that α-pinene, 3-carene, and camphene were observed to emit the most, and the largest amount of NVOC emitted was seen during the early morning and late afternoon within bamboo groves. Furthermore, NVOC emission was found to have normal correlations with temperature and humidity, and inverse correlations with solar radiation, PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), and wind speed. A regression analysis conducted to predict the effect of microclimate factors on NVOC emissions resulted in a regression equation with 82.9% explanatory power, finding that PAR, temperature, and humidity had a significant effect on NVOC emission prediction. In conclusion, this study investigated NVOC emission of bamboo groves, examined the relationship between NVOC emissions and microclimate factors, and derived a prediction equation of NVOC emissions to figure out bamboo groves’ forest healing effects. These results are expected to provide a basis for establishing more effective forest healing programs in bamboo groves. © 2021 by the authors.","Choi, Y.; Kim, G.; Park, S.; Kim, E.; Kim, S.",Forests,,435

This study aimed to assess the value of telephone-based assessments in the follow-up of MS patients. It includes one hundred and five patients who participated in the study and completed 3 telephone-based assessments which are the Hauser Ambulation index, Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychology Questionnaire (MSNQ), and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis Scale (SMSS).ResultsThe Hauser Ambulation index was significantly correlated with the latest Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score done within 1 month from the telephone call (r=0.738, P&lt;0.001). The analysis of MSNQ scores showed that one-third of the study population had evidence of cognitive and/or neuropsychological impairment. Post hoc analysis regarding the cognitive and psychological impairment component of SMSS revealed that the patients who answered “Never” had significantly lower MSNQ scores compared to those who answered “Sometimes” (P=0.016), “Often” (P=0.022), and “Always” (P=0.001). The comparison of the EDSS scores of the patients regarding the sensory-motor impairment component of SMSS showed a non-significant difference.ConclusionThe Hauser Ambulation index may be a reliable telephone-based tool for the assessment of physical disability.

As COVID-19 was spreading in Europe, the French national institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) established a transdisciplinary team to develop a multi-arm randomised controlled trial named DisCoVeRy. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational re-purposed therapeutics relative to Standard of Care (SoC) in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: DisCoVeRy is a phase III, open-label, adaptive, controlled, multicentre clinical trial in which hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in need of oxygen therapy are randomised between five arms: (1) a control group managed with SoC and four therapeutic arms with re-purposed antiviral agents: (2) remdesivir + SoC, (3) lopinavir/ritonavir + SoC, (4) lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon (IFN)-ß-1a + SoC and (5) hydroxychloroquine + SoC. The primary endpoint is the clinical status at Day 15 on the 7-point ordinal scale of the WHO Master Protocol (V.3.0, 3 March 2020). This trial involves patients hospitalised in conventional departments or intensive care units both from academic or non-academic hospitals throughout Europe. A sample size of 3100 patients (620 patients per arm) is targeted. This trial has begun on 22 March 2020. Since 5 April 2020, DisCoVeRy has been an add-on trial of the Solidarity consortium of trials conducted by the WHO in Europe and worldwide. On 8 June 2020, 754 patients have been included. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Inserm is the sponsor of DisCoVeRy. Ethical approval has been obtained from the institutional review board on 13 March 2020 (20.03.06.51744) and from the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) on 9 March 2020.

However, this access is complicated by social distancing requirements that disrupt traditional in-person communication. Many refugees must then rely on alternative information sources to stay informed.

We examine these relationships with survey data from 1,000 refugees living in both camps and non-camp settings in Kenya. Using logit models, we test relationships between information source and anxiety and the effect of these variables on refugees' expected behaviors of community members. Our primary contributions include the finding that information sources consistently exacerbate (e.g., Facebook) or ameliorate (e.g., news from the internet) different anxieties, or can have mixed effects (e.g., radio). We also find that anxiety and information have significant impacts on refugees' expectations of compliance by others and that, whether between camps or between camps and non-camp locales, findings vary by location. Our results have implications for refugee media and infectious disease anxiety scholarship as well as for managing infectious disease response.","McGee, Matthew A.; Maitland, Carleen; Njoroge, Dorothy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09935v1.pdf,435
305269,Changes in substance use among young adults during a respiratory disease pandemic,2020,"ObjectivesVarious commercial anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests are used for studies and in clinical settings after vaccination. An international standard for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been established to achieve comparability of such tests, allowing conversions to BAU/ml. This study aimed to investigate the comparability of antibody tests regarding the timing of blood collection after vaccination. MethodsFor this prospective observational study, antibody levels of 50 participants with homologous AZD1222 vaccination were evaluated at 3 and 11 weeks after the first dose and 3 weeks after the second dose using two commercial anti-Spike binding antibody assays (Roche and Abbott) and a surrogate neutralization assay. ResultsThe correlation between Roche and Abbott changed significantly depending on the time point studied. Although 3 weeks after the first dose, Abbott provided values three times higher than Roche, 11 weeks after the first dose, the values for Roche were twice as high as for Abbott, and 3 weeks after the second dose even 5-6 times higher. ConclusionsThe comparability of quantitative anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is highly dependent on the timing of blood collection after vaccination. Therefore, standardization of the timing of blood collection might be necessary for the comparability of different quantitative SARS-COV-2 antibody assays.

305559,A Systematic Review on Precision Nutrition for Prevention and Management of Obesity during COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused suffering and death around the world. Careful selection of facial protection is paramount for preventing virus spread among healthcare workers and preserving mask and N95 respirator supplies. METHODS: This paper is a comprehensive review of literature written in English and available on Pubmed comparing the risk of viral respiratory infections when wearing masks and N95 respirators. Current international oral and maxillofacial surgery guidelines for mask and N95 respirator use, patient COVID-19 disease status, aerosol producing procedures were also collected and incorporated into a workflow for selecting appropriate facial protection for oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures during the current pandemic. RESULTS: Most studies suggest N95 respirators and masks are equally protective against respiratory viruses. Some evidence favors N95 respirators, which are preferred for high-risk procedures when aerosol production is likely or when the COVID-19 status of a patient is positive or unknown. N95 respirators may also be used for multiple patients or reused depending on the type of procedure and condition of the respirator after each patient encounter. CONCLUSION: N95 respirators are preferred over masks against viral respiratory pathogens, especially during aerosol-generating procedures or when a patient's COVID-19 status is positive or unknown.","Zhang, Mingzhu; Emery, Andrew Robert; Tannyhill, R John; Zheng, Hui; Wang, Jingping",J Oral Maxillofac Surg,,435
305922,The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically reduced admissions of children with and without chronic conditions to general paediatric wards,2021,"CAGE-B and SAGE-B scores, consisting of age and fibrotic burden as cirrhosis and/or liver stiffness, were recently proposed to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among Caucasian chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients undergoing long-term antiviral therapy. We externally validated their predictive performances among an independent cohort from Asia, compared to other conventional prediction models. We consecutively recruited CHB patients with well-controlled viremia (serum HBV-DNA<2,000 IU/ml) receiving antiviral therapy. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis or HCC at baseline were excluded. Among 1763 patients, CAGE-B score provided the highest Heagerty's integrated area under the curve (iAUC) (0.820), followed by SAGE-B (0.804), mREACH-B (0.800), CAMD (0.786), mPAGE-B (0.748), and PAGE-B (0.721) scores. CAGE-B score showed a significantly better performance than SAGE-B, CAMD, PAGE-B, and mPAGE-B scores, but was similar to mREACH-B. SAGE-B score also showed significantly better performance than mPAGE-B and PAGE-B, but was similar to CAMD and mREACH-B. According to CAGE-B score 0~5, 6~10, and &#8805;11, the annual HCC incidences were 0.18, 1.34, and 6.03 per 100 person-years, respectively (all p<0.001 between each pair). Likewise, by SAGE-B score 0~5, 6~10, and &#8805;11, those were 0.31, 1.49, and 8.96 per 100 person-years, respectively (all p<0.001 between each pair). Hence CAGE-B and SAGE-B scores showed acceptable predictive performances for Asian CHB patients undergoing antiviral therapy, with the higher performance by CAGE-B score. They show a trend toward better prognostic capability to predict HCC risk than previous models.","Ji, Jung Hyun; Park, Soo Young; Son, Won Jeong; Shin, Hye Jung; Lee, Hyein; Lee, Hye Won; Lee, Jae Seung; Kim, Seung Up; Park, Jun Yong; Kim, Do Young; Ahn, Sang Hoon; Kim, Beom Kyung",J. viral hepat,,435

307389,Evaluation of Changes in Skin Characteristics Due to the Poor Quality of Sleep Caused by Smartphone Usage,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) quarantine has been associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We hypothesize these symptoms might even be more pronounced in the elderly, who may be particularly sensitive to social isolation. However, certain individuals might be more resilient than others due to their coping mechanisms, including religious coping. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the levels of perceived stress, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in older adults under COVID-19 quarantine in Qatar; and to identify the sociodemographic, psychological, and clinical factors associated with mental health outcomes, with a focus on the role of resilience, and religiosity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study assessing depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms as well as resilience, and religiosity through a phone survey in adults aged 60 years or more under COVID-19 quarantine in the State of Qatar, in comparison to age and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in elderly subjects under COVID-19 quarantine in Qatar was not significantly different from the prevalence in gender and age-matched controls. In the quarantined group, higher depressive, anxiety, and stress scores were associated with the female gender and with lower resilience scores but were not linked to age, psychiatric history, medical history, duration of quarantine, or religiosity. CONCLUSION: The elderly population does not seem to develop significant COVID-19 quarantine-related psychological distress, possibly thanks to high resilience and effective coping strategies developed through the years.","Ouanes, Sami; Kumar, Rajeev; Doleh, Esraa Saleh Idriss; Smida, Malek; Al-Kaabi, Abdulaziz; Al-Shahrani, Ahmad Medawi; Mohamedsalih, Ghassan Ahmed; Ahmed, Nagi Eltagi; Assar, Ahmed; Khoodoruth, Mohamed Adil Shah; AbuKhattab, Mohammed; Maslamani, Muna Al; AlAbdulla, Majid Ali",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,435
307390,Evaluation of changes in skin characteristics due to the poor quality of sleep caused by smartphone usage,2021,"E-cigarette use among young adults is a major public health concern. Approximately 17.7-40% of college students have tried or are currently using e-cigarettes. While a few studies have examined e-cigarette use among youth, opportunity exists to understand psychosocial factors that influence college students' e-cigarette behavior. The main purpose of this study is to examine the associations between the constructs of self-efficacy, knowledge, depression and anxiety symptoms, and e-cigarette use among college students. A retrospective cross-sectional survey (20-items) design was used for data collection. Bivariate analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate associations between the independent variables and the dependent variable. A total of 872 college students between the ages of 18 and 25 completed the survey in Qualtrics. A significant association between gender and frequency of e-cigarette use was found (&#967;2 = 22.94, p < .001). ANOVA results showed significant relationships between knowledge [F (3, 808) = 9.01, p < 0.001], self-efficacy [F (3, 808) = 4.85, p < 0.01], depression [F (3,808) = 8.31, p < .05], and e-cigarette use. Post hoc analysis revealed students who never used e-cigarettes scored higher on knowledge and self-efficacy than students who used every day, somedays or rarely, indicating never-users have higher knowledge of negative effects associated with e-cigarette use and have higher self-confidence than e-cigarette users. The study's findings highlight that modifiable factors such as knowledge about harmful effects of e-cigarettes and self-confidence are associated with low e-cigarette use. Interventions could be designed to target these modifiable factors.","Jones, Rebecca D; Asare, Matthew; Lanning, Beth",J. community health,,435

The stakeholders included the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology/American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, the National Academy of Neuropsychology, Division 40 of the American Psychological Association, the American Board of Professional Neuropsychology, and the American Psychological Association Services, Inc. The group reviewed literature; collated federal, regional, and state regulations and information from insurers; and surveyed practitioners to identify best practices. RESULTS: Literature indicates that TeleNP may offer reliable and valid assessments, but clinicians need to consider limitations, develop new informed consent procedures, report modifications of standard procedures, and state limitations to diagnostic conclusions and recommendations. Specific limitations affect TeleNP assessments of older adults, younger children, individuals with limited access to technology, and individuals with other individual, cultural, and/or linguistic differences. TeleNP may be contraindicated or infeasible given specific patient characteristics, circumstances, and referral questions.

310022,Effect of covid-19 on bacterial resistance,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unprecedented worldwide socio-economic and health impact. There is increasing evidence that a combination of inflammation and hypercoagulable state are the main mechanisms of respiratory failure in these patients. This narrative review aims to summarize currently available evidence on the complex interplay of immune dysregulation, hypercoagulability, and thrombosis in the pathogenesis of respiratory failure in COVID-19 disease. In addition, we will describe the experience of anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory strategies that have been tested. Profound suppression of the adaptive and hyperactivity of innate immune systems with macrophage activation appears to be a prominent feature in this infection. Immune dysregulation together with endotheliitis and severe hypercoagulability results in thromboinflammation and microvascular thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature leading to severe respiratory distress. Currently, some guidelines recommend the use of prophylactic low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, with intermediate dose prophylaxis in those needing intensive care, and the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with proven or suspected thrombosis. Strong recommendations cannot be made until this approach is validated by trial results. To target the inflammatory cascade, low-dose dexamethasone appears to be helpful in moderate to severe cases and trials with anti-interleukin agents (e.g., tocilizumab, anakinra, siltuximab) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are showing early promising results. Potential newer agents (e.g., Janus kinase inhibitor such as ruxolitinib, baricitinib, fedratinib) are likely to be investigated in clinical trials. Unfortunately, current trials are mostly examining these agents in isolation and there may be a significant delay before evidence-based practice can be implemented. It is plausible that a combination of anti-viral drugs together with anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulation medicines will be the most successful strategy in managing severely affected patients with COVID-19.","Bhattacharyya, Rajat; Iyer, Prasad; Phua, Ghee Chee; Lee, Jan Hau",Pulm Ther,,435

For bryozoan assemblages, depth, substratum and habitat structure are among the main factors influencing their distribution. Ecological studies on bryozoan fauna from Brazil are scarce and factors affecting the distribution and/or diversity of this common group are obscure. Here we attempted to verify the influence of bathymetry on bryozoan richness on the north shore of Bahia State, north-eastern Brazil. We identified 57 bryozoan taxa, comprising 35 families and 50 genera, all belonging to the Cheilostomata.

Species growing as encrusting sheets were dominant at all depths. There was a significant difference in richness among samples at different depths, with highest values of richness at 40 meters (Kruskal-Wallis Test). Analysis of similarities revealed a significant difference among the bryozoan assemblages, mainly when comparing assemblages from 10 and 20 meters with deeper ones. Also, shallower assemblages composition varied much than assemblages from 30 and 40 meters. Since depth is a proxy for several environmental parameters, further studies are needed to identify other factors influencing bryozoan distribution.","Almeida, Ana C S; Souza, Facelucia B C; Vieira, Leandro M; Nogueira, Marcos M",An Acad Bras Cienc,,435

Aims: The aims of this study are to (1) construct a conceptual framework for risk perception and depression of people in public health crises, (2) examine how the mental health of people in the crisis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affected by risk perception and its associated factors, including distance perception of the crisis and support of prevention and control policies, and (3) propose policy recommendations on how to deal with psychological problems in the current COVID-19 crisis. Methods: Online questionnaire survey was implemented. A total of 6373 people visited the questionnaire online, 1115 people completed the questionnaire, and the number of valid questionnaires was 1081. Structural equation modeling was employed for data analysis. Results: Risk perception and its associated factors significantly affect the mental health of people in public health crises. Specifically, (1) distance perception of public health crises is negatively associated with depression among people, (2) affective risk perception is positively associated with depression of people in public health crises, (3) cognitive risk perception is negatively associated with depression of people in public health crises, and (4) support of prevention and control policies is negatively associated with depression of people in public health crises. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that risk perception plays an important role in affecting the mental health of people in a public health crisis. Therefore, health policies aiming to improve the psychological wellbeing of the people in a public health crisis should take risk perception into consideration.","Ding, Yubin; Xu, Junling; Huang, Sisi; Li, Peipei; Lu, Cuizhen; Xie, Shenghua",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,435

Methods: In this study, we designed a dynamic graph model, not for precisely predicting the number of infected cases, but for a glance of the dynamics under a public epidemic emergency situation and of different contributing factors. Results: We demonstrated the impact of asymptomatic transmission in this outbreak and showed the effectiveness of city lockdown to halt virus spread within a city. We further illustrated that sudden emergence of a large number of cases could overwhelm the city medical system, and external medical aids are critical to not only containing the further spread of the virus but also reducing fatality. Conclusion: Our model simulation showed that highly populated modern cities are particularly vulnerable and lessons learned in China could facilitate other countries to plan the proactive and decisive actions. We shall pay close attention to the asymptomatic transmission being suggested by rapidly accumulating evidence as dramatic changes in quarantine protocol are required to contain SARS-CoV-2 from spreading globally.

Clinical presentation and imaging findings of metastatic broad ligament LMS are often nonspecific. Complete excision plays an important role in treatment of patients with localized LMS. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of a 33-year-old woman with recurrent broad ligament LMS metastasizing to pancreas and thigh. Previously, she was diagnosed with broad ligament LMS and underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The disease-free interval was 2.5 years until metastases were found. Computerized tomography (CT) of abdomen and thighs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of thighs and whole-body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET-CT) performed, revealed pancreatic and thigh metastasis. Ultrasonography-guided biopsy and histological examinations confirmed LMS at both the sites. Pancreatic metastasis was completely resected first. Then the patient underwent surgical resection of thigh metastasis when both chemotherapy and radiotherapy failed. She recovered well and remained free of disease recurrence in the 2 years follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Though imaging lacks specificity, it is a valuable asset in assessing the burden of disease and characterizing lesions while histological examination with immunohistochemistry is helpful for the diagnosis of LMS. Complete surgical resection of all metastatic sites where-ever feasible should be strongly considered in a treated case of broad ligament LMS with a durable disease-free interval.","Tian, Xuan; Yan, Xin; Wu, Jun; Song, Hongli; Shen, Zhongyang",BMC Surg,,435

In this study, we systemically applied SABRE to a series of nitrile compounds, which have been rarely investigated. By performing SABRE in various magnetic fields and concentrations on nitrile compounds, we unveiled its hyperpolarization properties to maximize the spin polarization and its transfer to the next spins. Through this sequential study, we obtained a ~130-fold enhancement for several nitrile compounds, which is the highest number ever reported for the nitrile compounds. Our study revealed that the spin polarization on hydrogens decreases with longer distances from the nitrile group, and its maximum polarization is found to be approximately 70 G with 5 µL of substrates in all structures. Interestingly, more branched structures in the ligand showed less effective polarization transfer mechanisms than the structural isomers of butyronitrile and isobutyronitrile. These first systematic SABRE studies on a series of nitrile compounds will provide new opportunities for further research on the hyperpolarization of various useful nitrile materials.","Kim, Sarah; Min, Sein; Chae, Heelim; Jeong, Hye Jin; Namgoong, Sung Keon; Oh, Sangwon; Jeong, Keunhong",Molecules (Basel),,435

This observation led us to perform epidemiological analysis, using data in the public domain, to study the correlation of COVID-19 with the prevalence and vaccination strategies for two respiratory pathogens: flu and tuberculosis (TB). Countries showing more than 1000 COVID-19 deaths were selected at three time points during the ongoing pandemic: 17 May, 1 October and 31 December 2020. The major findings of this study that are broadly consistent at all three time points are: First, countries with high flu deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Second, TB incidences and deaths negatively correlate with COVID-19 deaths/million. Countries displaying high TB and flu deaths (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Indonesia, India) display lower COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with low TB and flu deaths (Italy, Spain, USA, France). Third, countries with greater flu vaccination display lower flu incidences but higher COVID-19 deaths/million and mortality rates. On the other hand, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination negatively correlates with Covid-19 deaths/million. Fourth, countries with only BCG, but no flu, vaccination show delayed and lower number of COVID-19 deaths/million compared to countries with flu, but no BCG, vaccination. Fifth, countries with high BCG vaccination coverage as well as high TB deaths display the lowest COVID-19 deaths/million. The implications of this global study are discussed with respect to the roles of respiratory infections and vaccinations in lowering COVID-19 deaths.","Pathak, Sanmoy; Jolly, Mohit Kumar; Nandi, Dipankar",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,435

319234,Trends in pediatric ocular trauma presenting to an ophthalmology-specific emergency department during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between infection with SARS-CoV-2 and autoimmunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although most of the infected individuals are asymptomatic, a proportion of patients with COVID-19 develop severe disease with multiple organ injuries. Evidence suggests that some medications used to treat autoimmune rheumatologic diseases might have therapeutic effect in patients with severe COVID-19 infections, drawing attention to the relationship between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases. COVID-19 shares similarities with autoimmune diseases in clinical manifestations, immune responses and pathogenic mechanisms. Robust immune reactions participate in the pathogenesis of both disease conditions. Autoantibodies as a hallmark of autoimmune diseases can also be detected in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, some patients have been reported to develop autoimmune diseases, such as Guillain--Barré syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus, after COVID-19 infection. It is speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can disturb self-tolerance and trigger autoimmune responses through cross-reactivity with host cells. The infection risk and prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune diseases remains controversial, but patient adherence to medication regimens to prevent autoimmune disease flares is strongly recommended. SUMMARY: We present a review of the association between COVID-19 and autoimmune diseases, focusing on similarities in immune responses, cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2, the development of autoimmune diseases in COVID-19 patients and the risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with preexisting autoimmune conditions.","Liu, Yu; Sawalha, Amr H; Lu, Qianjin",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,435
319685,Characteristics of headache attributed to COVID-19 infection and predictors of its frequency and intensity: a cross sectional study. (Special Section: COVID-19 and headache.),2020,"Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Periodontitis, one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, leads to alveolar bone destruction and subsequent tooth loss, and develops due to pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by periodontopathic bacteria. Periodontopathic bacteria are involved in respiratory diseases, including aspiration pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other systemic diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Patients with these diseases have an increased COVID-19 aggravation rate and mortality. Because aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene can lead to COVID-19 aggravation. Conversely, oral care, including periodontal treatment, prevents the onset of pneumonia and influenza and the exacerbation of COPD. The reduced chance of receiving professional oral care owing to long-term hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 may increase the aggravation risk of infection in the lower respiratory tract. It can be hypothesized that periodontopathic bacteria are involved in the COVID-19 aggravation and therefore, the management of good oral hygiene potentially contributes to its prevention.","Takahashi, Yuwa; Watanabe, Norihisa; Kamio, Noriaki; Kobayashi, Ryutaro; Iinuma, Toshimitsu; Imai, Kenichi",J Oral Sci,,435

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the association of basal metabolic index (body mass index (BMI)) with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), dialysis, upgrade to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. Independent t-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to calculate mean differences and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with its 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively. Results: A total of 176 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included. The mean age was 62.2 years, with 51% being male patients. The mean BMI for non-surviving patients was significantly higher compared to patients surviving on the seventh day of hospitalization (35 vs. 30 kg/m2, P = 0.022). Similarly, patients requiring IMV had a higher BMI (33 vs. 29, P = 0.002) compared to nonintubated patients. The unadjusted OR for patients with a higher BMI requiring IMV (56% vs. 28%, OR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.6 - 7.0, P = 0.002) and upgrade to ICU (46% vs. 28%, OR;2.2, 1.07 - 4.6, P = 0.04) were significantly higher compared to patients with a lower BMI. Similarly, patients with a higher BMI had higher in-hospital mortality (21% vs. 9%, OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3 - 8.2, P = 0.01) compared to patients with a normal BMI. Despite a numerical advantage in the lower BMI group, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the need for dialysis (5% vs. 13%, OR: 3.8, 13% vs. 4%, 1.1 - 14.1, P = 0.07). aORs controlled for baseline comorbidities and medications mirrored the overall results, except for the need to upgrade to ICU. Conclusions: In patients with confirmed COVID-19, morbid obesity serves as an independent risk factor of high in-hospital mortality and the need for IMV. © The authors ;Journal compilation © J Clin Med Res and Elmer Press Inc™ ;www.jocmr.org This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial 4.0 International License, which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited","Ullah, W.; Roomi, S.; Nadeem, N.; Saeed, R.; Tariq, S.; Ellithi, M.; Haq, S.; Arslan, A.; Madara, J.; Boigon, M.; Haas, D.

A case study from the UAE,2020,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is causing hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide, is complex and can present with a multi-organ localization. One of its worst complications is an interstitial pneumonia with acute respiratory failure also known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which requires non-invasive or invasive ventilation. A severe coagulopathy with poor prognosis is found in 5-10% of cases. SARS-CoV-2 is manifesting as a multi-dimensional disease and, recently, unique co-existing pathophysiological and clinical aspects are being defined: (i) an increased immune and inflammatory response with the activation of a cytokine storm and consequent coagulopathy, which promote both venous thromboembolic events and in situ thrombosis localized in small arterioles and pulmonary alveolar capillaries; (ii) a high intrapulmonary shunt, which often accounts for the severity of respiratory failure, due to reduced hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction with pulmonary neo-angiogenetic phenomena. Furthermore, the high incidence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit and the autoptic findings of in situ micro-thrombosis at the pulmonary vascular level, suggest that in this disease coagulopathy, unlike septic disseminated intravascular coagulation, is driven towards a hyper-thrombogenic state, giving rise to a debate (with ongoing studies) about the preventive use of anticoagulant doses of heparin to reduce mortality.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), starting initially as an epidemic in China in late 2019 and now becoming a pandemic globally, poses grave challenges to the global health care systems while also provides an opportunity for studying infectious diseases in the perspective of methodology. The authors propose the evaluation methods for case reports, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), real-world evidence studies and health economics researches during an epidemic. Case reports, which are of important value for health care workers during outbreaks of infectious diseases, should be written in standard format and style and published following a strict peer review process. RCTs provides the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of a given treatment for the patients from the outbreaks. We review the potential challenges faced in conducting RCTs during the outbreaks. The real-world data collected from the cases in designated hospitals allow the verification of the safety and effectiveness of the intervention measures. The data from health economics research also provide important support for optimizing communicable disease prevention and control strategies. Herein we summarize the health economics research methods, study design, and technical points during the outbreaks. We recommend that clinical research and health economics research be incorporated into the prevention and control plan and measures be taken to ensure both the standards and feasibility of these studies to improve the response capacity against outbreaks of communicable diseases.","Gong, Mengchun; Liu, Li; Wu, Chen; Yang, Yue; Shen, Yang; Li, Jie; Lin, Kaicheng; Guo, Yi; Wei, Hongyun; Xu, Zeyu; Zhu, Hong",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,435

It allows developing indices and ranking alternatives, based on multiple combinations of normalization methods and aggregation functions. Given the steadily increasing importance of accounting for multiple preferences of the decision-makers and assessing the robustness of the decision recommendations, this tool is a timely instrument that can be used primarily by non-multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) experts to dynamically shape and evaluate their indices. The MCDA Index Tool allows the user to (i) input a dataset directly from spreadsheets with alternatives and indicators performance, (ii) build multiple indices by choosing several normalization methods and aggregation functions, and (iii) visualize and compare the indices' scores and rankings to assess the robustness of the results. A novel perspective on uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of preference models offers operational solutions to assess the influence of different strategies to develop indices and visualize their results. A case study for the assessment of the energy security and sustainability implications of different global energy scenarios is used to illustrate the application of the MCDA Index Tool.

Patients undergoing PAO for acetabular dysplasia have postoperative pain that can be managed with epidural analgesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the timing of the discontinuation of epidural analgesia on pain, opioid usage, and hospital length of stay (LOS). The study hypothesis was that removal of the epidural catheter on postoperative day 1 (POD1) would lead to reduced overall opioid usage and LOS compared with removal on POD2. METHODS: This is a retrospective before-and-after observational review of the impact of discontinuing epidural analgesia on POD1 versus POD2 in terms of in-hospital pain, opioid usage, and LOS. Baseline patient factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) as well as outcomes including mean and median of daily pain, total oral morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) used per day, and LOS were recorded. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses including multivariable main-effects linear regression modeling were performed to evaluate the impact of the timing of epidural removal on outcomes. RESULTS: Directly comparing outcomes for the day of epidural removal, patients with removal on POD1 had significantly less pain (mean of 4.6 versus 5.1 on the numeric rating scale [NRS], p = 0.033) and opioid usage (130.7 versus 200.4 MMEs, p < 0.001) than patients with removal on POD2. Additionally, LOS (3.3 versus 4.6 days, p < 0.001) and total opioid usage (333.0 versus 674.8 MMEs, p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in patients with epidural removal on POD1. These results persisted in multivariable analyses that were adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that patients with epidural removal on POD1 have significantly lower pain and an overall decrease in opioid usage on the date of epidural removal compared with patients undergoing epidural removal on POD2. Additionally, they have a shorter LOS as well as lower total opioid usage. Decreasing the duration of epidural usage may reduce pain, opioid usage, and LOS in patients undergoing PAO.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether customizing of public service announcements (PSAs) providing health guidelines to match individuals' identities increases their compliance. METHODS: We conducted a within- and between-subjects, randomized controlled cross-sectional, web-based study in July 2020. Participants viewed two PSAs: one advocating wearing a mask in public settings and one advocating staying at home. The control PSA only provided information, and the treatment PSAs were designed to appeal to the identities held by individuals; that is, either a Christian identity or an economically motivated identity. Participants were asked about their identity and then provided a control PSA and treatment PSA matching their identity, in random order. The PSAs were of approximately 100 words. RESULTS: We recruited 300 social media users from Amazon Mechanical Turk in accordance with usual protocols to ensure data quality. In total, 8 failed the data quality checks, and the remaining 292 were included in the analysis. In the identity-based PSA, the source of the PSA was changed, and a phrase of approximately 12 words relevant to the individual's identity was inserted. A PSA tailored for Christians, when matched with a Christian identity, increased the likelihood of compliance by 12 percentage points. A PSA that focused on economic values, when shown to individuals who identified as economically motivated, increased the likelihood of compliance by 6 points. CONCLUSIONS: Using social media to deliver COVID-19 public health announcements customized to individuals' identities is a promising measure to increase compliance with public health guidelines.

The ability of the pathogens to withstand the dry conditions and to develop resistance to heat is regarded as the major concern for the food industry dealing with low-moisture foods. In this regard, the present review is aimed to discuss the importance and the use of novel thermal and nonthermal technologies such as radiofrequency, steam pasteurization, plasma, and gaseous technologies for decontamination of foodborne pathogens in low-moisture foods and their microbial inactivation mechanisms. The review also summarizes the various sources of contamination and the factors influencing the survival and thermal resistance of pathogenic microorganisms in low-moisture foods. The literature survey indicated that the nonthermal techniques such as CO2 , high-pressure processing, and so on, may not offer effective microbial inactivation in low-moisture foods due to their insufficient moisture content. On the other hand, gases can penetrate deep inside the commodities and pores due to their higher diffusion properties and are regarded to have an advantage over thermal and other nonthermal processes. Further research is required to evaluate newer intervention strategies and combination treatments to enhance the microbial inactivation in low-moisture foods without significantly altering their organoleptic and nutritional quality.","Wason, Surabhi; Verma, Tushar; Subbiah, Jeyamkondan",,,435

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the onset of adverse facial skin reactions due to compulsory face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic in HCWs and non-HCWs, and draw awareness of this new dermatological condition and its preventive measures. MATERIALS & METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to 550 patients and HCWs from the Department of Dermatology and Allergy of the University Hospital Munich (LMU), Germany. Participants were surveyed regarding mask type, duration of usage and adverse facial skin reactions. Information on symptoms and the use of skin care products and topical drugs were retrieved. RESULTS: The duration of wearing masks showed a significant impact on the prevalence of symptoms (p < 0.001). Type IV hypersensitivity was significantly more likely in participants with symptoms compared to those without symptoms (p = 0.001), whereas no increase in symptoms was observed in participants with atopic diathesis. HCWs used facial skin care products significantly more often than non-HCWs (p = 0.001).

332434,Lessons Learned about Covid-19 in Assisted Living Facilities,2021,"BACKGROUND: First detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic stretched the medical system in Wuhan and posed a challenge to the state's risk communication efforts. Timely access to quality health care information during outbreaks of infectious diseases can be effective to curtail the spread of disease and feelings of anxiety. Although existing studies have extended our knowledge about online health information-seeking behavior, processes, and motivations, rarely have the findings been applied to an outbreak. Moreover, there is relatively little recent research on how people in China are using the internet for seeking health information during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore how people in China are using the internet for seeking health information during a pandemic. Drawing on previous research of online health information seeking, this study asks the following research questions: how was the ""#COVID-19 Patient Seeking Help"" hashtag being used by patients in Wuhan seeking health information on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak? and what kinds of health information were patients in Wuhan seeking on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak? METHODS: Using entity identification and textual analysis on 10,908 posts on Weibo, we identified 1496 patients with COVID-19 using ""#COVID-19 Patient Seeking Help"" and explored their online health information-seeking behavior. RESULTS: The curve of the hashtag posting provided a dynamic picture of public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients faced difficulties accessing offline health care services. In general, our findings confirmed that the internet is used by the Chinese public as an important source of health information. The lockdown policy was found to cut off the patients' social support network, preventing them from seeking help from family members. The ability to seek information and help online, especially for those with young children or older adult members during the pandemic. A high proportion of female users were seeking health information and help for their parents or for older adults at home. The most searched information included accessing medical treatment, managing self-quarantine, and offline to online support. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of health information-seeking behaviors during an outbreak and highlight the importance of paying attention to the information needs of vulnerable groups and the role social media may play.","Zhao, Xiaoman; Fan, Ju; Basnyat, Iccha; Hu, Baijing",J Med Internet Res,,435

333018,"A Perspective About the Construction of the ""Hospital de Campanha Porto.""",2020,"Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) become critically ill primarily around the time of activation of the adaptive immune response. Here, we provide evidence that antibodies play a role in the worsening of disease at the time of seroconversion. We show that early-phase severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serum of critically ill COVID-19 patients induces excessive inflammatory responses by human alveolar macrophages. We identified that this excessive inflammatory response is dependent on two antibody features that are specific for patients with severe COVID-19. First, inflammation is driven by high titers of anti-spike IgG, a hallmark of severe disease. Second, we found that anti-spike IgG from patients with severe COVID-19 is intrinsically more proinflammatory because of different glycosylation, particularly low fucosylation, of the antibody Fc tail. Low fucosylation of anti-spike IgG was normalized in a few weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the increased antibody-dependent inflammation mainly occurs at the time of seroconversion. We identified FcÎ³ receptor (FcÎ³R) IIa and FcÎ³RIII as the two primary IgG receptors that are responsible for the induction of key COVID-19-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. In addition, we show that anti-spike IgG-activated human macrophages can subsequently break pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induce microvascular thrombosis in vitro. Last, we demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by anti-spike IgG can be specifically counteracted by fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small-molecule inhibitor of Syk kinase.","Hoepel, Willianne; Chen, Hung-Jen; Geyer, Chiara E; Allahverdiyeva, Sona; Manz, Xue D; de Taeye, Steven W; Aman, Jurjan; Mes, Lynn; Steenhuis, Maurice; Griffith, Guillermo R; Bonta, Peter I; Brouwer, Philip J M; Caniels, Tom G; van der Straten, Karlijn; Golebski, Korneliusz; Jonkers, René E; Larsen, Mads D; Linty, Federica; Nouta, Jan; van Roomen, Cindy P A A; van Baarle, Frank E H P; van Drunen, Cornelis M; Wolbink, Gertjan; Vlaar, Alexander P J; de Bree, Godelieve J; Sanders, Rogier W; Willemsen, Lisa; Neele, Annette E; van de Beek, Diederik; Rispens, Theo; Wuhrer, Manfred; Bogaard, Harm Jan; van Gils, Marit J; Vidarsson, Gestur; de Winther, Menno; den Dunnen, Jeroen",Sci. transl. med,,435

Compared to the reference strain of SARS-CoV-2, the majority of currently circulating isolates possess an S protein variant characterized by an aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution at amino acid position 614 (D614G). Residue 614 lies outside the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the mutation does not alter the affinity of monomeric S protein for ACE2. However, S(G614), compared to S(D614), mediates more efficient ACE2-mediated transduction of cells by S-pseudotyped vectors and more efficient infection of cells and animals by live SARS-CoV-2. This review summarizes and synthesizes the epidemiological and functional observations of the D614G spike mutation, with focus on the biochemical and cell-biological impact of this mutation and its consequences for S protein function. We further discuss the significance of these recent findings in the context of the current global pandemic.","Jackson, Cody B; Zhang, Lizhou; Farzan, Michael; Choe, Hyeryun",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,435

Societies that use social platforms should be inclusive, responsive to evidence, limit punitive actions and allow productive discord and respectful disagreement. Social media success, we argue, is in the hypothesis. Documents are valuable to the degree that they are evidence in service of, or to challenge an idea for a purpose. We outline how a Bayesian social platform can facilitate virtuous behaviours to build evidence-based collective rationality. The chapter outlines the epistemic architecture of the platform's algorithms and user interface in conjunction with explicit community management to ensure psychological safety. The BetterBeliefs platform rewards users who demonstrate epistemically virtuous behaviours and exports evidence-based propositions for decision-making.

To many fans now, it seems to have an obsessional, unhealthy importance. The current Covid-19 pandemic is an opportunity to gain a renewed perspective on football. It is just a game. We can easily live without it–if we have to. During the Second World War, for example, professional league football stopped in England for seven years. The current disruption of the game may enable us to see and value the game in a different, healthier way. This commentary explores the impact of Covid-19 on the game in England, in part by using a historical perspective, drawing upon events which have significantly disrupted the game in the country in the past. To put events in England in a wider perspective, I also then include some reflections on the impact of Covid-19, other pandemics and other events, which have disrupted football around the world.","Moore, Kevin",Soccer Soc.,,435

Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain. The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population. An online survey was administered from 18-22 March 2020 to 2766 participants. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress. Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively. This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.","Mazza, Cristina; Ricci, Eleonora; Biondi, Silvia; Colasanti, Marco; Ferracuti, Stefano; Napoli, Christian; Roma, Paolo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,435

The viral pathogen responsible for the disease was named as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), and for the illness the acronym COVID-19 was coined (COronaVIrus Disease 2019). Viral pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinics are still somewhat obscure, when occurring during childhood the most. This systematic review aims at evaluating the features of liver involvement and damage in course of COVID-19. An insight into what is known as to COVID-19 and hepatic damage in adulthood as well as paediatric age was given. All the most relevant papers up to 15/10/2020 were identified and discussed. Establishing whether liver damage is due to a direct viral action or host immune system inflammatory reaction or consequence of the administered drugs or secondary to another organ failure (for example the heart) is difficult. What is sure is the fact that liver function should be checked at the time of admission to hospital and during hospitalization. If hepatic markers are altered, a specific therapy to protect liver is needed.","Mameli, Simone; Marcialis, Maria Antonietta; Bassareo, Pier Paolo; Fanos, Vassilios",Panminerva med,,435

The same exponential dynamics has been observed between January and March, 2021. The forecast of new cases and death recorded daily is crucial so that health experts and citizens can be guided in order to avoid escalation of the pandemic. We propose a deterministic method to predict the basic reproduction number Ro of first and second wave of COVID-19 cases in Kuwait and also to forecast the daily new cases and death of the pandemic in the country. Forecasting has been done using ARIMA model, Exponential smoothing model, Holts method, Prophet forecasting model and machine learning models like log-linear, polynomial and support vector regressions. The results presented aligned with other methods used to predict Ro in first and second waves and the forecasting clearly shows the trend of the pandemic in Kuwait. The deterministic prediction of Ro is a good forecasting tool available during the exponential phase of the contagion, which shows an increasing trend during the beginning of the first and second waves of the pandemic in Kuwait.","Oshinubi, Kayode; Al-Awadhi, Fahimah; Rachdi, Mustapha; Demongeot, Jacques",,,435

PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who developed pneumothorax. In addition, we compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated patients who developed a pneumothorax with those who did not develop a pneumothorax. METHODS: This study was a multicenter retrospective analysis of all adult critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection who were admitted to intensive care units in 4 tertiary care centers in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 842 critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection were analyzed, out of which 594 (71%) were mechanically ventilated. The overall incidence of pneumothorax was 85/842 (10%), and 80/594 (13%) in those who were mechanically ventilated. As compared to mechanically ventilated patients in the non-pneumothorax group, mechanically ventilated patients in the pneumothorax group had worse respiratory parameters at the time of intubation (mean PaO2:FiO2 ratio 105 vs 150, P<0.001 and static respiratory system compliance: 30ml/cmH2O vs 39ml/cmH2O, P = 0.01) and significantly higher in-hospital mortality (63% vs 49%, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of pneumothorax in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection was 13%.

Recently, eosinophils have been shown to have various other functions, including immunoregulation and antiviral activity. Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical settings, especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now available to selectively deplete these cells. There are key coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related questions concerning eosinophils whose answers affect recommended prevention and care. First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases have an altered course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with eosinopenia (now intentionally induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease course? This is a particularly relevant question because eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines?

METHODS: A total of 107 patients admitted to a CTC were included as the study population, and their mental health problems including depression (patient health questionnaire-9), anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder scale-7), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (PTSD checklist-5) and somatic symptoms (by patient health questionnaire-15) were evaluated every week during their stay. The stigma related to COVID-19 infection was evaluated with an adjusted version of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) stigma scale. RESULTS: During the first week of isolation, the prevalence of more-than-moderate depression was 24.3%, more-than-moderate anxiety was 14.9%, more-than-moderate somatic symptoms was 36.5% and possible PTSD was 5.6% of total population. For depression and anxiety, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection were significant risk factors. For PTSD, previous psychiatric history and stigma of COVID-19 infection as well as total duration of isolation were found to be significant risk factors. Prevalence of depression, anxiety and possible PTSD remained similar across the four weeks of observations, though the prevalence of severe depression, increased after four weeks of stay. Somatic symptoms seemed to decrease during their stay. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that social mitigation of COVID-19 related stigma, as well as care of patients with pre-existing mental health problems are important mental health measures during this crisis period. It is also important that clinical guidelines and public health policies be well balanced over the protection of the public and those quarantined to minimize the negative psychosocial consequences from isolation of the patients.","Kang, EunKyo; Lee, Sun Young; Kim, Min Sun; Jung, Hyemin; Kim, Kyae Hyung; Kim, Kyoung Nam; Park, Hye Yoon; Lee, Yu Jin; Cho, Belong; Sohn, Jee Hoon",J Korean Med Sci,,435

All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs. CONCLUSION: LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin &#8805;1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.","Goel, Harsh; Harmouch, Farah; Garg, Kawish; Saraiya, Pooja; Daly, Timothy; Kumar, Ashish; Hippen, John T",Eur. j. gastroenterol. hepatol,,435
345654,Restructuring the surgical service during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experience from a tertiary institution in Singapore,2020,"The disinfection of surfaces in medical facilities is an important element of infection control, including the control of viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Preparations used for surface disinfection are typically characterized via their activity against test organisms (i.e., viruses, bacteria and fungi) in the laboratory. Typically, these methods use a suspension of the test organism to assess the bactericidal, fungicidal or virucidal activity of a given preparation. However, such suspension methods do not fully imitate real-life conditions. To address this issue, carrier methods have been developed, in which microorganisms are applied to the surface of a carrier (e.g., stainless steel, glass and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) and then dried. Such methods more accurately reflect the applications in real-life clinical practice. This article summarizes the available methods for assessing the virucidal activity of chemical disinfectants for use in medical facilities based on the current European standards, including the activity against coronaviruses.","Tarka, Patryk; Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta",Viruses,,435
346479,"Ensuring retention in care for people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rome, Italy",2020,"Since its outbreak in China, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused worldwide disaster. Globally, there have been 71,581,532 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,618,374 deaths, reported to World Health Organization (data retrieved on December 16, 2020). Currently, no treatment modalities for COVID-19 (e.g., vaccines or antiviral drugs) with confirmed efficacy and safety are available. Although the possibilities and relevant challenges of some alternatives (e.g., use of stem cells as immunomodulators) have been proposed, the personal protective equipment is still the only way to protect and lower infection rates of COVID-19 among healthcare workers and airway managers (intubators). In this article, we described the combined use of a plastic sheet as a barrier with the intubating stylet for tracheal intubation in patients needing mechanical ventilation. Although conventional or video-assisted laryngoscopy is more popular and familiar to other groups around the world, we believe that the video-assisted intubating stylet technique is much easier to learn and master. Advantages of the video stylet include the creation of greater working distance between intubator and patient, less airway stimulation, and less pharyngeal space needed for endotracheal tube advancement. All the above features make this technique reliable and superior to other devices, especially when a difficult airway is encountered in COVID scenario. Meanwhile, we proposed the use of a flexible and transparent plastic sheet to serve as a barrier against aerosol and droplet spread during airway management. We demonstrated that the use of a plastic sheet would not interfere or hinder the intubator's maneuvers during endotracheal intubation. Moreover, we demonstrated that the plastic sheet was effective in preventing the spread of mist and water spray in simulation models with a mannequin. In our experience, we found that this technique most effectively protected the intubator and other operating room personnel from infection during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Luk, Hsiang-Ning; Yang, Yao-Lin; Huang, Ching-Hsuan; Su, I-Min; Tsai, Phil B",Cell Transplant,,435
347529,How to Make Digitalization Better Serve an Increasing Quality of Life?,2021,"COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 11 by WHO, due to its great threat to global public health. The coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) is essential for processing and maturation of the viral polyprotein, therefore recognized as an attractive drug target. Here we show that a clinically approved anti-HCV drug, Boceprevir, and a pre-clinical inhibitor against feline infectious peritonitis (corona) virus (FIPV), GC376, both efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells by targeting Mpro. Moreover, combined application of GC376 with Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), results in sterilizing additive effect. Further structural analysis reveals binding of both inhibitors to the catalytically active side of SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro as main mechanism of inhibition. Our findings may provide critical information for the optimization and design of more potent inhibitors against the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Fu, Lifeng; Ye, Fei; Feng, Yong; Yu, Feng; Wang, Qisheng; Wu, Yan; Zhao, Cheng; Sun, Huan; Huang, Baoying; Niu, Peihua; Song, Hao; Shi, Yi; Li, Xuebing; Tan, Wenjie; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George Fu",Nat Commun,,435

To stop the spread of the disease, it is crucial to create molecular tools allowing the investigation, diagnoses and treatment of COVID-19. One of such tools are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In this study we describe the development of hybridoma cells that can produce mouse mAbs against receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. These mAbs are able to specifically detect native and denatured S proteins in all tested applications, including immunoblotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence staining of cells and immunohistochemical staining of paraffin embedded patients' tissue samples. In addition, we showed that the obtained mAbs can efficiently block SARS-CoV-2 infection in in vitro experiments. Finally, we determined the amino acid sequence of light and heavy chains of the mAbs. This information will allow the use of corresponding peptides to establish genetically engineered therapeutic antibodies. To date multiple mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 proteins have been established, however, bigger sets of various antibodies will allow the detection and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, even if the virus acquires novel mutations.","Antipova, Nadezhda V; Larionova, Tatyana D; Siniavin, Andrei E; Nikiforova, Maria A; Gushchin, Vladimir A; Babichenko, Igor I; Volkov, Alexey V; Shakhparonov, Michail I; Pavlyukov, Marat S",Int. j. mol. sci.

349368,Google searches in patient self-care increase during the COVID-19 lockdown,2020,"There is rising international concern about the zoonotic origins of many global pandemics. Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem services into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases; and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the 'biodiversity crisis'. This also highlights the need for concerted global action, and is also consistent with the duties, and ultimately the self-interests, of developed, donor nations.","Everard, Mark; Johnston, Paul; Santillo, David; Staddon, Chad",Environ Sci Policy,,435
349749,Psychological and Neurobiological Aspects of Suicide in Adolescents: Current Outlooks,2020,"Since its emergence in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide including Pakistan. During the pandemic, whole genome sequencing has played an important role in understanding the evolution and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Although an unprecedented number of SARS-CoV-2 full genomes have been submitted in GISAID and NCBI, data from Pakistan is scarce. We report the sequencing, genomic characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients in Pakistan. The oropharyngeal swabs of patients that were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR at National Institute of Health, Pakistan, were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs Inc., MA, US) and Illumina iSeq 100 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, US). Based on whole-genome analysis, three Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 strains clustered into the 20A (GH) clade along with the strains from Oman, Slovakia, United States, and Pakistani strain EPI_ISL_513925. The two 19B (S)-clade strains were closely related to viruses from India and Oman. Overall, twenty-nine amino acid mutations were detected in the current study genome sequences, including fifteen missense and four novel mutations. Notably, we have found a D614G (aspartic acid to glycine) mutation in spike protein of the sequences from the GH clade. The G614 variant carrying the characteristic D614G mutation has been shown to be more infectious that lead to its rapid spread worldwide. This report highlights the detection of GH and S clade strains and G614 variant from Pakistan warranting large-scale whole-genome sequencing of strains prevalent in different regions to understand virus evolution and to explore their genetic diversity.","Umair, Massab; Ikram, Aamer; Salman, Muhammad; Khurshid, Adnan; Alam, Masroor; Badar, Nazish; Suleman, Rana; Tahir, Faheem; Sharif, Salmaan; Montgomery, Joel; Whitmer, Shannon; Klena, John",PLoS One,,435

350095,Specific approaches to patients affected by dementia and covid-19 in nursing homes: the role of the geriatrician,2021,"BACKGROUND: Current vaccines for the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) have demonstrated efficacy with low risk of adverse events. However, recent reports of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with adenovirus vector vaccines have raised concern. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review summarizes the current background, evaluation, and management of TTS for emergency clinicians. DISCUSSION: TTS, also known as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia, is a reaction associated with exposure to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and AD26.COV2·S (Johnson & Johnson) vaccine, which may result in thrombocytopenia and thrombotic events. There are several case series of patients diagnosed with TTS, but the overall incidence is rare. TTS is characterized by exposure to one of the aforementioned vaccines 4-30 days prior to presentation, followed by thrombosis, mild-to-severe thrombocytopenia, and a positive platelet factor-4 (PF4)-heparin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Thrombosis typically involves atypical locations, including cerebral venous thrombosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis. Evaluation should include complete blood count, peripheral smear, D-dimer, fibrinogen, coagulation panel, renal and liver function, and electrolytes, as well as PF4-heparin ELISA if available. Consultation with hematology is recommended if suspected or confirmed. Treatment may include intravenous immunoglobulin and anticoagulation, while avoiding heparin-based agents and platelet transfusion. CONCLUSIONS: With increasing vaccine distribution, it is essential for emergency clinicians to be aware of the evaluation and management of this condition.","Long, Brit; Bridwell, Rachel; Gottlieb, Michael",Am J Emerg Med,,435
350096,Specific approaches to patients affected by dementia and covid-19 in nursing homes: the role of the geriatrician,2021,"Background and Aim: This study aims to determine COVID-19 patient demographics and comorbidities associated with their hospital length of stay (LOS). Methods: Design: Single-site, retrospective study. Setting : A suburban 700-bed community hospital in Newark, Delaware, USA. Patients: Patients admitted to the hospital from March 11, 2020, to August 11, 2020, with a positive COVID-19 status. We followed a time-to-event analysis approach and used Kaplan-Meir curves and log-rank tests for bivariate analyses, and an accelerated failure time model for a multivariable model of hospital LOS. Results: Six hundred and eighty-seven patients discharged alive (mean [SD] age, 60.94 [18.10] years;339 men [49.34%];307 Black/African-American [44.69%];and 267 White [38.86%]) were included in the investigation. Bivariate analysis using Kaplan-Meir curves showed that patients' age, sex, ethnicity, insurance type, comorbidity of fluid and electrolyte disorder, hypertension, renal failure, diabetes, coagulopathy, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, neurological disorder, coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmias to be significantly associated with LOS (P&lt;0.05). In the multivariable analysis, patients' age, sex, ethnicity, number of Elixhauser comorbidities, and number of weeks since onset of the pandemic was significantly associated with LOS (P&lt;0.05). Fluid and electrolyte disorder is the only comorbidity independently associated with LOS after adjusting for patients' age, sex, race, ethnicity, number of Elixhauser comorbidities, and weeks since onset of pandemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients LOS vary based on multiple factors. Understanding these factors are crucial to improving the prediction accuracy of COVID-19 patient census in hospitals for resource planning and care delivery. Relevance for patients: Understanding of the factors associated with LOS of the COVID-19 patients may help the care providers and the patients to better anticipate the LOS, optimize the resources and processes, and prevent protracted stays.","Chiam, T.; Subedi, K.; Chen, D.; Best, E.; Bianco, F.

In this work, we demonstrated a strategy of using a superhydrophobic photothermal and thermal isolation macroporous xerogel (PMX) to delay icing and remove ice efficiently under faint sunlight irradiation. An oriented macroporous xerogel was prepared by an ice templating method, and multi-walled carbon nanotubes acting as the photothermal genesis component under sunlight irradiation were introduced into the xerogel. After fluorination, the PMX presented a robust water repellency and delayed icing. More importantly, numerous macropores in the PMX matrix acted as the thermal barrier that can restrict heat transmission to surroundings at maximum, which guarantees efficient anti-icing and de-icing in low temperature. Water on the PMX surface can never freeze at -30 °C under 0.25 kW/m2 (""0.25 sun"") sunlight irradiation. The outdoor experiment also has confirmed the availability of PMX in a natural winter environment. The PMX integrated with thermogenesis and thermo-isolation functions provides a new route for highly efficient anti-icing and de-icing.","Yu, Bo; Sun, Zhengrong; Liu, Yubo; Zhang, Zhizhi; Wu, Yang; Zhou, Feng",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,435

14 %) and those with coexisting conditions (10 % for those with cardiovascular disease and 7 % for those with diabetes) (Emanuel et al in N Engl J Med 2020) Overall, Covid-19 is substantially deadlier than seasonal influenza, which has a mortality of roughly 0 1 % Public health efforts depend heavily on predicting how diseases such as those caused by Covid-19 spread across the globe During the early days of a new outbreak, when reliable data are still scarce, researchers turn to mathematical models that can predict where people who could be infected are going and how likely they are to bring the disease with them These computational methods use known statistical equations that calculate the probability of individuals transmitting the illness Modern computational power allows these models to quickly incorporate multiple inputs, such as a given disease’s ability to pass from person to person and the movement patterns of potentially infected people traveling by air and land This process sometimes involves making assumptions about unknown factors, such as an individual’s exact travel pattern By plugging in different possible versions of each input, however, researchers can update the models as new information becomes available and compare their results to observed patterns for the illness In this paper we describe the development a model of Corona spread by using innovative big data analytics techniques and tools We leveraged our experience from research in modeling Ebola spread (Shaw et al Modeling Ebola Spread and Using HPCC/KEL System In: Big Data Technologies and Applications 2016 (pp 347-385) Springer, Cham) to successfully model Corona spread, we will obtain new results, and help in reducing the number of Corona patients We closely collaborated with LexisNexis, which is a leading US data analytics company and a member of our NSF I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement The lack of a comprehensive view and informative analysis of the status of the pandemic can also cause panic and instability within society Our work proposes the HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker, which provides a multi-level view of the pandemic with the informative virus spreading indicators in a timely manner The system embeds a classical epidemiological model known as SIR and spreading indicators based on causal model The data solution of the tracker is built on top of the Big Data processing platform HPCC Systems, from ingesting and tracking of various data sources to fast delivery of the data to the public The HPCC Systems Covid-19 tracker presents the Covid-19 data on a daily, weekly, and cumulative basis up to global-level and down to the county-level It also provides statistical analysis for each level such as new cases per 100,000 population The primary analysis such as Contagion Risk and Infection State is based on causal model with a seven-day sliding window Our work has been released as a publicly available website to the world and attracted a great volume of traffic The project is open-sourced and available on GitHub The system was developed on the LexisNexis HPCC Systems, which is briefly described in the paper","Villanustre, Flavio Chala Arjuna Dev Roger Xu Lili LexisNexis Jesse Shaw Furht Borko Khoshgoftaar Taghi",Journal of Big Data,,435

Current approaches do not quantify the uncertainty correctly in estimating $R_t$, as expected by the observed variability in contagion patterns. We elaborate on the Bayesian estimation of $R_t$ by improving on the Poisson sampling model of Cori et al. (2013). By adding an autoregressive latent process, we build a Dynamic Linear Model on the log of observed $R_t$s, resulting in a filtering type Bayesian inference. We use a conjugate analysis, and all calculations are explicit. Results show an improved uncertainty quantification on the estimation of $R_t$'s, with a reliable method that could safely be used by non-experts and within other forecasting systems. We illustrate our approach with recent data from the current COVID19 epidemic in Mexico.","Capistr'an, Marcos A.; Capella, Antonio; Christen, J. Andr'es",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02168v1.pdf,435
362596,Pediatric Trauma and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A 12-Year Comparison in a Level-1 Trauma Center,2020,"Background: A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design: Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic. In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a ""tele-bridge"" clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment.

Furthermore, the effects of an oral rehydration solution (ORS) mixed into milk replacer on the AER were determined. Acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was performed to estimate the AER. Sixty Holstein-Frisian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study and divided into groups as follows: healthy calves (H; n = 16), healthy calves fed with ORS (HORS; n = 14), diarrhoeic calves (D; n = 15) and diarrhoeic calves fed with ORS (DORS; n = 15). For the APAT, the calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen (AP)/kg body weight. Venous blood samples were collected before and after milk replacer and AP intake in 30-60 min intervals for 12 hr. During the APAT, no significant differences in median maximum acetaminophen concentration (Cmax ) were observed among all groups. Time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (Tmax ) in DORS (median 390 min, 25/75 quartiles: 300/480 min) was significantly higher compared with that in H (median: 270 min 25/75 quartiles: 210/315 min) and HORS (median: 300 min (25/75 quartiles: 240/360 min). Non-linear regression revealed that the calculated abomasal half-life (AP t1/2 ) tended to be delayed in DORS (median: 652 min, 25/75 quartiles: 445/795 min, p = .10). The area under the AP curve values (AUC) from 0 to 120 min and 0 to 240 min of the observation period were significantly higher in H than D and DORS. In conclusion, significant differences in the AER indices reflected delayed abomasal emptying in diarrhoeic calves. Furthermore, the hypertonic ORS tended to have an additive delaying impact on the AER, which needs attention for the feeding management of diarrhoeic calves.","Hildebrandt, Thomas; Scheuch, Eberhard; Weitschies, Werner; Schneider, Felix; Grimm, Michael; Bachmann, Lisa; Vervuert, Ingrid",J Anim Physiol Anim Nutr (Berl),,435

It was found that Cu/Co/Ni TNA greatly enhanced the chemiluminescence (CL) signal of the hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid (HOSA)-luminol system. The CL properties of Cu/Co/Ni TNA were investigated systemically. The possible CL mechanism also was intensively investigated. Based on the enhanced CL phenomenon of Cu/Co/Ni TNA, a Cu/Co/Ni TNA, penicillin, and anti-L. monocytogenes (Listeria monocytogenes) antibody-based sandwich complex assay for detection of L. monocytogenes was established. In this sandwich CL assay, penicillin was employed to capture and enrich pathogenic bacteria with penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) while anti-L. monocytogenes antibody was adopted as the specific recognition molecule to recognize L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes was detected sensitively based on this new Cu/Co/Ni TNA-HOSA-luminol CL system. The CL intensity was proportional to the L. monocytogenes concentration ranging from 2.0 × 102 CFU ml-1 to 3.0 × 107 CFU ml-1 and the limit of detection wa 70 CFU ml-1 .

If the homeopathy community fails to take advantage of this rare opportunity, it might wait another century for the next major pandemic.","Oberbaum, Menachem",Homeopathy,,435
368860,Emergence from the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Care of Chronic Pain: Guidance for the Interventionalist,2020,"Novice teachers struggle with assessing fundamental motor skills. With growing time constraints, not to mention the current COVID-19 pandemic, professional development needs to be streamlined, asynchronous, and online to meet the needs of current teachers. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and efficacy of the Motor Skill Assessment Program (MSAP) in increasing the assessment competency of the underhand roll among physical educators and to examine which factors associated with posttest assessment scores. Twenty-nine physical educators (female = 21, male = 8) completed the program. Paired sample t tests were used to determine the efficacy of the program in improving assessment accuracy from pretest to posttest. Associations between posttest scores assessed which factors predicted success within the program addressing feasibility. Program completion resulted in significantly better posttest assessment scores among participants. Guided practice attempts and average scores on guided practice tests correlated most strongly and positively with posttest scores. The assessment training program increased the assessment competency of physical educators. Guided practice and using practice tests best predicted participant learning. Now that the MSAP results with teacher learning and is feasible, this efficacy trial should be scaled up to feature a control group and more skills.

Design/methodology/approach: We utilise a singular case method to observe accountability implications in the case organisation. We also utilise two sources of primary data: eight semi-structured interviews with volunteers of the NGO branch, supported by auto-ethnographic data recorded in forty-six diary entries throughout the period of research. Findings: As the main mechanism for the discharge of beneficiary accountability for the case organisation is through action, this was affected greatly by the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures. Beneficiary accountability (discharged through action) changed rapidly, resulting in neglect of previous beneficiaries, carrying profound implications for charitable actors, beneficiaries and the organisation. Research limitations/implications: Our case focuses on that of a small organisation, and therefore the generalisability of findings will be somewhat limited and context specific. The number of interviews (eight) is also relatively small. Practical implications: Insights can be drawn for the management of volunteers, alignment of personally held accountabilities of internal actors with those of organisations and emotional aspects of accountability for NGO managers and organisers. Originality/value: NGO accountability theorisation is enhanced via the use of Levinas' Judaic writings concerning the importance of the ritual practice of ethics for the individual involved in charitable action.

370266,Expansion of asynchronous teledermatology during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"The COVID-19 has caused the deadliest pandemic around the globe, emerged from the city of Wuhan, China by the end of 2019 and affected all continents of the world, with severe health implications and as well as financial-damage. Pakistan is also amongst the top badly effected countries in terms of casualties and financial loss due to COVID-19. By 20th March, 2021, Pakistan reported 623,135 total confirmed cases and 13,799 deaths. A state space model called 'Bayesian Dynamic Linear Model' (BDLM) was used for the forecast of daily new infections, deaths and recover cases regarding COVID-19. For the estimation of states of the models and forecasting new observations, the recursive Kalman filter was used. Twenty days ahead forecast show that the maximum number of new infections are 4,031 per day with 95% prediction interval (3,319-4,743). Death forecast shows that the maximum number of the deaths with 95% prediction interval are 81 and (67-93), respectively. Maximum daily recoveries are 3,464 with 95% prediction interval (2,887-5,423) in the next 20 days. The average number of new infections, deaths and recover cases are 3,282, 52 and 1,840, respectively, in the upcoming 20 days. As the data generation processes based on the latest data has been identified, therefore it can be updated with the availability of new data to provide latest forecast.","Khan, Firdos; Ali, Shaukat; Saeed, Alia; Kumar, Ramesh; Khan, Abdul Wali",PLoS One,,435

The relationship of rheumatic diseases, their therapies, and COVID-19 with multiple genuine and malicious information available online can influence the knowledge and attitudes of rheumatic patients. This Google Forms study was conducted to understand the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of rheumatology patients with regard to COVID-19 in Nepal. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with rheumatic diseases. A modified version of a questionnaire was used after consent had been obtained. It was then translated into Nepali for comprehensibility. The final questionnaire contained a total of 29 questions: six on demographic parameters and twelve, five, and six on knowl-edge, attitudes and practice, respectively. Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe the positive responses in each domain. Logistic regression analysis was done to observe demographic variables associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practice. Results: Among 380 participants, 63.2% were female, the majority (42.1%) aged 18–29 years, and all were literate. Most were aware of the clinical features of COVID-19 (91.6%), 71.5% had positive attitudes toward its control, some (31.5%) thought that they had a greater chance of contracting COVID-19 than others, and 18.9% believed that antirheumatic medications could increase their susceptibility to infection. A majority (&gt;94.7%) of them practiced preventive measures. Conclusion: Patients with rheumatic diseases were aware of the general clinical features, routes of transmission, and general preventive measures regarding COVID-19 and did not significantly change their treatment practices.","Vaidya, Binit; Bhochhibhoya, Manisha; Baral, Rikesh; Nakarmi, Shweta",Open Access Rheumatol.

METHODS: 95 patients, whose nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 was positive to make a definite diagnosis of COVID-19, were selected as the study group. They were admitted at the Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center from January 21 to March 2, 2020. Another 95 healthy subjects and 95 non-infectious fever patients during the same period were selected as the control group. The BC-6900 blood cell analyzer was used to continuously observe and detect ECs in 95 patients with COVID-19 and the control group. The differences in expression levels of ECs in peripheral blood were analyzed. RESULTS: ECs were significantly decreased in 95 (75.8%) COVID-19 patients (P < .01). The absolute EC count IQR was 0.01 × 109/L (0 × 109/L - 0.04 × 109/L), and the EC percentage IQR was 0.3% (0.1% - 0.8%). As the patients' condition improved, the ECs returned to normal, but for those without improvement, ECs continued to decline. CONCLUSIONS: ECs decreased remarkably in patients with COVID-19, and gradually returned to normal after the improvement of the patients' condition, while EC continued to decrease in patients without improvement. It is suggested that ECs have certain clinical significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19, and may be a useful index in the early warning of acute infectious diseases.","Mu, Tong; Yi, Zumu; Wang, Minjin; Wang, Junren; Zhang, Chongwei; Chen, Hong; Bai, Mingxuan; Jiang, Lingyu; Zhang, Yuwei",J Clin Lab Anal,,435

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes from 2009 to 2012 were recruited for this population-based and observational study. Diabetes complications severity index (DCSI) score and defined daily dose (DDD) were used for analysis. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia by DPP4i use, with adjustments for propensity score. The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test was used to estimate the risk of KP pneumonia for DPP4i users. RESULTS: 34774 patients were included. The incidence rate of KP pneumonia in DDP4i users was 1.51 per 1000 person-years and that for the comparison was 2.25 per 1000 person-years. DDP4i users also had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of KP pneumonia (log-rank test p-value = 0.03). DDP4i users had a significantly lower risk of developing KP pneumonia compared with nonusers (adjusted HR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.48-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: For public health issue with type2 diabetes and infection, DPP4i use decreased KP pneumonia. Male gender, patients with co-morbidities, patients with higher DSCI score and higher DDD of DPP4i were observed to decrease KP pneumonia infection in our analysis. The possible role of DPP4i causing immunological disturbances should be considered.","Chen, Hsin-Hung; Chen, Ching-Chu; Ho, Chun-Wei; Hsieh, Ming-Chia; Hsu, Sheng-Pang; Lin, Cheng-Li; Kao, Chia-Hung",Postgrad Med,,435

Lack of definitive vaccine/drugs against this highly contagious virus has accelerated exploratory research on novel natural and synthetic inhibitors. Tea is a rich source of bioactives and known to have antiviral properties. In this study, an in silico strategy involving ADMET property screening, receptor-ligand docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was employed to screen potential tea bio-active inhibitors against three selected targets (RdRp, 3CLpro and PLpro) of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 70 tea bioactives screened, theaflavin 3,3'-di-gallate (TF3), Procyanidin B2 and Theaflavin 3-gallate (TF2a) exhibited highest binding affinities towards RdRp, 3CLpro/Mpro and PLpro targets of SARS-CoV-2 with low docking scores of -14.92, -11.68 and -10.90 kcal/mol, respectively. All of them showed a substantial number of hydrogen bonds along with other interactions in and around the active sites. Interestingly, the top bioactives in our study showed higher binding affinities compared with known antiviral drugs. Further, the top protein-ligand complexes showed less conformational changes during binding when subjected to MD simulation for 100 nanoseconds. The MMPBSA results revealed that RdRp-TF3, 3CLpro-Procyanidin B2 and PLpro-TF2a complexes were stable with binding free energies of -93.59 ± 43.97, -139.78 ± 16.51 and -96.88 ± 25.39 kJ/mol, respectively. Our results suggest that theaflavin 3,3'-digallate, Theaflavin 3-gallate and Procyanidin B2 found in black tea have the potential to act as inhibitors for selected targets of SARS-CoV-2 and can be considered as drug candidates in future studies against COVID-19.","Gogoi, Madhurjya; Borkotoky, Meghali; Borchetia, Sangeeta; Chowdhury, Pritom; Mahanta, Saurov; Barooah, Anoop Kumar",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,435

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the worldwide pattern of web based information seeking by public on obesity and related terms and topics using Google Trends. METHODS: We compared the relative frequency of search terms and topics related to Obesity between 2004 and 2019 on Google Trends. The mean relative interest score (RIS) was compared between a 4-year period quartiles. RESULTS: The mean RIS of the search term ""Obesity"" consistently decreased with time in all four quartiles (2004-2019), whereas the RIS of the search topics ""Weight loss"" and ""Abdominal Obesity"" increased. The topic ""Weight loss"" was popular during the month of January and its median RIS for January as compared to other months was higher for the entire study period (p<0.001). The RIS for the search term ""Obese"" decreased over time, whereas ""Body positivity"" and ""Self-Love"" increased after 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increase in prevalence of obesity worldwide, its popularity on internet diminishes. The reason for peaks in months should be explored and may be applied to awareness campaigns for better effectiveness. These patterns suggest normalization of obesity in the society with rise of public curiosity towards image-related obesity rather than its medical implications and harm.","Pawar, Aditya S; Nagpal, Sajan; Pawar, Neha; Lerman, Lilach O; Eirin, Alfonso",,,435
380348,Insights into laser safety considerations during COVID 19 pandemic,2020,"Background After the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, social isolation measures were introduced to contain infection. Although there is currently a slowing down of the infection, a reduction of hospitalizations, especially for myocardial infarction, was observed. The aim of our study is to evaluate the impact of the infectious disease on ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) care during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, through the analysis of recent cases of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods and Results Consecutive patients affected by STEMI from March 1 to 31, 2020, during social restrictions of Italian government, were collected and compared with patients with STEMI treated during March 2019. During March 2020, we observed a 63% reduction of patients with STEMI who were admitted to our catheterization laboratory, when compared with the same period of 2019 (13 versus 35 patients). Changes in all time components of STEMI care were notably observed, particularly for longer median time in symptom-to-first medical contact, spoke-to-hub, and the cumulative symptom-to-wire delay. Procedural data and in-hospital outcomes were similar between the 2 groups, whereas the length of hospitalization was longer in patients of 2020.

Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinical trial staff and clinical trial subjects were surveyed by questionnaire in this study. The results of interviews and questionnaire showed that coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to many changes in the implementation of drug clinical trials, including: a variety of meetings being held online webinars using various platforms, telemedicine and follow-up by video, A large number of deviations from protocol and losses of follow-up, delivery of clinical trial drugs by express, additional workload caused by screening for coronavirus, and anxiety of subjects. These results suggest that the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak has hindered the progress and damaged the quality of clinical trials. The online meeting, remote follow-up, express delivery of drugs and remote monitoring in the epidemic environment can ensure the progress of clinical trials to a certain extent, but they cannot fully guarantee the quality as before.","Chen, Zhimin; Chen, Liran; Chen, Huafang",PLoS One,,435

383289,A Diagnostic Challenge in COVID-19 Pandemic: PCP or COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) as well as mortality. D-dimer is a marker of fibrinolysis and has been used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in VTE among other diseases. The purpose of our study is to describe outcomes from out center and to examine trends in D-dimer levels as it relates to VTE and mortality.Patients admitted with confirmed COVID-19 cases to Emory Healthcare from March 12, 2020 through April 6, 2020 with measured plasma D-dimer levels were included in our retrospective analysis. Relevant data about comorbidities, hospitalization course, laboratory results, and outcomes were analyzed.One hundred fifteen patients were included in our study. Mean age was 64â±â15 years, 47 (41%) females and 84 (73%) African-American. Hypertension was present in 83 (72%) and diabetes in 60 (52%). Mean duration of hospitalization was 19â±â11 days with 62 (54%) patients intubated (mean duration of 13â±â8 days). VTE was diagnosed in 27 (23%) patients (mean time to diagnosis 14â±â9 days). Median D-dimer within the first 7 days of hospitalization was higher (6450 vs. 1596âng/mL, pâ<â0.001) in VTE cases compared to non-VTE cases, and was predictive of VTE (area under the curve [AUC]â=â0.72, optimal threshold 2500âng/mL) although not of mortality (AUC 0.55, Pâ=â.34). Change in D-dimer level (AUCâ=â0.72 Pâ=â.004) and rate of D-dimer rise (AUCâ=â0.75 Pâ=â.001) were also predictive of VTE, though neither predicted death (Pâ>â.05 for all). Within the first 7 days of hospitalization, peak D-dimer level of >2500âng/mL and a rate of change exceeding 150âng/mL/d were predictive of future diagnosis of VTE. Rise in D-dimer >2000âng/mL within any 24 hour period through hospital day 10 had 75% sensitivity and 74% specificity for diagnosis of VTE.We found that both magnitude and rate of rise in d-dimer within the first 10 days of hospitalization are predictive of diagnosis of VTE but not mortality. These parameters may aid in identifying individuals with possible underlying VTE or at high risk for VTE, thereby guiding risk stratification and anticoagulation policies in COVID-19 patients.","Creel-Bulos, Christina; Liu, Michael; Auld, Sara C; Gaddh, Manila; Kempton, Christine L; Sharifpour, Milad; Sniecinski, Roman M; Maier, Cheryl L; Nahab, Fadi B; Rangaraju, Srikant",Medicine (Baltimore),,435

In this context hundreds of models where proposed with the majority of them trained on public datasets. Data scarcity, mismatch between training and target population, group imbalance, and lack of documentation are important sources of bias, hindering the applicability of these models to real-world clinical practice. Considering that datasets are an essential part of model building and evaluation, a deeper understanding of the current landscape is needed. This paper presents an overview of the currently public available COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets. Each dataset is briefly described and potential strength, limitations and interactions between datasets are identified. In particular, some key properties of current datasets that could be potential sources of bias, impairing models trained on them are pointed out. These descriptions are useful for model building on those datasets, to choose the best dataset according the model goal, to take into account the specific limitations to avoid reporting overconfident benchmark results, and to discuss their impact on the generalisation capabilities in a specific clinical setting","Cruz, Beatriz Garcia Santa; Solter, Jan; Bossa, Matias Nicolas; Husch, Andreas Dominik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11572v1.pdf,435
383751,Investigating the impact of COVID-19 on primary care antibiotic prescribing in North West London across two epidemic waves,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the greatest clinical challenges of the last decades. Clinical factors associated with severity of the disease remain unclear. The aim of the study was to characterize Polish patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 and to evaluate potential prognostic factors of severe course of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted from March to July 2020 in the Pulmonology and Allergology Department of the University Hospital in Kraków, Poland. Consecutive patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection were enrolled, and data about past medical history, signs and symptoms, laboratory results, imaging studies results, in-hospital management and outcomes was prospectively gathered. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 100 patients at the mean age of 59.2 (SD 16.1) years among whom 63 (63.0%) were male. Among them 10 (10.0%) died, 47 (47%) presented respiratory failure, 15 (15.0%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 17 (17.0%) developed acute kidney injury, 7 (7.0%) had sepsis and 10 (10.0%) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. Multivariable analysis revealed age (OR 1.1; 95% CI 1.01-1.15), body mass index (BMI; OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.53), modified early warning score (MEWS; OR 3.95; 95% CI 1.48-12), the highest d-dimer value (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.03-2.9) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.03-1.3) to be associated with severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This observational study showed that almost half of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 developed respiratory failure in the course of the disease. Increasing age, BMI, MEWS, d-dimer value and LDH concentration were associated with the severity of COVID-19.","Stachura, Tomasz; Celejewska-Wójcik, Natalia; Polok, Kamil; Górka, Karolina; Licholai, Sabina; Wójcik, Krzysztof; Krawczyk, Jacek; Kozlowska, Anna; Przybyszowski, Marek; Wloch, Tomasz; Górka, Jacek; Sladek, Krzysztof",Adv Respir Med,,435
383918,Reevaluating chronic opioid monitoring during and after the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Abstract: The COVID-19 crisis determined a forceful change in European policy. Despite the theoretical dominance of the mainstream, metrics other than prices were used to decide how to deal with issues such as provisioning, subsidies, and the financial measures they required. This change, which involved both policy makers and the general public, undermined the dominant view that price-centered coordination of the economy constrains socially relevant decisions. It suggests that neoliberal dominance is not robust either in terms of policy priorities or in the way it affects people’s behavior. It also suggests that what a proper economic policy requires is an economic theory that does not merely describe the institutional status quo but foresees its possible change. © 2021, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.","Ramazzotti, P.",Journal of Economic Issues,,435
384049,Impact on Frontline Nurses in the Fight Against Coronavirus Disease,2020,"In view of many European countries and the USA leading to the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, winter season, the evolution of new mutations in the spike protein, and no registered drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 treatment, the discovery of effective and novel therapeutic agents is urgently required. The degrees and frequencies of COVID-19 clinical complications are related to uncontrolled immune responses, secondary bacterial infections, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and chronic pulmonary diseases. It is essential to recognize that the drug repurposing strategy so far remains the only means to manage the disease burden of COVID-19. Despite some success of using single-target drugs in treating the disease, it is beyond suspicion that the virus will acquire drug resistance by acquiring mutations in the drug target. The possible synergistic inhibition of drug efficacy due to drug-drug interaction cannot be avoided while treating COVID-19 and allied clinical complications. Hence, to avoid the unintended development drug resistance and loss of efficacy due to drug-drug interaction, multi-target drugs can be promising tools for the most challenging disease. In the present work, we have carried out molecular docking studies of compounds from the FDA approved drug library, and the FDA approved and passed phase -1 drug libraries with ten therapeutic targets of COVID-19. Results showed that known drugs, including nine anti-inflammatory compounds, four antibiotics, six antidiabetic compounds, and one cardioprotective compound, could effectively inhibit multiple therapeutic targets of COVID-19. Further in-vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies will guide these drugs' proper allocation to treat COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

There are no no pharmacological measures for the prevention or treatment of this infection and, so far, it has caused more than 4´880.000 confirmed cases and 322.000 deaths. The different strategies for the control of the disease that have been proposed involve the participation of different actors. Such participation, guided by legal guidelines based on public health measures, include containment, mitigation, physical isolation, and quarantine. As this is a populationbased problem, information plays a primary role; however, the many new terms hat have arisen and their misuse confuse and, therefore, misinform thus limiting citizen participation. For this reason, we conducted a review of the terms used in epidemics and pandemics of infectious diseases, particularly COVID-19. We considered and differentiated the relevant terms to facilitate the understanding of pathogen's behavior and epidemic and pandemic cycles, as well as the criteria for public health decision-making for the general public. This glossary should facilitate the use of the terms and standardize the information.","Botero-Rodríguez, Felipe; Franco, Oscar",Biomedica,,435

In this comparative study, we sought to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical management of breast cancer in a breast unit in an Italian region with a low incidence of COVID-19 infection. Eighty-three patients were included, of whom 41 received surgery during the height of the pandemic (Group A, operated on between March and April 2020), and 42 during the same period of the year in 2019 (Group B). Clinicopathological characteristics and surgical outcomes were compared between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the two groups with regard to age (p = 0.62), tumour size (p = 0.25), grade (p = 0.27), histology (p = 0.43), positive lymph node status (p = 0.35), and ER positive status (0.35). Waiting time for surgery was slightly longer in Group A (49.11 vs. 46.39 days, p = 0.38). Patients receiving immediate breast reconstruction were significantly less in Group A (p < 0.001). The use of sentinel node biopsy was similar in the two groups (p = 0.84). Hospital stay was longer in patients of Group B (p = 0.008). The use of regional nerve blocks was lower in Group A (p < 0.001). Patients operated on during the height of the pandemic were less likely to receive immediate reconstruction and regional nerve blocks during surgery. These features configure a situation of reduced level of care for patients with breast cancer. Efforts should be taken by the healthcare systems to maintain standard of care, even in case of a new peak in the coronavirus outbreak.","Fancellu, Alessandro; Sanna, Valeria; Rubino, Corrado; Ariu, Maria Laura; Piredda, Claudia; Piana, Gian Quirico; Cottu, Pietrina; Spanu, Angela; Cossu, Antonio; Deiana, Giulia; Porcu, Alberto",,,435

The lipid indices were calculated using these values and apolipoprotein B, and C-II were evaluated. The blood flow rate was also measured in the retina of the eyes using a laser doppler flowmetry. The heparin-lipoprotein lipase (HP-LPL) was also estimated using standard procedures. Genotyping of S447X was also done. Findings showed that LDL, HDL and Casteli II lipogenic index were elevated with the duration of administration of DHA and EPA while TG, total cholesterol (TC), and other lipogenic markers: Casteli I, Apo CII and Atherogenic indices were lowered with repeat visits and continued use of DHA and EPA combined with exercise and diet plan. The HP-LPL activity was also increased with each subsequent visit and study. In conclusion, the regimen significantly improved blood flow rate, lipid profile and lowered the risk for cardiovascular events in the selected study subjects. Continued studies are recommended to further demonstrate the longer-term effects of the treatment regimen in reducing the atherosclerotic plagues and cardiovascular outcomes of subjects.","Graham, Adenike Naye Amr Akinbobye Ola Sepper Otar Karim Anam Tulp Orien Einstein George",The FASEB Journal,,435
392693,Complementary and alternative therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder: A protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis,2020,"PURPOSE: A case of uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management in a pediatric patient with a ventricular assist device awaiting a heart transplant is reported. SUMMARY: A 4-month-old male in heart failure was experiencing uncontrolled hypertension. Because of a lack of hemodynamic stability, he was unable to be listed as a heart transplant candidate. He received multiple antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, ß-blockers, and direct-acting vasodilators) as both intermittent and continuous infusions over the course of several days without achieving normotension. The decision was then made to administer intravenous phentolamine as a continuous infusion to pursue a different mechanism than with traditional antihypertensive agents to achieve hemodynamic stability. Within 8 hours of initiation of the continuous phentolamine infusion, the patient became normotensive and was listed for a heart transplant. The continuous phentolamine infusion was administered over the next 4 days to maintain normotension, and on day 4 the patient underwent successful orthotopic heart transplantation. CONCLUSION: A 4-month-old male in heart failure with a ventricular assist device, experiencing uncontrolled hypertension nonresponsive to traditional pharmacologic management, was successfully treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of phentolamine.","Hatt, Andrew",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,435

394123,Looking after each other in a crisis-Lessons from Novichok and the parallels with Covid-19,2021,"PROBLEM: On March 17, 2020, the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended the suspension of all direct patient contact responsibilities for medical students because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given this change, medical students nationwide had to grapple with how and where they could fill the evolving needs of their schools' affiliated clinical sites, physicians, and patients and the community. APPROACH: At Harvard Medical School (HMS), student leaders created a COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team to: (1) develop a student-led organizational structure that would optimize students' ability to efficiently mobilize interested peers in the COVID-19 response, both clinically and in the community, in a strategic, safe, smart, and resource-conscious way; and (2) serve as a liaison with the administration and hospital leaders to identify evolving needs and rapidly engage students in those efforts. OUTCOMES: Within a week of its inception, the COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team had more than 500 medical student volunteers from HMS and had shared the organizational framework of the response team with multiple medical schools across the country. The HMS student volunteers joined any of the 4 virtual committees to complete this work: Education for the Medical Community, Education for the Broader Community, Activism for Clinical Support, and Community Activism. NEXT STEPS: The COVID-19 Medical Student Response Team helped to quickly mobilize hundreds of students and has been integrated into HMS's daily workflow. It may serve as a useful model for other schools and hospitals seeking medical student assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps include expanding the initiative further, working with the leaders of response teams at other medical schools to coordinate efforts, and identifying new areas of need at local hospitals and within nearby communities that might benefit from medical student involvement as the pandemic evolves.","Soled, Derek; Goel, Shivangi; Barry, Danika; Erfani, Parsa; Joseph, Nicholos; Kochis, Michael; Uppal, Nishant; Velasquez, David; Vora, Kruti; Scott, Kirstin Woody",Acad. med,,435

However, the sudden shift to remote and online learning, as a result of social isolation during COVID-19, has created a social disconnect, making these immediate regulatory supports less accessible. A need was identified for strategies to support collaborative learning regulation when learning remotely and online. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on models of self-, co, and socially shared learning regulation, a series of resources were developed for students, teachers and parents to support effective online collaborative learning. These strategies embedded evidence-based principles of learning drawn from the learning sciences, including elaboration, retrieval, dual coding and concrete examples. Findings: A set of ten student resources have been developed, accompanied by supporting information and strategies for teachers and families. These resources have been shared with schools across Australia. Originality/value: These evidence-based strategies are valuable, as they are addressing an identified urgent community need. Based on the science of learning, these strategies are original in synthesising effective learning techniques with the three forms of learning regulation to encourage student connection and collaboration in online and remote learning.","MacMahon, Stephanie; Leggett, Jack; Carroll, Annemaree",inform.Learn.Sci,,435

However, improper and unregulated disposals of these DPFs has been and will continue to intensify the plastic pollution problem we are already facing. This study focuses on the emission of pollutants from 7 DPF brands that were submerged in water to simulate environmental conditions if these DPFs were littered. The DPF leachates were filtered by inorganic membranes, and both particle-deposited organic membranes and the filtrates were characterized using techniques such as FTIR, SEM-EDX, Light Microscopy, ICP-MS and LC-MS. Micro and nano scale polymeric fibres, particles, siliceous fragments and leachable inorganic and organic chemicals were observed from all of the tested DPFs. Traces of concerning heavy metals (i.e. lead up to 6.79 µg/L) were detected in association with silicon containing fragments. ICP-MS also confirmed the presence of other leachable metals like cadmium (up to 1.92 µg/L), antimony (up to 393 µg/L) and copper (up to 4.17 µg/L). LC-MS analysis identified polar leachable organic species related to plastic additives and contaminants; polyamide-66 monomer and oligomers (nylon-66 synthesis), surfactant molecules, dye-like molecules and polyethylene glycol were all tentatively identified in the leachate. The toxicity of some of the chemicals found and the postulated risks of the rest of the present particles and molecules, raises the question of whether DPFs are safe to be used on a daily basis and what consequences are to be expected after their disposal into the environment.","Sullivan, G L; Delgado-Gallardo, J; Watson, T M; Sarp, S",Water Res,,435

METHODS: This cohort study was conducted at University Hospital, which is a designated hospital for COVID-19 patients. Adult patients who were admitted to our hospital emergency department with suspected COVID-19 and who were hospitalized in our institution with a COVID-19 diagnosis were analysed. RESULTS: There were 148 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. All-cause mortality of follow-up was 12.8%. There were statistically significant results between the two groups (survivors and nonsurvivors), which were classified based on hospital mortality rates, in terms of the lymphocyte to C-reactive protein ratio (LCRP), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), CRP concentration and comorbid disease. In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC), curve analysis, LCRP, NLR, PLR and SII area under the curve (AUC) for in-hospital mortality were 0.817, 0.816, 0.733 and 0.742, respectively. Based on an LCRP value of 1 for in-hospital mortality, the sensitivity and specificity rates were 100% and 86.8%, respectively. Based on the average SII of 2699 for in-hospital mortality, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rates were 68.4%, 77.5% and 76.3%, respectively. A total of 19 patients died during hospitalization. All of these patients had an LCRP level &#8804; 1; 14 had an NLR level &#8804; 10.8; 13 had an SII &#8805; 2699 (Fisher's exact test, P = .000). Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality rates were LCRP < 1, PLR, SII &#8805; 2699, white blood cell count, CRP, age, comorbidities, and ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that inflammatory parameters, such as LRCP, SII and NLR, were associated with disease severity and could be used as potentially important risk factors for COVID-19 progression.","Acar, Ethem; Demir, Ahmet; Yildirim, Birdal; Kaya, Mehmet Gökhan; Gökçek, Kemal",Int J Clin Pract,,435

398384,Elective Surgery during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Introduction: Like smoking, sedentary lifestyle is an issue of great concern because of its deleterious health challenges and implications. Given the global spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19), social isolation regulations and laws have been implemented in many countries to contain the spread of the virus and this has caused a drastic shift from the usual physically demanding life to a sedentary lifestyle characterized by significantly reduced physical activities and prolong sitting. Methods/Data Source: Human and nonhuman primate literature was examined to compare experimental and clinical modulation of inflammatory cytokines by exercised-induced myokines. Data synthesis: Experimental and clinical evidence was used to examine whether exercised-induced myokines can prime the immune system of the elderly population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: The immune system changes with advancement in age which increases the likelihood of infectious disease morbidity and mortality in older adults. Several epidemiological studies have also shown that physical inactivity among geriatric population impacts negatively on the immune system. Evidences on the importance of exercise in priming the immune system of elderly individuals could be an effective therapeutic strategy in combating the virus as it may well be a case of “let those with the best immune system win”. © 2021 Tokunbo O et al.","Tokunbo, O.; Abayomi, T.; Adekomi, D.; Oyeyipo, I.",African Health Sciences,,435

In this study, we applied a rule-based phenotyping algorithm to classify COVID-19 patients requiring ventilatory support. We analyzed patient outcomes of the different phenotypes based on type and sequence of ventilation therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and high flow nasal insufflation were three therapies used to phenotype patients leading to a total of seven subgroups; patients treated with a single therapy (3), patients treated with either form of noninvasive ventilation and subsequently requiring intubation (2), and patients initially intubated and then weaned onto a noninvasive therapy (2). In addition to summary statistics for each phenotype, we highlight data quality challenges and importance of mapping to standard terminologies. This work illustrates potential impact of accurate phenotyping on patient-level and system-level outcomes including appropriate resource allocation under resource constrained circumstances.","Essay, Patrick; Mosier, Jarrod; Subbian, Vignesh",Stud Health Technol Inform,,435

Method The Hearing Education and Research (HEAR) presentation, which included activities and videos to educate a group of ethnically diverse adolescents (n = 100) on NIHL, was created by 11 doctor of audiology (AuD) students through online collaborations toward course-related eSL requirements. Adolescents responded to a baseline survey to assess hearing health-related behaviors prior to reviewing the presentation. A postprogram survey was administered 1 week after the presentation to assess change in knowledge and attitudes toward NIHL prevention. Online collaborations with schoolteachers helped with project implementation. Postreflection papers written by AuD students regarding the eSL activities were analyzed. Lastly, suggestions from a focus group of educators were included that highlight the role of interprofessional collaborations to enhance school-based hearing conservation opportunities. Results The HEAR presentation resulted in changes in knowledge about NIHL among the adolescents. Postreflection papers by the AuD students indicated that the eSL activity served as a high-impact pedagogical assignment, especially during the academic challenges of the pandemic. Feedback from a focus group of schoolteachers helped outline ideas for future implementation of sustainable hearing conservation programs in school settings. Conclusion The pilot data collected in this study serve as a proof of concept for future hearing conservation projects in school-based settings via interprofessional collaborations and by engaging university students via eSL.","Deshpande, Shruti Balvalli",Am J Audiol,,435

We quantified core domains using the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory scale and provided important context through open-ended qualitative questions assessing: 1) COVID-19 infection history and experiences with quarantine; 2) Health and healthcare access; 3) Employment and economic impact of COVID-19. Participants reported increases in physical conflict or verbal arguments with a partner (13.5%) or other adult(s) (19.2%) due to stressors associated with the safer-at-home order. Participants also reported increased alcohol consumption (23.1%), problems with sleep (67.3%) and mental health (78.4%). Further, disruptions in access to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis or PrEP-a daily pill to prevent HIV-occurred (33.3% of 18 participants who reported being on PrEP). Many said they received less medical attention than usual (34.6%), and LTGW reported delays in critical gender-affirming hormones/procedures. Half of the participants lost their jobs (50.0%); many undocumented participants relayed additional financial concerns because they did not qualify for financial assistance. Though no COVID-19 infections were noted, COVID-19 dramatically impacted other aspects of health and overall wellbeing of LSMM and LTGW. Public health responses should address the stressors faced by LSMM and LTGW during the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on wellbeing.","MacCarthy, Sarah; Izenberg, Max; Barreras, Joanna L; Brooks, Ron A; Gonzalez, Ana; Linnemayr, Sebastian",PLoS One,,435

399958,"How to make Mandela smile: being methodical, motivated and meaningful",2021,"Despite over 140 million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide since the beginning of the pandemic, relatively few confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been reported. While immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection is probable, at least in the short term, few studies have quantified the reinfection risk. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to synthesise the evidence on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time. A standardised protocol was employed, based on Cochrane methodology. Electronic databases and preprint servers were searched from 1 January 2020 to 19 February 2021. Eleven large cohort studies were identified that estimated the risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over time, including three that enrolled healthcare workers and two that enrolled residents and staff of elderly care homes. Across studies, the total number of PCR-positive or antibody-positive participants at baseline was 615,777, and the maximum duration of follow-up was more than 10 months in three studies. Reinfection was an uncommon event (absolute rate 0%-1.1%), with no study reporting an increase in the risk of reinfection over time. Only one study estimated the population-level risk of reinfection based on whole genome sequencing in a subset of patients; the estimated risk was low (0.1% [95% CI: 0.08-0.11%]) with no evidence of waning immunity for up to 7 months following primary infection. These data suggest that naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity does not wane for at least 10 months post-infection. However, the applicability of these studies to new variants or to vaccine-induced immunity remains uncertain.","O Murchu, Eamon; Byrne, Paula; Carty, Paul G; De Gascun, Cillian; Keogan, Mary; O039,; Neill, Michelle; Harrington, Patricia; Ryan, Máirín",Rev Med Virol,,435

401258,"Health-related quality of life issues, including symptoms, in patients with active COVID-19 or post COVID-19; a systematic literature review",2021,"BACKGROUND: Human movement is among the essential forces that drive spatial spread of infectious diseases. To date, reducing and tracking human movement during the pandemic have proven effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19. Existing methods for monitoring and modeling the spatial spread of infectious diseases rely on various data sources as proxies of human movement, such as airline travel data, mobile phone data, and dollar bills tracking. However, intrinsic limitations of these data sources prevent us from systematic monitoring and analyses of human movement from different spatial scales (from local to global). OBJECTIVE: Big social media data such as geotagged tweets have been widely used in human mobility studies, yet more research is needed to validate the capabilities and limitations of using such data for studying human movement at different geographic scales (e.g., from local to global) in the context of global infectious disease transmission. This study aims to develop a novel data-driven public health approach using big Twitter data coupled with other human mobility data sources and AI to monitor and analyze human movement at different spatial scales (from global to regional to local) for enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. METHODS: This research will first develop a database with optimized spatiotemporal indexing to store and manage the multi-source datasets collected in this project. This database will be connected to our in-house Hadoop computing cluster for efficient big data computing and analytics. This research will then develop innovative data models, predictive models, and computing algorithms, to effectively extract and analyze human movement patterns from big geotagged Twitter data and other human mobility data sources for enhancing situational awareness and risk prediction in public health emergency response and disease surveillance systems. RESULTS: This project was funded as of May 2020. We have started the data collection, processing, and analysis for the project. CONCLUSIONS: Research findings can help government officials, public health managers and emergency responders, and researchers to answer critical questions during the pandemic regarding the current and future infectious risk of a state, county, or community and the effectiveness of the social/physical distancing practice in curtaining the spread of the virus.

In the context of the CANNA-TICS trial, investigating the effect of nabiximols on reducing the total tic score of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS-TTS) in patients with chronic tic disorders and Tourette syndrome, the impact of the two COVID-19 related intercurrent events handled by a treatment policy strategy is investigated using a multiplicative and additive data generating model. The empirical power is examined for the analysis of the YGTSS-TTS as a continuous and dichotomized endpoint using analysis techniques adjusted and unadjusted for the occurrence of the intercurrent event. In the investigated scenarios, the simulation studies showed that substantial power losses are possible, potentially making sample size increases necessary to retain sufficient power. However, we were also able to identify scenarios with only limited loss of power. By adjusting for the occurrence of the intercurrent event, the power loss could be diminished to different degrees in most scenarios. In summary, the presented risk assessment approach may support decisions on trial modifications like sample size increases, while maintaining trial integrity.","Lasch, Florian; Guizzaro, Lorenzo; Aguirre Dávila, Lukas; Müller-Vahl, Kirsten; Koch, Armin",,,435
402886,Post-COVID-19 fatigue and anhedonia: A cross-sectional study and their correlation to post-recovery period,2020,"Many countries are taking strict quarantine policies to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) around the world, such as city lockdown. Cities in China and Italy were locked down in the early stage of the pandemic. The present study aims to examine and compare the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on individuals' psychological states in China and Italy. We achieved the aim by (1) sampling Weibo users (geo-location = Wuhan, China) and Twitter users (geo-location = Lombardy, Italy); (2) fetching all the users' published posts two weeks before and after the lockdown in each region (e.g., the lockdown date of Wuhan was 23 January 2020); (3) extracting the psycholinguistic features of these posts using the Simplified Chinese and Italian version of Language Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary; and (4) conducting Wilcoxon tests to examine the changes in the psycholinguistic characteristics of the posts before and after the lockdown in Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively. Results showed that individuals focused more on ""home"", and expressed a higher level of cognitive process after a lockdown in both Wuhan and Lombardy. Meanwhile, the level of stress decreased, and the attention to leisure increased in Lombardy after the lockdown. The attention to group, religion, and emotions became more prevalent in Wuhan after the lockdown. Findings provide decision-makers timely evidence on public reactions and the impacts on psychological states in the COVID-19 context, and have implications for evidence-based mental health interventions in two countries.","Su, Yue; Xue, Jia; Liu, Xiaoqian; Wu, Peijing; Chen, Junxiang; Chen, Chen; Liu, Tianli; Gong, Weigang; Zhu, Tingshao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,435
402928,Predictors for development of critical illness amongst older adults with COVID-19: Beyond age to age-associated factors,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an RNA virus-based disease that can be deadly. For critically ill patients, mechanical ventilation is an important life-saving treatment. However, mechanical ventilation shows a trade-off between supporting respiratory function and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Surfactant therapy is a medical administration of exogenous surfactant to supplement or replace deficient or dysfunctional endogenous surfactant. Surfactant therapy can be used to postpone or shorten the use of mechanical ventilation to minimize or avoid VILI, because surfactants can reduce surface tension, improve lung compliance, and enhance oxygenation. In addition, nanotechnology can be applied to improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the adverse effects of surfactants. In this perspective, we discussed how nanoparticles deliver surfactants through intravenous injection and inhalation to the expected lung disease regions where surfactants are mostly needed, and discussed the prospects of nanoparticle-mediated surfactant therapy in the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.","Wu, You; Li, Xiaosi; Gan, Yu; Zhao, Chao",,,435

Apart from the numerous chemicals, surgical smoke had been shown to harbour intact bacterial and virus particles especially COVID-19 in the current time. Objective: To identify the inhalational, infectious, chemical, and mutagenic risks of surgical smoke and suggest evidence-based hazard reduction strategies. Also to cogitate on the very high risk of viral spread spread by the use of surgical diathermy in COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: A review of articles indexed for MEDLINE on PubMed using the keywords surgical smoke, diathermy, electrocautery, surgical smoke hazards, smoke evacuator, and guidelines for surgical smoke safety was performed. The review included evidences from 50 articles from the dermatology, surgery, infectious disease, obstetrics, and cancer biology literature. Results: There are risks associated with surgical smoke. Although some surgeons were aware, majority were not keen in the hazard reduction strategies. Conclusion: Many chemical and biological particles have been found in surgical smoke. It is highly recommended to follow the standardised guidelines for surgical smoke safety. Surgical smoke carries full virus particle(such as COVID-19 virus), it is strongly recommended to minimise or avoid electrocautery during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Karuppal, Raju; Surendran, Sibin; Patinharayil, Gopinathan; Muhammed Fazil, V V; Marthya, Anwar",,,435

407757,Second-to-fourth digit ratio and facial shape in Buryats of Southern Siberia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports suggest fewer patients with stroke symptoms are presenting to hospitals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We quantify trends in stroke code calls and treatments at 3 Connecticut hospitals during the local emergence of COVID-19 and examine patient characteristics and stroke process measures at a Comprehensive Stroke Center (CSC) before and during the pandemic. METHODS: Stroke code activity was analyzed from January 1 to April 28, 2020, and corresponding dates in 2019. Piecewise linear regression and spline models identified when stroke codes in 2020 began to decline and when they fell below 2019 levels. Patient-level data were analyzed in February versus March and April 2020 at the CSC to identify differences in patient characteristics during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 822 stroke codes were activated at 3 hospitals from January 1 to April 28, 2020. The number of stroke codes/wk decreased by 12.8/wk from February 18 to March 16 (P=0.0360) with nadir of 39.6% of expected stroke codes called from March 10 to 16 (30% decrease in total stroke codes during the pandemic weeks in 2020 versus 2019). There was no commensurate increase in within-network telestroke utilization. Compared with before the pandemic (n=167), pandemic-epoch stroke code patients at the CSC (n=211) were more likely to have histories of hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and substance abuse; no or public health insurance; lower median household income; and to live in the CSC city (P<0.05). There was no difference in age, sex, race/ethnicity, stroke severity, time to presentation, door-to-needle/door-to-reperfusion times, or discharge modified Rankin Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital presentation for stroke-like symptoms decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, without differences in stroke severity or early outcomes. Individuals living outside of the CSC city were less likely to present for stroke codes at the CSC during the pandemic. Public health initiatives to increase awareness of presenting for non-COVID-19 medical emergencies such as stroke during the pandemic are critical.","Jasne, Adam S; Chojecka, Pola; Maran, Ilavarasy; Mageid, Razaz; Eldokmak, Mohamed; Zhang, Qiang; Nystrom, Karin; Vlieks, Kelsey; Askenase, Michael; Petersen, Nils; Falcone, Guido J; Wira, Charles R; Lleva, Paul; Zeevi, Neer; Narula, Reshma; Amin, Hardik; Navaratnam, Dhasakumar; Loomis, Caitlin; Hwang, David Y; Schindler, Joseph; Hebert, Ryan; Matouk, Charles; Krumholz, Harlan M; Spudich, Serena; Sheth, Kevin N; Sansing, Lauren H; Sharma, Richa",Stroke,,435

Study DesignLongitudinal observational cohort study using individual-level linked data. SettingCare home residents in Wales (United Kingdom) between 1st September 2020 and 1st May 2021. Participants14,786 older care home residents (aged 65+). Our dataset consisted of 2,613,341 individual-level daily observations within 697 care homes. MethodsWe estimated odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) using multilevel logistic regression models. Our outcome of interest was a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We included time dependent covariates for the estimated community positive test rate of COVID-19, hospital admissions, and vaccination status. Additional covariates were included for age, positive PCR tests prior to the study, sex, frailty (using the hospital frailty risk score), and specialist care home services. ResultsThe multivariable logistic regression model indicated an increase in age (OR 1.01 [1.00,1.01] per year of age), community positive test rate (OR 1.13 [1.12,1.13] per percent increase in positive test rate), hospital inpatients (OR 7.40 [6.54,8.36]), and residents in care homes with non-specialist dementia care (OR 1.42 [1.01,1.99]) had an increased odds of a positive test.

409059,The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns: a review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments,2021,"BACKGROUND: Italy was the first country to largely experience the COVID-19 epidemic among other Western countries during the so-called first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Proper management of an increasing number of home-quarantined individuals created a significant challenge for health care authorities and professionals. This was especially true when considering the importance of remote surveillance to detect signs of disease progression and consequently regulate access to hospitals and intensive care units on a priority basis. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we report on an initiative promoted to cope with the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Spring/Summer of 2020, in the Autonomous Province of Trento, Italy. A purposefully built app named TreCovid19 was designed to provide dedicated health care staff with a ready-to-use tool for remotely monitoring patients with progressive symptoms of COVID-19, who were home-quarantined during the first wave of the epidemic, and to focus on those patients who, based on their self-reported clinical data, required a quick response from health care professionals. METHODS: TreCovid19 was rapidly developed to facilitate the monitoring of a selected number of home-quarantined patients with COVID-19 during the very first epidemic wave. The app was built on top of an existing eHealth platform, already in use by the local health authority to provide home care, with the following functionalities: (1) to securely collect and link demographic and clinical information related to the patients and (2) to provide a two-way communication between a multidisciplinary health care team and home-quarantined patients. The system supported patients to self-assess their condition and update the multidisciplinary team on their health status. The system was used between March and June 2020 in the province of Trento. RESULTS: A dedicated multidisciplinary group of health care professionals adopted the platform over a period of approximately 3 months (from March-end to June 2020) to monitor a total of 170 patients with confirmed COVID-19 during home quarantine. All patients used the system until the end of the initiative. The TreCovid19 system has provided useful insights of possible viability and impact of a technological-organizational asset to manage a potentially critical workload for the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of a relevant number of quarantined patients, notwithstanding its limitations given the rapid implementation of the whole initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The technological and organizational model adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed and finalized in a relatively short period during the initial few weeks of the epidemic. The system successfully supported the health care staff involved in the periodic monitoring of an increasing number of home-quarantined patients and provided valuable data in terms of disease surveillance.","Gios, Lorenzo; Crema Falceri, Giulia; Micocci, Stefano; Patil, Luigi; Testa, Sara; Sforzin, Simona; Turra, Ettore; Conforti, Diego; Malfatti, Giulia; Moz, Monica; Nicolini, Andrea; Guarda, Paolo; Bacchiega, Alessandro; Mion, Carlo; Marchesoni, Michele; Maimone, Rosa; Molini, Pietro Benedetto; Zanella, Alberto; Osmani, Venet; Mayora-Ibarra, Oscar; Forti, Stefano",JMIR Form Res,,435

Generalized curves of lung opacity volume and density over time can be used as standardized references from well before symptoms develop to over a month after recovery, when residual lung opacities remain. 739 patients with COVID-19 underwent CT and RT-PCR in an outbreak setting between January 21st and April 12th, 2020. 29 of 739 patients had serial exams (121 CTs and 279 laboratory measurements) over 50 ± 16 days, with an average of 4.2 sequential CTs each. Sequential volumes of total lung, overall opacity and opacity subtypes (ground glass opacity [GGO] and consolidation) were extracted using deep learning and manual segmentation. Generalized temporal curves of CT and laboratory measurements were correlated. Lung opacities appeared 3.4 ± 2.2 days prior to symptom onset. Opacity peaked 1 day after symptom onset. GGO onset was earlier and resolved later than consolidation. Lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein peaked earlier than procalcitonin and leukopenia. The temporal relationships of quantitative CT features and clinical labs have distinctive patterns and peaks in relation to symptom onset, which may inform early clinical course in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia, or may shed light upon chronic lung effects or mechanisms of medical countermeasures in clinical trials.","Kassin, Michael T; Varble, Nicole; Blain, Maxime; Xu, Sheng; Turkbey, Evrim B; Harmon, Stephanie; Yang, Dong; Xu, Ziyue; Roth, Holger; Xu, Daguang; Flores, Mona; Amalou, Amel; Sun, Kaiyun; Kadri, Sameer; Patella, Francesca; Cariati, Maurizio; Scarabelli, Alice; Stellato, Elvira; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; An, Peng; Turkbey, Baris; Wood, Bradford J",Sci Rep,,435
409625,Call of interprofessional duty: an ethnographically informed discussion on preparing students to be digitally resilient,2020,"AIMS: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, organisations have produced management guidance for cancer patients and the delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy, but none has offered estimates of risk or the potential impact across populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined data from four countries to produce pooled age-banded case fatality rates, calculated the sex difference in survival and used data from four recent studies to convert case fatality rates into age/sex-stratified infection fatality rates (IFRs). We estimated the additional risk of death in cancer patients and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and analyse the risk-benefit in some clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We obtained data based on 412 985 cases and 41 854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. IFRs for patients with cancer ranged from 0 to 29% and were higher in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.01-46%). The risk was significantly higher with age and in men compared with women. 37.5% of patients with a new diagnosis of cancer in 2018 had an IFR &#8805;5%. Survival benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy ranged from 5 to 10% in some common cancers, compared with the increased risk of death from COVID-19 of 0-3%. CONCLUSIONS: Older male patients are at a higher risk of death with COVID-19. Patients with cancer are also at a higher risk, as are those who have recently received chemotherapy. We provide well-founded estimates to allow patients and clinicians to better balance these risks and illustrate the wider impact in a national incident cohort.","Williams, M; Mi, E; Le Calvez, K; Chen, J; Pakzad-Shahabi, L; Dadhania, S; Wang, J; Ho, A; Rabinowicz, S",Clin. oncol,,435

During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may delay emergency care due to stay-at-home orders and concern of COVID-19 exposure. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether emergency presentation for testicular torsion was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether the rate of orchiectomy increased compared to a retrospective period. STUDY DESIGN: Patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study from seven institutions in the United States and Canada. Inclusion criteria were patients two months to 18 years of age with acute testicular torsion from March through July 2020. The retrospective group included patients from January 2019 through February 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis tests, Chi-square tests, and logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients were included: 84 patients in the COVID-19 cohort and 137 in the retrospective cohort. Median times from symptom onset to emergency department presentation during COVID-19 compared to the retrospective period were 17.9 h (IQR 5.5-48.0) and 7.5 h (IQR 4.0-28.0) respectively (p = 0.04). In the COVID-19 cohort, 42% of patients underwent orchiectomy compared to 29% of pre-pandemic controls (p = 0.06). During COVID-19, 46% of patients endorsed delay in presentation compared to 33% in the retrospective group (p = 0.04). DISCUSSION: We found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a higher proportion of patients reported delaying care. Strengths of the study include the number of included patients and the multicenter prospective design during the pandemic. Limitations include a retrospective pre-pandemic comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: In a large multicenter study we found a significantly longer time from testicular torsion symptom onset to presentation during the pandemic and a significantly higher proportion of patients reported delaying care.

However, the dominant environmental drivers or factors influencing N2 fixation and the functional significance of the diazotroph community structure in paddy soil across a climatic gradient are not yet well understood. Thus, we characterized the diazotroph community and identified the ecological predictors of N2 fixation potential in four different climate zones (mid-temperate, warm-temperate, subtropical, and tropical paddy soils) in eastern China. Comprehensive nifH gene sequencing, functional activity detection, and correlation analysis with environmental factors were estimated. The potential nitrogenase activity (PNA) was highest in warm-temperate regions, where it was 6.2-, 2.9-, and 2.2-fold greater than in the tropical, subtropical, and mid-temperate regions, respectively; nifH gene abundance was significantly higher in warm-temperate and subtropical zones than in the tropical or mid-temperate zones. Diazotroph diversity was significantly higher in the tropical climate zone and significantly lower in the mid-temperate zone. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and canonical correlation analysis indicated that paddy soil diazotroph populations differed significantly among the four climate zones, mainly owing to differences in climate and soil pH. Structural equation models and automatic linear models revealed that climate and nutrients indirectly affected PNA by affecting soil pH and diazotroph community, respectively, while diazotroph community, C/P, and nifH gene abundance directly affected PNA. And C/P ratio, pH, and the diazotroph community structure were the main predictors of PNA in paddy soils. Collectively, the differences in diazotroph community structure have ecological significance, with important implications for the prediction of soil N2-fixing functions under climate change scenarios.","Wu, Chuanfa; Wei, Xiaomeng; Hu, Ziye; Liu, Yi; Hu, Yajun; Qin, Hongling; Chen, Xiangbi; Wu, Jinshui; Ge, Tida; Zhran, Mostafa; Su, Yirong",,,435

Such reports have yet to be empirically validated. Here we combined data from multi-catch rodent stations (providing data on rodent captures), rodent bait stations (providing data on rodent activity) and residents' complaints to explore the effects of a six week lockdown period on rodent populations within the City of Sydney, Australia. The sampling interval encompassed October 2019 to July 2020 with lockdown defined as the interval from April 1st to May 15th, 2020. Rodent captures and activity (visits to bait stations) were stable prior to lockdown. Captures showed a rapid increase and then decline during the lockdown, while rodent visits to bait stations declined throughout this period. There were no changes in the frequency of complaints during lockdown relative to before and after lockdown. There was a non-directional change in the geographical distribution of indices of rodent abundance suggesting that rodents redistributed in response to resource scarcity. We hypothesize that lockdown measures initially resulted in increased rodent captures due to sudden shortage of human-derived food resources. Rodent visits to bait stations might not show this pattern due to the nature of the binary data collected, namely the presence or absence of a visit. Relocation of bait stations driven by pest management goals may also have affected the detection of any directional spatial effect. We conclude that the onset of COVID-19 may have disrupted commensal rodent populations, with possible implications for the future management of these ubiquitous urban indicator species.","Bedoya-Pérez, Miguel A; Ward, Michael P; Loomes, Max; McGregor, Iain S; Crowther, Mathew S",Sci Rep,,435

They can prolong QT interval, cause torsade de pointes, and lead to sudden cardiac death. We aimed to assess QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study. One hundred seventy-two confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in this study, hospitalized at Babol University of Medical Sciences hospitals between March 5, 2020, and April 3, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Electrocardiograms were used for outcome assessment. Results: 83.1% of patients received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin vs. 16.9% of patients who received only hydroxychloroquine. The mean age of patients was 59.2 ± 15.4.The mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the monotherapy group was shorter than the mean of posttreatment QTc interval in the combination therapy group, but it had no significant statistical difference (462.5 ± 43.1 milliseconds vs. 464.3 ± 59.1 milliseconds; p = 0.488). Generally, 22.1% of patients had a prolonged QTc interval after treatment. Male gender, or baseline QTc &#8805; 450 milliseconds, or high-risk Tisdale score increased the likelihood of prolonged QTc interval. Due to QTc prolongation, fourteen patients did not continue therapy after four days. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients treated by hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin had no significant difference in prolongation of QT interval and outcome. The numbers of patients with prolonged QT intervals in this study emphasize careful cardiac monitoring during therapy, especially in high-risk patients.","Eftekhar, Seyed Parsa; Kazemi, Sohrab; Barary, Mohammad; Javanian, Mostafa; Ebrahimpour, Soheil; Ziaei, Naghmeh",Cardiovasc Ther,,435

With limited therapeutic options, proning nonintubated patients emerged as a safe and affordable intervention to manage hypoxemia. METHODS: A proning protocol to identify and prone eligible patients was implemented. Patients were encouraged to self-prone for 2-3 hours, 3 times daily. Investigators created educational materials for nurses and patients and developed a COVID-19-specific proning order within the electronic health record (EHR). Investigators completed an 800-person retrospective chart review to study the implementation of this protocol. RESULTS: From March 22, 2020, to June 5, 2020, 586 patients were admitted to the COVID-19 floor. Of these patients, 42.8% were eligible for proning. Common contraindications were lack of hypoxia, altered mental status, and fall risk. The proning protocol led to a significant improvement in provider awareness of patients appropriate for proning, increasing from 12% to 83%, as measured by placement of a proning order into the EHR. There was a significant improvement in all appropriate patients documented as proned, increasing from 18% to 45% of eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of an effective hospital-wide proning protocol to address the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible and may be accomplished in a short period of time.","D039,; Souza, Felicia R; Murray, John P; Tummala, Sandeep; Puello, Frances; Pavkovich, David S; Ash, Daniel; Kelly, Stephanie B H; Tyker, Albina; Anderson, Daniela; Francisco, Mary A; Pierce, Nicole L; Cerasale, Matthew T",J Healthc Qual,,435

Although some of the treatments are promising, it is thought to be early to clearly state that there is definitive treatment. Experiences and treatment protocols studies coming from the centers are still very important. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors affecting the treatment process in the first cases followed in our clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this retrospective and cross-sectional study. Datas were recorded from the electronic and written files of patients. RESULTS: Eighty three patients were evaluated. The median age was 50±15 years. Fourty eight (57.8%) patients had one or more comorbidities. The most common comorbidity was hypertension. The most common symptom was cough in 58 patients (70%). The overall mortality was 15% and 85% of the patients were discharged. The time between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization was statistically significantly longer in deceased patients (p=0,039). Age, D-Dimer, troponin, creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, ferritin, procalcitonin, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio were statistically significantly higher in deceased patients than survivor patients. Performed subgroup analysis, in the patients receiving azithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine and other antibiotics plus hydroxychloroquine, the duration of hospitalization was shorter in azithromycin group (p=0,027). CONCLUSION: Early treatment and early admission to the hospital can be crucial for the better treatment process. Combination therapy with azithromycin may be preferred in the first treatment choice because it can shorten the length of hospital stay.","TanriverdI, ElIf; ÇÖrtÜk, Mustafa; Yildirim, BInnaz Zeynep; UGur Chousein, Efsun Gonca; Turan, Demet; Çinarka, HalIt; ÖzgÜl, Mehmet AkIf; ÇetInkaya, ErdoGan",,,435

It is unclear whether corticosteroids could be a candidate for an early intervention strategy for patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from 28 corticosteroid-treated patients with non-severe but advanced COVID-19, in which short-course and low-dose corticosteroids were administered because of unremitting or worsening clinical conditions during hospitalization. To compare the effect of corticosteroids on viral clearance, 44 corticosteroid-untreated patients were included as controls. Results: At the time of admission, corticosteroid-treated patients (n = 28) had a more advanced baseline illness compared with corticosteroid-untreated patients (n = 44), as reflected by poorer blood laboratory parameters (lymphocytes, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase) and more extensive chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. Corticosteroids were given because of radiological evidence of pneumonia progression (26/28) and/or unremitting fever (22/28) after admission. The median time from illness onset to corticosteroid treatment was 9 days (IQR, 7–10). The median duration and accumulated dose of corticosteroid treatment were 4.5 days [interquartile range (IQR), 3–5] and 140 mg of methylprednisolone (IQR, 120–200). Intravenous immunoglobulin (20 g per day for 3–5 days) was co-administered with corticosteroids. With the corticosteroid treatment, all patients achieved an abatement of fever within 1 day, and 78.6% (22/28) of the patients achieved radiological remission when evaluated about 3 days later. Only one (3.6%) patient progressed to severe COVID-19, and all patients recovered and were discharged without any sequela. The median time from illness onset to viral clearance was similar, as compared with 44 corticosteroid-untreated patients with relatively milder disease [18 (IQR 14.3–23.5) days vs. 17 (IQR, 12–20) days, p = 0.252]. When adjusted for age, sex, underlying comorbidities, baseline blood laboratory parameters, viral load, and chest radiological findings, the causal hazard ratio of corticosteroid treatment for the viral clearance was 0.79 (95%CI, 0.48–1.30, p = 0.34). Conclusion: Short-course and low-dose applications of corticosteroids, when co-administered with intravenous immunoglobulin, in non-severe COVID-19 patients during the stage of clinical deterioration may possibly prevent disease progression, while having a negligible impact on the viral clearance.","Hu, Zhiliang; Lv, Yanling; Xu, Chuanjun; Sun, Wenkui; Chen, Wei; Peng, Zhihang; Chen, Chen; Cui, Xiang; Jiao, Damin; Cheng, Cong; Chi, Yun; Wei, Hongxia; Hu, Chunmei; Zeng, Yi; Zhang, Xia; Yi, Yongxiang",Front.

We sought to investigate the impact of mitigation measures during the spring wave of COVID-19 on the incidence of other laboratory-confirmed respiratory viruses in Hamilton, Ontario. Methods: All nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n=57,503) submitted for routine respiratory virus testing at a regional laboratory serving all acute-care hospitals in Hamilton between January 2010 and June 2020 were reviewed. Testing for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza I-III, adenovirus, and rhinovirus/enterovirus was done routinely using a laboratory-developed polymerase chain reaction multiplex respiratory viral panel. A Bayesian linear regression model was used to determine the trend of positivity rates of all influenza samples for the first 26 weeks of each year from 2010 to 2019. The mean positivity rate of Bayesian inference was compared with the weekly reported positivity rate of influenza samples in 2020. Results: The positivity rate of influenza in 2020 diminished sharply following the population-wide implementation of COVID-19 interventions. Weeks 12-26 reported 0% positivity for influenza, with the exception of 0.1% reported in week 13.

420971,Gender and Age Differences Reveal Risk Patterns in COVID-19 Outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: The WHO and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend various triage tools to assist decision-making for patients with suspected COVID-19. We aimed to compare the accuracy of triage tools for predicting severe illness in adults presenting to the ED with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: We undertook a mixed prospective and retrospective observational cohort study in 70 EDs across the UK. We collected data from people attending with suspected COVID-19 and used presenting data to determine the results of assessment with the WHO algorithm, National Early Warning Score version 2 (NEWS2), CURB-65, CRB-65, Pandemic Modified Early Warning Score (PMEWS) and the swine flu adult hospital pathway (SFAHP). We used 30-day outcome data (death or receipt of respiratory, cardiovascular or renal support) to determine prognostic accuracy for adverse outcome. RESULTS: We analysed data from 20 891 adults, of whom 4611 (22.1%) died or received organ support (primary outcome), with 2058 (9.9%) receiving organ support and 2553 (12.2%) dying without organ support (secondary outcomes). C-statistics for the primary outcome were: CURB-65 0.75; CRB-65 0.70; PMEWS 0.77; NEWS2 (score) 0.77; NEWS2 (rule) 0.69; SFAHP (6-point rule) 0.70; SFAHP (7-point rule) 0.68; WHO algorithm 0.61. All triage tools showed worse prediction for receipt of organ support and better prediction for death without organ support. At the recommended threshold, PMEWS and the WHO criteria showed good sensitivity (0.97 and 0.95, respectively) at the expense of specificity (0.30 and 0.27, respectively). The NEWS2 score showed similar sensitivity (0.96) and specificity (0.28) when a lower threshold than recommended was used. CONCLUSION: CURB-65, PMEWS and the NEWS2 score provide good but not excellent prediction for adverse outcome in suspected COVID-19, and predicted death without organ support better than receipt of organ support. PMEWS, the WHO criteria and NEWS2 (using a lower threshold than usually recommended) provide good sensitivity at the expense of specificity.

421500,Could we have prevented all this? A comparison of the British and South Korean primary dental care response to COVID-19,2020,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to many challenges throughout the world, one of which is the delivery of health care to patients while they remain home. Telemedicine, or the use of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical health care, has been utilized by health care providers for many years, but its widespread implementation did not occur until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, it has become the primary mechanism of care delivery for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While obstacles are present for hospitals and providers to establish these services, most barriers exist with patient access. Patients require advanced technical support, translator services, and other measures to become comfortable engaging in a telemedicine encounter. In addition, appropriate follow-up must be provided for chronic medical illnesses and malignancies, helping to prevent the evolution of these conditions during the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, we must ensure equity for all patients seeking to access health services, including those of lower socioeconomic status. Many of these patients rely on public hotspots or library computers for their internet connectivity, but this is likely not conducive to a clinical encounter. These barriers must be addressed to ensure health equity for all patients seeking care. Telemedicine can connect patients and providers during this time of crisis and hopefully will serve as a model for continued use after the pandemic has abated.","Kronenfeld, Joshua P; Penedo, Frank J",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),,435

This study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 infection on mortality in hospitalized patients known to have HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We undertook a retrospective analysis of all patients admitted with a pre-existing diagnosis of HF between 1 March and 6 May 2020 to our unit. We assessed the impact of concomitant COVID-19 infection on in-hospital mortality, incidence of acute kidney injury, and myocardial injury. One hundred and thirty-four HF patients were hospitalized, 40 (29.9%) with concomitant COVID-19 infection. Those with COVID-19 infection had a significantly increased in-hospital mortality {50.0% vs. 10.6%; relative risk [RR] 4.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42-9.12], P < 0.001} and were more likely to develop acute kidney injury [45% vs. 24.5%; RR 1.84 (95% CI 1.12-3.01), P = 0.02], have evidence of myocardial injury [57.5% vs. 31.9%; RR 1.81 (95% CI 1.21-2.68), P < 0.01], and be treated for a superadded bacterial infection [55% vs. 32.5%; RR 1.67 (95% CI 1.12-2.49), P = 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HF admitted to hospital with concomitant COVID-19 infection have a very poor prognosis.

425033,Comparison of Patient Satisfaction Between Virtual Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic and In-person Visits Pre-pandemic,2020,"The study analyzes whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects the incidence of arm, forearm, and hip fractures. Additionally, the change in the overall cost of those fractures treatment was estimated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of arm, forearm, and hip fractures and the cost of fracture management are decreased. INTRODUCTION: Purposes of the study were to analyze if COVID-19 pandemic influences the incidence of arm, forearm, and hip osteoporotic fractures and to estimate the changes in costs of their management. METHODS: Data on arm, forearm, and hip fracture incidence were collected for inhabitants aged over 50 years in the district of Tarnowskie Góry and the city of Piekary Slaskie, South Poland, in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic (77 days, from March 16th to May 31st 2020). These results were compared with the number of fractures noted in years 2015-2019 in the same period of the year. The ratio of analyzed fractures per 100,000 inhabitants was calculated. RESULTS: The recorded numbers of fractures of arm, forearm, and hip were 13, 43, and 29, respectively. The respective mean number for fractures reported in corresponding period in 2015-2019 years was 23.6, 52, and 33. The year fracture incidence calculated per 100,000 inhabitants decreased by 45.8%, 18.4%, and 13.4%, respectively. The estimated numbers of avoided fractures extrapolated for the whole country for arm, forearm, and hip were 1722, 1548, and 947, respectively. The total number of avoided fractures was 4217. The expected nationwide cost reduction for the arm, forearm, and hip fracture management was estimated at  568,260,  332,820, and  1,628,840, respectively. The total cost reduction was  2,529,920 over the period of observation. CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease of arm, forearm, and hip fracture incidence was observed which may result in decrease of total costs for Polish healthcare system.","Pluskiewicz, W; Wilk, R; Adamczyk, P; Hajzyk, M; Swoboda, M; Sladek, A; Koczy, B",Osteoporosis int,,435
425048,Perceptions of telehealth and cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: To assess the relationships among pulmonary vascular enlargement, computed tomography (CT) findings quantified with software, and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) CT images of 87 patients (50 males, 37 females; median age, 63 years) with COVID-19 confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. The maximum subsegmental vascular diameter was measured on CT. Total CT lung volume (CTLV total) and lesion extent (ratio of lesion volume to CTLV total) of ground-glass opacities, reticulation, and consolidation were measured using software. Maximum pulmonary vascular diameter and lesion extent were analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed on CT results to predict disease severity. We also assessed changes in these measures on follow-up scans in 16 patients. RESULTS: All 23 patients with severe and critical illness had vascular enlargement (> 4 mm). Pulmonary vascular enlargement (odds ratio 3.05, p = 0.018) and CT lesion extent (odds ratio 1.07, p = 0.002) were independent predictors of disease severity after adjustment for age and comorbidities. On follow-up CT, vascular diameter and CT lesion volume decreased (p = 0.001, p = 0.002; respectively), but CTLV total did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Subsegmental vascular enlargement is a notable finding to predict acute COVID-19 disease severity.","Aoki, Ryo; Iwasawa, Tae; Hagiwara, Eri; Komatsu, Shigeru; Utsunomiya, Daisuke; Ogura, Takashi",Jpn. j. radiol.

425740,Orthopaedic Surgical Selection and Inpatient Paradigms During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) results in a tremendous disease burden worldwide. Available research on active surveillance among hospitalized adult patients suffering from SARI in China is limited. This pilot study aimed to identify associated etiologies and describe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical profiles of hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years in Jinshan, Shanghai. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted at 1 sentinel hospital in Jinshan district, Shanghai, from April 2017 to March 2018. Hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected within 24 hours of admission and tested for multiple respiratory viruses (including 18 common viruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained from case report forms. RESULTS: In total, 397 SARI patients were enrolled; the median age was 68 years, and 194 (48.9%) patients were male. A total of 278 (70.0%) patients had at least one underlying chronic medical condition. The most frequent symptoms were cough (99.2%) and sputum production (88.4%). The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days. A total of 250 infection patients (63.0%) were positive for at least one pathogen, of whom 198 (49.9%) were positive for a single pathogen and 52 (13.1%) were positive for multiple pathogens. The pathogens identified most frequently were M. pneumoniae (23.9%, 95/397), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (11.6%, 46/397), influenza virus A/H3N2 (Flu A/H3N2) (11.1%, 44/397), human rhinovirus (HRhV) (8.1%, 32/397), influenza virus B/Yamagata (Flu B/Yamagata) (6.3%, 25/397), pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (Flu A/pH1N1) (4.0%, 16/397), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 (2.0%, 8/397), human coronavirus (HCoV) type NL63 (2.0%, 8/397), HCoV 229E (1.5%, 6/397), HCoV HKU1 (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 3 (1.5%, 6/397), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 4 (1.3%, 5/397), HCoV OC43 (1.0%, 4/397), influenza virus B/Victoria (Flu B/Victoria) (0.5%, 2/397), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type B (0.5%, 2/397), and human bocavirus (HBoV) (0.3%, 1/397). The seasonality of pathogen-confirmed SARI patients had a bimodal distribution, with the first peak in the summer and the second peak in the winter. Statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the rates of dyspnea, radiographically diagnosed pneumonia and the presence of at least one comorbidity in patients who were infected with only M. pneumoniae, AdV, HRhV, Flu A/H3N2, Flu A /pH1N1 or Flu B/Yamagata. The differences in the positivity rates of the above 6 pathogens among the different age groups were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: M. pneumoniae, AdV and Flu A/H3N2 were the main pathogens detected in hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old in Jinshan district, Shanghai. Our findings highlight the importance of sustained multipathogen surveillance among SARI patients in sentinel hospitals, which can provide useful information on SARI etiologies, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics.","Li, Jian; Song, Can-Lei; Wang, Tang; Ye, Yu-Long; Du, Jian-Ru; Li, Shu-Hua; Zhu, Jian-Min",PLoS One,,435

431049,New-generation antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and the risk of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A scoping review,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed public health policies and human and community behaviors through lockdowns and mandates. Governments are rapidly evolving policies to increase hospital capacity and supply personal protective equipment and other equipment to mitigate disease spread in affected regions. Current models that predict COVID-19 case counts and spread are complex by nature and offer limited explainability and generalizability. This has highlighted the need for accurate and robust outbreak prediction models that balance model parsimony and performance. OBJECTIVE: We sought to leverage readily accessible data sets extracted from multiple states to train and evaluate a parsimonious predictive model capable of identifying county-level risk of COVID-19 outbreaks on a day-to-day basis. METHODS: Our modeling approach leveraged the following data inputs: COVID-19 case counts per county per day and county populations. We developed an outbreak gold standard across California, Indiana, and Iowa. The model utilized a per capita running 7-day sum of the case counts per county per day and the mean cumulative case count to develop baseline values. The model was trained with data recorded between March 1 and August 31, 2020, and tested on data recorded between September 1 and October 31, 2020. RESULTS: The model reported sensitivities of 81%, 92%, and 90% for California, Indiana, and Iowa, respectively. The precision in each state was above 85% while specificity and accuracy scores were generally >95%. CONCLUSIONS: Our parsimonious model provides a generalizable and simple alternative approach to outbreak prediction. This methodology can be applied to diverse regions to help state officials and hospitals with resource allocation and to guide risk management, community education, and mitigation strategies.","Gupta, Agrayan K; Grannis, Shaun J; Kasthurirathne, Suranga N",J Med Internet Res,,435

432689,Contact Dermatitis from Hand Hygiene Practices in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"We introduce FELICIA (FEderated LearnIng with a CentralIzed Adversary) a generative mechanism enabling collaborative learning. In particular, we show how a data owner with limited and biased data could benefit from other data owners while keeping data from all the sources private. This is a common scenario in medical image analysis where privacy legislation prevents data from being shared outside local premises. FELICIA works for a large family of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures including vanilla and conditional GANs as demonstrated in this work. We show that by using the FELICIA mechanism, a data owner with limited image samples can generate high-quality synthetic images with high utility while neither data owners has to provide access to its data. The sharing happens solely through a central discriminator that has access limited to synthetic data. Here, utility is defined as classification performance on a real test set. We demonstrate these benefits on several realistic healthcare scenarions using benchmark image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10) as well as on medical images for the task of skin lesion classification. With multiple experiments, we show that even in the worst cases, combining FELICIA with real data gracefully achieves performance on par with real data while most results significantly improves the utility.","Rajotte, Jean-Francois; Mukherjee, Sumit; Robinson, Caleb; Ortiz, Anthony; West, Christopher; Ferres, Juan Lavista; Ng, Raymond T",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07235v2.pdf,435

Here, we assessed the magnitude, function and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells in 95 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (38 of them being HIV-1 and/or tuberculosis (TB) co-infected) and 38 non-COVID-19 patients, using flow cytometry. We showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cell attributes, rather than magnitude, associates with disease severity, with severe disease being characterized by poor polyfunctional potential, reduced proliferation capacity and enhanced HLA-DR expression. Moreover, HIV-1 and TB co-infection skewed the SARS-CoV-2 T cell response. HIV-1 mediated CD4 T cell depletion associated with suboptimal T cell and humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2; and a decrease in the polyfunctional capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells was observed in COVID-19 patients with active TB. Our results also revealed that COVID-19 patients displayed reduced frequency of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with possible implications for TB disease progression. There results corroborate the important role of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in COVID-19 pathogenesis and support the concept of altered T cell functions in patients with severe disease.","Riou, Catherine; Du Bruyn, Elsa; Stek, Cari; Daroowala, Remy; Goliath, Rene T; Abrahams, Fatima; Said-Hartley, Qonita; Allwood, Brian W; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan; Wilkinson, Katalin A; Lindestam Arlehamn, Cecilia S; Sette, Alessandro; Wasserman, Sean; Wilkinson, Robert J",J. clin. invest,,435

Many studies reported low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and also revealed the need for methodological validation for enveloped viruses concentration in wastewater. The aim of this study was to evaluate different methodologies for the concentration of viruses in wastewaters and to select and improve an option that maximizes the recovery of SARS-CoV-2. A total of 11 concentration techniques based on different principles were evaluated: adsorption-elution protocols with negatively charged membranes followed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (Methods 1-2), PEG precipitation (Methods 3-7), aluminum polychloride (PAC) flocculation (Method 8), ultrafiltration (Method 9), skim milk flocculation (Method 10) and adsorption-elution with negatively charged membrane followed by ultrafiltration (Method 11). To evaluate the performance of these concentration techniques, feline calicivirus (FCV) was used as a process control in order to avoid the risk associated with handling SARS-CoV-2. Two protocols, one based on PEG precipitation and the other on PAC flocculation, showed high efficiency for FCV recovery from wastewater (62.2% and 45.0%, respectively). These two methods were then tested for the specific recovery of SARS-CoV-2. Both techniques could recover SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater, PAC flocculation showed a lower limit of detection (4.3 × 102 GC/mL) than PEG precipitation (4.3 × 103 GC/mL). This work provides a critical overview of current methods used for virus concentration in wastewaters and the analysis of sensitivity for the specific recovery of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage. The data obtained here highlights the viability of WBE for the surveillance of COVID-19 infections in the community.","Barril, Patricia Angélica; Pianciola, Luis Alfredo; Mazzeo, Melina; Ousset, María Julia; Jaureguiberry, María Virginia; Alessandrello, Mauricio; Sánchez, Gloria; Oteiza, Juan Martín",Sci Total Environ,,435

We examined the added utility of analyzing Twitter data to improve USC monitoring. METHODS: Georgia public school data were obtained from the National Center for Education Statistics. We identified school and district Twitter accounts with 1 or more tweets ever posted (""active""), and their USC-related tweets in the 2015-16 and 2016-17 school years. CDC researchers provided OSS-identified USC reports. Descriptive statistics, univariate, and multivariable logistic regression were computed. RESULTS: A majority (1,864/2,299) of Georgia public schools had, or were in a district with, active Twitter accounts in 2017. Among these schools, 638 were identified with USCs in 2015-16 (Twitter only, 222; OSS only, 2015; both, 201) and 981 in 2016-17 (Twitter only, 178; OSS only, 107; both, 696).

The antigen specificity of the antibody response mounted against this novel virus is not understood in detail. Here, we report that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a larger antibody response against the spike and nucleocapsid protein and epitope spreading to subdominant viral antigens, such as open reading frame 8 and nonstructural proteins. Subjects with a greater antibody response mounted a larger memory B cell response against the spike, but not the nucleocapsid protein. Additionally, we revealed that antibodies against the spike are still capable of binding the D614G spike mutant and cross-react with the SARS-CoV-1 receptor binding domain. Together, this study reveals that subjects with a more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibit a greater overall antibody response to the spike and nucleocapsid protein and a larger memory B cell response against the spike.IMPORTANCE With the ongoing pandemic, it is critical to understand how natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 develops. We have identified that subjects with more severe COVID-19 disease mount a more robust and neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Subjects who mounted a larger response against the spike also mounted antibody responses against other viral antigens, including the nucleocapsid protein and ORF8. Additionally, this study reveals that subjects with more severe disease mount a larger memory B cell response against the spike.

As many patients with PD have other long-term conditions, treatment is complex and risk of adverse events for these patients is high. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of pharmacists and impact of pharmacy interventions for PD patients. METHODS: We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Chinese databases Sinomed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify studies reporting pharmacist interventions and pharmacy services for PD patients using a predefined search strategy. The search period was from inception to March 2019. We also manually searched the reference list of included studies and ClinicalTrials.gov. We conducted meta-analyses to synthesize the evidence quantitatively. RESULTS: A total of 1607 studies were identified by applying the search criteria. After screening, 19 cross-sectional and case-controlled studies with 1458 PD patients from 9 countries were included. Pharmacist interventions for PD patients most commonly related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (13 studies), adherence assessment (12 studies), medication review (12 studies), identification of drug interactions (11 studies), monitoring response to medication therapy (11 studies), identification of inappropriate medication (11 studies), and patient education (10 studies). Most pharmacy services were provided in outpatient settings (13 studies). Reported impact measures included adherence (8 studies), quality of life (7 studies), and identification of drug-related problems (6 studies) such as ADRs (393 times out of 1760 times, 22.33%, 6 studies), inappropriate drug choice (349 times, 19.83%, 6 studies), inappropriate dosage (335 times, 19.03%, 6 studies), inappropriate drug use (257 times, 14.60%, 3 studies) and drug-drug interactions (146 times, 8.3%, 4 studies). Pooled results from 3 studies indicated no statistically significant impact of pharmacy services on all subscales of PD Questionnaire-39.

In the pandemic, parks, gardens and other local green spaces have been recognised as vital to people's physical and mental health. Emerging global evidence shows increased access to local parks and recreational activities and a new appreciation of the natural surroundings. Various movements and organisations globally have called for actions to embrace recent trends and changes in relation to the planning of public spaces and urban built environments to enable better access to parks and nature. The crisis, however, has exposed the inequities around access to green space where vulnerable populations such as older people and those in low socioeconomic areas are particularly affected. The crisis presents an opportunity to positively impact on society, and an opportunity to consolidate new emerging trends to better integrate nature into the architecture, infrastructure, and public spaces of urban areas.","Levinger, Pazit; Cerin, Ester; Milner, Colin; Hill, Keith D",Int J Environ Health Res,,435
444764,Dental care during COVID-19 pandemic: Survey of experts' opinion,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Inequality is deeply embedded in our economic structures-it is necessary to address these economic inequalities if we are to reduce health inequalities. An inclusive economic approach was conceptualised as a way to reduce these economic inequalities, although the attributes of this approach are unclear. Public health practitioners are increasingly asked to provide a health perspective on the economic recovery plans in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to identify the attributes of an inclusive economy to enable the public health profession to influence an inclusive economic recovery. APPROACH: We conducted a rapid review of grey and peer-reviewed literature to identify the attributes of an inclusive economy as currently defined in the literature. ATTRIBUTES OF AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY: Twenty-two concepts were identified from 56 reports and articles. These were collapsed into four distinct attributes of an inclusive economy: (1) an economy that is designed to deliver inclusion and equity, (2) equitable distribution of the benefits from the economy (eg, assets, power, value), (3) equitable access to the resources needed to participate in the economy (eg, health, education), and (4) the economy operates within planetary boundaries. CONCLUSION: As economies are (re)built following the COVID-19 pandemic, these attributes of an inclusive economy-based on the current literature-can be used to develop, and then monitor progress of, economic policy that will reduce health inequalities, improve health and mitigate against climate change.","Shipton, Deborah; Sarica, Shifa; Craig, Neil; McCartney, Gerry; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Roy, Graeme; McGregor, Peter; Scobie, Graeme",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),,435

A leading contributor to these concerning outcomes is a lack of available intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilation support. Poorer health is associated with a higher risk for severe respiratory complications from the coronavirus. We hypothesize that impaired respiratory muscle performance is an underappreciated factor contributing to poor outcomes unfolding during the coronavirus pandemic. Although impaired respiratory muscle performance is considered to be rare, it is more frequently encountered in patients with poorer health, in particular obesity. However, measures of respiratory muscle performance are not routinely performed in clinical practice, including those with symptoms such as dyspnea. The purpose of this article is to discuss the potential role of respiratory muscle performance from the perspective of the coronavirus pandemic. We also provide a theoretical patient management model to screen for impaired respiratory muscle performance and intervention, if identified, with the goal of unburdening health care systems during future pandemic crises.","Severin, Richard; Arena, Ross; Lavie, Carl J; Bond, Samantha; Phillips, Shane A",Am J Med,,435

National, European and International societies provided recommendations on how to safely perform endoscopic procedures during the current pandemic. Until now, the effect of the current pandemic on tertiary endoscopy centers has not been reported. Objective To analyze the influence of the early SARS-CoV2- pandemic on endoscopic care and work flow in two European tertiary endoscopy units. Methods Data from two tertiary endoscopy units (Katowice, Munich) were retrospectively collected during the early pandemic and compared to an equivalent pre-pandemic period. Data include procedures, complications, benchmarks, and influence on endoscopy training. Results During the early pandemic, we noted a highly significant decrease (49.1%) in the overall number of all endoscopies with a significant increase in therapeutic procedures. Besides, there were no significant differences in the number of urgent ERCP or interventional EUS procedures. The exceptional situation reduced endoscopic procedures performed by trainees significantly. Conclusions The SARS-CoV2-pandemic halved the endoscopy service of two tertiary centers while maintaining an urgent therapeutic service. Recommended personal safety measures in endoscopy proved to be efficient and safe in preventing SARS-CoV2 infection of staff or spreading. Unnecessarily, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic prevented routine endoscopy training.","Zorniak, Michal; Sirtl, Simon; Mahajan, Ujjwal Mukund; Stubbe, Hans Christian; Chapula, Mateusz; Wosiewicz, Piotr; Hartleb, Marek; Mayerle, Julia; Schulz, Christian",Dig. dis,,435

OBJECTIVE: To distinguish active pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia and MIS-C using presenting signs and symptoms, patient characteristics, and laboratory values. DESIGN: Patients diagnosed and hospitalized with active COVID-19 pneumonia or MIS-C at Children's of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham, AL from April 1 through September 1, 2020 were identified retrospectively. Active COVID-19 and MIS-C cases were defined using diagnostic codes and verified for accuracy using current US Centers for Disease Control case definitions. All clinical notes were reviewed for documentation of COVID-19 pneumonia or MIS-C, and clinical notes and electronic medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, prior exposure to or testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, laboratory data, imaging, treatment modalities and response to treatment. FINDINGS: 111 patients were identified, with 74 classified as mild COVID-19, 8 patients as moderate COVID-19, 8 patients as severe COVID-19, 10 as mild MIS-C and 11 as severe MIS-C. All groups had a male predominance, with Black and Hispanic patients overrepresented as compared to the demographics of Alabama. Most MIS-C patients were healthy at baseline, with most COVID-19 patients having at least one underlying illness. Fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms were predominant in the MIS-C population whereas COVID-19 patients presented with predominantly respiratory symptoms. The two groups were similar in duration of symptomatic prodrome and exposure history to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but MIS-C patients had a longer duration between presentation and exposure history. COVID-19 patients were more likely to have a positive SAR-CoV-2 PCR and to require respiratory support on admission. MIS-C patients had lower sodium levels, higher levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, d-dimer and procalcitonin. COVID-19 patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels on admission. MIS-C patients had coronary artery changes on echocardiography more often than COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study is one of the first to directly compare COVID-19 and MIS-C in the pediatric population. The significant differences found between symptoms at presentation, demographics, and laboratory findings will aide health-care providers in distinguishing the two disease entities.","Reiff, Daniel D; Mannion, Melissa L; Samuy, Nichole; Scalici, Paul; Cron, Randy Q",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,,435
450298,[COVID-19 and thromboprophylaxis: Recommendations for our clinical practice in Primary Care],2020,"Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations. At the time of writing, COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially interesting cycles seems beyond reach with such short series. We solve the problem of obtaining accurate estimates from short series by using recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods. We show that transformed daily COVID-19 cases for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly) and that shorter wavelength cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post-lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors. Unconstrained, new cases grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic declines. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or more daily falls. Spectral learning for epidemic time series contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process and can help evaluate interventions. Spectral fusion is a general technique that can fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates, which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.","Nason, Guy P",Sci Rep,,435

Here, we constructed two adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The immunogenicity of two vaccines was individually evaluated in mice. Specific immune responses were observed by priming in a dose-dependent manner, and stronger responses were obtained by boosting. Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were primed with 5×109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S, followed by boosting with 5×109 PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S at 4-week interval. Both mice and macaques well tolerated the vaccine inoculations without detectable clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost regimen induced high titers of 103.16 anti-S, 102.75 anti-RBD binding antibody and 102.38 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (pNAb) at 2 months, while pNAb decreased gradually to 101.45 at 7 months post-priming.

Many prevalent measures have been taken to prevent its spread and protect the public. However, the use of face coverings as an effective preventive measure remains contentious. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of face coverings as a protective measure. We examined the effectiveness of face coverings between 1 April and 31 December 2020. This was accomplished by analyzing trends of daily new COVID-19 cases, cumulative confirmed cases, and cases per 100,000 people in different U.S. states, including the District of Columbia. The results indicated a sharp change in trends after face covering mandates. For the 32 states with face covering mandates, 63% and 66% exhibited a downward trend in confirmed cases within 21 and 28 days of implementation, respectively. We estimated that face covering mandates in the 32 states prevented approximately 78,571 and 109,703 cases within 21- and 28-day periods post face covering mandate, respectively. A statistically significant (p = 0.001) negative correlation (-0.54) was observed between the rate of cases and days since the adoption of a face covering mandate.

455778,Paediatric dental A&E service during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"PURPOSE: Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease known as COVID-19, case management has emerged as a critical intervention in the treatment of cases, particularly for patients with severe symptoms and medical complications. In addition, case managers have been on the front lines of the response across the health care spectrum to reduce risks of contagion, including among health care workers. The purpose of this article is to discuss the case management response, highlighting the importance of individual care plans to provide access to the right care and treatment at the right time to address both the consequences of the disease and patient comorbidities. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: The COVID-19 response spans the full continuum of health and human services, including acute care, subacute care, workers' compensation (especially catastrophic case management), home health, primary care, and community-based care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: From the earliest days of the pandemic, case managers have assumed an important role on the front lines of the medical response to COVID-19, ensuring that procedures are in place for managing a range of patients: those who were symptomatic but able to self-isolate and care for themselves at home; those who had serious symptoms and needed to be hospitalized; and those who were asymptomatic and needed to be educated about the importance of self-isolating. Across the care spectrum, individualized responses to the clinical and psychosocial needs of patients with COVID-19 in acute care, subacute care, home health, and other outpatient settings have been guided by the well-established case management process of screening, assessing, planning, implementing, following up, transitioning, and evaluating. In addition, professional case managers are guided by values such as advocacy, ensuring access to the right care and treatment at the right time; autonomy, respecting the right to self-determination; and justice, promoting fairness and equity in access to resources and treatment. The value of justice also addresses the sobering reality that people from racial and ethnic minority groups are at an increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19. Going forward, case management will continue to play a major role in supporting patients with COVID-19, in both inpatient and outpatient settings, with telephonic follow-up and greater use of telehealth.","Baker, Michelle; Nelson, Sheila; Krsnak, Jean",Prof Case Manag,,435

RESULTS: Some structural effects at the neighbourhood level consistently either boost (e.g. population density) or reduce (e.g. income) COVID-19 cases. Other effects differ between the two waves (i.e. age composition, schools and transport infrastructures). CONCLUSIONS: Since certain characteristics influenced the virus diffusion in opposite ways between the two pandemic waves, territorial heterogeneity alone is insufficient to explain COVID-19 outbreaks-individual behaviour also needs to be factored in. Consequently, both econometric and spatial analysis techniques are recommended for tracking the spatiotemporal spread of this disease and for monitoring the effectiveness of policy measures across heterogeneous neighbourhoods.","Arauzo-Carod, Josep-Maria; Domènech, Antoni; Gutiérrez, Aaron",J. public health (Oxf),,435
457812,School closure and children in the outbreak of covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world showing high transmissibility. Many studies have proposed diverse diagnostic methods based on deep learning using chest X-ray images focusing on performance improvement. In reviewing them, this study noticed that evaluation results might be influenced by dataset organization. Therefore, this study identified whether the high-performance values can prove the clinical application potential. METHODS: This study selected chest X-ray image databases which have been widely applied in previous studies. One database includes images for COVID-19, while the others consist of normal and pneumonia images. Then, the COVID-19 classification model was designed and trained on diverse database compositions and evaluated using confusion matrix-based metrics. Also, each database was analyzed by graphical representation methods. RESULTS: The performance was significantly different according to dataset composition. Overall, higher performance was identified on the dataset organized with different databases for each class, compared with the dataset from same database. Also, there were significant differences in the image characteristics between different databases. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results indicate that model may be trained based on differences of the image characteristics between databases and not on lesion features. This shows that evaluation metrics can be influenced by dataset organization, and high metric values would not directly mean the potential for clinical application. These emphasize the importance of suitable dataset organization for applying COVID-19 diagnosis methods to real clinical sites. Radiologists should sufficiently understand about this issue as actual user of these methods.","Kim, Ga Young; Kim, Jae Yong; Kim, Chae Hyeon; Kim, Sung Min",J Appl Clin Med Phys,,435

458206,Access barriers to electroconvulsive therapy during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: In this COVID-19 pandemic, the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia is still challenging. We aimed to assess the classification performance of computed tomography (CT)-based CT signs and radiomics features for discriminating COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia. METHODS: A total of 154 patients with confirmed viral pneumonia (COVID-19: 89 cases, influenza pneumonia: 65 cases) were collected retrospectively in this study. Pneumonia signs and radiomics features were extracted from the initial unenhanced chest CT images to build independent and combined models. The predictive performance of the radiomics model, CT sign model, the combined model was constructed based on the whole dataset and internally invalidated by using 1000-times bootstrap. Diagnostic performance of the models was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The combined models consisted of 4 significant CT signs and 7 selected features and demonstrated better discrimination performance between COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia than the single radiomics model. For the radiomics model, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.888 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 78.4%; accuracy, 83.1%), and the AUC was 0.906 (sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 81.5%; accuracy, 84.4%) in the CT signs model. After combining CT signs and radiomics features, AUC of the combined model was 0.959 (sensitivity, 89.9%; specificity, 90.7%; accuracy, 90.3%). CONCLUSIONS: CT-based radiomics combined with signs might be a potential method for distinguishing COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia with satisfactory performance.","Huang, Yilong; Zhang, Zhenguang; Liu, Siyun; Li, Xiang; Yang, Yunhui; Ma, Jiyao; Li, Zhipeng; Zhou, Jialong; Jiang, Yuanming; He, Bo",BMC Med Imaging,,435

459222,Challenges in diagnosing hydroxychloroquine myopathy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: A significant portion of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at high risk of developing intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired swallowing dysfunction (neurogenic dysphagia) as a consequence of requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) is a simple and safe treatment for neurogenic dysphagia. It has been shown that PES can restore safe swallowing in orally intubated or tracheotomized ICU patients with neurogenic dysphagia following severe stroke. We report the case of a patient with severe neurogenic post-extubation dysphagia (PED) due to prolonged intubation and severe general muscle weakness related to COVID-19, which was successfully treated using PES. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old Caucasian female patient with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection developed neurogenic dysphagia following prolonged intubation in the ICU. To avoid aerosol-generating procedures, her swallowing function was evaluated non-instrumentally as recommended by recently published international guidelines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her swallowing function was markedly impaired and PES therapy was recommended. PES led to a rapid improvement of the PED, as evaluated by bedside swallowing assessments using the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and Dysphagia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS), and diet screening using the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS). The improved swallowing, as reflected by these measures, allowed this patient to transfer from the ICU to a non-intensive medical department 5 days after completing PES treatment. CONCLUSIONS: PES treatment contributed to the restoration of a safe swallowing function in this critically ill patient with COVID-19 and ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Early clinical bedside swallowing assessment and dysphagia intervention in COVID-19 patients is crucial to optimize their full recovery. PES may contribute to a safe and earlier ICU discharge of patients with ICU-acquired swallowing dysfunction. Earlier ICU discharge and reduced rates of re-intubation following PES can help alleviate some of the pressure on ICU bed capacity, which is critical in times of a health emergency such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Traugott, Marianna; Hoepler, Wolfgang; Kitzberger, Reinhard; Pavlata, Sophie; Seitz, Tamara; Baumgartner, Sebastian; Placher-Sorko, Gudrun; Pirker-Krassnig, Daniela; Ehehalt, Urs; Grasnek, Andreas; Beham-Kacerovsky, Michaela; Friese, Emanuela; Wenisch, Christoph; Neuhold, Stephanie",J Med Case Rep,,435

462144,The walk of life: Remote monitoring provides insights into physical activity during a pandemic,2021,"Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 variants from the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil have received much attention for their increased infectivity, potentially high virulence, and possible threats to existing vaccines and antibody therapies. The question remains if there are other more infectious variants transmitted around the world. We carry out a large-scale study of 252,874 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates from patients to identify many other rapidly growing mutations on the spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RDB). We reveal that 88 out of 95 significant mutations that were observed more than 10 times strengthen the binding between the RBD and the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), indicating the virus evolves toward more infectious variants. In particular, we discover new fast-growing RBD mutations N439K, L452R, S477N, S477R, and N501T that also enhance the RBD and ACE2 binding. We further unveil that mutation N501Y involved in United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil variants may moderately weaken the binding between the RBD and many known antibodies, while mutations E484K and K417N found in South Africa and Brazilian variants can potentially disrupt the binding between the RDB and many known antibodies. Among three newly identified fast-growing RBD mutations, L452R, which is now known as part of the California variant B.1.427, and N501T are able to effectively weaken the binding of many known antibodies with the RBD. Finally, we hypothesize that RBD mutations that can simultaneously make SARS-CoV-2 more infectious and disrupt the existing antibodies, called vaccine escape mutations, will pose an imminent threat to the current crop of vaccines. A list of most likely vaccine escape mutations is given, including N501Y, L452R, E484K, N501T, S494P, and K417N.","Wang, Rui; Chen, Jiahui; Gao, Kaifu; Wei, Guo-Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08023v2.pdf,435

462580,Spotlight for healthy adolescents and adolescents with preexisting chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Italy is particularly affected by SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Recently, Colombo and Impicciatore compared the deaths in 1084 selected municipalities between 21 February 2020 and 21 March 2020 with deaths in the same time period in 2015 to 2019. We extend analyses of data from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) and calculate SMRs for all causes of death in the nine selected regions of Italy, separately for men and women and summarized. We analyze the effect of covariables by Poisson modelling and discuss the limitations of the current elaborations. We conclude: In agreement with Colombo and Impicciatore, in the particular corona situation, this ""mortality excess loupe"" - assuming otherwise constant determinants of death - can be a virus-test-independent tool to determine mortality effects of SARS-CoV-2. The current ""loupe"" is focused on municipalities with increases of more than 20% deaths in March 2020 compared to the average deaths on the same days in 2015-2019. The time window of investigation could be opened before 21 February 2020 to detect masked increases in mortality before the first ""COVID-19 death"" was ascertained. The current ""loupe"" conveys pronounced mortality increases also in regions that were not considered to be corona hotspots. In this respect, even in the absence of representative virus test results, mortality data can be important indicators of the distribution or spread of a newly acting factor. Overall, it is advisable to carry out SMR analyses for Germany on a regular basis, differentiated by region, gender, age group and cause of death. Such analyses can contribute to the early detection and evaluation of the severity of a deadly pandemic (""burden of disease"") as well as to monitoring the dynamic spread of a factor such as SARS-CoV-2. SMR analyses can also be used to assess and evaluate both desired and undesired effects of measures taken against SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 - and possibly other epidemics or pandemics.","Morfeld, Peter; Erren, Thomas C",Gesundheitswesen,,435

They were randomized to perform 15 min of warm-up exercises, while wearing a cloth facemask (EXP) or no mask (CON) on two separate occasions, with at least 48-h separating conditions. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and d2 Attention assessment were used to verify cognitive function, using a repeated measures general linear model. The warm-up improved cognitive abilities and the results demonstrated significant differences between the EXP vs. CON groups in post-concentration performance (186.06 ± 15.47 EXP-score vs. 178.12 ± 13.66 CON-score), post the total number of errors (23.47 ± 14.50 EXP-frequency < 29.06 ± 13.74 CON-frequency), and in the post RPE (6.0 ± 1.37 EXP-index > 4.7 ± 0.85 CON-index). Wearing a cloth facemask caused positive effects on cognitive function. This data suggests that wearing a cloth facemask during warm-up may stimulate/improve the cognitive function.","Slimani, Maamer; Miarka, Bianca; Znazen, Hela; Moalla, Wassim; Hammami, Amri; Paravlic, Armin; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,435

462835,Caregiving at a Physical Distance: Initial Thoughts for COVID-19 and Beyond,2020,"BACKGROUND: In late 2019, a novel human coronavirus - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) - emerged in Wuhan, China. This virus has caused a global pandemic involving more than 200 countries. SARS-CoV-2 is highly adapted to humans and readily transmits from person-to-person. AIM: To investigate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 under various environmental and pH conditions. The efficacies of various laboratory virus inactivation methods and home disinfectants against SARS-CoV-2 were investigated. METHODS: The residual virus in dried form or in solution was titrated on to Vero E6 cells on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 after incubation at different temperatures. Viral viability was determined after treatment with various disinfectants and pH solutions at room temperature (20-25oC). FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 was able to retain viability for 3-5 days in dried form or 7 days in solution at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2 could be detected under a wide range of pH conditions from pH 4 to pH 11 for several days, and for 1-2 days in stool at room temperature but lost 5 logs of infectivity. A variety of commonly used disinfectants and laboratory inactivation procedures were found to reduce viral viability effectively. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces, and raises the possibility of faecal-oral transmission. Commonly used fixatives, nucleic acid extraction methods and heat inactivation were found to reduce viral infectivity significantly, which could ensure hospital and laboratory safety during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Chan, K-H; Sridhar, S; Zhang, R R; Chu, H; Fung, A Y-F; Chan, G; Chan, J F-W; To, K K-W; Hung, I F-N; Cheng, V C-C; Yuen, K-Y",J Hosp Infect,,435

We performed a spatiotemporal hotspot analysis to simulate a real-time surveillance scenario.Results. We analyzed 6527 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and identified microepidemics in more than 1100 neighborhoods, and more than half of the neighborhoods that had hotspots in a season became hotspots in the next season. We used data from 731 COVID-19 cases, and we found that a neighborhood was 1.90 times more likely to become a COVID-19 hotspot if it had been an influenza hotspot in 2018 to 2019.Conclusions. The use of readily available hospital data allows the real-time identification of spatiotemporal trends and hotspots of microepidemics.Public Health Implications. As local governments move to reopen the economy and ease physical distancing, the use of historic influenza hotspots could guide early prevention interventions, while the real-time identification of hotspots would enable the implementation of interventions that focus on small-area containment and mitigation.","Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Kalligeros, Markos; Benitez, Gregorio; Chan, Philip A; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Am J Public Health,,435

Mean values from two remotely sensed approaches show 2020 as having one of the cleanest snow/ice surfaces on record in the past two decades. A 30% LAP reduction in the spring and summer of 2020 affected the timing of 6.6 km3 of melt water. It remains to be seen whether there will be significant reductions in pollution post-COVID-19, but these results offer a glimpse of the link between pollution and the timing of water supply for billions of people. By causing more solar radiation to be reflected, cleaner snow/ice could mitigate climate change effects by delaying melt onset and extending snow cover duration.","Bair, Edward; Stillinger, Timbo; Rittger, Karl; Skiles, McKenzie",Proc.

Our objectives were to (1) describe adherence to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mitigation policies in these urban, low-income educational settings; (2) assess associations between policy adherence and in-hub COVID-19 transmission; and (3) identify barriers to and facilitators of adherence. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study from November 2020 to February 2021. We obtained COVID-19 case data from the San Francisco Department of Public Health, conducted field observations to observe adherence to COVID-19 mitigation policies, and surveyed hub leaders about barriers to and facilitators of adherence. We summarized quantitative data using descriptive statistics and qualitative data using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1738 children were enrolled in 85 hubs (39% Hispanic, 29% Black). We observed 54 hubs (n = 1175 observations of children and 295 observations of adults). There was high community-based COVID-19 incidence (2.9-41.2 cases per 100 000 residents per day), with 36 cases in hubs and only 1 case of hub-based transmission (adult to adult).

We estimated excess mortality in obesity, both 'direct', through infection, and 'indirect', through changes in health care, and also due to potential increasing obesity during lockdown. STUDY DESIGN: The study design of this study is a retrospective cohort study and causal inference methods. METHODS: In population-based electronic health records for 1,958,638 individuals in England, we estimated 1-year mortality risk ('direct' and 'indirect' effects) for obese individuals, incorporating (i) pre-COVID-19 risk by age, sex and comorbidities, (ii) population infection rate and (iii) relative impact on mortality (relative risk [RR]: 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0). Using causal inference models, we estimated impact of change in body mass index (BMI) and physical activity during 3-month lockdown on 1-year incidence for high-risk conditions (cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease), accounting for confounders. RESULTS: For severely obese individuals (3.5% at baseline), at 10% population infection rate, we estimated direct impact of 240 and 479 excess deaths in England at RR 1.5 and 2.0, respectively, and indirect effect of 383-767 excess deaths, assuming 40% and 80% will be affected at RR = 1.2. Owing to BMI change during the lockdown, we estimated that 97,755 (5.4%: normal weight to overweight, 5.0%: overweight to obese and 1.3%: obese to severely obese) to 434,104 individuals (15%: normal weight to overweight, 15%: overweight to obese and 6%: obese to severely obese) would be at higher risk for COVID-19 over one year. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention of obesity and promotion of physical activity are at least as important as physical isolation of severely obese individuals during the pandemic.","Katsoulis, M; Pasea, L; Lai, A G; Dobson, R J B; Denaxas, S; Hemingway, H; Banerjee, A",Public Health,,435

Providing access to prenatal health care while limiting exposure of both obstetric health care professionals and patients to COVID-19 is challenging. Although reductions in the frequency of prenatal visits and implementation of telehealth interventions provide some options, there still remains a need for patient-health care professional visits. A drive-through prenatal care model was developed in which pregnant women would remain in their automobiles while being assessed by the health care professional, thus reducing potential patient, health care professional, and staff exposure to COVID-19. Drive-through prenatal visits would include key elements that some institutions cannot perform by telehealth encounters, such as blood pressure measurements for evaluation for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, fetal heart rate assessment, and selected ultrasound-based measurements or observations, as well as face-to-face patient-health care professional interaction, thereby reducing patient anxiety resulting from the reduction in the number of planned clinic visits with an obstetric health care professional as well as fear of virus exposure in the clinic setting.

We aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of whether the timing of vertebroplasty (VP) for vertebral fracture associated with the risk of hip fracture for hip replacement.We identified 142,782 patients from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database with thoracolumbar vertebral fracture (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification:805.2-805.9) who were followed up from 2000 to 2013. These patients were divided into those who underwent VP (VP group) (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification : 78.49) within 3 months and those who did not (non-VP group). After adjusting for the confounding factors, the Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to estimate the effect of early VP on reducing the risk of hip fracture. The difference in the risk of hip replacement, between the VP group and non-VP group was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test.In the 14-year follow-up, the cumulative incidence rate of hip replacement in the VP group was lower than that in the non-VP group (0.362% and 0.533%, respectively, long-rank Pâ<â.001). There was a significant difference between the 2 groups since the first-year follow-up.Our study showed that early VP performed to avoid progression of the kyphotic changes following thoracolumbar vertebral fracture may reduce the risk of hip fracture. These results, obtained from retrospective data, indicate that a prospective study is warranted.","Li, Chiao-Zhu; Li, Chiao-Ching; Tang, Chi-Tun; Chung, Chi-Hsiang; Ou, Chien-Yu; Chen, Chun-Lin; Chen, Nan-Fu; Chung, Tzu-Tsao; Hueng, Dueng-Yuan; Ma, Hsin-I; Liu, Ming-Ying; Chen, Yuan-Hao; Chien, Wu-Chien; Ju, Da-Tong",Medicine (Baltimore),,435

COVID-19 vaccines are currently developed and tested in clinical trials. However, limited studies have investigated the willingness to get COVID-19 vaccines in populations. Therefore, the study aimed to determine the individual's willingness to accept and pay for COVID-19 vaccines, and knowledge, attitude, and perceptions (KAP) of COVID-19 vaccines, which hopefully will be available soon. Non-pregnant Chinese adults aged &#8805;18 years were asked to complete a self-administered KAP COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire distributed between March and May 2020. A total of 1179 participants (574 males and 605 females) were included and the mean age was 36.0 ± 11.5 years. Both the willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and pay for COVID-19 vaccines were high (77.4% and 81.1%), respectively. Also, the most acceptable price range of COVID-19 vaccine was ¥501-1000 (US $ 75-149). Education and willingness to be vaccinated were significantly associated with some of the responses in KAP (P < .05). In conclusion, our study reported high willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and pay for COVID-19 vaccines in Chinese population. Our findings also provided some important contributions for public health policy makers to formulate appropriate vaccination programs.","Zhang, Yutong; Luo, Xiaoqin; Ma, Zheng Feei",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,435
468516,Health Systems' Rehabilitation Research Priorities During the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic: Findings from the Learning Health Systems Rehabilitation Research Network (LeaRRn),2020,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic debilitating disease characterized by severe and disabling fatigue that fails to improve with rest; it is commonly accompanied by multifocal pain, as well as sleep disruption, and cognitive dysfunction. Even mild exertion can exacerbate symptoms. The prevalence of ME/CFS in the U.S. is estimated to be 0.5-1.5 % and is higher among females. Viral infection is an established trigger for the onset of ME/CFS symptoms, raising the possibility of an increase in ME/CFS prevalence resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current treatments are largely palliative and limited to alleviating symptoms and addressing the psychological sequelae associated with long-term disability. While ME/CFS is characterized by broad heterogeneity, common features include immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanistic basis of the disease remains poorly understood. Herein, we review the current understanding, diagnosis and treatment of ME/CFS and summarize past clinical studies aimed at identifying effective therapies. We describe the current status of mechanistic studies, including the identification of multiple targets for potential pharmacological intervention, and ongoing efforts towards the discovery of new medicines for ME/CFS treatment.","Toogood, Peter L; Clauw, Daniel J; Phadke, Sameer; Hoffman, David",Pharmacol Res,,435

Novel agents such as 18F DOPA and 68Ga DOTATATE are being used nowadays in academic centers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, procurement of MIBG has proved particularly challenging, necessitating the use of 68Ga DOTATATE positron emission tomography. Methods: 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT imaging was carried out for staging of three pediatric patients with Neuroblastoma at our institution. A review of the literature was also completed. Results: 68Ga-DOTATATE is FDA approved for imaging of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 68Ga DOTATATE PET/CT scans were successfully carried out in all patients. All patients showed DOTATATE avid disease. PET scans showed excellent spatial resolution and demonstrated high accuracy in concordance with current EANM guidelines. Conclusion: We have presented 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging believe it can be reliably used as an alternative to MIBG for staging of neuroblastoma. Its advantages include technical, clinical and practical advantages making it an attractive option.

469397,Urological activity at the time of COVID-19 pandemic: is there any differences between public and private field?,2020,"Tailoring the properties of porous organic materials, such as resorcinol-formaldehyde gels, for use in various applications has been a central focus for many studies in recent years. In order to achieve effective optimisation for each application, this work aims to assess the impact of the various synthesis parameters on the final textural properties of the gel. Here, the formation of porous organic gels is modelled using a three-dimensional lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation. We model growth from monomer species into the interconnected primary clusters of a gel, and account for varying catalyst concentration and solids content, two parameters proven to control gel properties in experimental work. In addition to analysing the textural properties of the simulated materials, we also explore their fractal properties through correlation dimension and Hurst exponent calculations. The correlation dimension shows that while fractal properties are not typically observed in scattering experiments, they are possible to achieve with sufficiently low solids content and catalyst concentration. Furthermore, fractal properties are also apparent from the analysis of the diffusion path of guest species through the gel's porous network. This model, therefore, provides insight into how porous organic gels can be manufactured with their textural and fractal properties computationally tailored according to the intended application.","Martin, Elisha; Prostredny, Martin; Fletcher, Ashleigh; Mulheran, Paul",,,435

The aim of this article is to review the literature regarding various aspects of association between diabetes and COVID-19 and to highlight clinically relevant points with focus on India. METHODS: We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar databases for articles regarding diabetes and COVID-19 published between March 19, 2020 and August 30, 2020. RESULTS: Diabetes and poor glycemic control are associated with increased severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Several clinical scenarios about hyperglycemia and COVID-19 are identified and each of these needs specific management strategies. CONCLUSION: It is prudent to maintain good glycemic control in patients with diabetes in order to minimize the complications of COVID-19.

Between 4 June and 3 July 2020, an investigation was conducted to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies among the employees of the FPG using point-of-care (POC) and venous blood tests. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction on nasal/oropharyngeal swabs as the diagnostic gold standard. The participants enrolled amounted to 4777. Seroprevalence was 3.66% using the POC test and 1.19% using the venous blood test, with a significant difference (p < 0.05). The POC test sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 63.64% (95% confidence interval (CI): 62.20% to 65.04%) and 96.64% (95% CI: 96.05% to 97.13%), while those of the venous blood test were, respectively, 78.79% (95% CI: 77.58% to 79.94%) and 99.36% (95% CI: 99.07% to 99.55%). Among the low-risk populations, the POC test's predictive values were 58.33% (positive) and 98.23% (negative), whereas those of the venous blood test were 92.86% (positive) and 98.53% (negative).

474122,"Maintaining Trauma Care Access During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Urban, Level-1 Trauma Center's Experience",2020,"BACKGROUND: The majority of stroke survivors return to their homes and need assistance from family caregivers to perform activities of daily living. These increased demands coupled with the lack of preparedness for their new roles lead to a high risk for caregivers developing depressive symptoms and other negative outcomes. Follow-up home support and problem-solving interventions with caregivers are crucial for maintaining stroke survivors in their homes. Problem-solving interventions are effective but are underused in practice because they require large amounts of staff time to implement and are difficult for caregivers logistically. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test a problem-solving intervention for stroke caregivers that can be delivered over the telephone during the patient's transitional care period (time when the stroke survivor is discharged to home) followed by 8 asynchronous online sessions. METHODS: The design is a two-arm parallel randomized clinical trial with repeated measures. We will enroll 240 caregivers from eight Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers. Participants randomized into the intervention arm receive a modified problem-solving intervention that uses telephone and web-based support and training with interactive modules, fact sheets, and tools on the previously developed and nationally available Resources and Education for Stroke Caregivers' Understanding and Empowerment Caregiver website. In the usual care group, no changes are made in the information, discharge planning, or care the patients who have had a stroke normally receive, and caregivers have access to existing VA resources (eg, caregiver support line, self-help materials). The primary outcome is a change in caregiver depressive symptoms at 11 and 19 weeks after baseline data collection. Secondary outcomes include changes in stroke caregivers' burden, knowledge, positive aspects of caregiving, self-efficacy, perceived stress, health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with care and changes in stroke survivors' functional abilities and health care use. The team will also determine the budgetary impact, facilitators, barriers, and best practices for implementing the intervention. Throughout all phases of the study, we will collaborate with members of an advisory panel. RESULTS: Study enrollment began in June 2015 and is ongoing. The first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known study to test a transitional care and messaging center intervention combined with technology to decrease caregiver depressive symptoms and to improve the recovery of stroke survivors. If successful, findings will support an evidence-based model that can be transported into clinical practice to improve the quality of caregiving post stroke.

Here, we examined whether differences in the endogenous opioid systems might be responsible for these differences. Rats received 6 weeks of chronic intermittent to 20% alcohol (v/v) or water-only from PND 26-66. Based on their consumption during the last 2 weeks of alcohol access, the alcohol-access rats were divided into high drinking (>2.5 g/kg/24-h) or low drinking (<2 g/kg/24-h). Rats were then given injections of the preferential mu opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (1 mg/kg, s.c.) or the selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist LY2456302 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) prior to fear conditioning and were then tested for conditioned fear 2 days later. Pre-training naltrexone increased conditioned suppression of lever-pressing during training and testing, with no differences between high versus low alcohol drinkers or between water-only versus alcohol access groups (averaged across drinking levels). There was no effect of LY2456302 on conditioned fear in any comparison. We also found no differences between high and low alcohol drinkers and no reliable effect of prior alcohol access (averaged across drinking levels) on conditioned fear. Our experiment replicates and extends previous demonstrations that a preferential MOR antagonist can increase fear learning using conditioned suppression of lever-pressing as a fear measure. However, additional research is needed to determine the cause of the differences in conditioned fear that we previously observed (as they were not observed in the current experiments).","Pajser, Alisa; Fisher, Hayley; Pickens, Charles L",Physiol Behav,,435

Also, to verify factors of resilience, namely the reliability and validity of self-efficacy and positive thinking, and establishment of a prospective norm analysis. METHOD: The study mainly applied Explorative Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to develop LHHLS and establish the reliability and validity of the tool's structure, verify norm analysis and the reliability of data from each question using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: According to statistics, LHHLS has a good factorial effectiveness and relatively high reliability, with factor reliability analyses where Cronbach's alpha lies between 0.83 to 0.94. The 14 questions in the LHHLS has a total variance of 67.04%. The tool includes two sub-assessments that are theoretically and statistically appropriate: mental health/self-efficacy and positive thinking. CONCLUSION: The tool LHHLS can be applied to populations affected by COVID-19. With participants' self-awareness of mental health state and state of happy living, this tool is valid and reliable in assessing and evaluating the resilience of such participants against times of COVID-19. This study can become future use for epidemic prevention communities in monitoring residents' healthy living and changes in their resilience. Also, can become a reference standard for interventions to reduce the impacts populations' happy and healthy living, in times of biological disasters.","Lo, Angela; Hsieh, Kuan-Ying; Lu, Wan-Chun; Shieh, Ierna; Chou, Frank Huang-Chih; Shieh, Vincent",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,435

This paper thus sought to determine whether RA could improve baseline barrier function and attenuate TNF-&#945;-induced barrier leak in the human bronchial epithelial cell culture model, 16HBE14o- (16HBE). We show for the first time that RA increases baseline barrier function of these cell layers indicated by an 89% increase in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and 22% decrease in 14C-mannitol flux. A simultaneous, RA-induced 70% increase in claudin-4 attests to RA affecting the tight junctional (TJ) complex itself. RA was also effective in alleviating TNF-&#945;-induced 16HBE barrier leak, attenuating 60% of the TNF-&#945;-induced leak to 14C-mannitol and 80% of the leak to 14C-inulin. Interleukin-6-induced barrier leak was also reduced by RA. Treatment of 16HBE cell layers with TNF-&#945; resulted in dramatic decrease in immunostaining for occludin and claudin-4, as well as a downward ""band-shift"" in occludin Western immunoblots. The presence of RA partially reversed TNF-&#945;'s effects on these select TJ proteins. Lastly, RA completely abrogated the TNF-&#945;-induced increase in ERK-1,2 phosphorylation without significantly decreasing the TNF-driven increase in total ERK-1,2. This study suggests RA could be effective as a prophylactic agent in minimizing airway barrier leak and as a therapeutic in preventing leak triggered by inflammatory cascades. Given the growing literature suggesting a ""cytokine storm"" may be related to COVID-19 morbidity, RA may be a useful adjuvant for use with anti-viral therapies.","Callaghan, Patrick J; Rybakovsky, Elizabeth; Ferrick, Bryan; Thomas, Sunil; Mullin, James M",PLoS One,,435

478130,Interpreting COVID-19 Test Results in Clinical Settings: It Depends!,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The effects of treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with a triple combination composed of hydroxychloroquine, an an-tiviral, and an antibiotic on electrocardiography (ECG) parameters in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms are not wholly understood. We aimed to explore the changes in ECG parameters after treatment with triple combination therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center case series analyzed 91 patients with mild-to-moderate symptomatic COVID-19 at Ankara Gazi Mus-tafa Kemal State Hospital of Ankara City, Turkey, from April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Forty-three patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+azithromycin (Group 1) and 48 patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine+oseltamivir+levofloxacin (Group 2). Heart rate, P wave duration, P wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, corrected QT interval (QTc), QTc dispersion (QTD), delta QTc, Tp-e, Tp-e dispersion, and Tp-e/QTc ratio were all calculated from the baseline and posttreatment 12-lead ECG recordings. RESULTS: The QTc, QRS duration, Tp-e, PR interval, and P wave duration were significantly increased after treatment (p<0.001; p<0.001; p<0.001; p=0.001; p=0.001). The posttreatment C-reactive protein level was significantly lower than at baseline in Group 1 (p=0.014). At admission, 30% of patients had QT prolongation, and 4.3% of them had a QT duration >500 ms. Both Group 1 and Group 2 showed significant prolongation of the QTc interval (Group 1; p<0.001 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), QRS duration (Group 1; p=0.006 vs. Group 2; p=0.014), Tp-e (Group 1; p=0.036 vs. Group 2; p<0.001), and PR interval (Group 1; p=0.002 vs. Group2; p=0.05). The QTD was significantly decreased in Group 1 (p<0.001). None of the patients experienced any overt ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate QT prolongation in a population of COVID-19 patients treated with triple combination therapy. We found that there was a significant decrease in the QTD after the treatment in patients who were taking triple therapy including azithromycin.","Ugurlu Ilgin, Burcu; Akbulut Koyuncu, Irem Müge; Kiziltunç, Emrullah",Anatol J Cardiol,,435
478212,COVID-19 drive-through testing survey: Measuring the burden on healthcare workers,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mental health of postpartum women has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the experiences that underlie this remain unexplored. The purpose of this study was to examine how people in Canada who gave birth during the pandemic were affected by policies aimed at limiting interpersonal contact to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospital and during the early weeks postpartum. METHODS: We took a social constructionist approach and used a qualitative descriptive methodology. Sampling methods were purposive and involved a mix of convenience and snowball sampling via social media and email. Study inclusion was extended to anyone aged 18 years or more who was located in Canada and was pregnant or had given birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were obtained via semistructured qualitative telephone interviews conducted between June 2020 and January 2021, and were analyzed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: Sixty-five interviews were conducted; data from 57 women who had already delivered were included in our analysis. We identified the following 4 themes: negative postpartum experience in hospital owing to the absence of a support person(s); poor postpartum mental health, especially in women with preexisting mental health conditions and those who had had medically complicated deliveries; asking for help despite public health regulations that prohibited doing so; and problems with breastfeeding owing to limited in-person follow-up care and lack of in-person breastfeeding support. INTERPRETATION: Policies that restrict the presence of support persons in hospital and at home during the postpartum period appear to be causing harm. Measures to mitigate the consequences of these policies could include encouraging pregnant people to plan for additional postpartum support, allowing a support person to remain for the entire hospital stay and offering additional breastfeeding support.","Rice, Kathleen; Williams, Sarah",CMAJ Open,,435
478483,The Kerala Model of health care delivery and its impact on Oral cancer care during the COVID 19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of chest CT findings with mortality in clinical management of older patients. METHODS: From January 21 to February 14, 2020, 98 older patients (&#8805; 60 years) who had undergone chest CT scans (""initial CT"") on admission were enrolled. Manifestation and CT score were compared between the death group and the survival group. In each group, patients were sub-grouped based on the time interval between symptom onset and the ""initial CT"" scan: subgroup1 (interval &#8804; 5 days), subgroup2 (interval between 6 and 10 days), and subgroup3 (interval > 10 days). Adjusted ROC curve after adjustment for age and gender was applied. RESULTS: Consolidations on CT images were more common in the death group (n = 46) than in the survival group (n = 52) (53.2% vs 32.0%, p < 0.001). For subgroup1 and subgroup2, a higher mean CT score was found for the death group (33.0 ± 17.1 vs 12.9 ± 8.7, p < 0.001; 38.8 ± 12.3 vs 24.3 ± 11.9, p = 0.002, respectively) and no significant difference of CT score was identified with respect to subgroup3 (p = 0.144). In subgroup1, CT score of 14.5 with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 77.3% for the prediction of mortality was an optimal cutoff value, with an adjusted AUC of 0.881. In subgroup2, CT score of 27.5 with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 70.6% for the prediction of mortality was an optimal cutoff value, with an adjusted AUC of 0.895. CONCLUSIONS: ""Initial CT"" scores may be useful to speculate prognosis and stratify patients. Severe manifestation on CT at an early stage may indicate poor prognosis for older patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ Severe manifestation on CT at an early stage may indicate poor prognosis for older patients with COVID-19. â¢ Radiologists should pay attention to the time interval between symptom onsets and CT scans of patients with COVID-19. â¢ Consolidations on CT images were more common in death patients than in survival patients.","Li, Yan; Yang, Zhenlu; Ai, Tao; Wu, Shandong; Xia, Liming",Eur Radiol,,435
478739,Massive open online course for type 2 diabetes self-management: Adapting education in the COVID-19 era,2020,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, COVID-19 infections began to rise exponentially in the USA, placing substantial burden on the healthcare system. As a result, there was a rapid change in transplant practices and policies, with cessation of most procedures. Our goal was to understand changes to pediatric kidney transplantation (KT) at the national level during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: Using SRTR data, we examined changes in pediatric waitlist registration, waitlist removal or inactivation, and deceased donor and living donor (DDKT/LDKT) events during the start of the disease transmission in the USA compared with the same time the previous year. RESULTS: We saw an initial decrease in DDKT and LDKT by 47% and 82% compared with expected events and then a continual increase, with numbers reaching expected prepandemic levels by May 2020. In the early phase of the pandemic, waitlist inactivation and removals due to death or deteriorating condition rose above expected values by 152% and 189%, respectively. There was a statistically significant decrease in new waitlist additions (IRR 0.49 0.65 0.85) and LDKT (IRR 0.17 0.38 0.84) in states with high vs. low COVID activity. Transplant recipients during the pandemic were more likely to have received a DDKT, but had similar calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) values, waitlist time, and cause of kidney failure as before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic initially reduced access to kidney transplantation among pediatric patients in the USA but has not had a sustained effect.","Charnaya, Olga; Chiang, Teresa Po-Yu; Wang, Richard; Motter, Jennifer D; Boyarsky, Brian J; King, Elizabeth A; Werbel, William A; Durand, Christine M; Avery, Robin K; Segev, Dorry L; Massie, Allan B; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M",Pediatr. nephrol,,435

Furthermore, this study investigated how social support, as a factor that reduces depression among older adults, mediates the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation. METHODS: Based on a survey of 260 older adults in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, suicidal ideation, depression, and social support were evaluated using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Measurement of Social Support in the Elderly, respectively. RESULTS: A multiple regression analysis confirmed that depression and social support were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. Based on path analysis, we found that social support mediated the relationship between depression and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, this study provides concrete insights for policymakers and social workers about how suicidal ideation among older adults may be diminished. Particularly, the role of depression and social support in suicidal ideation is a matter of concern for older adults in South Korea.","Kim, Bum Jung; Kihl, Taesuk",BMC Psychiatry,,435
482795,A word of caution and call for cross-society collaboration to develop surgical guidance about COVID-19,2020,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly, inducing a progressive growth in infected patients number. Social isolation (lockdown) has been assessed to prevent and control virus diffusion, leading to a worldwide financial and political crisis. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasopharyngeal swab takes place by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). However, molecular tests can give some false-negative results. In this context, serological assays can be useful to detect IgG/IgM antibodies, to assess the degree of immunization, to trace the contacts, and to support the decision to re-admit people at work. A lot of serological diagnostic kits have been proposed on the market but validation studies have not been published for many of them. The aim of our work was to compare and to evaluate different assays analytical performances (two different immunochromatographic cards, an immunofluorescence chromatographic card, and a chemiluminescence-automated immunoassay) on 43 positive samples with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 negative control subjects. Our data display excellent IgG/IgM specificities for all the immunocromatographic card tests (100% IgG and 100% IgM) and for the chemiluminescence-automated assay (100% IgG and 94% IgM); IgG/IgM sensitivities are moderately lower for all methods, probably due to the assay viral antigen's nature and/or to the detection time of nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, with respect to symptoms onset. Given that sensitivities (around 94% and 84% for IgG and IgM, respectively) implicate false-negative cases and given the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the only currently available procedure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission is to identify and isolate persons who are contagious. For this reason, we would like to submit a flowchart in which serological tests, integrated with nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR, are included to help social and work activities implementation after the pandemic acute phase and to overcome lockdown.","Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Grelli, Sandro; Ciotti, Marco; Miano, Roberto; Andreoni, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",Cell Death Discov,,435

483064,Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the fracture demographics: Data from a tertiary care hospital in Turkey,2020,"A widespread increase in forest cover is underway in northern Mediterranean forests because of land abandonment and decreased wood demand, but the resilience of these successional forests to climate change remains unresolved. Here we use 18-year time series of canopy greenness derived from satellite imagery (NDVI) to evaluate the impacts of climate change on Spain's forests. Specifically, we analyzed how NDVI was influenced by the climatic water balance (i.e. Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, SPEI), using monthly time-series extracted from 3,100 pixels of forest, categorized into ten forest types. The forests increased in leaf area index by 0.01 per year on average (from 1.7 in 2000 to 1.9 in 2017) but there was enormous variation among years related to climatic water balance. Forest types varied in response to drought events: those dominated by drought-avoiding species showed strong covariance between greenness and SPEI, while those dominated by drought-tolerant species showed weak covariance. Native forests usually recovered more than 80% of greenness within the 18 months and the remainder within 5 years, but plantations of Eucalyptus were less resilient. Management to increase the resilience of forests-a key goal of forestry in the Mediterranean region-appears to have had a positive effect: canopy greenness within protected forests was more resilient to drought than within non-protected forests. In conclusion, many of Spain's successional forests have been resilient to drought over the past 18 years, from the perspective of space. Future studies will need to combine remote sensing with field-based analyses of physiological tolerances and mortality processes to understand how Mediterranean forests will respond to the rapid climate change predicted for this region in the coming decades.","Khoury, Sacha; Coomes, David A",,,435
483643,"Grace, Connection, and Hard Conversations: Primary Care Geriatrics in the COVID Era",2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multi-systemic infection caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that has become a pandemic. Although its prevailing symptoms include anosmia, ageusia, dry couch, fever, shortness of brief, arthralgia, myalgia, and fatigue, regional and methodological assessments vary, leading to heterogeneous clinical descriptions of COVID-19. Aging, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and exposure to androgens have been correlated with worse prognosis in COVID-19. Abnormalities in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the androgen-driven transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) have been elicited as key modulators of SARS-CoV-2. MAIN TEXT: While safe and effective therapies for COVID-19 lack, the current moment of pandemic urges for therapeutic options. Existing drugs should be preferred over novel ones for clinical testing due to four inherent characteristics: 1. Well-established long-term safety profile, known risks and contraindications; 2. More accurate predictions of clinical effects; 3. Familiarity of clinical management; and 4. Affordable costs for public health systems. In the context of the key modulators of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, endocrine targets have become central as candidates for COVID-19. The only endocrine or endocrine-related drug class with already existing emerging evidence for COVID-19 is the glucocorticoids, particularly for the use of dexamethasone for severely affected patients. Other drugs that are more likely to present clinical effects despite the lack of specific evidence for COVID-19 include anti-androgens (spironolactone, eplerenone, finasteride and dutasteride), statins, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and direct TMPRSS-2 inhibitors (nafamostat and camostat). Several other candidates show less consistent plausibility. In common, except for dexamethasone, all candidates have no evidence for COVID-19, and clinical trials are needed. CONCLUSION: While dexamethasone may reduce mortality in severely ill patients with COVID-19, in the absence of evidence of any specific drug for mild-to-moderate COVID-19, researchers should consider testing existing drugs due to their favorable safety, familiarity, and cost profile. However, except for dexamethasone in severe COVID-19, drug treatments for COVID-19 patients must be restricted to clinical research studies until efficacy has been extensively proven, with favorable outcomes in terms of reduction in hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death.","Cadegiani, Flavio A",BMC Endocr Disord,,435

We examined the relationship between the COVID-19 outbreak and suicide attempts in Okayama, Japan using information from emergency dispatches. METHODS: This was a descriptive epidemiological study. We collected information on emergency dispatches in Okayama City and Kibichuo from March to August in 2018, 2019 and 2020 (n = 47,770 cases). We compared emergency dispatches and their demographic characteristics, especially focusing on suicide attempts, during these 3 years. RESULTS: The number of emergency dispatches in 2020 decreased compared with the previous 2 years, while the number and proportion of emergency dispatches related to suicide attempts increased. This increase was more pronounced among women and those aged 25-49 years. Among women aged 25-49 years, there was a cumulative total of 43 suicide attempts in 2018 and 2019 and 73 suicide attempts in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The number and proportion of emergency dispatches related to suicide attempts increased in 2020 compared with the previous 2 years, especially among women and those aged 25-49 years. This increase may be partly explained by hardships such as economic losses or reduced social ties during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Habu, Hiroshi; Takao, Soshi; Fujimoto, Ryohei; Naito, Hiromichi; Nakao, Atsunori; Yorifuji, Takashi",J. epidemiol,,435

As the amount of spatial data being produced has increased, coupled with increasingly complex software solutions being developed, there is a need for platforms that address these needs. In this paper, we present a distributed and light streaming system for combating pandemics and give a case study on spatial analysis of the COVID-19 geo-tagged Twitter dataset. In this system, three of the major components are the translation of tweets matching with user-defined bounding boxes, name entity recognition in tweets, and skyline queries. Apache Pulsar addresses all these components in this paper. With the proposed system, end-users have the capability of getting COVID-19 related information within foreign regions, filtering/searching location, organization, person, and miscellaneous based tweets, and performing skyline based queries. The evaluation of the proposed system is done based on certain characteristics and performance metrics. The study differs greatly from other studies in terms of using distributed computing and big data technologies on spatial data to combat COVID-19.

It was first identified in Wuhan, China, and has since spread causing a global pandemic. Various studies have been performed to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral infection for predicting drug repurposing candidates. However, such information is spread across many publications and it is very time-consuming to access, integrate, explore, and exploit. We developed CoVex, the first interactive online platform for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 host interactome exploration and drug (target) identification. CoVex integrates 1) experimentally validated virus-human protein interactions, 2) human protein-protein interactions and 3) drug-target interactions. The web interface allows user-friendly visual exploration of the virus-host interactome and implements systems medicine algorithms for network-based prediction of drugs. Thus, CoVex is an important resource, not only to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pathogenicity, but also in clinical research for the identification and prioritization of candidate therapeutics. We apply CoVex to investigate recent hypotheses on a systems biology level and to systematically explore the molecular mechanisms driving the virus life cycle. Furthermore, we extract and discuss drug repurposing candidates involved in these mechanisms. CoVex renders COVID-19 drug research systems-medicine-ready by giving the scientific community direct access to network medicine algorithms integrating virus-host-drug interactions.

In addition, they collated all relevant information about each case.Results The authors described a case history in which oral symptoms were observed which included dry mouth, acute dysgeusia, mild pain and burning sensation in lower lip mucosa, then after two days, vesicles appeared in the same region with simultaneous systemic symptoms of COVID-19. The patient reported a previous history of herpetic infections. After seven days, oral lesions were healed and systemic symptoms regressed on day 14.Literature review Seventeen studies reporting 226 confirmed cases, and the case reported by the review authors, were included. The age range was between 9-90 years. More than 170 cases developed oral manifestations. The most common oral manifestations were dry mouth (n = 75), dysgeusia (n = 71) and pseudomembranous fungal structure (n = 67). Changes in tongue sensation (n = 48) and ulceration (n = 28), muscle pain during mastication (n = 15), swelling in the oral cavity (n = 10) and herpetic lesions (n = 6) were other common symptoms. The mean onset time of the oral manifestation was 7.21 days after systemic symptoms (range: 10-42 days). In 42 cases, oral lesions resolved spontaneously or with some basic treatment within three weeks.Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 may present oral manifestations during their course of the disease; however, we do not know if there is a causal relationship between COVID-19 and these manifestations or not.","Sofi-Mahmudi, Ahmad",Evid Based Dent,,435

However, such association may be modified by possible baseline differences in glycemic control between insulin users and non-insulin users. Misinterpretation of the association between insulin treatment and mortality could lead to confusion in clinical practice and hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for whom insulin treatment is appropriately indicated may be omitted from such treatment. However, requirement for insulin during hospitalization for COVID-19 may be a marker of poor prognosis and as such could be used to identify patient population who require more aggressive treatments to prevent mortality.","Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Endocr Res,,435

CT identified extensive thrombus formation on the valve struts. This demonstrated complete resolution at 11 weeks with warfarin therapy. Although venous thromboembolism is now well-documented in COVID-19 patients, this case highlights the increased risks of systemic arterial embolism following recent cardiac procedures; it also serves as a timely reminder of the consequences of COVID-19 and the radiological vigilance required in identifying AVR thrombosis on acute cardiothoracic CT.

488350,Elective surgery cancellations due to the COVID-19 pandemic: global predictive modelling to inform surgical recovery plans,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nutrition education programs in schools have been effective in improving children's knowledge and behaviours related to food and nutrition. However, teachers find it challenging to implement such programs due to overcrowded curricula. Integrating nutrition with core subjects such as mathematics could potentially address time constraints and improve the learning of both. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the impact of a cross-curricular nutrition and mathematics program on primary school students' portion size estimation skills. Secondary aims include impact on their nutrition knowledge, attitudes towards mathematics and evaluating the quality of the lessons. METHODS: Twelve Year 3-4 classes from Catholic schools in New South Wales, Australia will be randomised to intervention (n = 6) or control (n = 6) groups. Teachers in the intervention group will receive a professional development workshop and resources to teach 4-5 lessons on portion size and measurements across 1-4 weeks. Outcome measures include portion size estimation skills, nutrition knowledge and attitudes towards mathematics, with data collected during three school visits (pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, 4 weeks post-intervention). Additionally, teaching quality will be assessed in both intervention and control groups and process evaluation undertaken using teacher interviews and student focus groups. DISCUSSION: This RCT uses an innovative approach to improve both nutrition and mathematics related learning outcomes among primary school children. It has the potential to impact teaching practices regarding integration of nutrition into curricula and enhance the implementation of nutrition education interventions.

The aim of this review was to conduct the first review of the literature regarding post-traumatic growth among adolescents (ages 12-18) to determine whether there is empirical evidence of adolescent post-traumatic growth. Results of the review, conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, are reported to (1) summarize existing support for adolescent post-traumatic growth within available empirical literature, (2) discuss potential moderators of adolescent post-traumatic growth occurrence, and (3) review existing measures of post-traumatic growth. Evidence of adolescent post-traumatic growth was found within three studies with correlational designs and two studies with longitudinal designs. The majority of the literature regarding adolescent post-traumatic growth provides initial support in the form of correlational evidence; however, such support is difficult to empirically establish given the lack of longitudinal studies in this area.

We assessed the quality of life of invasively ventilated COVID-19 ARDS survivors. METHODS: We carried out a prospective follow-up study of the patients admitted to the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) of a teaching hospital. Patients affected by COVID-19 ARDS who required invasive ventilation and were successfully discharged home were assessed through the telephone administration of validated tests. We explored survival, functional outcomes, return to work, quality of life, cognitive and psychological sequelae. The main variables of interest were the following: demographics, severity scores, laboratory values, comorbidities, schooling, working status, treatments received during ICU stay, complications, and psychological, cognitive, functional outcomes. RESULTS: Out of 116 consecutive invasively ventilated patients, overall survival was 65/116 (56%) with no death occurring after hospital discharge. Forty-two patients were already discharged home with a median follow-up time of 61 (51-71) days after ICU discharge and 39 of them accepted to be interviewed. Only one patient (1/39) experienced cognitive decline. The vast majority of patients reported no difficulty in walking (32/35:82%), self-care (33/39:85%), and usual activities (30/39:78%). All patients were either malnourished (15/39:38%) or at risk for malnutrition (24/39:62%). Exertional dyspnea was present in 20/39 (51%) patients. 19/39 (49%) reported alterations in senses of smell and/or taste either before or after hospitalization.

AIMS: To describe the prevalence of WRMI among O&Gs in Australia and New Zealand, explore risk factors for such injuries, and evaluate their impact. METHODS: An online survey of Fellows of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists was conducted in July 2016. It comprised questions on personal attributes, type of work, site and cause of WRMI, if any and treatment required. RESULTS: We received responses from 765 O&Gs giving a response rate of 38.3% (765/1997). Four hundred and ten specialists (53.6%) reported suffering a WRMI at some point, including 252 (32.9%) who reported multiple injuries. In multivariable analysis, females had increased risk of WRMI (odds ratio (OR): 2.12; 95% CI: 1.54-2.91) and among generalists and subspecialists, gynaecological oncologists had highest risk for WRMI (OR: 3.13; 95% CI: 1.21-8.14). Commonest sites of injury were back (218/633, 34.4%) and shoulder (131/633, 20.7%). Laparoscopic surgery (117/633, 18.5%) was the commonest cause of injury. Treatment was required for 88.6% of injuries (561/633) including 8.4% (53/633) of cases which required surgery. Ongoing symptoms post-injury were reported for 52.1% of injuries (330/633) and in 25.8% (163/633) of instances the practitioner needed to modify their scope of work. CONCLUSION: This survey among a large cohort of O&Gs shows a high prevalence of WRMI with a profound negative impact on the practitioner and profession. There is a pressing need to advocate for improved ergonomics in their workplaces.","Kapoor, Shveta; Mahomed, Kassam; Kapoor, Vishal",Aust. N. Z. j. obstet. gynaecol,,435

The Mental Health Checklist (MHCL) is a measure developed to assess psychological health during extended periods of isolation and confinement, and has shown strong psychometric properties in community samples and during Antarctic missions. This study validated the MHCL in a sample of 359 U.S. and U.K adults during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested model fit, and convergent validity analyses were conducted to compare the MHCL with validated measures of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as insomnia. The MHCL exhibited good model fit for most CFA indices, and showed strong convergent validity with other measures of psychological well-being. Findings suggest that the MHCL is useful for assessing mental health in a variety of environments and conditions.","So, Christine J; Kim, Jinu; Cifre, Anthony B; Gonzalez, Rogelio D; Bower, Joanne L; Alfano, Candice A",,,435

Methods: We have specified a novel multi-parameter generalized logistic growth model, which does not only look at the trend of the data, but also includes explanatory covariates, using a quasi-Poisson regression specification to account for overdispersion of the count data. We fitted our model to data from the onset of the disease (February 28) until September 15. Estimating the parameters from our model, we predicted the growth of the epidemic for the evolution of the disease until the end of October 2020. We also evaluated via simulations different fictional scenarios for the outcome of alternative policies (those analyses are included in the Supplementary Material). Results and Conclusions: The evolution of the disease has not followed an exponential growth, but rather, stabilized and moved downward after July 2020, starting to increase again after the implementation of the Step-by-Step policy. The lockdown policy implemented in the majority of the country has proven effective in stopping the spread, and the lockdown-relaxation policies, however gradual, appear to have caused an upward break in the trend.","Vicuña, María Ignacia; Vásquez, Cristián; Quiroga, Bernardo F",Front Public Health,,435

The aim of the current paper was to investigate the changing role of demographics and co-morbidity, with a particular focus on ethnicity, as risk factors for in-hospital mortality over an extended period. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study using the Hospital Episode Statistics administrative dataset. All patients aged &gt;= 18 years in England with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who had a hospital stay that was completed (discharged alive or died) between 1st March and 30th September 2020 were included. In-hospital mortality was the primary outcome of interest. Multilevel logistic regression was used to model the relationship between in-hospital mortality with adjustment for the covariates: age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, date of discharge and a number of comorbidities. Findings: Compared to patients in March-May (n = 93,379), patients in June-September (n = 24,059) were younger, more likely to be female and of Asian ethnicity, but less likely to be of Black ethnicity. In-hospital mortality rates, adjusted for covariates, declined from 33-34% in March to 11-12% in September. Compared to the March-May period, Bangladeshi, Indian and Other Asian ethnicity patients had a lower relative odds of death (compared to White ethnicity patients) during June-September. For Pakistani patients, the decline in-hospital mortality rates was more modest across the same time periods with the relative odds of death increasing slightly (odds ratio (95% confidence interval)) 1.24 (1.10 to 1.40) and 1.35 (1.08 to 1.69) respectively. From March-May to June-September the relative odds of death in patients with a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma increased (1.90 (1.73 to 2.08) vs 3.01 (2.55 to 3.54)) but decreased for male patients (1.44 (1.39 to 1.49) vs 1.27 (1.17 to 1.38)) and patients with obesity (1.42 (1.34 to 1.52) vs 0.97 (0.83 to 1.14)) and diabetes without complications (1.14 (1.10 to 1.19) vs 0.95 (0.87 to 1.05)). Interpretation: In-hospital mortality rates for patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 have fallen substantially and there is evidence that the relative importance of some covariates has changed since the start of the pandemic. These patterns should continue to be tracked as new variants of the virus emerge, vaccination programmes are rolled out and hospital pressures fluctuate.","Gray, W. K.; Navaratnam, A.

PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 infection (RT -PCR) and lung Computed tomography scan involvement compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients are not severely hypoxic, do not need intubation or invasive oxygenation. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: known hypersensitivity to colchicine; known hepatic failure; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<30 ml/min/1.73m2 (by the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) which estimates GFR based on serum creatinine. ; kidney transplant recipients, using Digoxin, QTc >450 msec. Participants will be recruited from inpatients at Labbafinejad Meidcal Center , Tehran, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Eligible enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A will receive the antiretroviral Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) while group B will receive Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Colchicine 1.5 mg loading then 0.5 mg twice daily orally. All patients in both groups will receive the same amounts of essential minerals, vitamins as antioxidants, and antibiotics. Patients of both groups will be treated under optimal treatment based on the CDC and WHO guidelines and national consensus proposed in Iran including the same dosages of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, antibiotics, trace elements and antioxidants while only in group-B patients Colchicine will be added on top of this protocol. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary: Time for clinical improvement and lung CT score changes 14 days after treatment. Secondary: 14 days after treatment - C-Reactive Protein test x Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio , Interleukin-6, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels reduction - Percentage of patients who require supplemental Oxygen - Mean hospital stay length RANDOMISATION: Patients will be allocated to each group (ratio 1:1) by using an online randomization tool: http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm BLINDING (MASKING): This will be a double-blind study in which participants and those assessing the final outcomes will be blinded to group assignment.

495871,Long term outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients: early learning,2020,"Rethinking cities is now more imperative than ever, as society faces global challenges such as population growth and climate change. The design of cities can not be abstracted from the design of its mobility system, and, therefore, efficient solutions must be found to transport people and goods throughout the city in an ecological way. An autonomous bicycle-sharing system would combine the most relevant benefits of vehicle sharing, electrification, autonomy, and micro-mobility, increasing the efficiency and convenience of bicycle-sharing systems and incentivizing more people to bike and enjoy their cities in an environmentally friendly way. Due to the uniqueness and radical novelty of introducing autonomous driving technology into bicycle-sharing systems and the inherent complexity of these systems, there is a need to quantify the potential impact of autonomy on fleet performance and user experience. This paper presents an ad-hoc agent-based simulator that provides an in-depth understanding of the fleet behavior of autonomous bicycle-sharing systems in realistic scenarios, including a rebalancing system based on demand prediction. In addition, this work describes the impact of different parameters on system efficiency and service quality and quantifies the extent to which an autonomous system would outperform current bicycle-sharing schemes. The obtained results show that with a fleet size three and a half times smaller than a station-based system and eight times smaller than a dockless system, an autonomous system can provide overall improved performance and user experience even with no rebalancing. These findings indicate that the remarkable efficiency of an autonomous bicycle-sharing system could compensate for the additional cost of autonomous bicycles.","S'anchez, Naroa Coretti; Martinez, Inigo; Pastor, Luis Alonso; Larson, Kent",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09694v2.pdf,435

497711,Palliative psychodermatology care during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Myocardial inflammation in COVID-19 has been documented. Its pathogenesis is not fully elucidated, but the two main theories foresee a direct role of ACE2 receptor and a hyperimmune response, which may also lead to isolated presentation of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis. The frequency and prognostic impact of COVID-19-mediated myocarditis is unknown. This review aims to summarise current evidence on this topic. We performed a systematic review of MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (1/12/19-30/09/20). We also searched clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished studies testing therapies with potential implication for COVID-19-mediated cardiovascular complication. Eligible studies had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 and a clinical and/or histological diagnosis of myocarditis by ESC or WHO/ISFC criteria. Reports of 38 cases were included (26 male patients, 24 aged < 50 years). The first histologically proven case was a virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis; however, biopsy evidence of myocarditis secondary to SARS-CoV-2 cardiotropism has been recently demonstrated. Histological data was found in 12 cases (8 EMB and 4 autopsies) and CMR was the main imaging modality to confirm a diagnosis of myocarditis (25 patients). There was a substantial variability in biventricular systolic function during the acute episode and in therapeutic regimen used. Five patients died in hospital. Cause-effect relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and myocarditis is difficult to demonstrate. However, current evidence demonstrates myocardial inflammation with or without direct cardiomyocyte damage, suggesting different pathophysiology mechanisms responsible of COVID-mediated myocarditis. Established clinical approaches should be pursued until future evidence support different actions. Large multicentre registries are advisable to elucidate further.","Castiello, Teresa; Georgiopoulos, Georgios; Finocchiaro, Gherardo; Claudia, Monaco; Gianatti, Andrea; Delialis, Dimitrios; Aimo, Alberto; Prasad, Sanjay",Heart fail. rev,,435

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of EGS patients during the pandemic period. The main outcome was 30-day morbidity and mortality according to severity and COVID-19 infection status. Secondary outcomes were changes in overall management. A logistic regression analysis was done to assess factors predictive of mortality. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three patients were included. Half of the patients with an abdominal ultrasound and/or CT scan had signs of severity at diagnosis, four times higher than the previous year. Non-COVID patients underwent surgery more often than the COVID group. Over 1/3 of 100 operated patients had postoperative morbidity, versus only 15% the previous year. The most common complications were septic shock, pneumonia, and ARDS. ICU care was required in 17% of patients, and was most often required in the SARS-CoV-2-infected group, which also had a higher morbidity and mortality. The 30-day mortality in the surgical series was of 7%, with no differences with the previous year. The strongest independent predictors of overall mortality were age > 70 years, ASA III-IV, ESS > 9, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Non-operative management (NOM) was undertaken in a third of patients, and only 14% of operated patients had a perioperative confirmation of -CoV-2 infection. The severity and morbidity of COVID-19-infected patients was much higher. Late presentations for medical care may have added to the high morbidity of the series.","María, Fernández-Martínez; Lorena, Martín-Román; María Luz, Fernández-Vázquez; Cristina, Rey-Valcarcel; Dolores, Pérez-Díaz; Fernando, Turégano-Fuentes",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,,435

There has been a paucity of data regarding trainee perceptions regarding quickly developed new methods of learning during the pandemic. This study explored PRM trainee perceptions of e-learning and effects of the pandemic on education. METHODS: Questionnaire study with data collected via REDCap. RESULTS: Greater than half of PRM trainees (56.6%, 30/53) responded. Most respondents reported that the virtual lectures series (79.3%), journal club (78.9%), and virtual arts initiatives (75.0%) were valuable to their education. Common benefits noted included access to subject experts, networking, lecture recording, and location flexibility. Common concerns included lack of protected time, virtual platform fatigue, and decreased engagement. Most respondents were not redeployed. Relative to before the pandemic, less satisfaction with clinical education (70.0%) and greater satisfaction with non-clinical education (60.0%) was reported. The majority of graduating trainees felt positively (83.3%) and 16.7% were neutral regarding confidence to graduate. CONCLUSION: Trainees perceived national e-learning as valuable to their education, especially due to the access to expert leaders around the nation. Future work should explore ways to overcome barriers and optimize benefits of GME and PRM e-learning.","Kivlehan, Emily; Chaviano, Kelli; Fetsko, Lauren; Javaid, Simra; Chandan, Priya; Rojas, Ana-Marie; Dubon, Mary E",J Pediatr Rehabil Med,,435

EXAMINATION AND DIAGNOSIS: On admission, the patient had subfebrile temperatures, exercise dyspnea, and right-basal rales. CRP was moderately elevated and oxygen saturation was slightly reduced. Thoracic CT showed bilateral ground-glass infiltrates. Immediately after the cruise a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2. THERAPY AND COURSE: Due to the fact that the patient's asymptomatic wife had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 immediately after returning from the cruise, we suspected COVID-19 disease and admitted the patient to our isolation ward. Two nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchial lavage yielded negative results for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, suspected COVID-19 diagnosis was verified serologically. CONCLUSION: In case of a high degree of clinical suspicion in combination with typical findings of thoracic imaging, the suspected diagnosis COVID-19 disease should be maintained even in case of multiple negative SARS-CoV-2-PCR. Seroconversion occurs a few days to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms and can be used to confirm the diagnosis.","Dubbke-Laule, Alexandra; Gnauck, Manuela; Straub, Ralf; Berthold, Frank; Jenssen, Christian",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,435

In this study, we propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict the possible conversion time that the patient would spend to convert to the severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem of imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity regularization term to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data and learn the shared information across the classification task and the regression task.

Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with 422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared to all comparison methods.

508904,Social restrictions during COVID-19 and major trauma volume at a level 1 trauma centre,2020,"Objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a shortage of medical resources, including ventilators, personal protective equipment, medical staff, and hospital beds. We investigated the impact of COVID-19 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, their families, caregivers, and medical experts. Methods We conducted a nationwide ALS webinar about COVID-19 in May 2020 and sent a questionnaire to those enrolled. Results A total of 135 participants (31 ALS patients; 23 families and caregivers of ALS patients; 81 medical experts) responded to this cross-sectional self-report questionnaire. The results showed that tracheostomy and invasive ventilation (TIV) was used in 22.6% of ALS patients, whereas 77.4% of ALS patients were not under TIV. Among non-TIV patients (n=24), 79.2% did not want TIV in the future. However, 47.4% of non-TIV patients not wanting a tracheostomy in advanced stages replied that they would want an emergency tracheostomy if they developed COVID-19-related pneumonia. These results suggest that ALS patients may be receptive to emergency treatments for reasons other than ALS. In addition, approximately half of the ALS patients agreed with the policy of not ventilating the elderly or ALS patients in case of a ventilator shortage.

Few cases of presumed in utero vertical transmission of the virus from infected mothers to fetuses have been reported, but stronger evidence is needed, from larger datasets with multiple biospecimens rigorously analyzed. Whether acquired before or after birth, SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates can be symptomatic, but our comprehension of neonatal immune response and the subsequent clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in early life are incomplete. Finally, the pandemic challenged several dogmas regarding the management of mother-infant dyads, and again more robust data are needed to support the formulation of evidence-based guidelines. Here, we briefly summarize existing evidence and key unresolved questions about SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in the neonatal period.","Pietrasanta, Carlo; Ronchi, Andrea; Schena, Federico; Ballerini, Claudia; Testa, Lea; Artieri, Giacomo; Mercadante, Domenica; Mosca, Fabio; Pugni, Lorenza",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,,435

Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of circulating neutrophils from children with COVID-19. METHODS: An observational study including 182 children with COVID-19, 21 children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and 40 healthy children was performed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Neutrophil phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry in blood samples. Cytokine production, plasma levels of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and citrullinated histone H3 were measured by ELISA. Cell-free DNA was quantified by fluorometry. FINDINGS: Compared with healthy controls, neutrophils from children with COVID-19 showed a lower expression of CD11b, CD66b, and L-selectin but a higher expression of the activation markers HLA-DR, CD64 and PECAM-1 and the inhibitory receptors LAIR-1 and PD-L1. No differences in the production of cytokines and NETs were observed. Interestingly, the expression of CD64 in neutrophils and the serum concentration of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 distinguished asymptomatic from mild and moderate COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Acute lung injury is a prominent feature of severe COVID-19 in adults. A low expression of adhesion molecules together with a high expression of inhibitory receptors in neutrophils from children with COVID-19 might prevent tissue infiltration by neutrophils preserving lung function. FUNDING: This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion, IP-COVID-19-0277 and PMO BID PICT 2018-2548), and University of Buenos Aires from Argentina (20020170100573BA).","Seery, Vanesa; Raiden, Silvina C; Algieri, Silvia C; Grisolía, Nicolás A; Filippo, Daniela; De Carli, Norberto; Di Lalla, Sandra; Cairoli, Héctor; Chiolo, María J; Meregalli, Claudia N; Gimenez, Lorena I; Gregorio, Gabriela; Sarli, Mariam; Alcalde, Ana L; Davenport, Carolina; Bruera, María J; Simaz, Nancy; Pérez, Mariela F; Nivela, Valeria; Bayle, Carola; Tuccillo, Patricia; Agosta, María T; Pérez, Hernán; Villa Nova, Susana; Suárez, Patricia; Takata, Eugenia M; García, Mariela; Lattner, Jorge; Rolón, María J; Coll, Patricia; Sananez, Inés; Holgado, María P; Ferrero, Fernando; Geffner, Jorge; Arruvito, Lourdes",EBioMedicine,,435

Although research identified poor mental health of medical workers in COVID-19, protective factors for their mental health remain to be appraised. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate relationships between mental health problems, loneliness, hope and self-compassion among Japanese medical workers, and compare with the general population. Online self-report measures regarding those four constructs were completed by 142 medical workers and 138 individuals in the general population. T-tests and multiple regression analysis were performed. Medical workers had higher levels of mental health problems and loneliness, and lower levels of hope and self-compassion than the general population. Loneliness was the strongest predictor of mental health problems in the medical workers. Findings suggest that Japanese medical workplaces may benefit from targeting workplace loneliness to prevent mental health problems among the medical staff.","Kotera, Yasuhiro; Ozaki, Akihiko; Miyatake, Hirotomo; Tsunetoshi, Chie; Nishikawa, Yoshitaka; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",Curr Psychol,,435

512610,Cognition and Daily Functioning: Results from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL) and Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA),2020,"Objectives: COVID-19 can lead to a hyperinflammatory state. CD6 is a glycoprotein expressed on mature T lymphocytes which is a crucial regulator of the T-cell activation. Itolizumab is a humanised antibody targeting CD6. Nonclinical and clinical data in autoimmune diseases indicate that it lowers multiple cytokines primarily involving the Th1/Th17 pathway. The primary objective of this study was to assess the impact of itolizumab in arresting the lung function deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Secondary objectives included safety, duration of ventilation, 14-day mortality and evaluation of interleukin 6 concentration. Methods: Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 received itolizumab in combination with other therapies included in the national protocol for COVID-19. Results: Seventy critical, severe or moderate patients were treated with itolizumab in 10 Cuban hospitals. Median age was 68, and 94% had comorbidities. After 72 h, most patients improved the PO2/FiO2 ratio and reduced FiO2 requirements. Ventilation time was 8 days for critical and 1 day for severe cases. Ten patients had related adverse events while 3 subjects developed related serious events. In 30 patients, interleukin 6 decreased in individuals with high level and did not change in those with lower concentration. Fourteen-day lethality rate was 4% and 18% for moderate and severe patients, respectively. The proportion of moderate or severe patients with ventilation or death at day 14 was 9.8%. Time to treatment, neurological manifestations and biomarkers such as NLR were significantly associated with higher lethality. Conclusions: The opportune administration of itolizumab might interrupt the hyperinflammatory cascade and prevent COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.","Caballero, Armando; Filgueira, Lázaro M; Betancourt, Julio; Sánchez, Naivy; Hidalgo, Carlos; Ramírez, Alberto; Martinez, Alejandro; Despaigne, Rolando E; Escalona, Alberto; Diaz, Henrry; Meriño, Elio; Ortega, Lilia M; Castillo, Ulises; Ramos, Mayra; Saavedra, Danay; García, Yanelda; Lorenzo, Geydi; Cepeda, Meylán; Arencibia, Maylén; Cabrera, Leticia; Domecq, Milagros; Estévez, Daymys; Valenzuela, Carmen; Lorenzo, Patricia; Sánchez, Lizet; Mazorra, Zaima; León, Kalet; Crombet, Tania",Clin Transl Immunology,,435

We have used a model-based approach to explore the relative impact of alternative dosing regimens proposed in different dosing protocols for hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19. METHODS: We compared different PK exposures using Monte Carlo simulations based on a previously published population pharmacokinetic model in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, externally validated using both independent data in lupus erythematous patients and recent data in French COVID-19 patients. Clinical efficacy and safety information from COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ were used to contextualize and assess the actual clinical value of the model predictions. RESULTS: Literature and observed clinical data confirm the variability in clinical responses in COVID-19 when treated with the same fixed doses. Confounding factors were identified that should be taken into account for dose recommendation. For 80% of patients, doses higher than 800 mg day on day 1 followed by 600 mg daily on following days might not be needed for being cured. Limited adverse drug reactions have been reported so far for this dosing regimen, most often confounded by co-medications, comorbidities or underlying COVID-19 disease effects. CONCLUSION: Our results were clear, indicating the unmet need for characterization of target PK exposures to inform HCQ dosing optimization in COVID-19. Dosing optimization for HCQ in COVID-19 is still an unmet need. Efforts in this sense are a prerequisite for best benefit/risk balance.","Thémans, Pauline; Dauby, Nicolas; Schrooyen, Loïc; Lebout, Faustine; Delforge, Marc; Nasreddine, Rakan; Libois, Agnès; Payen, Marie-Christine; Konopnicki, Déborah; Wuillaume, Francoise; Lescrainier, Cecile; Verlinden, Veerle; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Hamdani, Jamila; Musuamba, Flora T",,,435

For the first time, this infection was recorded in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Wuhan. The virus presumably crossed the interspecies barrier and passed to humans from a bat. Initially, the disease was considered exclusively in the context of damage to the respiratory system, but it quickly became clear that the disease also entails serious consequences from various systems, including the cardiovascular system. Among these consequences are myocarditis, myocardial damage, subsequent heart failure, myocardial infarction, and Takotsubo syndrome. On the other hand, clinical data indicate that the presence of chronic diseases in a patient aggravates the course and outcome of coronavirus infection. In this context, the relationship between COVID-19 and atherosclerosis, a condition preceding cardiovascular disease and other disorders of the heart and blood vessels, is particularly interesting. The renin-angiotensin system is essential for the pathogenesis of both coronavirus disease and atherosclerosis. In particular, it has been shown that ACE2, an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, plays a key role in Sars-CoV-2 infection due to its receptor activity. It is noteworthy that this enzyme is important for the normal functioning of the cardiovascular system. Disruptions in its production and functioning can lead to various disorders, including atherosclerosis.","Poznyak, Anastasia V; Bezsonov, Evgeny E; Eid, Ali H; Popkova, Tatyana V; Nedosugova, Ludmila V; Starodubova, Antonina V; Orekhov, Alexander N",Int. j. mol. sci.

Both types of media also contained an appropriately prepared vector system pGEM-5Zf (+) based on the lactose operon (beta-galactosidase system). Incubation was carried out on both types of media for 24 h with the addition of 200 μL of Salistat SGL03 solution in order to test its inhibitory effect on the coronavirus contained in the oral mucosa and nasopharynx, visible as light blue virus particles on the test plates, which gradually disappeared in the material collected from infected persons over time. Regardless of the conducted experiments, swabs were additionally taken from the nasopharynx of infected and healthy people after rinsing the throat and oral mucosa with Salistat SGL03. In both types of experiments, after 24 h of incubation on appropriate media with biological material, we did not find any virus particles. Results were also confirmed by MIC and MBC tests. Results prove that lactoferrin, as one of the ingredients of the preparation, is probably a factor that blocks the attachment of virus particles to the host cells, determining its anti-viral properties. The conducted preliminary experiments constitute a very promising model for further research on the anti-viral properties of the ingredients contained in the Salistat SGL03 dietary supplement.","Kucia, Marzena Wietrak Ewa Szymczak Mateusz Majchrzak Michał Kowalczyk Paweł",Materials,,435

Can a combination of Histamine-1 and Histamine-2 receptor blockers improve COVID-19 inpatient outcomes? METHODS: A physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine was performed in hospitalized patients with severe to critical pulmonary symptoms. Pulmonologists led the inpatient care in a single medical center of 110 high-acuity patients that were treated with cetirizine 10 mg b.i.d. and famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. plus standard-of-care. RESULTS: Of all patients, including those with Do Not Resuscitate directives, receiving the dual-histamine receptor blockade for at least 48 h, the combination drug treatment resulted in a 16.4% rate of intubation, a 7.3% rate of intubation after a minimum of 48 h of treatment, a 15.5% rate of inpatient mortality, and 11.0 days duration of hospitalization. The drug combination exhibited beneficial reductions in inpatient mortality and symptom progression when compared to published reports of COVID-19 inpatients. Concomitant medications were assessed and hydroxychloroquine was correlated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine provides proof-of-concept of a safe and effective method to reduce the progression in symptom severity, presumably by minimizing the histamine-mediated cytokine storm. Further clinical studies in COVID-19 are warranted of the repurposed off-label combination of two historically-safe histamine receptor blockers.","Hogan Ii, Reed B; Hogan Iii, Reed B; Cannon, Tim; Rappai, Maria; Studdard, John; Paul, Doug; Dooley, Thomas P",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,,435

Here we describe a metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma patient with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection while receiving pembrolizumab. Case presentation: A 66-year-old man, with a metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma receiving pembrolizumab, presented with fever. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed pulmonary ground-glass opacities, suggesting viral or immuno-related etiology. On day 7, the patient was hospitalized due to dyspnea and worsening of the radiological findings. Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing confirmed COVID-19. The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. Hydroxychloroquine was administered for 5 days, but discontinued after supraventricular extrasystoles. Clinical improvement allowed the patient's discharge after 81 days of hospitalization. Conclusion: A careful evaluation of oncologic patients receiving immunotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic is of utmost importance.","da Costa, Cesar Martins; de Souza, Zenaide Silva; Real Salgues, Alessandra Corte; Harada, Guilherme; Marino Rodrigues Ayres, Pedro Paulo; Vieira Nunes, Daniela Bulhões; Katz, Artur; Munhoz, Rodrigo Ramella",Immunotherapy,,435

METHODS: After systematically searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 retrospective, 6 prospective observational, and 2 cross-sectional studies was performed according to the guidelines of PRISMA. RESULTS: Overall, 4382 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included. Males accounted for significantly more patients than did females (OR 1.59; 95%CI 1.25-2.02) (P<.001). The total incidence of VTE among COVID-19 patients was 28.3 % (95%CI 21.6-35.4), with an incidence of 38.0% (95%CI 29.1-47.4) and 17.2% (95%CI 11.4-23.8) among severe COVID-19 cases and general cases, respectively. The total incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of lower extremities was 18.3% (95%CI 10.8-27.2), and the occurrence of DVT was 22.1% (95%CI 11.0-35.5) and 12.8% (95%CI 5.0-23.3) in severe and general cases, respectively. The total incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was 17.6% (95%CI 12.3-23.5), with a rate of 21.7% (95%CI 14.8-29.3) in severe cases and 12.5% (95%CI 6.1-23.5) in general cases. When COVID-19 severity is unclassified, mortality in patients with VTE was not significantly higher (25.2%; 95%CI 12.2-40.5) than that in those with no VTE (10.2%; 95%CI 3.4-19.5) (odd ratios:1.88(0.46, 7.64), P= .377). However, among patients with severe COVID-19, those who had VTE had a significantly higher mortality rate than did those without VTE (OR 2.02; (95%CI 1.15-3.53), P= .014). COVID-19 patients with VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels than did patients with no VTE in multiple studies. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of VTE, DVT, and PE is substantial among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, especially severe COVID-19 patients. Severe COVID-19 patients with VTE have significantly higher mortality rate than do patients without VTE. Increased values of D-dimer may be indicators of the occurrence of VTE in COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Yandong; Cai, Jiawei; Wang, Chao; Jin, Jie; Qu, Lefeng",J. Vasc. Surg. Venous Lymphat. Disord,,435

Human activities, especially at the wildlife interphase, are at the core of forces driving the emergence of new viral agents. Global surveillance activities have identified bats as the natural hosts of diverse coronaviruses, with other domestic and wildlife animal species possibly acting as intermediate or spillover hosts. The African continent is confronted by several factors that challenge prevention and response to novel disease emergences, such as high species diversity, inadequate health systems, and drastic social and ecosystem changes. We reviewed published animal coronavirus surveillance studies conducted in Africa, specifically summarizing surveillance approaches, species numbers tested, and findings. Far more surveillance has been initiated among bat populations than other wildlife and domestic animals, with nearly 26,000 bat individuals tested. Though coronaviruses have been identified from approximately 7% of the total bats tested, surveillance among other animals identified coronaviruses in less than 1%. In addition to a large undescribed diversity, sequences related to four of the seven human coronaviruses have been reported from African bats. The review highlights research gaps and the disparity in surveillance efforts between different animal groups (particularly potential spillover hosts) and concludes with proposed strategies for improved future biosurveillance.","Geldenhuys, Marike; Mortlock, Marinda; Epstein, Jonathan H; Paweska, Janusz T; Weyer, Jacqueline; Markotter, Wanda",Viruses,,435

Whether camostat mesylate is able to lower disease burden in coronavirus disease 2019 sepsis is currently unknown. Design: Retrospective observational case series. Setting: Patient treated in ICU of University hospital Göttingen, Germany. Patients: Eleven critical ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients with organ failure were treated in ICU. Interventions: Compassionate use of camostat mesylate (six patients, camostat group) or hydroxychloroquine (five patients, hydroxychloroquine group). Measurements and Main Results: Clinical courses were assessed by Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score at days 1, 3, and 8. Further, viral load, oxygenation, and inflammatory markers were determined. Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score was comparable between camostat and hydroxychloroquine groups upon ICU admission. During observation, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score decreased in the camostat group but remained elevated in the hydroxychloroquine group. The decline in disease severity in camostat mesylate treated patients was paralleled by a decline in inflammatory markers and improvement of oxygenation. Conclusions: The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 decreased upon camostat mesylate treatment within a period of 8 days and a similar effect was not observed in patients receiving hydroxychloroquine. Camostat mesylate thus warrants further evaluation within randomized clinical trials.","Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Moerer, Onnen; Alt-Epping, Sabine; Bräuer, Anselm; Büttner, Benedikt; Müller, Martin; Fricke, Torben; Grundmann, Julian; Harnisch, Lars-Olav; Heise, Daniel; Kernchen, Andrea; Pressler, Meike; Stephani, Caspar; Tampe, Björn; Kaul, Artur; Gärtner, Sabine; Kramer, Stefanie; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Winkler, Martin Sebastian",Crit Care Explor,,435

METHODS: This was an observational retrospective study of hospitalised patients treated with baricitinib for severe COVID-19. Outcomes were clinical improvement on an ordinal scale of 1–8 on day 1 of baricitinib compared with day 14 (where 8=death and 1=not hospitalised with no limitations of activities), overall survival, time to recovery since baricitinib treatment started (days until hospital discharge) and laboratory parameters related to COVID-19 poor prognosis. Adverse events related to baricitinib during the admission period were also reported. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (70% men, mean age 70 years (IQR 54–79)) treated with baricitinib daily for 6 days (IQR 5–7) were included. Thirty-six patients were treated with corticosteroids (84%). Clinical improvement was 3 points (IQR 1–4) in patients on an ordinal scale of 4–6, overall survival was 100% at day 30 and day 60 with a mean time to recovery of 12 days (IQR 9–25) from start of baricitinib treatment.

Herd prevalence was found to be 91.7% (11/12 herds) for Giardia and 58.3% (7/12 herds) for Cryptosporidium. Regarding the age of the animals, although Giardia was detected in animals as young as 1 week, the prevalence increased with age, reaching 80% by 8 weeks. Similarly, the highest percentage of Cryptosporidium detection (20%) was also found in the 8 week-old group. By PCR, 92 of the 274 analysed samples were positive for Giardia. Sequencing of the amplicons showed the existence of Giardia duodenalis assemblage A in 67 samples; G. duodenalis assemblage E in 24 samples; and inconsistent results between the two molecular markers used in a further sample.

The reliability of HTS workflows from sample preparation to data analysis and results interpretation for plant virus detection and identification must be evaluated (verified and validated) to approve this tool for diagnostics. Many different extraction methods, library preparation protocols, and sequence and bioinformatic pipelines are available for virus sequence detection. To assess the performance of plant virology diagnostic laboratories in using the HTS of ribosomal RNA depleted total RNA (ribodepleted totRNA) as a diagnostic tool, we carried out an interlaboratory comparison study in which eight participants were required to use the same samples, (RNA) extraction kit, ribosomal RNA depletion kit, and commercial sequencing provider, but also their own bioinformatics pipeline, for analysis. The accuracy of virus detection ranged from 65% to 100%. The false-positive detection rate was very low and was related to the misinterpretation of results as well as to possible cross-contaminations in the lab or sequencing provider. The bioinformatic pipeline used by each laboratory influenced the correct detection of the viruses of this study. The main difficulty was the detection of a novel virus as its sequence was not available in a publicly accessible database at the time. The raw data were reanalysed using Virtool to assess its ability for virus detection. All virus sequences were detected using Virtool in the different pools. This study revealed that the ribodepletion target enrichment for sample preparation is a reliable approach for the detection of plant viruses with different genomes. A significant level of virology expertise is needed to correctly interpret the results. It is also important to improve and complete the reference data.","Gaafar, Yahya Z.

Here, we examined the effect of vitamin C on human bronchial epithelium transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B (BEAS-2B) cells, and observed that sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) was the primary vitamin C transporter. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that treating BEAS-2B cells with vitamin C led to a significant upregulation of several metabolic pathways and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) along with a downregulation of pathways involved in lung injury and inflammation. Remarkably, vitamin C also enhanced the expression of the viral-sensing receptors retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), which was confirmed at the protein and functional levels. In addition, the lungs of l-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase knockout (GULO-KO) mice also displayed a marked decrease in these genes compared to wild-type controls. Collectively, our findings indicate that vitamin C acts at multiple levels to exert its antiviral and protective functions in the lungs.","Teafatiller, Trevor; Agrawal, Sudhanshu; De Robles, Gabriela; Rahmatpanah, Farah; Subramanian, Veedamali S.; Agrawal, Anshu",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439814/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biom11081148,435

RESULTS: Lymphoma complicated non clonal enteropathy, celiac disease (n = 15) and type I refractory celiac disease (n = 2) in 17 patients and clonal type II refractory celiac disease in 20 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery with resection of the main tumour mass in 22 cases. In univariate analysis, non clonal celiac disease, serum albumin level > 21.6 g/L at diagnosis, chemotherapy and surgical resection predicted good survival (p = 0.0007, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, serum albumin level > 21.6 g/L, chemotherapy and reductive surgery were all significantly associated with increased survival (p < 0.002, p < 0.03, p < 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underlines the prognostic value of celiac disease type in patients with T-cell lymphoma, and suggests that a combination of nutritional, chemotherapy and reductive surgery may improve survival.","Malamut, Georgia; Chandesris, Olivia; Verkarre, Virginie; Meresse, Bertrand; Callens, Céline; Macintyre, Elizabeth; Bouhnik, Yoram; Gornet, Jean-Marc; Allez, Matthieu; Jian, Raymond; Berger, Anne; Châtellier, Gilles; Brousse, Nicole; Hermine, Olivier; Cerf-Bensussan, Nadine; Cellier, Christophe",Dig Liver Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23313469/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1590865812004380; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2012.12.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1590865812004380,435
593748,COVID-19: the implications and consequences of prolonged lockdown and COVID-19 vaccine cost in a low-middle income country,2021-05-19,"INTRODUCTION: As the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading in 2020, the government imposed national lockdowns. We considered the effects these lockdowns had on the paediatric population, with a specific focus on lower limb orthopaedic trauma. We hypothesise that these restrictions will have altered the mechanisms of injury and reduced the number of referrals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 28/08/19 to 01/04/21, considering the variations in referrals and operations during these times, and analysed these data using an online statistical calculator. We examined the rate of referrals, types of fractures referred to the centre, mechanism of injury, volume of operations performed, and average wait times to undergo an operation. The data were compared in pre-lockdown and lockdown times. RESULTS: 67 paediatric patients with lower limb fractures were included in this study. Throughout the lockdown periods, the mean age of children referred was younger (6.9 from 11.1) and they were less likely to be injured as a result of sport (p = 0.0493). They were more likely to fracture their lower leg (p = 0.0016) when compared with other anatomical regions. The average weekly rate of referrals dropped (0.84–0.68), but the rate of operations almost quartered (0.39–0.16). The average wait times for operations dropped significantly, with patients waiting 80% less time from the date of their injury. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the prevalence and management of lower limb paediatric trauma. The demographics and mechanisms of injury which presented to the trust over the pandemic and associated national lockdowns were significantly different. There was a drop in the number of referrals and a preference to non-operative management when patients did present.","Darling, John; Nowicka, Maria; Niazi, Noman; Pillai, Anand",Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34347124/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00402-021-04103-8,435
594033,Use of Ethanol-Based Hand Disinfectants: Source of Increased Ethyl Glucuronide Levels in Hair?,2020-09-22,"Brief description of the primary research objective Among healthcare workers, anesthesiologists are regarded as frequently exposed frontline providers in the fight against COVID-19 due to their proximity to patient airways and involvement in aerosolized procedures. As such, the risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus as an occupational hazard is presumed to be higher. To date, in most published studies, all healthcare workers were grouped together, independent of specialty or profession. At the time that this survey was distributed, we did not find any peer-reviewed articles that differentiated COVID-19 infection rates among frontline, such as anesthesiologists vs. non-frontline healthcare workers. This retrospective survey’s primary research objective was to report the rate of COVID-19 infection among anesthesiologists compared to the general population of healthcare workers. Methodology A survey was sent among anesthesiology attendings and residents in Northern New Jersey and Brooklyn, New York hospitals on duty during the peak pandemic from March 2020 to May 2020. Questions in the survey focused on infection rates and adherence to standards of infection precaution and personal protective equipment (PPE) utilization. Main Findings This retrospective study highlights the rate of infection among anesthesiologists as a particularly vulnerable subgroup of frontline residents and physicians, as they are called to duty when emergent airway management is required. In our study, the reported rate of contracting COVID-19 among anesthesiologists was 16.7%. This statistic is higher than the infection rates published by studies by New York State and the CDC. Conclusion The survey sent to anesthesiologists is useful to understand the impact of COVID-19 on this subgroup of frontline providers and the importance of adhering to standards of infection protocol and the role of PPE.","Yakobi, Michael; Nandigam, Harish; Fallon, James",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408960/,435
594142,COVID-19 pandemic is not the time of trial and error,2020-09-14,"The objective of this longitudinal cohort study was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) in healthcare workers employed at healthcare settings in three rural counties in eastern South Dakota and western Minnesota from May 13, 2020, through December 22, 2020. Three blood draws were performed at five clinical sites and tested for the presence of antibodies against the SARS‐CoV‐2. Serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies using a fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (FMIA), neutralization of SARS‐CoV‐2 spike‐pseudotyped particles (SARS‐CoV‐2pp) assay, and serum virus neutralization (SVN) assay. The seroprevalence was determined to be 1/336 (0.29%) for samples collected from 5/13/20 to 7/13/20, 5/260 (1.92%) for samples collected from 8/13/20 to 9/25/20, and 35/235 (14.89%) for samples collected from 10/16/20 to 12/22/20. Eight of the 35 (22.8%) seropositive individuals identified in the final draw did not report a previous diagnosis with COVID‐19. There was a high correlation (>90%) between the FMIA and virus neutralization assays. Each clinical site's seroprevalence was higher than the cumulative incidence for the general public in the respective county as reported by state public health agencies. As of December 2020, there was a high percentage (85%) of seronegative individuals in the study population.","Neises, Jordan Z.; Hossain, Md.

As people across the country find ways to stay at home, telehealth preserves an opportunity to obtain necessary healthcare services. Further, telehealth can help individuals avoid COVID-19 infection, free up hospital beds and other resources for those patients most in need and prevent infected individuals from spreading that infection. Federal and state regulators have recognized this potential of telehealth and have quickly changed a variety of laws and regulations to enable health care providers to deploy solutions quickly. These changes can provide lasting benefits for the use of telehealth well after the current crisis. However, to best realize telehealth’s benefits further legal and regulatory action are necessary. Specifically, lawmakers and regulators should focus on six areas: reimbursement, privacy/cybersecurity, liability, licensure, technology access, and AI.","Hoffman, David A",J Law Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32843985/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa043,435

595733,Rates of Prenatal Cannabis Use Among Pregnant Women Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Robust serological assays are essential for long-term control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many recently released point-of-care (PoCT) serological assays have been distributed with little premarket validation. METHODS: Performance characteristics for 5 PoCT lateral flow devices approved for use in Australia were compared to a commercial enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and a recently described novel surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). RESULTS: Sensitivities for PoCT ranged from 51.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 43.1%–60.4%) to 67.9% (95% CI, 59.4%–75.6%), and specificities from 95.6% (95% CI, 89.2%–98.8%) to 100.0% (95% CI, 96.1%–100.0%). ELISA sensitivity for IgA or IgG detection was 67.9% (95% CI, 59.4%–75.6%), increasing to 93.8% (95% CI, 85.0%–98.3%) for samples >14 days post symptom onset. sVNT sensitivity was 60.9% (95% CI, 53.2%–68.4%), rising to 91.2% (95% CI, 81.8%–96.7%) for samples >14 days post symptom onset, with specificity 94.4% (95% CI, 89.2%–97.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays were generally lower than those reported by manufacturers. Timing of specimen collection relative to onset of illness or infection is crucial in reporting of performance characteristics for COVID-19 serological assays. The optimal algorithm for implementing serological testing for COVID-19 remains to be determined, particularly in low-prevalence settings.","Bond, Katherine; Nicholson, Suellen; Lim, Seok Ming; Karapanagiotidis, Theo; Williams, Eloise; Johnson, Douglas; Hoang, Tuyet; Sia, Cheryll; Purcell, Damian; Mordant, Francesca; Lewin, Sharon R; Catton, Mike; Subbarao, Kanta; Howden, Benjamin P; Williamson, Deborah A",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32761124/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa467,435

METHODS: We conducted active surveillance of community-acquired ALRI in two hospitals in Cambodia, a low-income tropical country. Patients were tested for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) by direct sputum examination, other bacteria by blood and/or sputum cultures, and respiratory viruses using molecular techniques on nasopharyngeal/throat swabs. Pulmonologists reviewed clinical/laboratory data and interpreted chest X-rays (CXR) to confirm ALRI. RESULTS: Between April 2007 - December 2009, 1,904 patients aged ≥5 years were admitted with acute pneumonia (50.4%), lung sequelae-associated ALRI (24.3%), isolated pleural effusions (8.9%) or normal CXR-related ALRI (17.1%); 61 (3.2%) died during hospitalization. The two former diagnoses were predominantly due to bacterial etiologies while viral detection was more frequent in the two latter diagnoses. AFB-positive accounted for 25.6% of acute pneumonia. Of the positive cultures (16.8%), abscess-prone Gram-negative bacteria (39.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (38.0%) were most frequent, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.7%). Of the identified viruses, the three most common viruses included rhinoviruses (49.5%), respiratory syncytial virus (17.7%) and influenza viruses (12.1%) regardless of the diagnostic groups. Wheezing was associated with viral identification (31.9% vs. 13.8%, p < 0.001) independent of age and time-to-admission. CONCLUSIONS: High frequency of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae infections support the need for introduction of the respective vaccines in the national immunization program. Tuberculosis was frequent in patients with acute pneumonia, requiring further investigation.

597501,Impact of COVID‐19‐related social restrictions on orthopaedic trauma in a level 1 trauma centre in Sydney: the first wave,2020-10-13,"Optimal control for infectious diseases has received increasing attention over the past few decades. In general, a combination of cost state variables and control effort have been applied as cost indices. Many important results have been reported. Nevertheless, it seems that the interpretation of the optimal control law for an epidemic system has received less attention. In this paper, we have applied Pontryagin’s maximum principle to develop an optimal control law to minimize the number of infected individuals and the vaccination rate. We have adopted the compartmental model SIR to test our technique. We have shown that the proposed control law can give some insights to develop a control strategy in a model-free scenario. Numerical examples show a reduction of 50% in the number of infected individuals when compared with constant vaccination. There is not always a prior knowledge of the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals required to formulate and solve the optimal control problem. In a model-free scenario, a strategy based on the analytic function is proposed, where prior knowledge of the scenario is not necessary. This insight can also be useful after the development of a vaccine to COVID-19, since it shows that a fast and general cover of vaccine worldwide can minimize the number of infected, and consequently the number of deaths. The considered approach is capable of eradicating the disease faster than a constant vaccination control method.","Nepomuceno, Erivelton G.; Peixoto, Márcia L.

Now a prominent unnoticed sub-weekly cycle (SWC) of 3.5 days is uncovered in the long-term epidemiological records of Kawasaki disease (KD) in Japan, a mysterious vasculitis of yet unknown origin. After ruling out the effect of reporting biases, the analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) atmospheric profiles further confirms that this variability is linked to atmospheric particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 1 micron. SWC accounts for 20% of the variance in KD and its contribution is stable throughout the entire epidemiological record dating back to 1970, both at the prefecture level and for entire Japan. KD maxima in 2010-2016 always occur in full synchrony with LIDAR particle arrival in diverse locations such as Tokyo, Toyama and Tsukuba as well as for the entire of Japan. Rapid intrusion of aerosols from heights up to 6km to the surface is observed with KD admissions co-varying with their metal chemical composition.

600474,"Infection Spread, Recovery, and Fatality from Coronavirus in Different Provinces of Saudi Arabia",2021-07-24,"After the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic out of China, evolution in the pandemic worldwide shows dramatic differences among countries. In Europe, the situation of Italy first and later Spain has generated great concen, and despite other countries show better prospects, large uncertainties yet remain on the future evolution and the e, or attack strategies. Here we applied a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for the spread of infection during the latent period, in which we also incorporate effects of varying proportions of containment. We fit data to reported infected populations at the beginning of the first peak of the pandemic to account for the uncertainties in case reporting and study the scenario projections for the individual regions (CCAA). The aim of this model it’s to evaluate the confinement rate at the first stages of the epidemic outbreak in order to evaluate the scenarios that minimize the incidence but also the mortality. Results indicate that with data for March 23, the epidemics follow an evolution similar to the isolation of 1 , 5 percent of the population, and if there were no effects of intervention actions it might reach a maximum of over 1.4 M infected around April 27. The effect on the epidemics of the ongoing partial confinement measures is yet unknown (an update of results with data until March 31st is included), but increasing the isolation around ten times more could drastically reduce the peak to over 100 k cases by early April, while each day of delay in taking this hard containment scenario represents a 90 percent increase of the infected population at the peak. Dynamics at the sub aggregated levels of CCAA show epidemics at the different levels of progression with the most worrying situation in Madrid and Catalonia. Increasing alpha values up to 10 times, in addition to a drastic reduction in clinical cases, would also more than half the number of deaths. Updates for March 31st simulations indicate a substantial reduction in burden is underway. A similar approach conducted for Italy pre-and post-intervention also begins to suggest a substantial reduction in both infected and deaths has been achieved, showing the efficacy of drastic social distancing interventions. At last we show the real evolution of the pandemic up to the end of May and the beginning of July in order to calculate the real confinement rate from data to compare with the scenarios formulated at March.","López, Leonardo; Rodó, Xavier",Results Phys,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379720321604?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391984/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2020.103746; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379720321604,435

All three defensins were also readily expressed in skin samples, while their expression in lymphoid tissues and the kidney was low and inconsistent. Treatment of primary tracheal epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or infection with canine respiratory coronavirus led to decreased expression of CBD103 and CBD108, while cells infected with canine parainfluenza virus had lower levels of CBD1 and CBD108. Furthermore CBD103 was demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity against the respiratory pathogen Bordetella bronchiseptica.","Erles, Kerstin; Brownlie, Joe",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2009.10.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242709003511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19931188/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242709003511,435
602165,In hospital verification of non CE-marked respiratory protective devices to ensure safety of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020-05-20,"Dengue virus (DENV) is an important human pathogen causing millions of disease cases and thousands of deaths worldwide. Non-structural protein 4A (NS4A) is a vital component of the viral replication complex (RC) and plays a major role in the formation of host cell membrane-derived structures that provide a scaffold for replication. The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of NS4A(1–48) is known to preferentially interact with highly curved membranes. Here, we provide experimental evidence for the stable binding of NS4A(1–48) to small liposomes using a liposome floatation assay and identify the lipid binding sequence by NMR spectroscopy. Mutations L6E;M10E were previously shown to inhibit DENV replication and to interfere with the binding of NS4A(1–48) to small liposomes. Our results provide new details on the interaction of the N-terminal region of NS4A with membranes and will prompt studies of the functional relevance of the curvature sensitive membrane anchor at the N-terminus of NS4A.","Hung, Yu-Fu; Schwarten, Melanie; Hoffmann, Silke; Willbold, Dieter; Sklan, Ella H.; Koenig, Bernd W.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7072812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26197333/,435

Digital pathology (DP) has been hailed as a potential solution to at least some of the challenges faced. We present a survey of pathologists within a UK National Health Service cellular pathology department with access to DP, in which we ascertain the role of DP in clinical services during this current pandemic and explore challenges encountered. This survey indicates an increase in uptake of diagnostic DP during this period, with increased remote access. Half of respondents agreed that DP had facilitated maintenance of diagnostic practice. While challenges have been encountered, these are remediable, and none have impacted on the uptake of DP during this period. We conclude that in our institution, DP has demonstrated current and future potential to increase resilience in diagnostic practice and have highlighted some of the challenges that need to be considered.","Browning, Lisa; Fryer, Eve; Roskell, Derek; White, Kieron; Colling, Richard; Rittscher, Jens; Verrill, Clare",J Clin Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32616541/,435

The tourism industry is among the worst-hit industries. How to focus on visitors who are most helpful to the tourism industry and develop sustainable strategy of operation is a very important question for after the epidemic is over. This study applied two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate past statistics from the Tourism Bureau and explore the shopping patterns of tourists who travel to Taiwan. The focus will be on tourists from major countries such as China, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries. According to the analysis of tourists from different countries, the money spent by tourists from different countries is concentrated on different items, and there are subitems that they particularly like to purchase. For the analysis of the purpose of coming to Taiwan, some tourism areas worth developing (such as medical treatment and leisure) are also presented in the research results. Based on these results, and according to the sustainable development goals, specific recommendations for the sustainability strategy of operation are made as a reference for the government and relevant industries. This research also broadens the scope of application of DEA and points out a different direction for future research.","Tsai, Ming-Chi",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705479/,435

602629,Post-COVID syndrome: Turning convalescence into illness? – Authors’ reply,2021-07-12,"In 2012 in Jordan, infection by a novel coronavirus (CoV) caused the first known cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). MERS-CoV sequences have since been found in a bat and the virus appears to be enzootic among dromedary camels across the Arabian Peninsula and in parts of Africa. The majority of human cases have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In humans, the etiologic agent, MERS-CoV, has been detected in severe, mild and influenza-like illness and in those without any obvious signs or symptoms of disease. MERS is often a lower respiratory tract disease associated with fever, cough, breathing difficulties, pneumonia that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure and death among more than a third of those infected. Severe disease is usually found in older males and comorbidities are frequently present in cases of MERS. Compared to SARS, MERS progresses more rapidly to respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, is more often observed as severe disease in patients with underlying illnesses and is more often fatal. MERS-CoV has a broader tropism than SARS-CoV, rapidly triggers cellular damage, employs a different receptor and induces a delayed proinflammatory response in cells. Most human cases have been linked to lapses in infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, with a fifth of virus detections reported among healthcare workers. This review sets out what is currently known about MERS and the MERS-CoV, summarises the new phenomenon of crowd-sourced epidemiology and lists some of the many questions that remain unanswered, nearly three years after the first reported case.","Mackay, Ian M.; Arden, Katherine E.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25656066/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215000465; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.01.021; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215000465,435

This study investigated how the pandemic affected endocrine surgery practice. METHODS: PanSurg-PREDICT is an international, multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study of emergency and elective surgical patients in secondary/tertiary care during the pandemic. PREDICT-Endocrine collected endocrine-specific data alongside demographics, COVID-19 and outcome data from 11–3-2020 to 13–9-2020. RESULTS: A total of 380 endocrine surgery patients (19 centres, 12 countries) were analysed (224 thyroidectomies, 116 parathyroidectomies, 40 adrenalectomies). Ninety-seven percent were elective, and 63% needed surgery within 4 weeks. Eight percent were initially deferred but had surgery during the pandemic; less than 1% percent was deferred for more than 6 months. Decision-making was affected by capacity, COVID-19 status or the pandemic in 17%, 5% and 7% of cases. Indication was cancer/worrying lesion in 61% of thyroidectomies and 73% of adrenalectomies and calcium 2.80 mmol/l or greater in 50% of parathyroidectomies. COVID-19 status was unknown at presentation in 92% and remained unknown before surgery in 30%. Two-thirds were asked to self-isolate before surgery. There was one COVID-19-related ICU admission and no mortalities. Consultant-delivered care occurred in a majority (anaesthetist 96%, primary surgeon 76%). Post-operative vocal cord check was reported in only 14% of neck endocrine operations. Both of these observations are likely to reflect modification of practice due to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected endocrine surgical decision-making, case mix and personnel delivering care. Significant variation was seen in COVID-19 risk mitigation measures. COVID-19-related complications were uncommon. This analysis demonstrates the safety of endocrine surgery during this pandemic.

The COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) (3) collects data on hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19; to date, such data have been limited. During March 1-August 22, 2020, approximately one in four hospitalized women aged 15-49 years with COVID-19 was pregnant. Among 598 hospitalized pregnant women with COVID-19, 54.5% were asymptomatic at admission. Among 272 pregnant women with COVID-19 who were symptomatic at hospital admission, 16.2% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 8.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation. During COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, 448 of 458 (97.8%) completed pregnancies resulted in a live birth and 10 (2.2%) resulted in a pregnancy loss. Testing policies based on the presence of symptoms might miss COVID-19 infections during pregnancy. Surveillance of pregnant women with COVID-19, including those with asymptomatic infections, is important to understand the short- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 for mothers and newborns. Identifying COVID-19 in women during birth hospitalizations is important to guide preventive measures to protect pregnant women, parents, newborns, other patients, and hospital personnel. Pregnant women and health care providers should be made aware of the potential risks for severe COVID-19 illness, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and ways to prevent infection.","Delahoy, Miranda J.; Whitaker, Michael; O’Halloran, Alissa; Chai, Shua J.; Kirley, Pam Daily; Alden, Nisha; Kawasaki, Breanna; Meek, James; Yousey-Hindes, Kimberly; Anderson, Evan J.; Openo, Kyle P.; Monroe, Maya L.; Ryan, Patricia A.; Fox, Kimberly; Kim, Sue; Lynfield, Ruth; Siebman, Samantha; Davis, Sarah Shrum; Sosin, Daniel M.; Barney, Grant; Muse, Alison; Bennett, Nancy M.; Felsen, Christina B.; Billing, Laurie M.; Shiltz, Jessica; Sutton, Melissa; West, Nicole; Schaffner, William; Talbot, H.

Binding free energies calculated from umbrella sampling simulations show the strong binding between SARS‐CoV‐2 RBDs and antibodies, in agreement with recent experiments. Binding strengths of antibodies slightly differ, as further confirmed by calculating solvent accessible surface areas. Polar uncharged residues of RBD more predominantly bind to antibodies than do charged or hydrophobic residues of RBD. In particular, the binding between RBD and antibody is more significantly stabilized by multivalent hydrogen bonds of RBD residues (≈406th–505th) than by locally formed hydrogen bonds of only a few RBD residues (≈417th–487th or ≈487th–505th). Hydrogen‐bond analyses reveal key residues of RBD for strong hydrogen‐bond interactions between RBDs and antibodies, which help in the rational design of vaccine and drug molecules targeting the S protein of SARS‐CoV‐2.","Lee, Hwankyu",Adv Theory Simul,https://doi.org/10.1002/adts.202100012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230907/,435

The study cohort comprised 3623 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in the SALUD hospital network of Aragon (Spain), which includes 23 hospitals, between February 2020 and January 2021, a period that includes several pandemic waves. Up to 165 variables were analysed, including demographics, comorbidity, chronic drugs, vital signs, and laboratory data. To build the predictive models, different techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms were explored: multilayer perceptron, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). A reduction dimensionality procedure was used to minimize the features to 20, ensuring feasible use of the tool in practice. Our model was validated both internally and externally. We also assessed its calibration and provide an analysis of the optimal cut-off points depending on the metric to be optimized. The best performing algorithm was XGBoost. The final model achieved good discrimination for the external validation set (AUC = 0.821, 95% CI 0.787–0.854) and accurate calibration (slope = 1, intercept = −0.12). A cut-off of 0.4 provides a sensitivity and specificity of 0.71 and 0.78, respectively.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress, fear and coping strategies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among Malaysian residents. METHODS: Participants were invited to an online cross-sectional survey from Aug-Sep 2020. The study assessed psychological distress using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, level of fear using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: The mean age (±SD) of the participants (N = 720) was 31.7 (±11.5) years, and most of them were females (67.1%). Half of the participants had an income source, while 216 (30%) identified themselves as frontline health or essential service workers. People whose financial situation was impacted due to COVID-19 (AOR 2.16, 95% CIs 1.54–3.03), people who drank alcohol in the last four weeks (3.43, 1.45–8.10), people who were a patient (2.02, 1.39–2.93), and had higher levels of fear of COVID-19 (2.55, 1.70–3.80) were more likely to have higher levels of psychological distress. Participants who self-isolated due to exposure to COVID-19 (3.12, 1.04–9.32) and who had moderate to very high levels of psychological distress (2.56, 1.71–3.83) had higher levels of fear. Participants who provided care to a family member/patient with a suspected case of COVID-19 were more likely to be moderately to highly resilient compared to those who did not.

To examine the hydrologic, land cover, and seasonal patterns of waterborne pathogens (i.e. protozoa (2), pathogenic bacteria (4) human viruses, (8) and bovine viruses (8)) eight rivers were monitored in the Great Lakes Basin over 29 months from February 2011 to June 2013. Sampling locations represented a wide variety of land cover classes from urban to agriculture to forest. A custom automated pathogen sampler was deployed at eight sampling locations which provided unattended, flow-weighted, large-volume (120–1630 L) sampling. Human and bovine viruses and pathogenic bacteria were detected by real-time qPCR in 16%, 14%, and 1.4% of 290 samples collected while protozoa were never detected. The most frequently detected pathogens were: bovine polyomavirus (11%), and human adenovirus C, D, F (9%). Human and bovine viruses were present in 16.9% and 14.8% of runoff-event samples (n = 189) resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 13.9% and 12.9% of low-flow samples (n = 101), respectively, indicating multiple delivery mechanisms could be influential. Data indicated human and bovine virus prevalence was different depending on land cover within the watershed. Occurrence, concentration, and flux of human viruses were greatest in samples from the three sampling locations with greater than 25% urban influence than those with less than 25% urban influence. Similarly, occurrence, concentration, and flux of bovine viruses were greatest in samples from the two sampling locations with greater than 50 cattle/km(2) than those with less than 50 cattle/km(2). In seasonal analysis, human and bovine viruses occurred more frequently in spring and winter seasons than during the fall and summer. Concentration, occurrence, and flux in the context of hydrologic condition, seasonality, and land use must be considered for each watershed individually to develop effective watershed management strategies for pathogen reduction.","Lenaker, P.L.; Corsi, S.R.; Borchardt, M.A.; Spencer, S.K.; Baldwin, A.K.; Lutz, M.A.",Water Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135417300672; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2017.01.060; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0043135417300672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28187346/,435
607356,Sex Differences in Association Between Anti-Hypertensive Medications and Risk of COVID-19 in Middle-Aged and Older Adults,2021-08-18,"Favipiravir (T-705) has been developed as a potent anti-influenza drug and exhibited a strong inhibition effect against a broad spectrum of RNA viruses. Its active form, ribofuranosyl-triphosphate (T-705-RTP), functions as a competitive substrate for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the influenza A virus (IAV). However, the exact inhibitory mechanisms of T-705 remain elusive and subject to a long-standing debate. Although T-705 has been proposed to inhibit transcription by acting as a chain terminator, it is also paradoxically suggested to be a mutagen towards IAV RdRp by inducing mutations due to its ambiguous base pairing of C and U. Here, we combined biochemical assay with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory functions exerted by T-705 in IAV RdRp. Our in vitro transcription assay illustrated that IAV RdRp could recognize T-705 as a purine analogue and incorporate it into the nascent RNA strand. Incorporating a single T-705 is incapable of inhibiting transcription as extra natural nucleotides can be progressively added. However, when two consecutive T-705 are incorporated, viral transcription is completely terminated. MD simulations reveal that the sequential appearance of two T-705 in the nascent strand destabilizes the active site and disrupts the base stacking of the nascent RNA. Altogether, our results provide a plausible explanation for the inhibitory roles of T-705 targeting IAV RdRp by integrating the computational and experimental methods. Our study also offers a comprehensive platform to investigate the inhibition effect of antivirals and a novel explanation for the designing of anti-flu drugs.","Wang, Yuqing; Yuan, Congmin; Xu, Xinzhou; Chong, Tin Hang; Zhang, Lu; Cheung, Peter Pak-Hang; Huang, Xuhui",Biophysical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpc.2021.106652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34237555/,435

Incorporating video-conferencing applications in the patient handover process between healthcare workers can enhance social distancing while maintaining handover elements. This study describes pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians' experience of using an online video-conferencing application for handover during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: qualitative content analysis Setting: PICU at a university hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Subjects: PICU Physicians Interventions: Due to the pandemic, the hospital's PICU used Zoom as a remote conferencing application, instead of a face-to-face handover. Following institutional review board approval, data were collected over two weeks (July 1, 2020 to July 14, 2020). Measurements: Demographic data and narrative descriptions of the perceived efficacy of remote handover were collected using open-ended questions through a created online link. The analysis process included open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. Main Results: All 37 PICU physicians who participated in the handover completed the survey. The participants comprised six attendings, nine specialists, and 22 residents. They had variable previous teleconferencing experiences. Most physicians (78.4%) were comfortable conducting a remote endorsement. Most found that Situation-Background-Assessment-Recommendation handover elements were properly achieved through this remote handover process. The perceived advantages of online handover included fewer interruptions, time efficiency, and facilitation of social distancing. The perceived disadvantages were the paucity of nonverbal communication and teaching during virtual meetings. Conclusions: Video-conferencing applications used for online handovers could supplement traditional face-to-face intensive care unit patient endorsement during outbreaks of infectious diseases. The use of video streaming and more emphasis on teaching should be encouraged to optimize the users' experience.","Temsah, M.-H.; Abouammoh, N.; Ashry, A.; Al-Eyadhy, A.; Alhaboob, A.; Alsohime, F.; Almazyad, M.; Alabdulhafid, M.; Temsah, R.; Aljamaan, F.; Jamal, A.; Halwani, R.; Alhasan, K.; Al-Tawfiq, J.

The highest rate was in solid organ transplant recipients: rate ratio 13.6 (95% CI 9.6 to 19.2, p=8 x 10-50). In both the shielded and the general population, the risk of severe COVID-19 increased with the number of adults but decreased with the number of school-age children in the household. Severe COVID-19 was strongly associated with recent exposure to hospital (defined as 5 to 14 days before presentation date): rate ratio 12.6 (95% CI 11.7 to 13.6, p=2 x 10-989) overall. In a case-crossover analysis with less recent exposure only (15 to 24 days before first testing positive) as reference category, the rate ratio associated with recent exposure only was 6.3 (95% CI 3.6 to 11.1, p=2 x 10-10). Among those eligible for shielding, the population attributable risk fraction (PARF) of severe cases for recent exposure to hospital was 36%. In the general population the PARF for recent exposure to hospital peaked at 46% in May 2020 and again at 64% in December 2020. * Conclusions - The effectiveness of shielding vulnerable individuals was limited by the inability to control transmission in hospital and from other adults in the household. For solid organ transplant recipients, in whom the efficacy of vaccines is uncertain, these results support a policy of offering vaccination to household contacts. Mitigating the impact of the epidemic requires control of nosocomial transmission.","McKeigue, P. M.; McAllister, D.; Caldwell, D.; Gribben, C.; Bishop, J.; McGurnaghan, S.

608650,Mobilizing PACU Nurses to Provide Critical Care during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021-08-31,"Abstract BACKGROUND: COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), became a pandemic in 2020 with mortality rate of 2% and high transmissibility, which makes studies with an epidemiological profile essential. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the population that performed the SARS-CoV-2 molecular and serological tests in Carlos Chagas-Sabin laboratories in Cuiaba. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out with all the samples collected from nasal swab tested by RT-PCR and serological for SARM-CoV-2 IgM / IgG from the population served between April and July 2020. FINDINGS: In the analyzed period, 11,113 PCR-Covid-19 exams were registered. Of this total of cases, 3,912 (35.20%) tested positive, while 6,889 (61.90%) did not detect viral RNA and 312 (2.80%) of the visits resulted as undetermined. The peak of positive RT-PCR performed in July (n = 5878), with 35.65% (n = 2096). A total of 6,392 tests performed on SOROVID-19, with a peak of 1161 (18.16%) of the positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 in July. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Molecular positivity and serological tests, both peaked in July 2020, were mostly present in women aged 20-39, characterizing Cuiaba as the epicenter of the Midwest region in this period due to the high rate of transmissibility of SARS- CoV-2.

Media and public health officials have lauded the perceived gender-related influence on policies and strategies for reducing the deleterious effects of the pandemic. We examine this proposition by analyzing COVID-19-related deaths globally across countries led by men and women. While we find some limited support for lower reported fatality rates in countries led by women, they are not statistically significant. Country cultural values offer more substantive explanation for COVID-19 outcomes. We offer several potential explanations for the pervasive perception that countries led by women have fared better during the pandemic, including data selection bias and Western media bias that amplified the successes of women leaders in OECD countries.","Windsor, Leah C.; Yannitell Reinhardt, Gina; Windsor, Alistair J.; Ostergard, Robert; Allen, Susan; Burns, Courtney; Giger, Jarod; Wood, Reed",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382791/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244531,435

There are no clinical presentations unique to LD and hence accurate laboratory tests are required for early diagnosis. Therefore, we designed a real-time PCR assay that targets the 23S-5S rRNA intergenic spacer region (23S-5S PCR) and allows for detection of all Legionella species and discrimination of L. pneumophila from other Legionella species. In total, 271 isolates representing 50 Legionella species were tested and the assay was validated using 39 culture-positive and 110 culture-negative patient specimens collected between 1989 and 2006. PCR-positive results were obtained with all 39 culture-positive samples (100% sensitivity). Specimens that tested positive according to 23S-5S PCR, but were culture-negative, were further analysed by DNA sequencing of the amplicon or the macrophage infectivity potentiator (mip) gene. In addition to L. pneumophila, Legionella longbeachae, Legionella cincinnatiensis and Legionella micdadei were identified in the specimens. The assay showed a 7-log dynamic range displaying a sensitivity of 7.5 CFU/mL or three genome equivalents per reaction. Sixty-one specimens containing viruses or bacteria other than Legionellae were negative according to 23S-5S PCR, demonstrating its specificity. Use of this assay should contribute to the earlier detection of respiratory disease caused by Legionella species, as well as to increased rates of detection.","Yang, G.; Benson, R.; Pelish, T.; Brown, E.; Winchell, J.M.; Fields, B.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19438641/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02766.x; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14608302; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14608302,435

Decision-making and planning is critical to ensure successful aging-in-place (AIP), especially when individuals experience age-related changes such as cognitive decline. Objectives: We are testing how decision-making and planning for AIP is impacted by changes in older adults' cognition and function, chronic conditions, social influences, environmental factors and identifying the mediating/moderating interactions between factors. We will also assess whether decision-making and planning for AIP translates into timely adoption of plans and goal concordance between older adults and their surrogate/caregiver decision makers. METHODS: We will conduct a longitudinal single-group interventional clinical trial of community-dwelling older adults who are enrolled in LitCog, (R01AG03611) and expose them to an online intervention, PlanYourLifespan.org, which facilitates decision-making and planning for AIP. Enrolled participants (n = 398) will complete interviews at baseline, one month, and every six months up to 42 months in conjunction with the LitCog study, where cognitive, social, functional, and health literacy data is collected. Additionally, we will collect data on decision-making, resource use, communication of plans, timing of plan implementation, and goal concordance. PROJECTED OUTCOMES: Findings from this study may generate evidence on how age-related changes in older adults may affect decision-making and implementation in relation to AIP as well as the impact of social relationships and support. Ultimately these findings may help shape the design of programs and practices that may improve the lives of older adults and the capacity of institutions to adapt to societal aging and AIP.","Lindquist, Lee A.; Muhammad, Ruqayyah; Miller-Winder, Amber P.; Opsasnick, Lauren; Kim, Kwang-Youn; Benavente, Julia Yoshino; Wolf, Michael; Ramirez-Zohfeld, Vanessa",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conctc.2021.100756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33869887/,435

METHOD: In this multinational study, chest CT scans of 185 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence, image quality regarding the assessment of GGO, as well as subjective time-efficiency of MinIP and standard MPR series were analyzed based on the assessment of six radiologists. In addition, the suitability for COVID-19 evaluation, image quality regarding GGO and subjective time-efficiency in clinical routine was assessed by five clinicians. RESULTS: The reference standard revealed a total of 149 CT scans with pulmonary GGO. MinIP reconstructions yielded significantly higher sensitivity (99.9 % vs 95.6 %), specificity (95.8 % vs 86.1 %) and accuracy (99.1 % vs 93.8 %) for assessing of GGO compared with standard MPR series. MinIP reconstructions achieved significantly higher ratings by radiologists concerning diagnostic confidence (medians, 5.00 vs 4.00), image quality (medians, 4.00 vs 4.00), contrast between GGO and unaffected lung parenchyma (medians, 5.00 vs 4.00) as well as subjective time-efficiency (medians, 5.00 vs 4.00) compared with MPR-series (all P < .001). Clinicians preferred MinIP reconstructions for COVID-19 assessment (medians, 5.00 vs 3.00), image quality regarding GGO (medians, 5.00 vs 3.00) and subjective time-efficiency in clinical routine (medians, 5.00 vs 3.00).

Here, we designed a unique “posture” of rose Bengal (RB) on cotton-based super-adsorptive fibrous equipment, with RB being separately captured in the mesopores of porous organic polymers (POPs). The resultant daylight-induced biocidal cotton fabric with enhanced efficiency was named as DBwEE-Cotton. The enhanced biocidal activity of the DBwEE-Cotton was achieved based on two mechanisms: (1) the separation of RB in mesopores on the fabric avoids the aggregation-caused self-quenching; and (2) other than singlet oxygen generation, RB is forced to undergo type I photoreaction by surrounding the RB with massive amounts of good hydrogen donors (i.e., POP) under daylight irradiation. Given the enhanced production efficiency of reactive oxygen species by the DBwEE-Cotton, 99.9999% of E. coli and L. innocua bacteria were killed within 20 min of daylight exposure. The DBwEE-Cotton also presents excellent wash and light durability with no biocidal function loss. The development of DBwEE-Cotton provides a facile strategy of avoiding aggregation-caused self-quenching and modulating photoreactions of PS on a flexible substrate, which may guide the design of novel personal protective equipment (PPE) integrated with improved biocidal efficiency, wearability, and repeated and long-term applicability for protecting people from lethal infectious diseases.","Tang, Peixin; El-Moghazy, Ahmed Y.; Ji, Bolin; Nitin, Nitin; Sun, Gang",Materials advances,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34179787/; https://doi.org/10.1039/d1ma00100k,435
611200,Changing patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic: population-based modelling to understand palliative care implications,2020-06-09,"Terminology is the most basic information that researchers and literature analysis systems need to understand. Mining terms and revealing the semantic relationships between terms can help biomedical researchers find solutions to some major health problems and motivate researchers to explore innovative biomedical research issues. However, how to mine terms from biomedical literature remains a challenge. At present, the research on text segmentation in natural language processing (NLP) technology has not been well applied in the biomedical field. Named entity recognition models usually require a large amount of training corpus, and the types of entities that the model can recognize are limited. Besides, dictionary-based methods mainly use pre-established vocabularies to match the text. However, this method can only match terms in a specific field, and the process of collecting terms is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Many scenarios faced in the field of biomedical research are unsupervised, i.e. unlabelled corpora, and the system may not have much prior knowledge. This paper proposes the TermInformer project, which aims to mine the meaning of terms in an open fashion by calculating terms and find solutions to some of the significant problems in our society. We propose an unsupervised method that can automatically mine terms in the text without relying on external resources. Our method can generally be applied to any document data. Combined with the word vector training algorithm, we can obtain reusable term embeddings, which can be used in any NLP downstream application. This paper compares term embeddings with existing word embeddings. The results show that our method can better reflect the semantic relationship between terms. Finally, we use the proposed method to find potential factors and treatments for lung cancer, breast cancer, and coronavirus.","Tiwari, Prayag; Uprety, Sagar; Dehdashti, Shahram; Hossain, M.

While past critiques of this canon have argued for expanding the geographic bounds outside of Europe, these efforts still ground the origins of social theory in a time period of racial exclusion and segregation. We argue for a reckoning with the racial origins of the discipline in the United States in anti-Blackness and the legacies of racial exclusions. We must grapple with the histories of exclusion and segregation that continue to impact the discipline’s present and futures. In this paper, we argue that the teaching of sociology’s history should be through the “Foundations of Social Theory,” a broad approach to teaching that rejects the ideas of both “classics” and a “canon.” This approach roots theory in our history through core issues of study (e.g., the origins and consequences of capitalism) and directly addresses past racial and gendered exclusions by centering BIPOC intellectual contributions across time. By lifting the time and space restrictions, we open the doors to including voices omitted and repressed due to the exclusion of BIPOC people, especially Black women, from higher education in the U.S. This approach acknowledges the diverse histories and voices in our classrooms and profession, and highlights the relevance of social theory for our future.","Fillingim, Angela; Rucks-Ahidiana, Zawadi",Am Sociol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12108-021-09487-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896943/,435

In this study, 200 adult ticks were collected from healthy camels in two localities from Hail province (Saudi Arabia). The analysis showed high microbial diversity dominated by the two domains (Archaea and Bacteria) associated with Hyalomma dromedarii from both regions. Proteobacteria (61.3%) and Firmicutes (31.2%) dominated the ticks from the Al Khotha region. While, the microbiome of ticks from the Al Gayed region was dominated by Proteobacteria (81.2%) and Firmicutes (9.2%). Twenty-three families were identified in the DNA-pool from the Al Gayed region, and was dominated by Pseudomonadaceae (45.37%), and Marinobacteraceae (14.39%) families. Francisellaceae (46%), Staphylococcaceae (24.26%) dominated the microbiome of the ticks collected from Al Gayed region. Thus, the genera Pseudomonas, Francisella, Proteus, Marinobacter, Glutamicibacter, Pedobacter, and Staphylococcus are largely distributed in the two identified microbiomes.

The present study provides an insight into the psychosocial challenges faced by the HCWs related to their work, family and personal well-being and the associated stigmas. Additionally, the coping mechanisms adopted by them and their perceptions on the interventions to address these challenges were also explored. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted between September and December 2020 through in-depth telephonic interviews using an interview guide among 111 HCWs who were involved in COVID-19 management across 10 States in India. Results: HCWs report major changes in work-life environment that included excessive workload with erratic timings accentuated with the extended duration of inconvenient personal protection equipment usage, periods of quarantine and long durations of separation from family. Family-related issues were manifold; the main challenge being separated from family, the challenge of caregiving, especially for females with infants and children, and fears around infecting family. Stigma from the community and peers fuelled by the fear of infection was manifested through avoidance and rejection. Coping strategies included peer, family support and the positive experiences manifested as appreciation and recognition for their contribution during the pandemic. Interpretation & conclusions: The study demonstrates the psychological burden of HCWs engaged with COVID-19 care services. The study findings point to need-based psychosocial interventions at the organizational, societal and individual levels. This includes a conducive working environment involving periodic evaluation of the HCW problems, rotation of workforce by engaging more staff, debunking of false information, community and HCW involvement in COVID sensitization to allay fears and prevent stigma associated with COVID-19 infection/transmission and finally need-based psychological support for them and their families.","Chakma, Tapas; Thomas, Beena E; Kohli, Simran; Moral, Rony; Menon, Geetha R; Periyasamy, Murugesan; Venkatesh, U; Kulkarni, Ragini Nitin; Prusty, Ranjan Kumar; Balu, Vinoth; Grover, Ashoo; Kishore, Jugal; Viray, Maribon; Venkateswaran, Chitra; Mathew, Geethu; Ketharam, Asha; Balachandar, Rakesh; Singh, Prashant Kumar; Jakhar, Kiran; Singh, Shalini; Devi, Rekha; Saha, Kalyan B; Barde, Pradeep; Singh, Ravinder; John, Denny; Mishra, Bijaya Kumar; Yadav, Jeetendra; Agarwal, Sumit; Rao, Vishnu Vardhana; Panda, Samiran",Indian j. med. res,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_2204_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34596596/,435

A rapid, sensitive, and specific assay for distinguishing pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 from seasonal influenza viruses and for subtyping seasonal influenza A viruses could aid in the surveillance and control of these viral infections. Here, such a multiplex real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for typing influenza A and B viruses and the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 is developed. This assay can also subtype seasonal influenza A viruses simultaneously. The analytical sensitivity is 10–10(4) copies/reaction. The coefficients of variation of inter-assay and intra-assay are 0.04–0.45% and 0.08–0.97%, respectively. The new multiplex rRT-PCR assay is more sensitive in subtyping seasonal influenza viruses than the conventional PCR techniques. Results obtained with this assay for the detection of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 are highly consistent (96.88%) with those achieved using the US CDC's rRT-PCR protocol. A sample identified as “pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 positive” by the US CDC's rRT-PCR was reclassified correctly as subtype H3N2 using this assay.

We analyzed 131 COVID-19 patients by exome sequencing and examined the genetic variants of TMPRSS2, PCSK3, DPP4, and BSG genes. In total we identified seventeen variants. In PCSK3 gene, we observed a missense variant (c.893G>A) statistically more frequent compared to the EUR GnomAD reference population and a missense mutation (c.1906A>G) not found in the GnomAD database. In TMPRSS2 gene, we observed a significant difference in the frequency of c.331G>A, c.23G>T, and c.589G>A variant alleles in COVID-19 patients, compared to the corresponding allelic frequency in GnomAD. Genetic variants in these genes could influence the entry of the SARS-CoV-2. These data also support the hypothesis that host genetic variability may contribute to the variability in infection susceptibility and severity.","Latini, Andrea; Agolini, Emanuele; Novelli, Antonio; Borgiani, Paola; Giannini, Rosalinda; Gravina, Paolo; Smarrazzo, Andrea; Dauri, Mario; Andreoni, Massimo; Rogliani, Paola; Bernardini, Sergio; Helmer-Citterich, Manuela; Biancolella, Michela; Novelli, Giuseppe",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867305/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11091010,435
614053,Instagram Usage and Engagement by Dermatology Residency Programs during the COVID-19 Pandemic compared with Twitter and Facebook,2021-08-18,"Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging bat-borne zoonotic virus that causes near-annual outbreaks of fatal encephalitis in South Asia—one of the most populous regions on Earth. In Bangladesh, infection occurs when people drink date-palm sap contaminated with bat excreta. Outbreaks are sporadic, and the influence of viral dynamics in bats on their temporal and spatial distribution is poorly understood. We analyzed data on host ecology, molecular epidemiology, serological dynamics, and viral genetics to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of NiV dynamics in its wildlife reservoir, Pteropus medius bats, in Bangladesh. We found that NiV transmission occurred throughout the country and throughout the year. Model results indicated that local transmission dynamics were modulated by density-dependent transmission, acquired immunity that is lost over time, and recrudescence. Increased transmission followed multiyear periods of declining seroprevalence due to bat-population turnover and individual loss of humoral immunity. Individual bats had smaller host ranges than other Pteropus species (spp.), although movement data and the discovery of a Malaysia-clade NiV strain in eastern Bangladesh suggest connectivity with bats east of Bangladesh. These data suggest that discrete multiannual local epizootics in bat populations contribute to the sporadic nature of NiV outbreaks in South Asia. At the same time, the broad spatial and temporal extent of NiV transmission, including the recent outbreak in Kerala, India, highlights the continued risk of spillover to humans wherever they may interact with pteropid bats and the importance of limiting opportunities for spillover throughout Pteropus’s range.","Epstein, Jonathan H.; Anthony, Simon J.; Islam, Ariful; Kilpatrick, A.

614290,Palliative psychodermatology care during COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND: A variety of stressors throughout medical education have contributed to a burnout epidemic at both the undergraduate medical education (UGME) and postgraduate medical education (PGME) levels. In response, UGME and PGME programs have recently begun to explore resilience-based interventions. As these interventions are in their infancy, little is known about their efficacy in promoting trainee resilience. This systematic review aims to synthesize the available research evidence on the efficacy of resilience curricula in UGME and PGME. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search of the literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Educational Resources Information Centre (ERIC), and Education Source from their inception to June 2020. Studies reporting the effect of resilience curricula in UGME and PGME settings were included. A qualitative analysis of the available studies was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I Tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirteen were single-arm studies, 6 quasi-experiments, and 2 RCTs. Thirty-eight percent (8/21; n = 598) were implemented in UGME, while 62 % (13/21, n = 778) were in PGME. There was significant heterogeneity in the duration, delivery, and curricular topics and only two studies implemented the same training model. Similarly, there was considerable variation in curricula outcome measures, with the majority reporting modest improvement in resilience, while three studies reported worsening of resilience upon completion of training. Overall assessment of risk of bias was moderate and only few curricula were previously validated by other research groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that resilience curricula may be of benefit to medical trainees. Resilience training is an emerging area of medical education that merits further investigation. Additional research is needed to construct optimal methods to foster resilience in medical education.

METHODS: We designed a discrete-choice experiment to administer 10 choice questions to each respondent representing experimentally controlled pairs of scenarios defined by when nonessential businesses could reopen (May, July, or October 2020), cumulative percentage of Americans contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through 2020 (2% to 20%), time for economic recovery (2 to 5 years), and the percentage of US households falling below the poverty threshold (16% to 25%). Respondents were recruited by SurveyHealthcareGlobus. RESULTS: A total of 5953 adults across all 50 states completed the survey between May 8 and 20, 2020. Latent-class analysis supported a 4-class model. The largest class (36%) represented COVID-19 risk-minimizers, reluctant to accept any increases in COVID-19 risks. About 26% were waiters, strongly preferring to delay reopening nonessential businesses, independent of COVID-19 risk levels. Another 25% represented recovery-supporters, primarily concerned about time required for economic recovery. This group would accept COVID-19 risks as high as 16% (95% CI: 13%-19%) to shorten economic recovery from 3 to 2 years. The final openers class prioritized lifting social distancing restrictions, accepting of COVID-19 risks greater than 20% to open in May rather than July or October. Political affiliation, race, household income, and employment status were all associated with class membership (P<.01). CONCLUSION: Americans have diverse preferences pertaining to social-distancing restrictions, infection risks, and economic outcomes. These findings can assist elected and public-health officials in making difficult policy decisions related to the pandemic.","Reed, Shelby; Gonzalez, Juan Marcos; Johnson, F.

Methods: Forty-four children who were newly diagnosed with KD were selected as the KD group. They were divided into acute phase of KD and subacute phase of KD. They were also separated into groups with and without coronary artery disease (CAD) (CAD+ and CAD–, respectively). Meanwhile, 44 children hospitalized with febrile disease and 44 healthy children were selected as a febrile control group and normal control group, whom were attended to at Children's Hospital of Soochow University at the same time. We detected the concentration of IFN-β and PLT of peripheral blood serum for all three groups and analyzed the difference. Results: At acute and subacute phases of KD, both IFN-β and PLT are higher than both the febrile control group and healthy control group, especially at subacute phase; the difference between groups was statistically significant, P < 0.05. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of IFN-β and PLT at acute phase of KD were 0.81 and 0.72, respectively; the sensitivity and specificity were 97.22 and 63.64%, and 57.89 and 73.86%, respectively. The AUCs of combined IFN-β and PLT were 0.81 at acute phase and 0.96 at subacute phase of KD, with sensitivity and specificity of 97.22 and 55.26%, and 86.36 and 100%, respectively. The cutoff value of combined IFN-β and PLT detection was IFN-β = 3.51 pg/ml and PLT = 303 × 10(9)/L at acute phase of KD, IFN-β = 4.21 pg/ml and PLT = 368 × 10(9)/L at subacute phase from plot vs. criterion values. However, there are no significant differences between the CAD– group and the CAD+ group for combined IFN-β and PLT, both P > 0.5, neither at acute nor at subacute phase of KD.

This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with refractory COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1(st) to February 5(th). The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared. RESULTS: Compared with general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After adjustment, those with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.

Three key elements require special attention to reduce the maximum and average aerosolized contaminant concentration exposure to a healthcare worker in any isolation system: flow rate; air changes per hour; and patient placement. This is important because concentration exposures of aerosolized contaminants to healthcare workers in hospitals using temporary isolation systems can reach levels 21–30 times greater than a properly engineered negative pressure isolation room.

This study investigates the severity of mental health problems among confirmed COVID-19 patients. From March to November 2020, we collected the data from 118 COVID-19 patients who voluntarily participated in the National Center for Disaster Trauma's online mental health assessment consisting of self-report scales like Primary Care of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder screen (PC-PTSD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and P4 Suicidality Screener. For control, 116 other disaster-experienced and 386 non-COVID-19-experienced participants were recruited. The COVID-19 patients showed more severe symptoms including post-traumatic symptoms, depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms than control groups across all four screening scales (p < 0.001). Regarding high-risk, COVID-19 patients had an increased association with high-risk compared to the comparison groups (PC-PTSD: OR = 24.16, 95% CI = 13.52–43.16 p < 0.001; PHQ-9: OR = 14.45, 95% CI = 8.29–25.19, p < 0.001; GAD-7: OR=20.71, 95% CI = 10.74–39.96, p < 0.001; PHQ-15: OR = 5.65, 95% CI = 3.44–9.25, p < 0.001; P4: OR = 14.67, 95% CI = 8.95–25.07, p < 0.001).

There is also no information as to whether the expression of these mediators is altered in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia (PE) or preterm birth (PTB). This is important since the expression of decidual and placental ACE2 and TMPRSS2 across gestation may impact susceptibility of pregnancies to vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Objectives To investigate the expression pattern of specific SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in the placenta across human pregnancy and in paired samples of decidua and placenta in pregnancies complicated by PTB or PE compared to term, uncomplicated pregnancies. Study Design Two separate cohorts of patients, totalling 87 pregnancies were included. The first cohort comprised of placentae from first (7-9 weeks), second (16-18 weeks), third-trimester preterm (26-31 weeks) and third-trimester term (38-41 weeks) pregnancies (n=5/group), whereas, the second independent cohort, included matched decidua and placentae from pregnancies from term, uncomplicated pregnancies (37-41 weeks; n=14) as well as pregnancies complicated by PTB (26-37 weeks, n=11) or PE (25-37 weeks n=42). Samples were subjected to qPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS)/RNAseq for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression quantification, respectively. Results In the first cohort, the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry genes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 exhibited a gestational-age dependent expression profile, i.e. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA was higher (p<0.05) in the first trimester compared to second trimester, PTB and term placentae (p<0.05) and exhibited a negative correlation with gestational age (p<0.05). In the second cohort, RNAseq demonstrated very low/undetectable expression levels of ACE2 in PTB, PE and term decidua and in placentae from late gestation. In contrast, TMPRSS2 was expressed in both decidual and placental samples but did not change in pregnancies complicated by either PTB or PE. Conclusions The increased expression of these SARS-CoV-2 cell entry associated genes in the placenta during the first trimester compared to later stages of pregnancy suggest the possibility of differential susceptibility to placental entry to SARS-CoV-2 across pregnancy. Even though there is some evidence of increased rates of PTB associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found no increase in mRNA expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 at the maternal-fetal interface.","Bloise, Enrrico; Zhang, Jianhong; Nakpu, Jittanan; Hamada, Hirotaka; Dunk, Caroline E.; Li, Siliang; Imperio, Guinever E.; Nadeem, Lubna; Kibschull, Mark; Lye, Phetcharawan; Matthews, Stephen G.; Lye, Stephen J.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000293782030884X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853537/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000293782030884X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.08.055,435
617309,Patient satisfaction and acceptability with telehealth at specialist medical outpatient clinics during the COVID‐19 pandemic in Australia,2021-07-02,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus’s capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID-19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated.","Bollavaram, Keval; Leeman, Tiffanie H.; Lee, Maggie W.; Kulkarni, Akhil; Upshaw, Sophia G.; Yang, Jiabei; Song, Hannah; Platt, Manu O.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431617,435

Individuals in the USA and the UK are self-isolating in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Different motivations may drive their self-isolation: some might see value in it (understood as the identified form of autonomous motivation), while others might feel forced into it by authorities or close others (family, friends, neighbourhoods, doctors; the external form of controlled motivation). People who typically prefer company will find themselves spending more time alone, and may experience ill-being uniformly, or as a function of their identified or external motivations for self-isolation. Self-isolation, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to distinguish two constructs coming from disparate literatures. This project examined preference and motivation (identified and external) for solitude, and tested their independent and interacting contributions to ill-being (loneliness, depression and anxiety during the time spent alone) across two weeks. Confirmatory hypotheses regarding preference and motivation were not supported by the data. A statistically significant effect of controlled motivation on change in ill-being was observed one week later, and preference predicted ill-being across two weeks.

An increasing number of reports reveal that similar to the proteins of animal viruses, many plant virus proteins localize in the nucleolus to divert host nucleolar proteins from their natural functions in order to exert novel role(s) in the virus infection cycle. This chapter will highlight studies showing how plant viruses recruit nucleolar functions to facilitate virus translation and replication, virus movement and assembly of virus-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, and to counteract plant host defense responses. Plant viruses also provide a valuable tool to gain new insights into novel nucleolar functions and processes. Investigating the interactions between plant viruses and the nucleolus will facilitate the design of novel strategies to control plant virus infections.","Taliansky, M.E.; Brown, J.W.S.; Rajamäki, M.L.; Valkonen, J.P.T.; Kalinina, N.O.",Adv Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123850348000053; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123850348000053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20951872/; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-385034-8.00005-3,435
618413,How the experience of medical assistance in dying changed during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: a qualitative study of providers,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection carries a substantial risk of severe and prolonged illness; treatment options are currently limited. We assessed the efficacy and safety of inhaled nebulised interferon beta-1a (SNG001) for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the change in clinical condition on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) during the dosing period in the intention-to-treat population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug). The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death. Multiple analyses were done to identify the most suitable statistical method for future clinical trials. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events for 28 days. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2020-001023-14) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04385095); the pilot trial of inpatients with COVID-19 is now completed. FINDINGS: Between March 30 and May 30, 2020, 101 patients were randomly assigned to SNG001 (n=50) or placebo (n=51). 48 received SNG001 and 50 received placebo and were included in the intention-to-treat population. 66 (67%) patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline: 29 in the placebo group and 37 in the SNG001 group. Patients receiving SNG001 had greater odds of improvement on the OSCI scale (odds ratio 2·32 [95% CI 1·07–5·04]; p=0·033) on day 15 or 16 and were more likely than those receiving placebo to recover to an OSCI score of 1 (no limitation of activities) during treatment (hazard ratio 2·19 [95% CI 1·03–4·69]; p=0·043). SNG001 was well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (seven [15%] patients in the SNG001 group and five [10%] in the placebo group). There were three deaths in the placebo group and none in the SNG001 group. INTERPRETATION: Patients who received SNG001 had greater odds of improvement and recovered more rapidly from SARS-CoV-2 infection than patients who received placebo, providing a strong rationale for further trials.

The objective of this study is to analyze psychological distress in a sample of Spanish population, identifying the predictive nature of the information received, the preventive measures taken, level of concern, beliefs, and knowledge about the infection. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on a sample of 4615 participants. Data were collected through a self-prepared questionnaire and the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12). Bivariate analyses and logistic regressions were performed. Of the total participants, 71.98% presented psychological distress. The study population actively sought information about coronavirus, expressed a high level of concern and knowledge, and the most frequent preventive behavior was hand washing. As predictive factors, the degree of concern for COVID-19 was identified (odds ratio (OR) = 1.244, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.179, 1.312]), the number of hours spent consulting information on COVID-19 (OR = 1.038, 95% CI = [1.009, 1.068]), or the need for psychological support (OR = 1.135, 95% CI = [1.094, 1.177]), among others. These results could help design more effective strategies towards a psycho-emotional approach for the population when in similar health crisis situations.

619381,Reducing risks associated with medicines and lifestyle in a residential care population with intellectual disabilities: evaluation of a pharmacy review initiative in England,2021-08-17,"African horse sickness virus (AHSV), an orbivirus in the Reoviridae family with nine different serotypes, causes devastating disease in equids. The virion particle is composed of seven proteins organized in three concentric layers, an outer layer made of VP2 and VP5, a middle layer made of VP7, and inner layer made of VP3 that encloses a replicase complex of VP1, VP4, and VP6 and a genome of 10 double-stranded RNA segments. In this study, we sought to develop highly efficacious candidate vaccines against all AHSV serotypes, taking into account not only immunogenic and safety properties but also virus productivity and stability parameters, which are essential criteria for vaccine candidates. To achieve this goal, we first established a highly efficient reverse genetics (RG) system for AHSV serotype 1 (AHSV1) and, subsequently, a VP6-defective AHSV1 strain in combination with in trans complementation of VP6. This was then used to generate defective particles of all nine serotypes, which required the exchange of two to five RNA segments to achieve equivalent titers of particles. All reassortant-defective viruses could be amplified and propagated to high titers in cells complemented with VP6 but were totally incompetent in any other cells. Furthermore, these replication-incompetent AHSV particles were demonstrated to be highly protective against homologous virulent virus challenges in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-knockout mice. Thus, these defective viruses have the potential to be used for the development of safe and stable vaccine candidates. The RG system also provides a powerful tool for the study of the role of individual AHSV proteins in virus assembly, morphogenesis, and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE African horse sickness virus is transmitted by biting midges and causes African horse sickness in equids, with mortality reaching up to 95% in naive horses. Therefore, the development of efficient vaccines is extremely important due to major economic losses in the equine industry. Through the establishment of a highly efficient RG system, replication-deficient viruses of all nine AHSV serotypes were generated. These defective viruses achieved high titers in a cell line complemented with VP6 but failed to propagate in wild-type mammalian or insect cells. Importantly, these candidate vaccine strains showed strong protective efficacy against AHSV infection in an IFNAR(−/−) mouse model.","Lulla, Valeria; Lulla, Aleksei; Wernike, Kerstin; Aebischer, Andrea; Beer, Martin; Roy, Polly",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27279609/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00548-16,435

In this study, we evaluated the antiviral effects and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol in patients with the 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19). Fifty patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were divided into two groups: including lopinavir/ritonavir group (34 cases) and arbidol group (16 cases). Lopinavir/ritonavir group received 400 mg/100mg of Lopinavir/ritonavir, twice a day for a week, while the arbidol group was given 0.2 g arbidol, three times a day. Data from these patients were retrospectively analyzed. The cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1ab and nucleocapsid genes by RT-PCR assay were monitored during antiviral therapy. None of the patients developed severe pneumonia or ARDS. There was no difference in fever duration between the two groups (P=0.61). On day 14 after the admission, no viral load was detected in arbidol group, but the viral load was found in 15(44.1%) patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Patients in the arbidol group had a shorter duration of positive RNA test compared to those in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (P<0.01). Moreover, no apparent side effects were found in both groups. In conclusion, our data indicate that arbidol monotherapy may be superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19.","Zhu, Zhen; Lu, Zhaohui; Xu, Tianmin; Chen, Cong; Yang, Gang; Zha, Tao; Lu, Jianchun; Xue, Yuan",J Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445320301882; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163445320301882; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32283143/,435
620530,3219 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Southeast Michigan: a retrospective case cohort study,2021-04-07,"The ongoing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has promoted to develop novel serological testing technologies since they can be effectively complementary to RT-PCR. Here, a new all-fiber Fresnel reflection microfluidic biosensor (FRMB) was constructed through combining all-fiber optical system, microfluidic chip, and multimode fiber bio-probe. The transmission of the incident light and the collection and transmission of Fresnel reflection light are achieved using a single-multi-mode fiber optic coupler (SMFC) without any other optical separation elements. This compact design greatly simplifies the whole system structure and improves light transmission efficiency, which makes it suitable for the label-free, sensitive, and easy-to-use point-of-care testing (POCT) of targets in nanoliter samples. Based on Fresnel reflection mechanism and immunoassay principle, both the SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could be sensitively quantified in 7 min using the secondary antibodies-modified multimode fiber bio-probe. The FRMB performs in one-step, is accurate, label-free, and sensitive in situ/on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG in serum with simple dilution only. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and SARS-CoV-2 IgG were 0.82 ng/mL and 0.45 ng/mL, respectively. Based on our proposed theory, the affinity constants of SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibody and their respective secondary antibodies were also determined. The FRMB can be readily extended as a universal platform for the label-free, rapid, and sensitive in situ/on-site measurement of other biomarkers and the investigation of biomolecular interaction.

One of the most common applications of MinION is for nanopore-based DNA barcoding in situ for species identification and discovery, yet the existing sample capability is limited (n ≤ 10). Here, we assembled a portable sequencing setup comprising the BentoLab and MinION and developed a workflow capable of processing 32 samples simultaneously. We demonstrated this enhanced capability out at sea, where we collected samples and barcoded them onboard a dive vessel moored off Sisters’ Islands Marine Park, Singapore. In under 9 h, we generated 105 MinION barcodes, of which 19 belonged to fresh metazoans processed immediately after collection. Our setup is thus viable and would greatly fortify existing portable DNA barcoding capabilities. We also tested the performance of the newly released R10.3 nanopore flow cell for DNA barcoding, and showed that the barcodes generated were ~99.9% accurate when compared to Illumina references. A total of 80% of the R10.3 nanopore barcodes also had zero base ambiguities, compared to 50–60% for R9.4.1, suggesting an improved homopolymer resolution and making the use of R10.3 highly recommended.","Chang, Jia Jin Marc; Ip, Yin Cheong Aden; Ng, Chin Soon Lionel; Huang, Danwei",Genes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11101121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987804/,435
622936,Homecare and the COVID-19 Pandemic – Experience at an Urban Specialist Cancer Palliative Center,2020-06-30,"Menstrual health has received increasing recognition as an essential issue for public health and gender equality. A growing body of research has elucidated adolescent girls’ menstrual needs and informed policy and practice responses. However, the experiences of adult women have received little attention, particularly in the workplace where many spend a significant proportion of their lives. To address this gap, we took a grounded theory approach to generate a nuanced understanding of working women’s menstrual experiences, and the impact of menstruation on their work and health in Mukono District, Uganda. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 35 women aged 18–49. This included 21 women working in markets, 7 teachers and 7 healthcare facility workers. Frequent collaborative analysis sessions throughout data collection, coding of interview transcripts, and generation of participant, workplace, and category memos facilitated analysis. Our core category and underlying theory, ‘being a responsible woman’, underpinned women’s experiences. ‘Being responsible’ meant keeping menstruation secret, and the body clean, at all times. These gendered expectations meant that any difficulty managing menses represented a failure of womanhood, met with disgust and shame. Difficulties with menstrual pain and heavy bleeding were excepted from these expectations and perceived as requiring compassion. Commercial menstrual products were expensive for most women, and many expressed concerns about the quality of cheaper brands. Workplace infrastructure, particularly unreliable water supply and cleanliness, was problematic for many women who resorted to travelling home or to other facilities to meet their needs. Menstruation presented a burden at work, causing some women to miss work and income, and many others to endure pain, discomfort and anxiety throughout their day. Our findings can inform norm and resource-focused responses to improve experiences and should provoke critical reflection on the discourse used in menstrual health advocacy in Uganda.","Hennegan, Julie; Kibira, Simon P S; Exum, Natalie G; Schwab, Kellogg J; Makumbi, Fredrick E; Bukenya, Justine",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219001/,435

However, there is scarce knowledge about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. RESULTS: Here, we reveal that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain. Using CLIP-seq and SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, we uncover TRIM25’s endogenous RNA targets and protein binding partners. We demonstrate that TRIM25 controls the levels of Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP). Finally, we show that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is important for its ubiquitin ligase activity towards itself (autoubiquitination) and its physiologically relevant target ZAP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that many other proteins with the PRY/SPRY domain could have yet uncharacterized RNA-binding potential. Together, our data reveal new insights into the molecular roles and characteristics of RNA-binding E3 ubiquitin ligases and demonstrate that RNA could be an essential factor in their enzymatic activity.

In this literature review, we aimed to investigate which school CS programs exist in the areas of (applied) life sciences and if any projects target infectious disease surveillance. This review’s objectives are to determine success factors in terms of data quality and student engagement. After a comprehensive search in biomedical and social databases, we found 23 projects. None of the projects found focused on infectious disease surveillance, and the majority centered around species biodiversity. While a few projects had issues with data quality, simplifying the protocol or allowing students to resubmit data made the data collected more usable. Overall, students at different educational levels and disciplines were able to collect usable data that was comparable to expert data and had positive learning experiences.

Our objective was to quantify the presence and magnitude of antibody response in vaccinated, older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities. DESIGN: A cross-sectional quality improvement study was conducted March 15 – April 1, 2021 in the greater Pittsburgh region. SETTING: and Population: Participants were older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities, who received mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Conditions that impair immune responses were exclusionary criteria. METHODS: Sera were collected to measure IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody level with reflex to total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin levels, and blinded evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple linear regression analysis evaluated relationships between factors potentially associated with antibody levels. Spearman correlations were calculated between antibody levels and neutralization titers. RESULTS: All participants (N = 70) had received two rounds of vaccination and were found to have antibodies with wide variation in relative levels. Antibody levels trended lower in males, advanced age, current use of steroids, and longer length of time from vaccination. Pseudovirus neutralization titer levels were strongly correlated (P < .001) with Beckman Coulter antibody levels (D614 G NT50, r(s) = 0.91; B.1.1.7 [UK] NT50, r(s) = 0.91). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Higher functioning, healthier, residential older adults mounted detectable antibody responses when vaccinated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. Data suggests some degree of immunity is present during the immediate period following vaccination. However, protective effects remain to be determined in larger studies as clinical protection is afforded by ongoing adaptive immunity, which is known to be decreased in older adults. This study provides important preliminary results on level of population risk in older adult residents at assisted living, personal care, and independent living communities to inform reopening strategies, but are not likely to be translatable for residents in nursing homes.","Nace, David A.; Kip, Kevin E.; Mellors, John W.; Peck Palmer, Octavia M.; Shurin, Michael R.; Mulvey, Katie; Crandall, Melissa; Sobolewski, Michele D.; Enick, P.

625707,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Emergency Department of a tertiary children’s hospital,2021-01-29,"Chemokines and their receptors function in the recruitment and activation of cells of the immune system to sites of inflammation. As such, chemokines play an important role in mediating pathophysiological events during microbial infection. In particular, CXCL9, 10 and 11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3 have been associated with the clinical course of several infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza. While CXCL9, 10 and 11 share the same receptor and have overlapping functions, each can also have unique activity in host defense. The lack of a preferred characterized animal model for SARS has brought our attention to ferrets, which have been used for years in influenza studies. The lack of immunological reagents for ferrets prompted us to clone CXCL9, 10, 11 and CXCR3 and, in the case of CXCL10, to express the gene as a recombinant protein. In this study we demonstrate that endogenous ferret CXCL10 exhibits similar mRNA expression patterns in the lungs of deceased SARS patients and ferrets experimentally infected with SARS coronavirus. This study therefore represents an important step towards development of the ferret as a model for the role of CXCL9, 10 and 11:CXCR3 axis in severe viral infections.","Danesh, Ali; Seneviratne, Charit; Cameron, Cheryl M.; Banner, David; Devries, Mark E.; Kelvin, Alyson A.; Xu, Luoling; Ran, Longsi; Bosinger, Steven E.; Rowe, Thomas; Czub, Marcus; Jonsson, Colleen B.; Cameron, Mark J.; Kelvin, David J.",Molecular Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18006061/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016158900700747X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016158900700747X; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5653245?pdf=render,435
625826,Addressing the Mental Health Challenges of Cancer Care Workers in LMICs During the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-10-05,"Vascular endothelial activation, marked by de novo expression of E-selectin, is an early and essential event in the process of leukocyte extravasation and inflammation. Evidence suggests that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates inflammation in animal models of renal disease, implying that HGF might inhibit specific components of the inflammatory response. This study examined the effect of HGF on endothelial E-selectin expression in acute inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In vitro, HGF suppressed TNF-α-induced cell surface expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited E-selectin mediated monocytic adhesion to endothelial monolayers. HGF activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt that in turn inhibited its downstream transducer glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3. Blockade of the PI3K–Akt pathway with specific inhibitors abrogated HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppression of E-selectin. In addition, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity by lithium suppressed TNF-α-induced E-selectin expression and monocytic adhesion, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Moreover, ectopic expression of an uninhibitable mutant GSK3β, in which the regulatory serine-9 is replaced by alanine, abolished HGF's suppressive effect on endothelial E-selectin. In vivo, administration of exogenous HGF reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin induced by bolus injection of TNF-α. This was associated with less sequestration of circulating fluorescence-labeled macrophages in the kidney. These findings suggest that HGF ameliorates acute renal inflammation in part by downregulating E-selectin mediated macrophage adhesion to the inflamed endothelium.","Gong, R.; Rifai, A.; Dworkin, L.D.",Kidney Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16501492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253815516505; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815516505,435
626031,Assessment of the Prevalence of Symptoms in Patients Under Institutional Isolation in COVID-19 Pandemic in India,2020-06-30,"Abstract Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that cause ocular and sexually transmitted diseases, and are associated with cardiovascular diseases. The analysis of codon usage may improve our understanding of the evolution and pathogenesis of Chlamydia and allow reengineering of target genes to improve their expression for gene therapy. Here, we analyzed the codon usage of C. muridarum, C. trachomatis (here indicating biovar trachoma and LGV), C. pneumoniae, and C. psittaci using the codon usage database and the CUSP (Create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). The results show that the four genomes have similar codon usage patterns, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the third codon position. Compared with Homo sapiens, the four chlamydial species show discordant seven or eight preferred codons. The ENC (effective number of codons used in a gene)‐plot reveals that the genetic heterogeneity in Chlamydia is constrained by the G+C content, while translational selection and gene length exert relatively weaker influences. Moreover, mutational pressure appears to be the major determinant of the codon usage variation among the chlamydial genes. In addition, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of E. coli, yeast, adenovirus and Homo sapiens. There are 23 codons showing distinct usage differences between C. trachomatis and E. coli, 24 between C. trachomatis and adenovirus, 21 between C. trachomatis and Homo sapiens, but only six codons between C. trachomatis and yeast. Therefore, the yeast system may be more suitable for the expression of chlamydial genes. Finally, we compared the codon preferences of C. trachomatis with those of six eukaryotes, eight prokaryotes and 23 viruses. There is a strong positive correlation between the differences in coding GC content and the variations in codon bias (r=0.905, P<0.001). We conclude that the variation of codon bias between C. trachomatis and other organisms is much less influenced by phylogenetic lineage and primarily determined by the extent of disparities in GC content.

METHODS: Forty-two patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Yongzhou Central Hospital, Hunan, China, between January 20, 2020, and March 2, 2020, were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using anal swab viral RT-PCR. In this report, we present the clinical characteristics and chest CT features of six patients with positive anal swab results and compare the clinical, laboratory, and CT findings between the positive and negative groups. RESULTS: The anal swab positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in discharged patients was 14.3% (6/42). All six patients were male. In the positive group, 40% of the patients (2/5) had a positive stool occult blood test (OBT), but none had diarrhea. The median duration of fever and major symptoms (except fever) in the positive patients was shorter than that of the negative patients (1 day vs. 6 days, 4.5 days vs. 10.5 days, respectively). The incidence of asymptomatic cases in the positive group (33.3%) was also higher than that of the negative group (5.6%). There were no significant differences in the CT manifestation or evolution of the pulmonary lesions between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In our case series, patients with viral RNA positive anal swabs did not exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, and their main symptoms disappeared early. They had similar CT features to the negative patients, which may be easier to be ignored. A positive OBT may indicate gastrointestinal damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhou, Hui; Zhu, Liping; Leng, Yueshuang; Wang, Dongcui; Bai, Harrison X.; Xiong, Zeng; Shi, Linbo; Liao, Weihua",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873230/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05363-2,435

Therefore, it is important to investigate the psychological consequences of this process, given the unique situation that has been experienced globally. Therefore, the present study examined whether intolerance of uncertainty was related to mental wellbeing and whether this relationship was mediated by rumination and fear of COVID-19. The sample comprised 1772 Turkish individuals (aged between 18 and 73 years) from 79 of 81 cities in Turkey, who completed measures of mental wellbeing, intolerance of uncertainty, rumination, and fear of COVID-19. Results of serial mediation analyses showed that intolerance of uncertainty had a significant direct effect on mental wellbeing. Rumination and fear of COVID-19, in combination, serially mediated the association between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing. The findings are discussed within the framework of the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and related literature.","Satici, Begum; Saricali, Mehmet; Satici, Seydi Ahmet; Griffiths, Mark D.",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427165/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00305-0,435

We employ a large panel data of 5.6 million daily transactions from 2.6 million debit cards owned by the low-income population in the U.S. to quantify the joint impacts of the state lockdowns and stimulus payments on this population’s spending along the inter-temporal, geo-spatial, and cross-categorical dimensions. Leveraging the difference-in-differences analyses at the per card and zip code levels, we uncover three key findings. (1) Inter-temporally, the state lockdowns diminished the daily average spending relative to the same period in 2019 by $3.9 per card and $2,214 per zip code, whereas the stimulus payments elevated the daily average spending by $15.7 per card and $3,307 per zip code. (2) Spatial heterogeneity prevailed: Democratic zip codes displayed much more volatile dynamics, with an initial decline three times that of Republican zip codes, followed by a higher rebound and a net gain after the stimulus payments; also, Southwest exhibited the highest initial decline whereas Southeast had the largest net gain after the stimulus payments. (3) Across 26 categories, the stimulus payments promoted spending in those categories that enhanced public health and charitable donations, reduced food insecurity and digital divide, while having also stimulated non-essential and even undesirable categories, such as liquor and cigar. In addition, spatial association analysis was employed to identify spatial dependency and local hot spots of spending changes at the county level. Overall, these analyses reveal the imperative need for more geo- and category-targeted stimulus programs, as well as more effective and strategic policy communications, to protect and promote the well-being of the low-income population during public health and economic crises.","Li, Kangli; Foutz, Natasha Zhang; Cai, Yuxin; Liang, Yunlei; Gao, Song",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495996/,435

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A paper survey in booklet form was administered to attendees at 2 general medical conferences in May 2019. The survey was divided into 5 sections: knowledge of health systems and policy, knowledge of public health concepts and function, public health engagement, public health education, and demographics. RESULTS: One hundred two surveys were received from 402 attendees (response rate, 24.3%). Most were male (56%), older than 50 years (51%), and physicians (86%). Respondents had a fairly good knowledge of federal health programs (77%) and public health functions (84%), but less than half had a personal interaction with public health in the past 2 years (45%) or were aware of how to work with public health organizations in their community (46%). Only a few respondents rated their public health training as good or excellent during their primary degree (7%) or graduate medical education (15%), and most (75%) were interested in learning more about public health and health policy. CONCLUSION: Respondents had generally good foundational knowledge of federal health programs and public health functions, although some gaps were identified. Inclusion of health policy and public health topics in continuing medical education would be well received by clinicians. To improve collaboration between public health and medicine, public health should personally engage clinicians more and explain how they can work together to improve population health.","Bornstein, Shari; Markos, James-Roland; Murad, M.

Strains of TCoV that were pathogenic in poults and nonpathogenic in chickens did not adapt to cause disease in chickens. Comparative genomics revealed two recombination sites that replaced the spike gene in IBV with an unidentified sequence likely from another coronavirus, resulting in cross-species transmission and a pathogenicity shift. Following emergence in turkeys, TCoV diverged to different serotypes through the accumulation of mutations within spike. This is the first evidence that recombination can directly lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses and new coronaviral diseases, emphasizing the importance of limiting exposure to reservoirs of coronaviruses that can serve as a source of genetic material for emerging viruses.","Jackwood, Mark W.; Boynton, Tye O.; Hilt, Deborah A.; McKinley, Enid T.; Kissinger, Jessica C.; Paterson, Andrew H.; Robertson, Jon; Lemke, Conelia; McCall, Amber W.; Williams, Susan M.; Jackwood, Joshua W.; Byrd, Lauren A.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022075/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.11.044; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682209007806; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682209007806,435

The causative agent for this respiratory disease is a member of the betacoronavirus genus, phylogenetically closely related to the SARS coronavirus that caused an international health emergency in 2002. With lessons learned from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, and with undeniable technological advances, vaccine development against MERS was initially fast-paced and has produced several DNA and protein vaccine candidates with promising results during early pre-clinical testing. At least one vaccine candidate has even entered first-in-humans clinical trials now. With the number of MERS cases declining though and other infectious diseases attracting increased attention, the question remains, whether, similar to the situation after the SARS pandemic, vaccine development is halted or remains the priority it rightfully should.","Lee, Hai Yen; Nyon, Mun Peak; Strych, Ulrich",Curr Trop Med Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40475-016-0084-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226714/,435

The diagnosis and management of cancer is time sensitive and is likely to be substantially affected by these disruptions. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in India. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional cohort study at 41 cancer centres across India that were members of the National Cancer Grid of India to compare provision of oncology services between March 1 and May 31, 2020, with the same time period in 2019. We collected data on new patient registrations, number of patients visiting outpatient clinics, hospital admissions, day care admissions for chemotherapy, minor and major surgeries, patients accessing radiotherapy, diagnostic tests done (pathology reports, CT scans, MRI scans), and palliative care referrals. We also obtained estimates from participating centres on cancer screening, research, and educational activities (teaching of postgraduate students and trainees). We calculated proportional reductions in the provision of oncology services in 2020, compared with 2019. FINDINGS: Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, the number of new patients registered decreased from 112 270 to 51 760 (54% reduction), patients who had follow-up visits decreased from 634 745 to 340 984 (46% reduction), hospital admissions decreased from 88 801 to 56 885 (36% reduction), outpatient chemotherapy decreased from 173634 to 109 107 (37% reduction), the number of major surgeries decreased from 17 120 to 8677 (49% reduction), minor surgeries from 18 004 to 8630 (52% reduction), patients accessing radiotherapy from 51 142 to 39 365 (23% reduction), pathological diagnostic tests from 398 373 to 246 616 (38% reduction), number of radiological diagnostic tests from 93 449 to 53 560 (43% reduction), and palliative care referrals from 19 474 to 13 890 (29% reduction). These reductions were even more marked between April and May, 2020. Cancer screening was stopped completely or was functioning at less than 25% of usual capacity at more than 70% of centres during these months. Reductions in the provision of oncology services were higher for centres in tier 1 cities (larger cities) than tier 2 and 3 cities (smaller cities). INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable impact on the delivery of oncology services in India. The long-term impact of cessation of cancer screening and delayed hospital visits on cancer stage migration and outcomes are likely to be substantial. FUNDING: None.

631774,The impact of COVID-19 on the physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels of pregnant women with gestational diabetes,2021-08-20,"Insular populations have traditionally drawn a lot of attention from epidemiologists as they provide important insights regarding transmission of infectious diseases and propagation of epidemics. There are numerous historical instances where isolated populations showed high morbidity once a new virus entered the population. Building upon that and recent findings that the activation of the behavioral immune system (BIS) depends both upon one’s vulnerability and environmental context, we predicted that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, place of residence (island vs. mainland) explains a significant proportion of variance in preferred interpersonal distances, animosity toward strangers, and willingness to punish those who do not adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. With 48 populated islands, Croatia provides a fruitful testing ground for this prediction. We also opted to explore relations among BIS-related variables (pathogen disgust, germ aversion, and perceived infectability) and social cognitions in a more natural context than has previously been done. The study was conducted online, on Croatian residents, during April and May 2020. As expected, the BIS variables contributed significantly to preferred interpersonal distances, negative emotions toward strangers, and willingness to punish those who do not adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, our results showed that geographical location explained a significant amount of variance in preferred social (but not personal and intimate) distances and negative emotions toward foreigners. As Croatian islands are extremely frequent travel destinations, these differences between mainlanders and islanders cannot be explained by the lack of exposure to foreigners. Additionally, we found that scores on preferred interpersonal distances, pathogen disgust, and germ aversion were significantly higher compared to those obtained in Croatian samples before the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, men scored higher in perceived infectability than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and women did not, which reflects the objectively higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 for men than for women. Taken together, our results support the notion that BIS is a highly adaptive and context-dependent response system, likely more reactive in more susceptible individuals.","Hromatko, Ivana; Grus, Andrea; Kolđeraj, Gabrijela",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995203/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647586,435

However, their effectiveness depends on the population’s preventive behaviour, which may be divergent from public policies. Therefore, this study aims to summarise and evaluate the evidence on barriers and facilitators to populational adherence to prevention and control measures in COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search on MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO for studies focusing on adults receiving protective behaviour recommendations to combat COVID-19 and other respiratory infectious diseases. The searches will be carried out from database’s inception to the present. We will include studies that use qualitative methods in their data collection and analysis and studies that use mixed methods if they include any qualitative methods of analysis. Studies published in English, Portuguese and Spanish will be included. Two review authors will independently screen the studies for inclusion and extract data. We will assess the quality of the included studies using the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme tool. For the assessment of the confidence in the synthesised findings, we will use the GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research.

632254,Correlates of Quality of Life in Anxiety Disorders: Review of Recent Research,2021-10-06,"Oligomeric spike (S) glycoproteins extend from coronavirus membranes. These integral membrane proteins assemble within the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells and are subsequently endoproteolyzed in the Golgi, generating noncovalently associated S1 and S2 fragments. Once on the surface of infected cells and virions, peripheral S1 fragments bind carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) receptors, and this triggers membrane fusion reactions mediated by integral membrane S2 fragments. We focused on the quaternary structure of S and its interaction with CEACAMs. We discovered that soluble S1 fragments were dimers and that CEACAM binding was entirely dependent on this quaternary structure. However, two differentially tagged CEACAMs could not co-precipitate with the S dimers, suggesting that binding sites were closely juxtaposed in the dimer (steric hindrance) or that a single CEACAM generated global conformational changes that precluded additional interactions (negative cooperativity). CEACAM binding did indeed alter S1 conformations, generating alternative disulfide linkages that were revealed on SDS gels. CEACAM binding also induced separation of S1 and S2. Differentially tagged S2 fragments that were free of S1 dimers were not co-precipitated, suggesting that S1 harbored the primary oligomerization determinants. We discuss the distinctions between the S·CEACAM interaction and other virus-receptor complexes involved in receptor-triggered entry.","Lewicki, Daniel N.; Gallagher, Thomas M.",J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11912215/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820850388; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820850388,435

MethodsA retrospective cohort study of adults with COVID-19 admitted to seven intensive care units (ICUs) in England up to 18 May 2020, was performed. Patients with completed ICU stays were included. The proportion and type of organisms were determined at <48 and >48 hours following hospital admission, corresponding to community and hospital-acquired co-infections. ResultsOf 254 patients studied (median age 59 years (IQR 49-69); 64.6% male), 139 clinically significant organisms were identified from 83(32.7%) patients. Bacterial co-infections were identified within 48 hours of admission in 14(5.5%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of ICU stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The co-infection rate >48 hours after admission was 27/1000 person-days (95% CI 21.3-34.1). Patients with co-infections were more likely to die in ICU (crude OR 1.78,95% CI 1.03-3.08, p=0.04) compared to those without co-infections.

636162,COVID: A Potential but Preventable Workplace Hazard,2020-08-19,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a mass bereavement event which has profoundly disrupted grief experiences. Understanding support needs and access to support among people bereaved at this time is crucial to ensuring appropriate bereavement support infrastructure. Aim: To investigate grief experiences, support needs and use of formal and informal bereavement support among people bereaved during the pandemic. Design: Baseline results from a longitudinal survey. Support needs and experiences of accessing support are reported using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis of free-text data. Setting/Participants: 711 adults bereaved in the UK between March-December 2020, recruited via media, social media, national associations and community/charitable organisations. Results: High-level needs for emotional support were identified. Most participants had not sought support from bereavement services (59%, n=422) or their GP (60%, n=428). Of participants who had sought such support, over half experienced difficulties accessing bereavement services (56%, n=149)/GP support (52%, n=135). 51% reported high/severe vulnerability in grief; among these, 74% were not accessing bereavement or mental-health services. Barriers included limited availability, lack of appropriate support, discomfort asking for help, and not knowing how to access services. 39% (n=279) experienced difficulties getting support from family/friends, including relational challenges, little face-to-face contact, and disrupted collective mourning. The perceived uniqueness of pandemic bereavement and wider societal strains exacerbated their isolation. Conclusions: People bereaved during the pandemic have high levels of support needs alongside difficulties accessing support. We recommend increased provision and tailoring of bereavement services, improved information on support options, and social/educational initiatives to bolster informal support and ameliorate isolation.","Harrop, E.

637038,Virtual dermatopathology: A potential educational tool during COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-06-04,"OBJECTIVE: Although prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is increasingly common, little is known concerning patient symptom burden or attitudes toward PMV. This study aims to describe the mood, well-being, distressing symptoms, and attitudes toward prolonged ventilation among PMV patients treated either at home or long-term acute care (LTAC). DESIGN: An observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 62 communicative participants treated with PMV, aged ≥18 years, insurees of a single HMO, treated at home hospital or LTAC specializing in ventilation in Jerusalem. MEASURES: Sociodemographic characteristics; chronic conditions; functional status; symptom burden measured by revised Edmonton Symptomatic Assessment System (r-ESAS); attitudes toward PVM. RESULTS: Participants were aged 61.7 ± 20.7 years, commonly suffered progressive neuromuscular disease (43.5%) or chronic lung disease (29%), were functionally dependent, treated at home (64.5%) or LTAC (35.5%), and had a mean PMV duration of 36.6 months (interquartile range 10.8-114.1). The 5-item, short Geriatric Depression Scale identified depression among 38% of participants, and was less at home vs LTAC (34% vs 44%, P < .001). Mean revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment System score was 24.5 ± 14.8 (maximum severity = 100), and participants reported severe or distressing symptoms for tiredness (27%/20%), pain (10%/25%), anxiety (16%/14%), depression (9%/21%), drowsiness (12%/17%), shortness of breath (9%/15%), poor appetite (7%/9%), and nausea (0%/10%). Impaired general well-being was reported as severe, moderate, mild, or none among 15%, 40%, 30%, and 15%, respectively. Only 1 patient had advance directives concerning ventilation prior to intubation, and when asked if they had to choose again today, 85% of patients would again opt for ventilation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Few PMV patients reported distressing symptoms, and 85% would choose ventilation if asked again. These findings might be useful in clinical practice to assist in decision making concerning prolonged ventilation.","Jacobs, Jeremy M.; Marcus, Esther-Lee; Stessman, Jochanan",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.07.037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861020306629; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861020306629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32907755/,435

This study describes the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on families with children in Canada. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This descriptive study used a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of adults living in Canada (n=3000) to examine the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes among parents with children <18 years old living at home (n=618) were compared with the rest of the sample. Data were collected via an online survey between 14 May to 29 May 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported on changes to their mental health since the onset of the pandemic and sources of stress, emotional responses, substance use patterns and suicidality/self-harm. Additionally, parents identified changes in their interactions with their children, impacts on their children’s mental health and sources of support accessed. RESULTS: 44.3% of parents with children <18 years living at home reported worse mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 35.6% of respondents without children <18 living at home, χ(2) (1, n=3000)=16.2, p<0.001. More parents compared with the rest of the sample reported increased alcohol consumption (27.7% vs 16.1%, χ(2) (1, n=3000)=43.8, p<0.001), suicidal thoughts/feelings (8.3% vs 5.2%, χ(2) (1, n=3000)=8.0, p=0.005) and stress about being safe from physical/emotional domestic violence (11.5% vs 7.9%, χ(2) (1, n=3000)=8.1, p=0.005). 24.8% (95% CI 21.4 to 28.4) of parents reported their children’s mental health had worsened since the pandemic. Parents also reported more frequent negative as well as positive interactions with their children due to the pandemic (eg, more conflicts, 22.2% (95% CI 19.0 to 25.7); increased feelings of closeness, 49.7% (95% CI 45.7 to 53.7)). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies that families with children <18 at home have experienced deteriorated mental health due to the pandemic.

Computational chemistry approaches hold the potential for triaging potential candidates far more quickly than their experimental counterparts. These methods have been widely used to search for small molecules that can inhibit critical proteins involved in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. An important target is the SARS-CoV-2 main protease Mpro, an enzyme that cleaves the viral polyproteins into individual proteins required for viral replication and transcription. Unfortunately, standard computational screening methods face difficulties in ranking diverse ligands to a receptor due to disparate ligand scaffolds and varying charge states. Here, we describe full density functional quantum mechanical (DFT) simulations of Mpro in complex with various ligands to obtain absolute ligand binding energies. Our calculations are enabled by a new cloud-native parallel DFT implementation running on computational resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS). The results we obtain are promising: the approach is quite capable of scoring a very diverse set of existing drug compounds for their affinities to M pro and suggest the DFT approach is potentially more broadly applicable to repurpose screening against this target. In addition, each DFT simulation required only ~ 1 h (wall clock time) per ligand. The fast turnaround time raises the practical possibility of a broad application of large-scale quantum mechanics in the drug discovery pipeline at stages where ligand diversity is essential.

638972,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Fellowship Training: A National Survey of Pediatric Otolaryngology Fellowship Directors,2020-06-23,"Abstract: Food‐ and waterborne viruses pose serious health risks to humans and were associated with many outbreaks worldwide. Rapid, accurate, and nondestructive methods for detection of viruses are of great importance to protect public health. In this study, surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with gold SERS‐active substrates was used to detect and discriminate 7 food‐ and waterborne viruses, including norovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, and herpersvirus. Virus samples were purified and dialyzed in phosphate buffered saline (8 to 9 log PFU/mL) and then further diluted in deionized water for SERS measurement. After capturing the characteristic SERS spectral patterns, multivariate statistical analyses, including soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were employed to analyze SERS spectral data for characterization and identification of viruses. The results show that SIMCA was able to differentiate viruses with and without envelope with >95% of classification accuracy, while PCA presented clear spectral data segregations between different virus strains. The virus detection limit by SERS using gold substrates reached a titer of 10(2). Practical Application: SERS is a simple, rapid, and accurate method for detection of food‐ and waterborne viruses. Our results demonstrate that coupled with gold substrates, SERS was able to rapidly detect and discriminate among different food‐ and waterborne viruses, indicating that SERS can provide rapid, sensitive, and reproducible detection results with minimum sample preparation for virus detection.","Fan, Cui; Hu, Zhiqiang; Riley, Lela K.; Purdy, Gregory A.; Mustapha, Azlin; Lin, Mengshi",J Food Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20629888/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01619.x,435

These COVID-19 disparities are but one example of how systemic racism filters into health outcomes for many Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC). With these issues front and center, more attention is being given to the ways that White medical professionals contribute to these disparities, including their socialization to ignore or deny inequities. As such, the present study sought to understand how educating White health-care pre-professionals about systemic racism might influence their understanding of and responsibility for disrupting White supremacy. Data were drawn from 49 White-identified nursing students who participated in a mapping project that uncovered instantiations of systemic racism in the United States. Participant written reflections were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings revealed that mapping projects can develop White people's knowledge and understanding of systemic racism.

The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is now the largest publicly available HIPAA limited dataset in US history with over 6.4 million patients and is a testament to a partnership of over 100 organizations. METHODS: We developed a pipeline for ingesting, harmonizing, and centralizing data from 56 contributing data partners using four federated Common Data Models. N3C Data quality (DQ) review involves both automated and manual procedures. In the process, several DQ heuristics were discovered in our centralized context, both within the pipeline and during downstream project-based analysis. Feedback to the sites led to many local and centralized DQ improvements. RESULTS: Beyond well-recognized DQ findings, we discovered 15 heuristics relating to source CDM conformance, demographics, COVID tests, conditions, encounters, measurements, observations, coding completeness and fitness for use. Of 56 sites, 37 sites (66%) demonstrated issues through these heuristics. These 37 sites demonstrated improvement after receiving feedback. DISCUSSION: We encountered site-to-site differences in DQ which would have been challenging to discover using federated checks alone. We have demonstrated that centralized DQ benchmarking reveals unique opportunities for data quality improvement that will support improved research analytics locally and in aggregate. CONCLUSION: By combining rapid, continual assessment of DQ with a large volume of multi-site data, it is possible to support more nuanced scientific questions with the scale and rigor that they require.","Pfaff, Emily R; Girvin, Andrew T; Gabriel, Davera L; Kostka, Kristin; Morris, Michele; Palchuk, Matvey; Lehmann, Harold P; Amor, Benjamin; Bissell, Mark; Bradwell, Katie R; Gold, Sigfried; Hong, Stephanie S; Loomba, Johanna; Manna, Amin; McMurry, Julie; Niehaus, Emily; Quresh, Nabeel; Walden, Anita; Zhang, Xiaohan Tanner; Zhu, Richard L; Moffitt, Richard A; Haendel, Melissa A; Chute, Christopher G",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34590684/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab217,435

643614,The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers under the Outbreak of COVID-19,2020-03-08,"Propolis is a natural product originating from life activity of honeybees. It exhibits wide range of biological properties applicable in medicine, the food industry, and cosmetics. Chemically, propolis is a complex and variable mixture with more than 300 identified biologically active components. Propolis's many health-promoting effects are attributed to different biochemical mechanisms, mediated by often-concerted actions of some of its many constituents. Propolis is considered safe and biocompatible. Yet due to its intrinsic complexity, standardization of propolis preparations for medical use as well as prediction of e.g. pathogen-specific interactions becomes a non-trivial task. In this work we demonstrate a new physical mechanism of propolis action, largely independent of specific nuances of propolis chemistry, which may underlie some of its biological actions. We show that propolis-bearing surfaces generate an extensive exclusion zone (EZ) water layer. EZ is an interfacial region of water capable of excluding solutes ranging from ions to microorganisms. Propolis-generated EZ may constitute an effective barrier, physically disabling the approach of various pathogens to the propolis-functionalized surfaces. We suggest possible implications of this new mechanism for propolis-based prevention of respiratory infections.","Kowacz, Magdalena; Pollack, Gerald H.",Colloid Interface Sci Commun,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221503822030087X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colcom.2020.100307; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221503822030087X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864353/,435
643926,Vitamin D and Hospital Admission in Older Adults: A Prospective Association,2021-02-14,"A previous report demonstrated the strong association between the presence of antibodies binding to an epitope region from SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, termed Ep9, and COVID-19 disease severity. Patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies (Abs) had hallmarks of antigenic imprinting (AIM), including early IgG upregulation and cytokine-associated injury. Thus, the immunological memory of a previous infection was hypothesized to drive formation of suboptimal anti-Ep9 Abs in severe COVID-19 infections. This study identifies a putative primary antigen capable of stimulating production of cross-reactive, anti-Ep9 Abs. Binding assays with patient blood samples directly show cross-reactivity between Abs binding to Ep9 and only one bioinformatics-derived, homologous potential antigen, a sequence derived from the neuraminidase protein of H3N2 Influenza A virus. This cross-reactive binding is highly influenza strain specific and sensitive to even single amino acid changes in epitope sequence. The neuraminidase protein is not present in the influenza vaccine, and the anti-Ep9 Abs likely resulted from the widespread influenza infection in 2014. Therefore, AIM from a previous infection could underlie some cases of COVID-19 disease severity. Importance Infections with SARS-COV-2 result in diverse disease outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal. The mechanisms underlying different disease outcomes remain largely unexplained. Previously, our laboratory identified a strong association between the presence of an antibody and increased disease severity in a subset of COVID-19 patients. Here, we report that this severity-associated antibody cross-reacts with viral proteins from an influenza A viral strain from 2014. Therefore, we speculate that antibodies generated against previous infections, like the 2014 influenza A, play a significant role in directing some peoples’ immune responses against SARS-COV-2. Such understanding of the sources and drivers of COVID-19 disease severity can help early identification and pre-emptive treatment.","Sen, Sanjana R.; Sanders, Emily C.; Santos, Alicia M.; Bhuvan, Keertna; Tang, Derek Y.; Gelston, Aidan A.; Miller, Brian M.; Ricks-Oddie, Joni L.; Weiss, Gregory A.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127968/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.445201,435
644910,Protocol for Functional Assessment of Adults and Older Adults after Hospitalization for COVID-19,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: To date, whether the immune response for SARS-CoV-2 infection among people living with HIV(PLWH) is different from HIV-naïve individuals is still not clear. METHODS: In this cohort study, COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan between January 15 and April 1, 2020, were enrolled. Patients were categorized into PLWH and HIV-naïve group. All patients were followed up regularly (every fifteen days) until November 30, 2020, and the immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 was observed. RESULTS: Totally, 18 PLWH and 185 HIV-naïve individuals with COVID-19 were enrolled. The positive conversion rates of IgG were 56% in PLWH and 88% in HIV-naïve patients respectively, and the peak was on the 45th day after COVID-19 onset. However, the positive rate of IgG dropped to 12% in PLWH and 33% among HIV-naïve individuals by the end of the study. The positive conversion rate of IgG among asymptomatic carriers is significantly lower than that among moderate patients (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05–0.65) and PLWH had a lower IgG seroconversion rate compared to the HIV-naive group (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.05–0.90). Patients with lower lymphocyte counts at onset had a higher positive conversion rate (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09–0.90) and longer duration for IgG (AHR = 4.01, 95% CI: 1.78–9.02). CONCLUSIONS: The positive conversion rate of IgG for SARS-CoV-2 was relatively lower and quickly lost in PLWH, which meant PLWH was in a disadvantaged situation when affected with COVID-19.","Liu, Yanbin; Xiao, Yanling; Wu, Songjie; Marly, Gifty; Ming, Fangzhao; Wang, Xiaoya; Wu, Mengmeng; Feng, Ling; Tang, Weiming; Liang, Ke",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127964/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-543375/v1,435
645148,Safe management of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19: a rapid systematic review,2020-05-14,"Background : COVID-19, the disease caused by the highly infectious and transmissible coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has quickly become a morbid global pandemic. Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less clinically apparent, collecting high-quality biospecimens from infants, children and adolescents in a standardized manner during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to establish a biologic understanding of the disease in the pediatric population. This biorepository enables pediatric centers world-wide to collect samples in a standardized manner to drive forward our understanding of COVID-19 by addressing specific pediatric and neonatal COVID-19-related questions. Methods : A broad study was implemented with strategic enrollment guidelines to include patients seen in urgent care clinics and hospital settings, neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and asymptomatic children. The methodology described here, details the importance of establishing collaborations between the clinical and research teams to harmonize protocols for patient recruitment and sample collection, processing and storage. Results : Considerations and challenges facing enrollment of neonatal and pediatric cohorts are described. A roadmap is laid out for successful collection, processing, storage and database management of multiple pediatric samples such as blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva, tracheal aspirates, stool, and urine. Using this methodology, we enrolled 327 participants, who provided a total of 972 biospecimens. Conclusions : Pediatric biospecimens will be key in answering questions relating to viral transmission by children, differences between pediatric and adult viral susceptibility, and, immune responses, the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on fetal development, and factors driving the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. The specimens in this biorepository will allow necessary comparative studies between children and adults, help determine the accuracy of current pediatric viral testing techniques, in addition to, understanding neonatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease abnormalities. The successful establishment of a pediatric biorepository is critical to provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and subsequently, develop future treatment and vaccination strategies.","Lima, Rosiane; Gootkind, Elizabeth; Flor, Denis De La; Yockey, Laura; Bordt, Evan; D'Avino, Paolo; Ning, Shen; Heath, Katerina; Harding, Katherine; Zois, Jaclyn; Park, Grace; Hardcastle, Margot; Grinke, Kathleen A.; Grimmel, Sheila; Forde, Pamela J.; Davidson, Susan P.; Hall, Kathryn E.; Neilan, Anne; Matute, Juan D.; Lerou, Paul H.; Fasano, Alessio; Shui, Jessica E.; Edlow, Andrea G.; Yonker, Lael M.",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-42030/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818214/,435

One such alternative is sample pooling. Here we compared commercial kits that are used in COVID-19 diagnostics, in terms of sensitivity and feasibility for use in pooling. We showed that pooling of up to 60 samples did not affect the efficiency of the kits. Also, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a more suitable target in pooled samples than the Envelope (E) protein. This approach could provide an easy method of screening large number of samples and help adjust different government regulations.","Petrovan, Vlad; Vrajmasu, Virgil; Dimon, Paula; Zaulet, Mihaela",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.120667,435

647592,"COVID-19 Related Psychological Distress, Fear and Coping: Identification of High-Risk Groups in Bangladesh",2021-08-13,"OBJECTIVES: To design and test a ventilator circuit that can be used for ventilation of two or more patients with a single ventilator, while allowing individualization of tidal volume, fractional concentration of oxygen, and positive end-expiratory pressure to each patient, irrespective of the other patient’s respiratory system mechanics. DESIGN: Description and proof of concept studies. SETTINGS: Respiratory therapy laboratory. SUBJECTS: Ventilation of mechanical test lungs. INTERVENTIONS: Following a previously advocated design, we used components readily available in our hospital to assemble two “bag-in-a-box” breathing circuits. Each patient circuit consisted of a flexible bag in a rigid container connected via one-way valve to a test lung, along with an inline positive end-expiratory pressure valve, connected to the ventilator’s expiratory limb. Compressed gas fills the bags during “patient” exhalation. During inspiration, gas from the ventilator, in pressure control mode, enters the containers and displaces gas from the bags to the test lungs. We varied tidal volume, “respiratory system” compliance, and positive end-expiratory pressure in one lung and observed the effect on the tidal volume of the other. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We were able to obtain different tidal volume, dynamic driving pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure in the two lungs under widely different compliances in both lungs. Complete obstruction, or disconnection at the circuit connection to one test lung, had minimal effect (< 5% on average) on the ventilation to the co-ventilated lung. CONCLUSIONS: A secondary circuit “bag-in-the-box” system enables individualized ventilation of two lungs overcoming many of the concerns of ventilating more than one patient with a single ventilator.","Han, Jay S.; Mashari, Azad; Singh, Devin; Dianti, Jose; Goligher, Ewan; Long, Michael; Ng, William; Wasowicz, Marcin; Preiss, David; Vesely, Alex; Kacmarek, Robert; Keshavjee, Shaf; Brochard, Laurent; Fisher, Joseph A.; Slutsky, Arthur S.",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32671348/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000118,435
648001,Cognitive consequences of COVID-19 in older adults with cognitive impairment,2021-04-30,"Infectious diseases are diagnosed by detection of a bacterium, virus, fungus, protozoan, or helminth in a patient with a compatible clinical illness. The methods of detection include cultivation of bacteria and fungi on growth medium, isolation of viruses in cell culture, and identification of the agent biochemically, antigenically, or genetically. Infectious diseases can also be identified by detection of a specific immune response, usually antibodies, that develop during the course of illness. Visualization of an agent in infected tissue can provide a diagnosis based on specific morphological characteristics or identify the category of organism, for example, gram-positive or gram-negative bacterium or virus (e.g., eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in neurons in rabies virus infection). Methods that detect and allow visualization of antigens (immunohistochemistry) or nucleic acid sequences (in situ hybridization) provide more specific diagnoses. Detection of specific nucleic acid sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction is a powerful molecular diagnostic tool. Since the elucidation of the etiology of the first infectious disease, anthrax, more than 135 years ago, Koch's postulates have been applied and modified as novel technologies and agents have emerged. During the last 45 years, more than 70 previously unknown agents of infections have been identified in emerging infectious diseases, a phenomenon that is likely to continue.","Walker, D.H.",Pathobiology of Human Disease,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123864567017135; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123864567017135,435

It argues that structural adjustment policies in the 1980s and 1990s as well as corruption and limited investment in recent times have severely weakened the country’s health system. This article also emphasises the interconnection between poverty, slums, and COVID-19. This interconnection brings to the fore inequality in Cameroon. Arguably, this inequality could facilitate the spread of COVID-19 in the country. This article draws attention to the political forces shaping the response to the pandemic and contends that in some regions in the country, the lack of an effective response to the pandemic may not necessarily be due to a lack of resources. In so doing, it critiques the COVID-19 orthodoxy that focuses exclusively on the pathology of the disease and advocates “technical” solutions to the pandemic, while ignoring the political and socio-economic forces that shape the fight against the pandemic. At times, medical supplies and other forms of assistance may be available, but structural violence impairs access to these resources.

Home health care may especially benefit older adults with diabetes through individualized education, advocacy, care coordination, and psychosocial support for patients and their caregivers. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between race/ethnicity and hospital discharge to home health care and subsequent utilization of home health care among a cohort of adults (age 50 and older) who experienced a diabetes-related hospitalization. The study was limited to patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare for at least 12 months and in the United States. The cohort (n = 786,758) was followed for 14 days after their diabetes-related index hospitalization, using linked Medicare administrative, claims, and assessment data (2014–2016). Multivariate logistic regression models included patient demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, geographic region, neighborhood deprivation, and rural/urban setting. In fully adjusted models, hospital discharge to home health care was significantly less likely among Hispanic (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.8–0.8) and American Indian (OR 0.8, CI 0.8–0.8) patients compared to White patients. Among those discharged to home health care, all non-white racial/ethnic minority patients were less likely to receive services within 14-days. Future efforts to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in post-acute care outcomes among patients with a diabetes-related hospitalization should include policies and practice guidelines that address structural racism and systemic barriers to accessing home health care services.","Smith, Jamie M.; Jarrín, Olga F.; Lin, Haiqun; Tsui, Jennifer; Dharamdasani, Tina; Thomas-Hawkins, Charlotte",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808769/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063196,435

We further demonstrate the existence in serum of protective neutralizing antibodies targeting co-dominant fusion (F) glycoprotein epitopes. Lack of a substantial reduction in serum neutralization of mutant measles viruses that retain even one of the co-dominant antigenic sites makes evolution of pathogenic measles viruses capable of escaping serum neutralization in vaccinated individuals extremely unlikely.","Muñoz-Alía, Miguel Ángel; Nace, Rebecca A.; Zhang, Lianwen; Russell, Stephen J.",Cell Rep Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948566/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2021.100225,435

However, accurate epidemiological and virological data, including genomic analysis where possible, are required to differentiate cases of prolonged viral RNA shedding (i.e. intermittent detection) from true reinfection. The objective of this review was to systematically identify and summarise all cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection confirmed by comparative genomic analysis. Methods: A protocol based on Cochrane rapid review methodology was employed. Databases and pre-print servers were searched until 9/11/2020. Results: Ten studies, representing 17 patients, were identified (mean age=40; 71% male). The time interval between primary infection and reinfection ranged from 13 to 142 days (median: 60). Comparative whole genome sequencing confirmed reinfection in 14 patients (the primary and secondary infections were caused by different viruses). A further three cases had strong, but not confirmed evidence of reinfection, as only partial genomes were retrieved on primary infection. Across 12 studies that reported the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) comparing the first and second genomes, between 8 and 24 SNPs were discovered. With an average SARS-CoV-2 mutation acquisition rate of 1-2 per month, in all cases it is likely that the secondary infection was caused by a different SARS-CoV-2 virus, rather than prolonged shedding of viral RNA from the primary infection. In five reinfection cases, the primary and secondary infections were caused by different SARS-CoV-2 lineages/clades, strongly indicating that infections were caused by different viruses. Conclusion: Comparative genomic analyses from 14 patients confirm that SARS-CoV-2 reinfection can occur.","Murchu, Eamon O.; O'Neill, Sinead; Byrne, Paula; De Gascun, Cillian; O'Neill, Michelle; Ryan, Máirín; Harrington, Patricia",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667038021000077; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667038021000077?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcvp.2021.100015,435

Currently, the disease has spread to most duck-raising areas in China, leading to great economic losses in the duck industry. In the recent years, DTMUV has raised some concerns, because of its expanding host range and increasing pathogenicity, as well as the potential threat to public health. Innate immunity is crucial for defending against invading pathogens in the early stages of infection. Recently, studies on the interaction between DTMUV and host innate immune response have made great progress. In the review, we provide an overview of DTMUV and summarize current advances in our understanding of the interaction between DTMUV and innate immunity, including the host innate immune responses to DTMUV infection through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), signaling transducer molecules, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), and the immune evasion strategies employed by DTMUV.

Although we are equipped with some symptomatic treatments, especially for the motor signs of the disease, there are still no established disease‐modifying drugs so the disease progresses unchecked. Standard drug discovery programs for disease‐modifying therapies have provided key insights into the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease but, of the many positive candidates identified in pre‐clinical studies, none has yet translated into a successful clinically efficacious drug. Given the huge cost of drug discovery programs, it is not surprising that much attention has turned toward repurposing strategies. The trialing of an established therapeutic has the advantage of bypassing the need for preclinical safety testing and formulation optimization, thereby cutting both time and costs involved in getting a treatment to the clinic. Additional reduced failure rates for repurposed drugs are also a potential bonus. Many different strategies for drug repurposing are open to researchers in the Parkinson's disease field. Some of these have already proven effective in identifying suitable drugs for clinical trials, lending support to such approaches. In this review, we present a summary of the different strategies for drug repurposing, from large‐scale epidemiological correlation analysis through to single‐gene transcriptional approaches. We provide examples of past or ongoing studies adopting each strategy, where these exist. For strategies that have yet to be applied to Parkinson's disease, their utility is illustrated using examples taken from other disorders.","Fletcher, Edward J.

We assumed an average incubation period of one week and an average duration of infectivity of 10 days. One week after the introduction of strict measures, the increase in daily new cases was reversed, and the reproduction number dropped.

The aim of this study was to assess the degree of anxiety, depression, resilience, and other psychiatric symptoms among healthcare workers in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This survey involved medical healthcare workers at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center (Tokyo, Japan) between April 22 and May 15, 2020. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and resilience was assessed using the Japanese versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Furthermore, we added original questionnaires comprising three factors: (i) anxiety and fear of infection and death; (ii) isolation and unreasonable treatment; and (iii) motivation and escape behavior at work. RESULTS: In total, 848 healthcare workers participated in this survey: 104 doctors, 461 nurses, 184 other co-medical staff, and 99 office workers. Among all participants, 85 (10.0%) developed moderate-to-severe anxiety disorder, and 237 (27.9%) developed depression. Problems with anxiety and fear of infection and death, isolation and unreasonable treatment, and motivation and escape from work were higher in the depression group than in the non-depression group (total CES-D score ≥ 16 points). Being a nurse and high total GAD-7 scores were risk factors of depression. Older workers and those with higher resilience were less likely to develop depression than others. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, many healthcare workers suffered from psychiatric symptoms. Psychological support and interventions for protecting the mental health of them are needed.","Awano, Nobuyasu; Oyama, Nene; Akiyama, Keiko; Inomata, Minoru; Kuse, Naoyuki; Tone, Mari; Takada, Kohei; Muto, Yutaka; Fujimoto, Kazushi; Akagi, Yu; Mawatari, Momoko; Ueda, Akihiro; Kawakami, Junko; Komatsu, Junko; Izumo, Takehiro",Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.5694-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33132305/,435

Despite this complexity, the HIV-1 Env must retain conserved determinants that mediate CD4 binding. To evaluate how these determinants might provide opportunities for antibody recognition, we created variants of gp120 stabilized in the CD4-bound state, assessed binding of CD4 and of receptor-binding-site antibodies, and determined the structure at 2.3 Å resolution of the broadly neutralizing antibody b12 in complex with gp120. b12 binds to a conformationally invariant surface that overlaps a distinct subset of the CD4-binding site. This surface is involved in the metastable attachment of CD4, before the gp120 rearrangement required for stable engagement. A site of vulnerability, related to a functional requirement for efficient association with CD4, can therefore be targeted by antibody to neutralize HIV-1.","Zhou, Tongqing; Xu, Ling; Dey, Barna; Hessell, Ann J.; Van Ryk, Donald; Xiang, Shi-Hua; Yang, Xinzhen; Zhang, Mei-Yun; Zwick, Michael B.; Arthos, James; Burton, Dennis R.; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Sodroski, Joseph; Wyatt, Richard; Nabel, Gary J.; Kwong, Peter D.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17301785/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2584968?pdf=render,435

These molecules are identified and selected through an in vitro process called SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). Proteins are the most common targets in aptamer selection. In diagnostic and detection assays, aptamers represent an alternative to antibodies as recognition agents. Cellular detection is a promising area in aptamer research. One of its principal advantages is the ability to target and specifically differentiate microbial strains without having previous knowledge of the membrane molecules or structural changes present in that particular microorganism. The present review focuses on aptamers, SELEX procedures, and aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms and viruses.

With limited resources for research available, it is important to identify evidence-based strategies for reorganising PHC delivery, determine where relevant evidence gaps exist and prioritise these for future study. This paper describes an approach for doing this using the best available evidence combined with consultation to establish evidence priorities. We first reviewed PHC organisational interventions in Asia-Pacific LMICs and ascertained evidence gaps. The largest gaps related to interventions to promote access to essential medicines, patient management tools, effective health promotion strategies and service planning and accountability. Evidence from Pacific Island countries was particularly scant. We then engaged an expert panel of 22 PHC stakeholders from seven Asia-Pacific LMICs in a Delphi exercise to identify priority questions for future research. Research priorities were: (1) identifying effective PHC service delivery models for chronic diseases; (2) devising sustainable models of disease integration; (3) optimising task shifting; (4) understanding barriers to care continuity; (5) projecting future PHC needs; and (6) designing appropriate PHC service packages. Notably, stakeholder-determined priorities reflected large, context-dependent system issues, while evidence gaps centred on discrete interventions. Future research on the organisation of PHC services in Asia-Pacific LMICs should incorporate codesign principles to engage researchers and national PHC system stakeholders, and innovative methods that build on existing evidence and account for system complexity.","Palagyi, Anna; Dodd, Rebecca; Jan, Stephen; Nambiar, Devaki; Joshi, Rohina; Tian, Maoyi; Abimbola, Seye; Peiris, David",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31478022/,435

However, there are some ongoing concerns about the negative impact of using PPE for prolonged periods. This study examined the impact of wearing PPE on surgeons’ performance and decision making during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, an anonymous online questionnaire was created and disseminated to surgeons all over the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included the demographic data, the local hospital policies, the non-technical skills (e.g., communication, vision, and comfort) and the technical skills, and the process of decision making. From June 2020 to August 2020, 162 surgeons participated in this questionnaire. Of them, 80.2% were aged from 26 to 45 years, 70.4% have received a special training for PPE, and 59.3% of participants have operated on COVID-19 confirmed cases. A negative impact of wearing PPE was reported on their overall comfort, vision, and communication skills (92.6%, 95.1%, and 82.8%, respectively). The technical skills and decision making were not significantly affected (60.5% and 72.8%, respectively). More preference for conservative approach, damage control procedures, and/or open approach was reported. Despite its benefits, PPE is associated with a significant negative impact on the non-technical skills (including vision, communication, and comfort) as well as a non-significant negative impact on technical skills and decision making of surgeons. Extra efforts should be directed to improve PPE, especially during lengthy pandemics.","Alarfaj, Mosab A.; Foula, Mohammed S.; Alshammary, Shadi; Nwesar, Fayrouz A.; Eldamati, Ahmed M.; Alomar, Abdullah; Abdulmomen, Abdulrahim A.; Alarfaj, Leenah; Almulhim, Abdulmohsen; Alarfaj, Odai; Zakaria, Hazem M.",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000027240,435

Since then, other viruses related to the first HBoV isolate (HBoV1), namely HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4, have been detected principally in human faeces. HBoVs are small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses of about 5300 nucleotides, consisting of three open reading frames encoding the first two the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and nuclear phosphoprotein (NP1) and the third the viral capsid proteins 1 and 2 (VP1 and VP2). HBoV pathogenicity remains to be fully clarified mainly due to the lack of animal models for the difficulties in replicating the virus in in vitro cell cultures, and the fact that HBoV infection is frequently accompanied by at least another viral and/or bacterial respiratory and/or gastroenteric pathogen infection. Current diagnostic methods to support HBoV detection include polymerase chain reaction, real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzyme immunoassay using recombinant VP2 or virus-like particle capsid proteins, although sequence-independent amplification techniques combined with next-generation sequencing platforms promise rapid and simultaneous detection of the pathogens in the future. This review presents the current knowledge on HBoV genotypes with emphasis on taxonomy, phylogenetic relationship and genomic analysis, biology, epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnostic methods.

The eyemate-IO (Implandata Ophthalmic Products) is an implant for intraocular pressure (IOP) monitoring placed in the ciliary sulcus during cataract surgery. RESULTS: Remote IOP monitoring enabled the clinician to identify sustained high IOP readings and the need for glaucoma surgery. Post-operatively, response to treatment could be monitored to ensure sufficient long-term IOP control.

By July 20, 2020, there were 2,118,646 confirmed cases and 80,120 confirmed deaths. To assist with the development of preventive measures and targeted interventions to combat the pandemic in Brazil, we present a geographic study to detect “active” and “emerging” space–time clusters of COVID-19. We document the relationship between relative risk of COVID-19 and mortality, inequality, socioeconomic vulnerability variables. We used the prospective space–time scan statistic to detect daily COVID-19 clusters and examine the relative risk between February 25–June 7, 2020, and February 25–July 20, 2020, in 5570 Brazilian municipalities. We apply a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to assess whether mortality rate, GINI index, and social inequality are predictors for the relative risk of each cluster. We detected 7 “active” clusters in the first time period, being one in the north, two in the northeast, two in the southeast, one in the south, and one in the capital of Brazil. In the second period, we found 9 clusters with RR > 1 located in all Brazilian regions. The results obtained through the GLM showed that there is a significant positive correlation between the predictor variables in relation to the relative risk of COVID-19. Given the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the GLM residuals, a spatial lag model was conducted that revealed that spatial effects, and both GINI index and mortality rate were strong predictors in the increase in COVID-19 relative risk in Brazil. Our research can be utilized to improve COVID-19 response and planning in all Brazilian states. The results from this study are particularly salient to public health, as they can guide targeted intervention measures, lowering the magnitude and spread of COVID-19. They can also improve resource allocation such as tests and vaccines (when available) by informing key public health officials about the highest risk areas of COVID-19.","Martines, M.

The severe lung disease caused by SARS-CoV-2-2019 is one of the many causes of ARDS. SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 2.7 million deaths world-wide and has challenged all therapeutic options for mechanical ventilation. Thus, new therapies are necessary to prevent deaths and long-term complications of severe lung diseases and prolonged mechanical ventilation. We have developed a novel device that allows selective lobe ventilation, selective lobe recruitment and provides a new platform for pulmonary drug delivery. A major advantage of separating lobes that are mechanically heterogeneous is to allow customization of ventilator parameters to match the needs of segments with similar compliance, for better overall ventilation perfusion relationship (V/Q) and prevention of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) of more compliant lobes. This device accounts for lung heterogeneity and is a potential new therapy for acute lung injury by allowing selective lobe mechanical ventilation using two novel modes of mechanical ventilation (differential positive end-expiratory pressure and asynchronous ventilation) and two new modalities of alveolar recruitment (selective lobe recruitment and continuous positive airway pressure of lower lobes with continuous ventilation of upper lobes). We report initial experience with this novel device which includes a brief overview of device development, the initial in vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo testing, layout future research, potential benefits, new therapies, and expected challenges prior to uniform implementation in clinical practice.","Maracaja, Luiz; Kumar Khanna, Ashish; Royster, Roger; Maracaja, Danielle; Lane, Magan; Jordan, James Eric",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053077021003670; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053077021003670?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2021.04.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103214/,435

Substudy A included 1656 eligible patients of 17 primary care clinicians who were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a mailed letter about HCV screening (letter only), or a similar letter with a laboratory order for HCV screening (letter+order). Substudy B included the remaining 19 837 eligible patients followed by 417 clinicians. Active electronic patient portal users were randomized 1:5 to receive a mailed letter about HCV screening (letter), or an electronic patient portal message with similar content (patient portal); inactive patient portal users were mailed a letter. In a factorial design, patients in substudy B were also randomized 1:1 to receive standard content (usual care), or content based on principles of social norming, anticipated regret, reciprocity, and commitment (behavioral content). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of patients who completed HCV testing within four months. RESULTS: 21 303 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Among the 1642 patients in substudy A, 19.2% (95% confidence interval 16.5% to 21.9%) completed screening in the letter only arm and 43.1% (39.7% to 46.4%) in the letter+order arm (P<0.001). Among the 19 661 patients in substudy B, 14.6% (13.9% to 15.3%) completed screening with usual care content and 13.6% (13.0% to 14.3%) with behavioral science content (P=0.06). Among active patient portal users, 17.8% (16.0% to 19.5%) completed screening after receiving a letter and 13.8% (13.1% to 14.5%) after receiving a patient portal message (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Opt out framing and effort reduction by including a signed laboratory order with outreach increased screening for HCV. Behavioral science messaging content did not increase uptake, and mailed letters achieved a greater response rate than patient portal messages.

Post hoc analysis revealed that children in two clinical groups displayed significant pragmatic language deficits. Children in the ASD group who were older exhibited comparable degree of impairments as their LI peers, suggesting a relatively stagnant development of pragmatic language skills in children with ASD. Findings also supported the use of DA in identifying pragmatic language deficits, which have implications for the adoption of this assessment approach in clinical settings.","Wong, Kay H.

The combination of non-parametric models for population dynamics with molecular clock models which relate genetic data to time has enabled phylodynamic inference based on large sets of time-stamped genetic sequence data. The methodology for non-parametric inference of effective population size is well-developed in the Bayesian setting, but here we develop a frequentist approach based on non-parametric latent process models of population size dynamics. We appeal to statistical principles based on out-of-sample prediction accuracy in order to optimize parameters that control shape and smoothness of the population size over time. We demonstrate the flexibility and speed of this approach in a series of simulation experiments, and apply the methodology to reconstruct the previously described waves in the seventh pandemic of cholera. We also estimate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 in England using thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. By incorporating a measure of the strength of these interventions over time within the phylodynamic model, we estimate the impact of the first national lockdown in the UK on the epidemic reproduction number.","Didelot, Xavier; Geidelberg, Lily; Volz, Erik M",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34426812/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.18.427056,435

False-negative RT-PCR results may hamper clinical management of patients and hinder the adoption of epidemiological measures to control the pandemic. The current study was aimed at assessing whether amplification of {beta}-glucoronidase (GUSB) gene would help estimate the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative results in upper respiratory tract (URT) specimens. URT specimens that tested negative by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR displayed higher GUSB RT-PCR cycle thresholds (CT) (P=0.070) than those testing positive (median, 30.7; range, 27.0-40.0, and median 29.7; range 25.5-36.8, respectively), this reflecting poorer cellularity. Receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis indicated that a CT threshold of 31.2 discriminated best between positive and negative SARS CoV-2 RT-PCRs (area under a curve, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P=0.08). This cut-off yielded a true negative ratio of 89% and accuracy of 70%. The data suggested that amplification of the GUSB gene by RT-PCR may help to appraise the accuracy of negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in patients in whom Covid-19 is eventually diagnosed.","Albert, E.; Ferrer, B.; Torres, I.; Serrano, A.; Alcaraz, M.

659822,Prevalence and Risk Factors for Acute Posttraumatic Stress Disorder during the COVID-19 Outbreak,2021-01-28,"The cytoskeletal protein vimentin is secreted under various physiological conditions. Extracellular vimentin exists primarily in two forms: attached to the outer cell surface and secreted into the extracellular space. While surface vimentin is involved in processes such as viral infections and cancer progression, secreted vimentin modulates inflammation through reduction of neutrophil infiltration, promotes bacterial elimination in activated macrophages, and supports axonal growth in astrocytes through activation of the IGF-1 receptor. This receptor is overexpressed in cancer cells, and its activation pathway has significant roles in general cellular functions. In this study, we investigated the functional role of extracellular vimentin in non-tumorigenic (MCF-10a) and cancer (MCF-7) cells through the evaluation of its effects on cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, and monolayer permeability. Upon treatment with extracellular recombinant vimentin, MCF-7 cells showed increased migration, proliferation, and adhesion, compared to MCF-10a cells. Further, MCF-7 monolayers showed reduced permeability, compared to MCF-10a monolayers. It has been shown that the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can alter blood–brain barrier integrity. Surface vimentin also acts as a co-receptor between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the cell-surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Therefore, we also investigated the permeability of MCF-10a and MCF-7 monolayers upon treatment with extracellular recombinant vimentin, and its modulation of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain. These findings show that binding of extracellular recombinant vimentin to the cell surface enhances the permeability of both MCF-10a and MCF-7 monolayers. However, with SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain addition, this effect is lost with MCF-7 monolayers, as the extracellular vimentin binds directly to the viral domain. This defines an influence of extracellular vimentin in SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Thalla, Divyendu Goud; Jung, Philipp; Bischoff, Markus; Lautenschläger, Franziska",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299089/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22147469,435

The first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to four new species are still being found every year. Extrapolation of the discovery curve suggests that there is still a substantial pool of undiscovered human virus species, although an apparent slow-down in the rate of discovery of species from different families may indicate bounds to the potential range of diversity. More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human hosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also have mammalian or avian origins. Indeed, a substantial proportion of mammalian viruses may be capable of crossing the species barrier into humans, although only around half of these are capable of being transmitted by humans and around half again of transmitting well enough to cause major outbreaks. A few possible predictors of species jumps can be identified, including the use of phylogenetically conserved cell receptors. It seems almost inevitable that new human viruses will continue to emerge, mainly from other mammals and birds, for the foreseeable future. For this reason, an effective global surveillance system for novel viruses is needed.","Woolhouse, Mark; Scott, Fiona; Hudson, Zoe; Howey, Richard; Chase-Topping, Margo",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22966141/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0354,435

To better understand the diversity, evolution, and transmission of JMTV, we sampled 215 ticks, 104 cattle bloods, 216 bats, and 119 rodents in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang Province, China as well as 240 bats from Guizhou and Henan Provinces. JMTV was identified in 107 ticks (from two species), 54 bats (eleven species), 8 rodents (three species), and 10 cattle, with prevalence levels of 49.8, 11.8, 6.7, and 9.6 per cent, respectively, suggesting that bats may be a natural reservoir of JMTV. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that all the newly identified JMTVs were closely related to each other and to previously described viruses. Additionally, all tick and mammalian JMTV sampled in Wenzhou shared a consistent genomic structure, suggesting that the virus can cocirculate between ticks and mammals without observable variation in genome organization. All JMTVs sampled globally could be divided into two phylogenetic groups, Mantel tests suggested that geographic isolation, rather than host species, may be the main driver of JMTV diversity. However, the exact geographical origin of JMTV was difficult to determine, suggesting that this virus has a complex evolutionary history.","Guo, Jing-Jing; Lin, Xian-Dan; Chen, Yan-Mei; Hao, Zong-Yu; Wang, Zhao-Xiao; Yu, Zhu-Mei; Lu, Miao; Li, Kun; Qin, Xin-Cheng; Wang, Wen; Holmes, Edward C; Hou, Wei; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",Virus Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/veaa051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976906/,435

Because there is currently no approved drug for the management of the disease, research efforts have been intensified towards the discovery of a potent drug for the treatment of the disease. Papain Like protease (PLpro) is one of the key proteins involved in the viral replication. We therefore docked forty-six compounds already characterized from Azadirachta indica, Xylopia aethipica and Allium cepa against MERS-CoV-PLpro. The molecular docking analysis was performed with AutoDock 1.5.6 and compounds which exhibit more negative free energy of binding, and low inhibition constant (Ki) with the protein (MERS-CoV-PLpro) were considered potent. The physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds were predicted using the Swissadme web server. Twenty-two of the compounds showed inhibition potential similar to dexamethasone and remdesvir, which had binding affinity of −6.8 and −6.3 kcal/mol respectively. The binding affinity of the compounds ranged between −3.4 kcal/mol and −7.7 kcal/mol whereas; hydroxychloroquine had a binding affinity of −4.5 kcal/mol. Among all the compounds, nimbanal and verbenone showed drug likeliness, they did not violate the Lipinski rule neither were they inhibitors of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Both nimbanal and verbenone were further post-scored with MM/GBSA and the binding free energy of nimbanal (−25.51 kcal/mol) was comparable to that of dexamethasone (−25.46 kcal/mol). The RMSD, RMSF, torsional angle, and other analysis following simulation further substantiate the efficacy of nimbanal as an effective drug candidate. In conclusion, our study showed that nimbanal is a more promising therapeutic agent and could be a lead for the discovery of a new drug that may be useful in the management of severe respiratory coronavirus syndrome.","Eunice, Adegbola Aanuoluwa; Samuel, Fadahunsi Olumide; Alausa, Abdulahi; Zabdiel, Abijo Ayodeji; Adewale, Balogun Toheeb; Sarah, Aderibigbe Taiwo; Banjo, Semire; Ifeoluwa, Adegbola Peter",Inform Med Unlocked,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914821001076; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914821001076?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2021.100617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075339/,435

OBJECTIVE: To describe and classify the cutaneous findings with supporting histopathology of confirmed COVID‐19 inpatients. METHODS: We included consecutive inpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19 for whom a dermatology consult was requested. A skin biopsy was performed in all cases. Skin findings were classified as being compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID‐19 or as representing a distinct clinical entity. RESULTS: Twenty‐eight patients were studied in whom thirty‐one dermatologic diagnoses were made. Twenty‐two of the dermatoses were compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID‐19; nine entities were not associated with infection by SARS‐CoV‐2. The most common COVID‐19‐associated pattern was an exanthematous presentation. In four patients, a new pattern was observed, characterized by discrete papules with varied histopathological findings including a case of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. No cases of pernio‐like lesions were identified. Skin findings not associated with COVID‐19 represented 29% of diagnoses and included Malassezia folliculitis, tinea, miliaria and contact dermatitis. LIMITATIONS: There is no gold‐standard test to distinguish between viral exanthems and drug reactions. CONCLUSION: A histopathological study is critical before attributing skin findings to a manifestation of COVID‐19.","Barrera‐Godínez, A.; Méndez‐Flores, S.; Gatica‐Torres, M.; Rosales‐Sotomayor, A.; Campos‐Jiménez, K.I.; Carrillo‐Córdova, D.M.; Durand‐Muñoz, M.C.; Mena‐Hernández, G.L.; Melchor‐Mendoza, Y.K.; Ruelas‐Villavicencio, A.L.; García‐Irigoyen, A.; Acatitla‐Acevedo, G.A.; Toussaint‐Caire, S.; Domínguez‐Cherit, J.",J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013600/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.17381,435
666448,A qualitative study of nurses’ experiences of self-care counseling in migrant patients with heart failure,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mainly targets the respiratory system. However, recent studies also show its role in causing gastrointestinal hemorrhage, potentially affecting morbidity and mortality-related outcomes of the patients. There is still no consensus on the risk factors, characteristics, and the overall outcome of the gastrointestinal hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients. The main aim of this study was to summarize current evidence, assessing risk factors that promote the onset of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients, and to compare the incidences of the different sites of gastrointestinal lesions, the events of abdominal pain, diarrhea, intensive care unit admissions, and mortality between COVID-19 patients with or without gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: A search of the academic literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines across five databases i.e., Web of Science, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Scopus, and MEDLINE. A random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the influence of the history of drugs consumption, gastrointestinal bleeding, the different incidence of gastrointestinal lesions, events of abdominal pain, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality between COVID-19 patients with/without gastrointestinal bleeding. RESULTS: Out of 458 studies, three eligible studies with 663 participants (mean age: 69.7 ± 4.3 years) were included. A meta-analysis showed a medium-to-large influence of the history of gastrointestinal bleeding (Hedge’s g: 1.01) and anticoagulant drug consumption (g: 0.33) on the gastrointestinal bleeding in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers was higher as compared to esophagitis (37.5% versus 9.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides preliminary evidence regarding the risk factors associated with the onset of gastrointestinal hemorrhage among COVID-19 patients. The study also outlines the characteristics and the outcomes of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Jie; Hang, Ying",Pak J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475942/; https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.37.5.4351,435

Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize how the transmission potential varied over the course of the outbreak. Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1–7). Our findings suggest that R(t) decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control. Most recent estimates of R(t) reached values largely below the epidemic threshold, indicating that a secondary outbreak of the novel coronavirus was unlikely to occur aboard the Diamond Princess Ship.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Chowell, Gerardo",Infect Dis Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32190785/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300063,435
669072,CPMS–improving patient care in Europe via virtual case discussions,2021-02-02,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to significant changes in healthcare systems and its impact on the treatment of cardiovascular conditions, such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), is unknown in countries where the healthcare systems were not saturated, as was the case in Portugal. As such, we aimed to assess the effect on STEMI admissions and outcomes in Portuguese centers. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, observational, retrospective study including all patients admitted to our hospital due to STEMI between the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 case diagnosed in Portugal and the end of the state of emergency (March and April 2020). Patient characteristics and outcomes were assessed and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS: A total of 104 STEMI patients were assessed, 55 in 2019 and 49 in 2020 (-11%). There were no significant differences between groups regarding age (62±12 vs. 65±14 years, p=0.308), gender (84.8% vs. 77.6% males, p=0.295) or comorbidities. In the 2020 group, there was a significant decrease in the proportion of patients transported to the hospital in pre-hospital emergency medical transportation (38.2% vs. 20.4%, p=0.038), an increase in system delay (49 [30-110.25] vs. 140 [90-180] minutes, p=0.019), a higher Killip-Kimball class, with a decrease in class I (74.5% vs. 51%) and an increase in class III (1.8% vs. 8.2%) and IV (5.5% vs. 18.4%) (p=0.038), a greater incidence of vasoactive support (3.7% vs. 26.5%, p=0.001), invasive mechanic ventilation usage (3.6% vs. 14.3%, p=0.056), and an increase in severe left ventricular dysfunction at hospital discharge (3.6% vs. 16.3%, p=0.03). In-hospital mortality was 14.3% in the 2020 group and 7.3% in the 2019 group p=0.200). CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of significant variation in the absolute number of STEMI admissions, there was an increase in STEMI clinical severity and significantly worse outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. An increase in system delay, impaired pre-hospital care and patient fear of in-hospital infection can partially justify these results and should be the target of future actions in further waves of the pandemic.","Azul Freitas, André; Baptista, Rui; Gonçalves, Valdirene; Ferreira, Cátia; Milner, James; Lourenço, Carolina; Costa, Susana; Franco, Fátima; Monteiro, Sílvia; Gonçalves, Francisco; Gonçalves, Lino",Rev Port Cardiol (Engl Ed),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2174204921001835; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2174204921001835; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.repce.2021.07.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34274091/,435
669660,The Neglect of Educational Issues During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-06-25,"OBJECTIVE: Children’s hospitals frequently care for infants with various life-threatening airway anomalies. Management of these infants can be challenging given unique airway anatomy and potential malformations. Airway emergency management must be immediate and precise, often demanding specialized equipment and/or expertise. We developed a Neonatal-Infant Airway Safety Program to improve medical responses, communication, equipment usage and outcomes for infants requiring emergent airway interventions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients admitted to our quaternary neonatal and infant intensive care unit (NICU) from 2008–2019 were included in this study. Our program consisted of a multidisciplinary airway response team, pager system, and emergency equipment cart. Respiratory therapists present at each emergency event recorded specialist response times, equipment utilization, and outcomes. A multidisciplinary oversite committee reviewed each incident. RESULTS: Since 2008, there were 159 airway emergency events in our NICU (~12 per year). Mean specialist response times decreased from 5.9±4.9 min (2008–2012, mean±SD) to 4.3±2.2 min (2016–2019, p=0.12), and the number of incidents with response times >5 min decreased from 28.8±17.8% (2008–2012) to 9.3±11.4% (2016–2019, p=0.04 by linear regression). As our program became more standardized, we noted better equipment availability and subspecialist communication. Few emergency situations (n=9, 6%) required operating room management. There were 3 patient deaths (2%). CONCLUSIONS: Our airway safety program, including readily available specialists and equipment, facilitated effective resolution of airway emergencies in our NICU and multidisciplinary involvement enabled rapid and effective changes in response to COVID-19 regulations. A similar program could be implemented in other centers.","Thom, Christopher S; Deshmukh, Hitesh; Soorikian, Leane; Jacobs, Ian; Fiadjoe, John E; Lioy, Janet",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995823/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.25.20201582v1?rss=1,435

Identifying clonal groups allows for assessment of geographic spread, transmission events, and identification of new or emerging strains that may be more virulent or more transmissible. Here we present a rapid, whole genome, allele-based method (GNUVID) for assigning sequence types to sequenced isolates of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. This sequence typing scheme can be updated with new genomic information extremely rapidly, making our technique continually adaptable as databases grow. We show that our method is consistent with phylogeny and recovers waves of expansion and replacement of sequence types/clonal complexes in different geographical locations. GNUVID is available as a command line application (https://github.com/ahmedmagds/GNUVID).","Moustafa, Ahmed M.; Planet, Paul J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.139055,435

X-SCID is lethal without allogeneic stem cell transplant or gene therapy due to opportunistic infections. An infant with X-SCID became infected with SARS-CoV-2 while awaiting transplant. The patient developed severe hepatitis without the respiratory symptoms typical of COVID-19. He was treated with convalescent plasma, and thereafter was confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, as detected with a microfluidic antigen array. After resolution of the hepatitis, he received a haploidentical CD34 selected stem cell transplant, without conditioning, from his father who had recovered from COVID-19. SARS CoV-2 was detected via RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs until 61 days post transplantation.

METHODS: This study adopted a systematic search strategy to identify the free mobile applications available in the App and Google Play stores related to the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the PRISMA flowchart of the search, only 12 applications met the inclusion criterion. RESULTS: The 12 mobile applications that met the inclusion criterion were: Mawid, Tabaud, Tawakkalna, Sehha, Aarogya setu, TraceTogether, COVID safe, Immuni, COVID symptom study, COVID watch, NHS COVID-19, and PathCheck. The following features and functionalities of the apps were described: app overview (price, ratings, android, iOS, developer/owner, country, status), health tools (user status-risk assessment, self-assessment, E-pass integration, test results reporting, online consultation, contact tracing), learning options (personalized notes, educational resources, COVID-19 information), communication tools (query resolution, appointments, social network, notifications), app design (data visualization, program plan), networking tools (location mapping – GPS, connectivity with other devices), and safety and security options (alerts, data protection). Also, the effectiveness of the apps was analyzed. CONCLUSION: The analysis revealed that various applications have been developed for different functions like contact tracing, awareness building, appointment booking, online consultation, etc. However, only a few applications have integrated various functions and features such as self-assessment, consultation, support and access to information. Also, most of the apps are focused on contact tracing, while very few are dedicated to raising awareness and sharing information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Likewise, the majority of applications rely on GPS and Bluetooth technologies for relevant functions. No apps were identified that had built-in social media features. It is suggested to design and develop an integrated mobile health application with most of the features and functionalities analyzed in this study.","Alanzi, Turki",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469298/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s285014,435

672648,Syndromic Surveillance: Hospital Emergency Department Participation During the Kentucky Derby Festival,2005-06-24,"Circulating CD11c(+) B cells are a key phenomenon in certain types of autoimmunity but have also been described in the context of regular immune responses (i.e., infections, vaccination). Using mass cytometry to profile 46 different markers on individual immune cells, we systematically initially confirmed the presence of increased CD11c(+) B cells in the blood of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Notably, significant differences in the expression of CD21, CD27, and CD38 became apparent between CD11c(−) and CD11c(+) B cells. We observed direct correlation of the frequency of CD21(−)CD27(−) B cells and CD21(−)CD38(−) B cells with CD11c(+) B cells, which were most pronounced in SLE compared to primary Sjögren's syndrome patients (pSS) and healthy donors (HD). Thus, CD11c(+) B cells resided mainly within memory subsets and were enriched in CD27(−)IgD(−), CD21(−)CD27(−), and CD21(−)CD38(−) B cell phenotypes. CD11c(+) B cells from all donor groups (SLE, pSS, and HD) showed enhanced CD69, Ki-67, CD45RO, CD45RA, and CD19 expression, whereas the membrane expression of CXCR5 and CD21 were diminished. Notably, SLE CD11c(+) B cells showed enhanced expression of the checkpoint molecules CD86, PD1, PDL1, CD137, VISTA, and CTLA-4 compared to HD. The substantial increase of CD11c(+) B cells with a CD21(−) phenotype co-expressing distinct activation and checkpoint markers, points to a quantitative increased alternate (extrafollicular) B cell activation route possibly related to abnormal immune regulation as seen under the striking inflammatory conditions of SLE which shows a characteristic PD-1/PD-L1 upregulation.","Rincon-Arevalo, Hector; Wiedemann, Annika; Stefanski, Ana-Luisa; Lettau, Marie; Szelinski, Franziska; Fuchs, Sebastian; Frei, Andreas Philipp; Steinberg, Malte; Kam-Thong, Tony; Hatje, Klas; Keller, Baerbel; Warnatz, Klaus; Radbruch, Andreas; Lino, Andreia C.; Schrezenmeier, Eva; Dörner, Thomas",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33777025/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.635615,435

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with meta-regression of serum cystatin C in COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, between January 2020 and February 2021, for studies reporting serum cystatin C concentrations, measures of clinical severity and survival outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021245295). RESULTS: Thirteen studies in 2510 COVID-19 patients, 1972 with low severity or survivor status and 538 with high severity or non-survivor status during follow up, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that serum cystatin C concentrations were higher in patients with high disease severity or non-survivor status (standard mean deviation, SMD, 1.71, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.46, p < 0.001). Extreme between-study heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 97.5%, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analysis, performed by sequentially removing each study and re-assessing the pooled estimates, showed that the magnitude and direction of the effect size was not substantially modified. The Begg’s and Egger’s t tests did not show publication bias. In meta-regression, the SMD of serum cystatin C was not associated with age, proportion of males, C-reactive protein, neutrophils, lymphocytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, and proportion of patients with diabetes or hypertension.

Given the health and economic threats posed by the pandemic to the global community, there are concerns that rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour may rise during and in its aftermath. Our living systematic review (LSR) focuses on suicide prevention in relation to COVID-19, with this iteration synthesising relevant evidence up to June 7 (th) 2020. Method: Automated daily searches feed into a web-based database with screening and data extraction functionalities. Eligibility criteria include incidence/prevalence of suicidal behaviour, exposure-outcome relationships and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest are suicide, self-harm or attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts. No restrictions are placed on language or study type, except for single-person case reports. Results: Searches identified 2070 articles, 29 (28 studies) met our inclusion criteria, of which 14 articles were research letters or pre-prints awaiting peer review. All articles reported observational data: 12 cross-sectional; eight case series; five modelling; and three service utilisation studies. No studies reported on changes in rates of suicidal behaviour. Case series were largely drawn from news reporting in low/middle income countries and factors associated with suicide included fear of infection, social isolation and economic concerns. Conclusions: A marked improvement in the quality of design, methods, and reporting in future studies is needed. There is thus far no clear evidence of an increase in suicide, self-harm, suicidal behaviour, or suicidal thoughts associated with the pandemic. However, suicide data are challenging to collect in real time and economic effects are evolving. Our LSR will provide a regular synthesis of the most up-to-date research evidence to guide public health and clinical policy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide.

The Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 found lower respiratory infections (LRIs) were the leading infectious cause of death and the fifth leading cause of death overall. Pneumococcal pneumonia caused 55% of LRI deaths in all ages (1.5 million deaths). Novel pathogens, particularly viruses, continue to emerge as causes of pneumonia. The rise of drug-resistance among common respiratory pathogens is a further challenge.

Methods: A prospective data of 76 adults who were admitted due to acute HF between October 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 at our center were analyzed. Endpoints included survival and rehospitalization within six months after discharge. Results: The mean age was 64.9 ± 13.8 years, with a male preponderance (68.4%). Approximately 60.5% of patients had the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <40%, whereas 26.3% of patients had LVEF ≥50%. Coronary artery disease (75%), arterial hypertension (72.4%), chronic kidney disease (46.1%), and diabetes mellitus (46.1%) were the most frequent comorbidities. Poor compliance (40.8%) and non-cardiac infection (21.1%) were the common precipitating factors for hospitalization. The majority of subjects had severe symptoms, indicated by the frequent need of intensive care unit (43%), high N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide levels [NT-proBNP; median, 4765 (1539.7-11782.2) pg/mL], and presence of either atrial fibrillation, severe mitral regurgitation, or significant pulmonary hypertension in approximately one-third of cases. Even though in-hospital mortality was relatively low (2.6%), the all-cause mortality and rehospitalization rates in the next six months after discharge were still high, reaching 22.54% and 19.72%, respectively. Further survival analysis showed that tachycardia on admission and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) resulted in low six-month survival rates among these patients. Conclusion: After hospital discharge, patients with HF were still exposed to higher risks of death and readmission albeit with the medication addressed. Tachycardia on admission and pre-existing CKD might predict worse outcomes.","Suciadi, Leonardo P; Wibawa, Kevin; Jessica, Giovanni; Henrina, Joshua; Cahyadi, Irvan; Santi, Bryany T; Hariadi, Titus K; Tedjasukmana, Firman; Kristanti, Nathania M; Pakpahan, Elisa F; Manullang, Reynold A; Sutandar, Antono",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34306870/,435
674805,"Determinants of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards first aid among kindergarten and elementary school teachers in Gondar city, Northwest Ethiopia",2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND: Water immersion during labour can provide benefits including reduced need for regional analgesia and a shorter labour. However, in the United Kingdom a minority of women use a pool for labour or birth, with pool use particularly uncommon in obstetric-led settings. Maternity unit culture has been identified as an important influence on pool use, but this and other possible factors have not been explored in-depth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify factors influencing pool use through qualitative case studies of three obstetric units and three midwifery units in the UK. METHODS: Case study units with a range of waterbirth rates and representing geographically diverse locations were selected. Data collection methods comprised semi-structured interviews, collation of service documentation and public-facing information, and observations of the unit environment. There were 111 interview participants, purposively sampled to include midwives, postnatal women, obstetricians, neonatologists, midwifery support workers and doulas. A framework approach was used to analyse all case study data. RESULTS: Obstetric unit culture was a key factor restricting pool use. We found substantial differences between obstetric and midwifery units in terms of equipment and resources, staff attitudes and confidence, senior staff support and women’s awareness of water immersion. Generic factors influencing use of pools across all units included limited access to waterbirth training, sociodemographic differences in desire for pool use and issues using waterproof fetal monitoring equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Case study findings provide new insights into the influence of maternity unit culture on waterbirth rates. Access to pool use could be improved through midwives based in obstetric units having more experience of waterbirth, providing obstetricians and neonatologists with information on the practicalities of pool use and improving accessibility of antenatal information. In terms of resources, recommendations include increasing pool provision, ensuring birth room allocation maximises the use of unit resources, and providing pool room environments that are acceptable to midwives.

METHODS: This retrospective study from a University tertiary care hospital in northern Italy, included hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 between February 25(th), 2020 and March 25(th), 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 317 patients were enrolled. Their median age 71 years and 67.2% were males (213/317). The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (149/317; 47.0%), cardiovascular disease (63/317, 19.9%) and diabetes (49/317; 15.5%). Common symptoms at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis included fever (285/317; 89.9%), shortness of breath (167/317; 52.7%) and dry cough (156/317,49.2%). An “atypical” presentation including at least one among mental confusion, diarrhea or nausea and vomiting was observed in 53/317 patients (16.7%). Hypokalemia occurred in 25.8% (78/302) and 18.5% (56/303) had acute kidney injury. During hospitalization, 111/317 patients (35.0%) received non-invasive respiratory support, 65/317 (20.5%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 60/317 (18.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. All cause in-hospital mortality, assessed in 275 patients, was 43.6% (120/275). On multivariable analysis, age (per-year increase odds ratio [OR]:1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.10, p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (OR:2.58; 95% CI 1.07-6.25; p=0.03), and C-reactive protein levels (per-point increase OR:1.009; 95% CI 1.004-1.014; p=0.001) were independent risk factors for all-cause in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 mainly affected elderly patients with predisposing conditions and caused severe illness, frequently requiring non-invasive respiratory support or ICU admission. Despite supportive care, COVID-19 remains associated with a substantial risk of all-cause in-hospital mortality.","Vena, Antonio; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Di Biagio, Antonio; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Taramasso, Lucia; De Maria, Andrea; Ball, Lorenzo; Brunetti, Iole; Loconte, Maurizio; Patroniti, Nicolò A.; Robba, Chiara; Delfino, Emanuele; Dentone, Chiara; Magnasco, Laura; Nicolini, Laura; Toscanini, Federica; Bavastro, Martina; Cerchiaro, Matteo; Barisione, Emanuela; Giacomini, Mauro; Mora, Sara; Baldi, Federico; Balletto, Elisa; Berruti, Marco; Briano, Federica; Sepulcri, Chiara; Dettori, Silvia; Labate, Laura; Mirabella, Michele; Portunato, Federica; Pincino, Rachele; Russo, Chiara; Tutino, Stefania; Pelosi, Paolo; Bassetti, Matteo",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20304845?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20304845; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810610/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.07.049,435

676703,Prone Positioning of Older Adults with COVID-19: A Brief Review and Proposed Protocol,2021-08-27,"Newcastle disease Virus (NDV), a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, and Influenza virus, from the Orthomyxoviridae family, are two main avian pathogens that cause serious economic problems in poultry farming. NDV strains are classified into three major pathotypes: velogenic, mesogenic, and lentogenic. Avian influenza viruses (AIV) are also divided into: low pathogenic (LPAI) and highly pathogenic (HPAI) strains. Both viruses are enveloped, single stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses which give similar symptoms ranging from sub-clinical infections to severe disease, including loss in egg production, acute respiratory syndrome, and high mortality, depending on their level of pathogenicity. This similarity hinders diagnosis when based solely on clinical and post mortem examination. Most of the currently available molecular detection methods are also pathogenspecific, so that more than one RT-PCR is then required to confirm or exclude the presence of both pathogens. To overcome this disadvantage, we have applied a One Step Duplex RT-PCR method to distinguish between those two pathogens. The main objective of the project was to develop a universal, fast, and inexpensive method which could be used in any veterinary laboratory.","Nidzworski, Dawid; Smietanka, Krzysztof; Minta, Zenon; Szewczyk, Bogusław",Cent Eur J Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32215119/; https://doi.org/10.2478/s11535-013-0164-7,435

OBJECTIVE: To explore the epidemiology of older patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study. SETTING: A population-based study. SUBJECTS: The resident older patients (older than 65 years old) diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: Citywide case series reported to Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 12 December 2019 to 17 March 2020 were included. The epidemic curves were constructed by dates of disease onset. RESULTS: 14238 confirmed COVID-19 cases were older persons. The number of male cases were slightly less than female cases (1:1.01). The attack rate of COVID-19 in the older persons was 11.49‰ in Wuhan. There was a rapid increase of disease at the early stage of the epidemic and then a gradual and steady decrease was performed. 3,723 (26.15%) and 734 (5.16%) patients were diagnosed as severe and critical cases, respectively. The attributable crude fatality ratio of COVID-19 in the older population was 222.57/100,000, and the crude fatality ratio of COVID was 19.37%. The proportion of severe and critical cases, and fatality ratio were both higher in downtown area and increased with age. CONCLUSIONS: The older persons are sensitive to COVID-19. The proportion of severe and critical cases and fatality ratio are higher than that in children and younger adults. Strengthen the protection and control strategies for the older adults is of priorities. More detailed epidemiological and clinical information should be measured in further studies.","Guo, Yan; Liu, Xinghua; Deng, Mengyao; Liu, Pulin; Li, Fang; Xie, Nianhua; Pang, Yanhui; Zhang, Xiaoxia; Luo, Wen; Peng, Ying; Yan, Yaqiong; Li, Gang; Yang, Mei",Age Ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584953/,435

Records of children and adolescents treated at our hospital during 1987–2006 with a documented rhinovirus infection were reviewed and compared with patients with other respiratory virus infections. Prospective study included all children ≥1 month of age admitted to pediatric infectious disease ward during an autumn period. Rhinoviruses were detected by reverse transcription‐PCR and/or culture, and sequence analysis was used for virus typing. In the retrospective study, the median age of 580 children with rhinovirus infection was 1.9 years (interquartile range, 1.0–4.3 years), and 27% had an underlying medical condition. Eighty‐four children (16% of in‐patients) were treated at pediatric intensive care unit. Twenty‐one children (4%) had a hospital‐acquired rhinovirus infection. In the prospective study, rhinoviruses were detected in 28% of 163 hospital episodes. Acute wheezing illness was diagnosed in 61% of children with rhinovirus and in 31% of children with respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus, or no study virus (P < 0.001). One‐half of sequence‐analyzed rhinovirus strains belonged to the newly identified C group. In conclusion, rhinovirus infections are a frequent cause of pediatric hospitalizations, and they are common also at the intensive care unit. Acute wheezing is the most frequent manifestation in hospital setting, but the range of clinical presentations is wide. Group C rhinoviruses may account for a large part of rhinovirus hospitalizations. J. Med.

The Online Nursing Education Best Practices Guide (ONE Guide) builds on and extends the nationally recognized Quality Matters® program and serves as a roadmap guiding course development and delivery. The fundamental principle for success in online teaching is instructor presence; the teacher as a facilitator of learning is illustrated throughout the guide. An Online Instructor Checklist facilitates systematic implementation of best practice principles. METHODS: This article is based on a focused literature review and concept analysis resulting in a comprehensive guide for delivery of effective, quality nursing education through best practices in the online learning environment. A broad search of databases focused on articles during 2014 to 2019 was completed. The literature review included articles that examined over 1200 student perceptions of instructor presence in the online setting. CONCLUSION: Nurses carry a direct responsibility for the health and well-being of patients. Nursing quality education proves fundamental to the profession’s long-term outcomes.

Introduction: After months of strict quarantine, several countries are planning exit strategies to progressively lift social restrictions without giving rise to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Although several strategies have been studied in terms of how and when to relax such stringent constraints, there is a lack of consensus on the optimal strategy for managing the pandemic beyond lockdown. The risks posed by delaying return to work and school openings are real and sizeable, particularly for relevant working sectors and for students from low-income families Inclusion criteria: This review will consider studies that focussed on relaxation strategies for lockdown exit among workers and students facing an epidemic /pandemic crisis. Methods: The searches will be conducted across four databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch, Google Scholar), and the bibliography of all selected studies will be hand-searched. In addition, because the topic is new, relevant literature will be checked using daily, updated COVID-19 collections from NCBI (LitCovid) and MedRxiv servers. Studies published in English, German, Spanish, Italian and French will be included, with no limits on publication dates. This review will consider all study designs, regardless of their rigor.

We investigated whether immunologic dysregulation contributes to these complaints. Cytokine and chemokine production was measured after stimulating monocytes of QFS patients and age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls with LPS and several viral ligands. The H3K4me3 mark of open chromatin was measured at the promoter regions of cytokines and chemokines that differed significantly from healthy controls. Monocytes of QFS patients produced significantly less TNF‐α (p = 0.032), IL‐1β (0.004, 0.024, and 0.008), IL‐6 (0.043), RANTES (0.033), IP‐10 (0.049), MCP‐1 (0.022), IL‐ 13 (0.029), and IL‐10 (0.026) than healthy controls when stimulated with various ligands. H3K4me3 expression was significantly lower in QFS patients than in healthy controls on the promoter regions of IL‐1β (p = 0.004), MCP‐1 (<0.001 and <0.001), IP‐10 (<0.001), IL‐10 (0.041), and IL‐13 (<0.001, <0.001, and 0.001). QFS patients showed diminished cytokine responses to various stimuli compared to age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls, likely due to epigenetic remodeling and long‐term memory as a result from the acute Q fever infection. This might explain the upper respiratory tract ailments in QFS.","Raijmakers, Ruud P.H.; Jansen, Anne F.M.; Keijmel, Stephan P.; van der Meer, Jos W.M.; Joosten, Leo A.B.; Netea, Mihai G.; Bleeker‐Rovers, Chantal P.",Eur J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001808/; https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201848012,435

A new, reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed for the rapid (within 1 h), simultaneous detection of A and B group HRSV. Primers specific for groups A and B were designed to amplify the N and L genes of HRSV, respectively. A fluorescent dye, calcein, was used as an indicator for the endpoint visual detection and/or real-time amplification of HRSV RNA. The detection limit of the new method was 281.17 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50)/ml for HRSV A and 1.58 TCID50/ml for HRSV B. To evaluate the validity of this method, a comparison with RT-PCR was performed using 77 nasopharyngeal swabs as samples. Both RT-LAMP and RT-PCR detected HRSV in 38 HRSV samples, yielding a positive rate of 49%. Of the RT-LAMP positive samples, 36 (95%) were also positive by RT-PCR, while two were negative by RT-PCR. Among the 36 RT-LAMP and RT-PCR positive samples, 11 belonged to HRSV group A, while 25 belonged to group B. The results show that the new RT-LAMP is simple, rapid and well suited for HRSV diagnosis, especially in a limited-resource setting.","Mu, Yonglin; Zeng, Jiawei; Chen, Qianqian; Liu, Jia; Wang, Lili; Yao, Fujia; Cui, Meng; He, Zhixiang; Zhang, Chiyu; Xiao, Ming; Lan, Ke",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414002249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925133/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414002249; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.06.005,435

684384,Applied Research in Quality of Life: A Computational Literature Review,2021-08-09,"The receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein is a candidate vaccine antigen that binds angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), leading to virus entry. Here, it is shown that rapid conversion of recombinant RBD into particulate form via admixing with liposomes containing cobalt‐porphyrin‐phospholipid (CoPoP) potently enhances the functional antibody response. Antigen binding via His‐tag insertion into the CoPoP bilayer results in a serum‐stable and conformationally intact display of the RBD on the liposome surface. Compared to other vaccine formulations, immunization using CoPoP liposomes admixed with recombinant RBD induces multiple orders of magnitude higher levels of antibody titers in mice that neutralize pseudovirus cell entry, block RBD interaction with ACE2, and inhibit live virus replication. Enhanced immunogenicity can be accounted for by greater RBD uptake into antigen‐presenting cells in particulate form and improved immune cell infiltration in draining lymph nodes. QS‐21 inclusion in the liposomes results in an enhanced antigen‐specific polyfunctional T cell response. In mice, high dose immunization results in minimal local reactogenicity, is well‐tolerated, and does not elevate serum cobalt levels. Taken together, these results confirm that particulate presentation strategies for the RBD immunogen should be considered for inducing strongly neutralizing antibody responses against SARS‐CoV‐2.","Huang, Wei‐Chiao; Zhou, Shiqi; He, Xuedan; Chiem, Kevin; Mabrouk, Moustafa T.; Nissly, Ruth H.; Bird, Ian M.; Strauss, Mike; Sambhara, Suryaprakash; Ortega, Joaquin; Wohlfert, Elizabeth A.; Martinez‐Sobrido, Luis; Kuchipudi, Suresh V.; Davidson, Bruce A.; Lovell, Jonathan F.",Adv Mater,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202005637; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111375/,435

We conducted a scoping review to examine the nursing literature on IPV in the above four regions in China. We conducted a comprehensive search of 11 Chinese and English databases from database inception to January 31, 2020, for eligible papers including empirical studies, reviews, reports, and expert opinion articles. We hand searched references lists and other studies published by the first and corresponding authors of included articles. Two reviewers independently screened articles and extracted data, and three reviewers cross-checked the extracted results. We also conducted quality appraisal for applicable empirical studies. A total of 58 Chinese-language and 63 English-language articles were included, 58 from Taiwan, 44 from Hong Kong, 13 from mainland China, and six from institutions outside China, but none from Macao. The quantitative and qualitative studies described the prevalence and complex nature of IPV, comparable to non-nursing and international studies. Nurse-led advocacy and Qigong (traditional Chinese mind-body health practice) interventions showed promise for improving mental health in women in Hong Kong. There was a low level of knowledge and preparedness to respond to IPV among Chinese nurses, especially in mainland China. Mixed methods studies in Hong Kong and Taiwan as complex designs were generally well-conducted. Nursing case reports from Taiwan uniquely supplemented the evidence base. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, varying designs were used to study various facets of IPV, targeting victims, nurses and other key stakeholders. In mainland China and Macao, IPV research was limited in quantity, quality, and diversity. As more research in the area of IPV is needed, factors influencing nursing research on IPV also merit investigation, while taking into consideration socio-economic-political-cultural factors.","Li, Quanlei; Liu, Huaping; Chou, Kuei-Ru; Lin, Chia-Chin; Van, Iat-Kio; Davidson, Patricia M.; Campbell, Jacquelyn C.",Lancet Reg Health West Pac,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34327373/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanwpc.2020.100017,435

METHODS: Unilateral nasopharyngeal, nasal mid-turbinate, throat swabs, and saliva were simultaneously sampled for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR from suspect or confirmed cases of COVID-19.True positives were defined as patients with at least one SARS-CoV-2 detected by rRT-PCR from any site on the evaluation day or at any time point thereafter, till discharge. Diagnostic performance was assessed and extrapolated for site combinations. RESULTS: We evaluated 105 patients; 73 had active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, nasopharyngeal specimens had the highest clinical sensitivity at 85%, followed by throat, 80%, mid-turbinate, 62%, and saliva, 38-52%. Clinical sensitivity for nasopharyngeal, throat, mid-turbinate and saliva was 95%, 88%, 72%, and 44-56% if taken ≤7 days from onset of illness, and 70%, 67%, 47%, 28-44% if >7 days of illness. Comparing patients with URTI vs. pneumonia, clinical sensitivity for nasopharyngeal, throat, mid-turbinate and saliva was 92% vs 70%, 88% vs 61%, 70% vs 44%, 43-54% vs 26-45%. A combination of nasopharyngeal plus throat or mid-turbinate plus throat specimen afforded overall clinical sensitivities of 89-92%, this rose to 96% for persons with URTI and 98% for persons <7 days from illness onset. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal followed by throat specimens offer the highest clinical sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis in early illness.

685607,Does time change the anxiety and depression scores for pregnant women on Covid‐19 pandemic?,2021-07-12,"BACKGROUND: In comparison with adults, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children has a milder course. The management of children with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) needs to be appropriately targeted. METHODS: We designed a hub-and-spoke system to provide healthcare indications based on the use of telemedicine and stringent admission criteria, coordinate local stakeholders and disseminate information. RESULT: Between March 24th and September 24th 2020, the Hub Centre managed a total of 208 children (52% males, median age, 5.2, IQR 2–9.6 years) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Among them, 174 were managed in cooperation with family pediatricians and 34 with hospital-based physicians. One hundred-four (50%) received a final diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Application of stringent criteria for hospital admission based on clinical conditions, risk factors and respect of biocontainment measures, allowed to manage the majority of cases (74, 71.1%) through telemedicine. Thirty children (28%) were hospitalized (median length 10 days, IQR 5–19 days), mainly due to the presence of persistent fever, mild respiratory distress or co-infection occurring in infant or children with underlying conditions. However, the reasons for admission slightly changed over time. CONCLUSION: An hub-and-spoke system is effective in coordinate territorial health-care structures involved in management paediatric COVID-19 cases through telemedicine and the definition of stringent hospital admission criteria. The management of children with COVID-19 should be based on clinical conditions, assessed on a case-by-case critical evaluation, as well as on isolation measures, but may vary according to local epidemiological changes.","Nunziata, Francesco; Bruzzese, Eugenia; Poeta, Marco; Pierri, Luca; Catzola, Andrea; Ciccarelli, Gian Paolo; Vassallo, Edoardo; Montella, Emma; Lo Vecchio, Andrea; Guarino, Alfredo",Ital J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198780/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-020-00928-y,435

Prior to the pandemic, medical residents and physicians often experienced difficulty receiving counseling due to concerns about confidentiality, stigma, cost, time, and reportability to licensure/credentialing bodies. Since 2004, the OHSU Resident and Faculty Wellness Program (RFWP) team has sought to reduce these barriers by providing on-site free, confidential, individual counseling and medication management. Utilization of this program is high with over 500 physicians a year seeking care; 38% of all OHSU residents/fellows and 7% of all faculty eligible for our services participated in 2019-20. In the present essay, we describe how our model of care for trainees and faculty was a key wellness resource during COVID-19. Similar to other accounts of lower help-seeking by health professionals initially during the pandemic, we experienced a slight downturn in utilization rates during the initial weeks of when the pandemic struck our area, but quickly returned to normal and exceeded prior levels. All appointments shifted to telehealth visits and a number of physicians expressed gratitude for the opportunity to talk through concerns and strengthen coping. A number of physicians requested medication consultations to address severe insomnia, anxiety, and depression. We hope that being present in our physicians’ lives when they are exposed to COVID-related stress or trauma will keep them safe, help them cope with difficult experiences and losses, and ultimately facilitate both recovery and post-traumatic growth.","Ey, Sydney; Soller, Marie; Moffit, Mary",Glob Adv Health Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/2164956120973981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33329941/,435

This may be significant for patient health, epidemiology, and diagnosis. However, methods to preserve stool, and to extract and quantify viral RNA are not standardized. We test the performance of three preservative approaches at yielding detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA: the OMNIgene-GUT kit, Zymo DNA/RNA shield kit, and the most commonly applied, storage without preservative. We test these in combination with three extraction kits: QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Zymo Quick-RNA Viral Kit, and MagMAX Viral/Pathogen Kit. We also test the utility of ddPCR and RT-qPCR for the reliable quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from stool. We identify that the Zymo DNA/RNA preservative and the QiaAMP extraction kit yield more detectable RNA than the others, using both ddPCR and RT-qPCR. Taken together, we recommend a comprehensive methodology for preservation, extraction and detection of RNA from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in stool.","Natarajan, Aravind; Han, Alvin; Zlitni, Soumaya; Brooks, Erin F.; Vance, Summer E.; Wolfe, Marlene; Singh, Upinder; Jagannathan, Prasanna; Pinsky, Benjamin A.; Boehm, Alexandria; Bhatt, Ami S.",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25576-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34599164/,435

We examined the impact of a school nurse educational intervention aimed at improving K‐12 school biological event preparedness. METHODS: Missouri Association of School Nurses (MASN) members were e‐mailed a survey link in fall 2013 (ie, preintervention), links to online education modules (ie, intervention) in late fall, and a postintervention survey link in spring, 2014. School biological event readiness was measured using 35 indicators, for a possible score range of 0‐35. A paired t‐test compared pre‐ to postintervention preparedness scores. RESULTS: A total of 133 school nurses (33.6% response rate) completed a survey; 35.3% of those (N = 47) completed both pre‐ and postintervention survey that could be matched. Pre‐ and postintervention preparedness scores ranged from 5 to 28.5 ([Formula: see text] = 13.3) and 6.5 to 25 ([Formula: see text] = 14.8), respectively. Postintervention scores were significantly higher than preintervention scores for those who watched at least 1 module (t = −2.3, p < .05). CONCLUSION: The education intervention was effective at improving school preparedness, though the impact was small. The education intervention needs to be reassessed, especially in regard to providing a longer intervention period.","Rebmann, Terri; Elliott, Michael B.; Artman, Deborah; VanNatta, Matthew; Wakefield, Mary",J Sch Health,https://doi.org/10.1111/josh.12435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714869/,435

There have been revolutionary changes that happened with the advent of this novel corona virus. The proposed technique is based on secured glycemic information sharing between the server and users using artificial neural computational learning suite. Using symmetric Tree Parity Machines (TPMs) at the server and user ends, salp swarm-based session key has been generated for the proposed glycemic information modular encryption. The added taste of this paper is that without exchanging the entire session key, both TPMs will get full synchronized in terms of their weight vectors. With rise in the intake of highly rated Glycemic Indexed (GI) foods in today’s COVID-19 lockdown lifestyle, it contributes a lot in the formation of cavities inside the periodontium, and several other diseases likes of COPD, Type I and Type II DM. GI-based food pyramid depicts the merit of the food in the top to bottom spread up approach. High GI food items helps in more co-morbid diseases in patients. It is recommended to have foods from the lower radars of the food pyramid. The proposed encryption with salp swarm-generated key has been more resistant to Man-In-The-Middle attacks. Different mathematical tests were carried on this proposed technique. The outcomes of those tests have proved its efficacy, an acceptance of the proposed technique.

Such measures usually involve restrictions on the movement of citizens, and have had a profound effect on usual activities and timetables. As a result of school closures and strict restrictions regarding going outside home, children have been one of the most disadvantaged population groups during the lockdown period. We therefore aimed to investigate potential health risk behaviors amongst isolated pre-school and school-aged children. We retrieved relevant articles from MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases to describe identified health-related behaviors (i.e. screen exposure, environmental influence, physical activity and fitness, sedentariness, sleep patterns, eating habits, psychological response, body composition, and injuries) in relation to social isolation and social deprivation of children without previous illness or conditions. This review depicts the potential health-related behaviors according to related literature, and put the focus on future short and long-term sequels of social isolation. Socio-affective complications and insufficient physical activity are underscored as two of the main concerns, particularly among socio-economic deprived children. Both issues could be effectively addressed with either adequate parental or community guidance.","López-Bueno, Rubén; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F.; Casajús, José A.; Calatayud, Joaquín; Tully, Mark A.; Smith, Lee",Prev Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743520303807?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33271236/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106349; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743520303807,435

The pathogenesis of the disease is characterised by chronic dilatation, with irreversible and usually progressive destruction of the bronchial wall as a consequence of the vicious pathogenic circle described by E. Cole, of infection, inflammation, injury to the mucociliary system, and cyclical repair of the airway. The disease can have different causes, and usually presents with cough and chronic expectoration, and repeated, acute, infectious exacerbations.

The sera of immune mice served as a source of IgG antibodies. The concentration of histamine in the supernatants was determined at 4 hours after incubation with antisera and virus. We compared the contribution of MCs to the pathogenesis of post-immunization influenza infection with A/H5N1 and A/H1N1 influenza viruses in mice. The mice were immunized parenterally with inactivated viruses and challenged with lethal doses of drift A/H5N1 and A/H1N1 influenza viruses on the 14(th) day after immunization. Simultaneously, half of the mice were injected intraperitoneally with a mixture of histamine receptor blockers (chloropyramine and quamatel). In in vitro experiments, the immune complex formed by A/H5N1 virus and antiserum caused a significant increase in the histamine release compared to immune serum or the virus alone. With regard to the A/H1N1 virus, such an increase was not significant. A/H1N1 immunization caused detectable HI response in mice at 12(th) day after immunization, in contrast to the A/H5N1 virus. After challenge of A/H5N1-immunized mice, administration of antihistamines increased the survival rate by up to 90%. When infecting the A/H1N1-immunized mice, 90% of the animals were already protected from lethal infection by day 14; the administration of histamine receptor blockers did not increase survival. Histological examination of the lungs has shown that toluidine blue staining allows to estimate the degree of MC degranulation. The possibility of in vitro activation of murine MCs by IgG-containing immune complexes has been shown. In a model of influenza infection, it was shown that the administration of histamine receptor blockers increased survival. When the protection was formed faster due to the earlier production of HI antibodies, the administration of histamine receptor blockers did not significantly affect the course of the infection. These data allow to propose that even if there are antibody-dependent MC reactions, they can be easily stopped by the administration of histamine receptor blockers.","Mamontov, Andrey; Losev, Igor; Korzhevskii, Dmitrii; Guselnikova, Valeriia; Polevshchikov, Alexander; Desheva, Yulia",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335593/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.689436,435
