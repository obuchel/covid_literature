15561,GPVI (Glycoprotein VI) Interaction With Fibrinogen Is Mediated by Avidity and the Fibrinogen αC-Region,2021-01-21,"Improved mobility not only contributes to more intensive human activities but also facilitates the spread of communicable disease, thus constituting a major threat to billions of urban commuters. In this study, we present a multi-city investigation of communicable diseases percolating among metro travelers. We use smart card data from three megacities in China to construct individual-level contact networks, based on which the spread of disease is modeled and studied. We observe that, though differing in urban forms, network layouts, and mobility patterns, the metro systems of the three cities share similar contact network structures. This motivates us to develop a universal generation model that captures the distributions of the number of contacts as well as the contact duration among individual travelers. This model explains how the structural properties of the metro contact network are associated with the risk level of communicable diseases. Our results highlight the vulnerability of urban mass transit systems during disease outbreaks and suggest important planning and operation strategies for mitigating the risk of communicable diseases.","Qian, Xinwu; Sun, Lijun; Ukkusuri, Satish V.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7902662/,740
25074,Hospital Institutional Context and Funding,2018-02-15,"Infectious diseases are drawing our attention again. In recent years, we have been confronted with SARS, bird-flu, swine-flu and many other severe diseases. In addition, pathogens are getting resistant to drugs controlling them. In this paper we establish a new population dynamical system of infectious diseases including drug treatment. We take into account both sensitive and resistant parasites. The unknown model parameters are fitted based on a set of data for malaria from Cisse, Burkina Faso. The fitted model is used to investigate the influence of drug treatment on drug resistance. Based on these investigations, treatment strategies to reduce drug resistance can be elaborated.","An, Le Thi Thanh; Jäger, Willi",Model Based Parameter Estimation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121577/,740

However, asymptomatic dysphagia can also cause clinical issues, especially in those with respiratory conditions. Therefore, adequate screening is an essential beginning to their care. The repetitive saliva swallowing test (RSST) is one of the safest screening methods for dysphagia; it can be easily performed by nonprofessionals in any setting. There is evidence of its predictive values in aspiration pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), artificial ventilation, and other conditions. Additionaly, it has recently been found to be a strong predictor of the risk of future COPD exacerbation. The cost-effectiveness, harmlessness, and simplicity make it an optimal screening method for the large population of patients with respiratory conditions, although different cutoff values may be useful in different populations. It also takes into account multiple aspects of the swallowing ability, such as respiration, musculature, cognition, and general well-being.","Yoshimatsu, Yuki",Aspiration Pneumonia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7298539/,740
35287,Blockchain for Internet of Medical Things: A Technical Review,2020-05-31,"We predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries using a logistic model. The model uses a regression analysis based on the least-squares fitting. In particular, the growth rate of the infection has been fitted as an exponential decay, as compared to a linear decay, reported previously in logistic models. The model has been validated with the data of China and South Korea, where the pandemic is nearing to its end. The data of Italy, Germany, Spain, and Sweden show that the peak of the infection has been reached, i.e. a time when the new infections will start to decrease as compared to the previous day. The model predicts the approximate number of total infections at the end of the outbreak. The possible peak date and the total number of infections for different countries are predicted using the data available. The total number of infections in the USA is estimated to be around 4 million. The model prediction of Brazil shows that the peak will reach on 5 July 2020 and total infections will be 3.2 million. The reported data of India show a large initial scatter in the growth rate. The total number of infections in India is estimated to be around 2.4 million by the model and the predicted peak date is 3 August 2020. The predictions of India are discussed in the context of restricted movement of population, i.e. lock-down imposed by the government.","Bhardwaj, Rajneesh",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306451/,740

35293,The PULSE Project: A Case of Use of Big Data Uses Toward a Cohomprensive Health Vision of City Well Being,2020-05-31,"PURPOSE: To examine the diagnosis and treatment of traumatic bronchial rupture in children at the Children’s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China. METHODS: The diagnosis and treatment of eight cases of traumatic bronchial rupture were analyzed retrospectively from January 2014 to December 2019 in our hospital. RESULTS: Diagnosis of the eight patients was clear after a chest CT with three-dimensional reconstruction techniques and fiberoptic bronchoscopy; six of the patients had a delay in diagnosis of at least 2 weeks. Among the patients, six had left bronchus rupture, and the other two had right bronchus rupture. All eight patients received surgery; seven patients received a bronchial end-to-end valgus anastomosis, and one received right middle lobe lobectomy. There were no deaths in this group, and all patients were cured and discharged. Follow-up was conducted for 3 months to 2 years; the patients who received surgery showed mild bronchostenosis within 2 weeks after the trauma, and the other six patients showed moderate bronchostenosis upon CT examination. CONCLUSION: Being alert to bronchial rupture after trauma in children is helpful for diagnosis. Chest CT with three-dimensional reconstruction techniques and fiberoptic bronchoscopy are the most valuable diagnostic methods. The patients can show excellent results if the operation for a continuous valgus anastomosis of the posterior wall and interrupted end-to-end valgus anastomosis of the anterior wall on the ruptured side is performed in the early stage of traumatic bronchial rupture.","Li, Yonggang; Wang, Gang; Wu, Chun; Pan, Zhengxia; Li, Hongbo; Wang, Quan; Wang, Yi; Dai, Jiangtao",Pediatr Surg Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306561/,740
35294,Evaluation of Stationary Wavelet Transforms in Reconstruction of Pure High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs),2020-05-31,"Neurological and psychiatric (mental health) disorders have a large impact on health burden globally. Cognitive disorders (including dementia) and stroke are leading causes of disability. Mental health disorders, including depression, contribute up to one-third of total years lived with disability. The Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN) is an international multi-database network that harnesses administrative and electronic medical records from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. Using these databases NeuroGEN will investigate medication use and health outcomes in neurological and mental health disorders. A key objective of NeuroGEN is to facilitate high-quality observational studies to address evidence-practice gaps where randomized controlled trials do not provide sufficient information on medication benefits and risks that is specific to vulnerable population groups. International multi-database research facilitates comparisons across geographical areas and jurisdictions, increases statistical power to investigate small subpopulations or rare outcomes, permits early post-approval assessment of safety and effectiveness, and increases generalisability of results. Through bringing together international researchers in pharmacoepidemiology, NeuroGEN has the potential to be paradigm-changing for observational research to inform evidence-based prescribing. The first focus of NeuroGEN will be to address evidence-gaps in the treatment of chronic comorbidities in people with dementia.","Ilomäki, Jenni; Bell, J. Simon; Chan, Adrienne Y.

35306,Remote Health Monitoring Systems Based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication Systems,2020-05-31,"BACKGROUND: Recirculation during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is a known drawback that limits sufficient oxygenation. This study aimed to compare the short-term oxygenation and long-term mortality based on cannula configuration in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who receive VV-ECMO, especially in the absence of newly developed dual-lumen, single cannula. METHODS: Data of patients with severe ARDS who received VV-ECMO from 2012 to 2015 at six hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes were the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) at 1, 4, and 12 h after ECMO initiation and 180-day mortality. RESULTS: Patients (n = 335) were divided into two groups based on the return cannula site: femoral vein (n = 178) or internal jugular vein (n = 157). The propensity score matching analysis generated 90 pairs, and baseline characteristics at admission, including PaO(2), were similar between the groups. PaO(2) at 1, 4 and 12 h after ECMO initiation were not different according to cannula configuration. Moreover, the increment in oxygenation from the baseline values was not different between the femoral and jugular group. PaCO(2) level at 1, 4 and 12 h were significantly lower in the jugular group. The two groups did not differ in terms of mortality at 180 days after ECMO, however more cannula-related complications occurred in the jugular group. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the cannula configuration, patients with ARDS managed with VV-ECMO showed comparable clinical outcomes in terms of short-term oxygenation and long-term mortality. Nevertheless, further well-designed randomized control trials are warranted.","Lim, Sung Yoon; Ahn, Soyeon; Hong, Sang-Bum; Chung, Chi Ryang; Jeon, Kyeongman; Lee, Sang-Min; Cho, Woo Hyun; Park, Sunghoon; Cho, Young-Jae",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306930/,740
35307,A Convolutional Neural Network for Lentigo Diagnosis,2020-05-31,"BACKGROUND: In bacteria, pan-genomes are the result of an evolutionary “tug of war” between selection and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). High rates of HGT increase the genetic pool and the effective population size (N(e)), resulting in open pan-genomes. In contrast, selective pressures can lead to local adaptation by purging the variation introduced by HGT and mutation, resulting in closed pan-genomes and clonal lineages. In this study, we explored both hypotheses, elucidating the pan-genome of Vibrionaceae isolates after a perturbation event in the endangered oasis of Cuatro Ciénegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, and looking for signals of adaptation to the environments in their genomes. RESULTS: We obtained 42 genomes of Vibrionaceae distributed in six lineages, two of them did not showed any close reference strain in databases. Five of the lineages showed closed pan-genomes and were associated to either water or sediment environment; their high N(e) estimates suggest that these lineages are not from a recent origin. The only clade with an open pan-genome was found in both environments and was formed by ten genetic groups with low N(e), suggesting a recent origin. The recombination and mutation estimators (r/m) ranged from 0.005 to 2.725, which are similar to oceanic Vibrionaceae estimations. However, we identified 367 gene families with signals of positive selection, most of them found in the core genome; suggesting that despite recombination, natural selection moves the Vibrionaceae CCB lineages to local adaptation, purging the genomes and keeping closed pan-genome patterns. Moreover, we identify 598 SNPs associated with an unstructured environment; some of the genes associated with these SNPs were related to sodium transport. CONCLUSIONS: Different lines of evidence suggest that the sampled Vibrionaceae, are part of the rare biosphere usually living under famine conditions. Two of these lineages were reported for the first time. Most Vibrionaceae lineages of CCB are adapted to their micro-habitats rather than to the sampled environments. This pattern of adaptation is concordant with the association of closed pan-genomes and local adaptation.","Vázquez-Rosas-Landa, Mirna; Ponce-Soto, Gabriel Yaxal; Aguirre-Liguori, Jonás A.; Thakur, Shalabh; Scheinvar, Enrique; Barrera-Redondo, Josué; Ibarra-Laclette, Enrique; Guttman, David S.; Eguiarte, Luis E.; Souza, Valeria",BMC Genomics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7306931/,740
35314,Older People’s Needs and Opportunities for Assistive Technologies,2020-05-31,"Within the global financial chaos caused by the impacts of COVID‐19, the oil and natural gas production industry has been hit unusually hard. At the onset of the pandemic, oil was already experiencing severe market distress, as global supply exceeded global demand. OPEC had tried to craft a cutback in production, which then turned into a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, driving a dramatic decline in global crude oil prices. Then, as the global pandemic emerged and the response of almost all major consuming nations was to bring travel, industry, and workplace commuting to a screeching full stop, the resulting collapse in demand allowed the oil industry to give an object lesson in supply‐demand economics. The bottom fell out of the crude oil price both internationally and domestically for the United States.

52071,Tests salivaires dans les écoles : quelles modalités ?,2021-04-27,"INTRODUCTION: The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in nearly 2 million patients being put on waiting lists for elective procedures in the UK. We aim to describe how the COVID-19 Algorithm for Resuming Elective Surgery (CARES) was used to allocate patients to elective theatre lists while factoring in patient safety, risk to healthcare workers and, protection of resources. METHODOLOGY: A multidisciplinary team was employed with the task of using CARES to allocate theatre slots to 1169 patients on the waiting list. CARES was used in conjunction with an evidence-based scale for procedural urgency (Levels 1-4) to stratify patients and list them for surgery at one of three ‘COVID-light’ sites i.e. 1. With HDU/ITU access, specialist staff, and equipment, 2. An NHS short-stay surgical unit, 3. A private surgical unit. Incidence of post-operative Covid-19 infection was assessed by looking at positive Covid-19 RT-PCR or CT Chest with characteristic findings performed within 2 weeks of the surgery. RESULTS: 118 cases were deemed to be Priority 1/2, 222 were Level 3, and 808 were Level 4. In 6 weeks, 355 surgeries were performed, with Urgent and Level 1/2 cases performed soonest (mean 18 days, p < 0.001). 33 high-risk/complex/paediatric patients had surgery at Site 1 and the rest at Sites 2 and 3. No patients contracted COVID-19 within 2 weeks of surgery. CONCLUSION: CARES’ holistic approach enabled equitable and safe resumption of arthroplasty during the pandemic, by stratification and creation of COVID-light sites.

Portal or splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT) is a serious and common complication after LS, and lethal complications of PSVT can occur when the portal vein is completely occluded by portal vein thrombosis (PVT). We aimed to clarify the predictors of PSVT after LS and to determine which of them were also predictors of PVT. METHODS A total of 56 consecutive patients who underwent elective LS were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of PSVT after LS. In addition, patients with PSVT were divided into two groups: a PVT group and a non-PVT group. The preoperative and intraoperative clinical data were compared among the groups. RESULTS Thirty (53.6%) patients developed PSVT. The splenic vein diameter was the most useful predictor for the development of PSVT, and 10 mm was an accurate splenic vein diameter cut-off value for use as a predictive factor for PSVT. In addition, the splenic vein diameter was the most useful predictor of the development of PVT from splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), and 14 mm was found to be an accurate cut-off value. CONCLUSION PSVT is a common postoperative complication that is identified on enhanced computed tomography. The splenic vein diameter is not only a predictor of PSVT but also of the development of PVT from SVT.","Kuroki, Tamotsu; Kitasato, Amane; Tokunaga, Takayuki; Takeshita, Hiroaki; Taniguchi, Ken; Maeda, Shigeto; Fujioka, Hikaru",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-018-1655-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29569060/,740

It explores the observation of students as participants in the online learning of using Personal Protective Equipment and simulation-based learning of perinatal emergency management. This was followed by their mutual interaction and reflections. This paper aims to understand the role of synchronous remote learning through simulation and its impact on interprofessional interactions. We describe the experience of medical and midwifery students with the ONE-Sim workshop, facilitated by medical (obstetric and neonatal) and midwifery educators. Formal thematic analysis will be performed as part of the ongoing study; however, initial direct observation demonstrated that students reacted positively to the online ONE-Sim workshop and engaged well with facilitators and peers. Students mutually interacted amongst themselves, shared their previous experiences, knowledge of roles as medical and midwifery practitioners and how they see themselves in those roles in a perinatal emergency setting.

Developing an algorithm-based technique could improve postoperative results while limiting intraoperative inefficiencies. Objective To investigate the postoperative success of an algorithmic external levator aponeurosis resection technique for aponeurotic ptosis with good levator function. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study included patients with involutional ptosis and normal levator function who were treated from July 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016, at a private ophthalmic plastic surgery clinic. Interventions The technique involved a small incision in the eyelid crease, with dissection through the orbital septum to expose the levator aponeurosis. The leading edge of the aponeurosis was then clamped to a medical-grade spring scale to standardize the stress on the eyelid between patients. Two millimeters of aponeurosis were resected for every 1 mm of desired ptosis correction. Two sutures were then placed to connect the aponeurosis to the tarsus at predetermined locations. Main Outcomes and Measures Preoperative predicted (goal) vs actual margin reflex distance-1 (MRD1). Results Twenty-six eyelids of 15 patients (6 men and 9 women; mean [SD] age, 65 years [range, 17-84 years]) met inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up was 189 days (range, 63-343 days). The mean preoperative MRD1 was 0.44 mm (range, -0.5 to 2 mm; 95% CI, 0.18-0.70 mm) compared with the final mean MRD1 of 3.2 mm (range, 2.5-4.0 mm; 95% CI, 3.1-3.4 mm; P < .001). The mean predicted goal MRD1 was 3.4 mm (range, 2.5-4.0 mm; 95% CI, 3.2-3.5 mm). The final MRD1 of all eyelids was within 1 mm of the goal MRD1. The mean surgical time per eyelid was 14.6 minutes (range, 10.5-34.0 minutes). Twelve eyelids (46%) did not have intraoperative suture adjustments. Conclusions and Relevance In correcting aponeurotic ptosis, a small-incision levator aponeurectomy incorporating an algorithm and consistent stress on the aponeurosis during resection achieves the goal MRD1 efficiently. The algorithm closely estimates the desired height intraoperatively such that only small intraoperative suture height revisions, if any, are needed. No intraoperative adjustments were made in 12 eyelids, necessitating future studies to determine whether any adjustments are needed.

162197,Development of a pharmacist-led internal medicine outpatient consult service.,2021,"BACKGROUND Given the uncontrolled increase of those affected by the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, COVID-19, and the possibility of the health system collapsing in Spain, the Royal Decree 463/2020, of March 14th, declared a state of alarm for the management of this health crisis. The whole population, despite their social background, were confined inside their homes during this arduous situation. There are numerous articles that endorse the idea that their home conditions, the number of people with whom they coexist with, their employment, gender, amount of physical exercise, as well as their body mass index and their diagnosis in COVID-19 are characteristics that may represent an increased risk of suffering pain and changes in their quality of life. We proposed a study to determine the impact of the confinement on pain, quality of life and public health of the Spanish population due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS An observational study was carried out during April and May 2020 through an online survey. It was statistically analysed through descriptive analysis and inferential analysis by bivariate logistic regression, ordinal logistic and Pearson's chi square. RESULTS A total of 225 questionnaires were obtained between April and May 2020. For subjects suffering pain before confinement, significant relationships were drawn between experiencing pain and work-related activities (P=0.006), as well as, physical activity or the absence of it (P=0.033). In addition, an important association between experiencing pain and gender was discovered, both for people suffering pain before and during confinement (P=0.007 and P=0.011). Furthermore, the confinement has affected the quality of life of those affected, particularly in relation with suffering pain before and during confinement (P=0.001 and P=0.000), Job type (P=0.016) and BMI (P=0.025) and affecting more Physical Role, Emotional Role and Mental Health, followed by Physical Function. CONCLUSIONS The presence of pain in subjects undergoing confinement is persistent, with varying intensity and frequency based on age, gender, physical activity, and work status. In any of these conditions, the quality of life of the subjects in confinement has been severely affected, which to this day creates a severe public health problem.","Iglesias-López, Elvira; García-Isidoro, Sara; Castellanos-Sánchez, Víctor Omar",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894721/,740

Since the number of corona positive patients is increasing sharply in Iran, this study aimed to forecast the number of newly infected patients in the coming days in Iran. METHODS The data used in this study were obtained from daily reports of the Iranian Ministry of Health and the datasets provided by the Johns Hopkins University including the number of new infected cases from February 19, 2020 to March 21, 2020. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was applied to predict the number of patients during the next thirty days. RESULTS The ARIMA model forecasted an exponential increase in the number of newly detected patients. The result of this study also show that if the spreading pattern continues the same as before, the number of daily new cases would be 3574 by April 20. CONCLUSION Since this disease is highly contagious, health politicians need to make decisions to prevent its spread; otherwise, even the most advanced and capable health care systems would face problems for treating all infected patients and a substantial number of deaths will become inevitable.","Moftakhar, Leila; Seif, Mozhgan",Archives of Iranian medicine,https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271595/,740

It is now clear that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by respiratory microdroplets expelled by infected persons, which can become suspended in the air. Several layering technologies are being explored to mitigate indoor transmission in the hopes of re-opening business, schools and transportation systems. Here we coupled the water adsorptive and photocatalytic capacity of novel Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to demonstrate the capture and inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. Discussion is given on the methods of analysis and the differences between the photocatalytic activity of several MOFs, and the difference between MOF induced photocatalysis and ultra violet photolysis of SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to investigate the association between baseline sarcopenia and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 who had baseline chest computed tomography (CT) scans at a Korean university hospital from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The main outcome was time from hospital admission to discharge. Death was considered as a competing risk for discharge. Baseline skeletal muscle cross-sectional area at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra was measured from chest CT scans. The lowest quartile of skeletal muscle index (skeletal muscle cross-sectional area divided by height-squared) was defined as sarcopenia. RESULTS: Of 121 patients (median age, 62 years; 44 men; 29 sarcopenic), 7 patients died and 86 patients were discharged during the 60-day follow-up. Patients with sarcopenia showed a longer time to discharge (median, 55 vs. 28 days; p<0.001) and a higher incidence of death (17.2% vs. 2.2%; p=0.004) than those without sarcopenia. Baseline sarcopenia was an independent predictor of delayed hospital discharge (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.96), but was not independently associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 (aHR, 3.80; 95% CI, 0.48-30.26). The association between baseline sarcopenia and delayed hospital discharge was consistent in subgroups stratified by age, sex, comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19.

Many people started to receive doses of BCG based on that hypothesis even before its confirmation.

Reporte de un caso,2021,The dedication of undergraduate neuroscience faculty to their students could not have been more evident than what these educators demonstrated when the COVID-19 pandemic impacted colleges and universities across the United States. These faculty faced the crisis head-on to provide their students with exceptional instruction in virtual formats that many faculty had never used for instruction before the pandemic. This same tenacious attitude has been reflected in pedagogical efforts that undergraduate neuroscience faculty have undertaken since the mid-1990s. The challenges of providing cutting-edge neuroscience education to undergraduates in a dynamic field have produced a series of curricular designs and approaches that capitalize on discipline-based education research. This article reviews curricular models and pedagogical strategies aimed at enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate neuroscience students whose lived experiences and academic backgrounds reflect the richly kaleidoscopic demographics of college students in the 21st century. The future of undergraduate neuroscience education is bright as faculty and their students collaborate on their journey of discovery in neuroscience.,"Ramirez, Julio J",Neurosci Lett,,740

We endeavoured to establish the experiences of families of children attending a neurodevelopmental service after a transition to virtual consultations. METHODS: Anonymous questionnaires were posted to parents of children registered in virtual clinics over a 10-week period. RESULTS: Thirty parental questionnaires were completed. Parents reported a very high level of satisfaction (8.2/10) with previous face-to-face clinic appointments and virtual consultations (8.2/10). Individual aspects of virtual consultations received very positive ratings. Overall, 77% of parents highlighted a future preference for a combined service of both virtual and face-to-face consultations. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the high level of parental satisfaction with the service, but especially satisfaction with the unplanned transition to virtual clinics. Virtual clinics cannot replace the holistic approach gained from face-to-face consultations; however, we identified their benefits of convenience and accessibility for our vulnerable population. In response, we have developed an integrated outpatient service involving both forms of consultation to potentiate satisfaction and adapt to meet the needs of our patients. The suggested proforma that has been developed offers a simple structure for undertaking a virtual consultation that can be adapted to different specialities, integrating the suggestions provided by our service users.","Finnegan, Rebecca; Flynn, Aoife; Flanagan, Orla",Ir. j. med. sci,,740

The pandemic has led to many social and health-care challenges. In this context, surgery is an area that is facing the need for many adaptations. In this systematic literature review, we analyzed different perspectives concerning this situation, aiming to provide recommendations that could guide surgeons and entities toward screening, elective and emergency surgeries, decision making, and operating room management. A computerized search in PubMed, Scopus, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) for relevant literature up to April 4, 2020, was performed. Articles were included if they were related to surgery dynamics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 281 articles found in our initial search and 15 articles from alternative sources, 39 were included in our review after a systematic evaluation. Concerning preoperative testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 29 (74.4%) articles recommended some kind of screening. Another major suggestion was postponing all (or at least selected) elective operations (29 articles, 74.4%). Several additional recommendations with respect to surgical practice or surgical staff were also assessed and discussed, such as performing laparoscopic surgeries and avoiding the use of electrocauterization. On the basis of the current literature, we concluded that any surgery that can be delayed should be postponed. COVID-19 screening is strongly recommended for all surgical cases. Moreover, surgical staff should be reduced to the essential members and provided with institutional psychological support.","Hojaij, Flávio Carneiro; Chinelatto, Lucas Albuquerque; Boog, Gustavo Henrique Pereira; Kasmirski, Júlia Adriana; Lopes, João Vitor Ziroldo; Sacramento, Fernando Mauad",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,740

The SOT group had a higher proportion of cardiovascular disease (P < .05). During the index hospitalization, there were no significant differences with regard to disease severity or critical care needs (mechanical intubation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy). At 28 days, 4 (13%) patients died in the SOT group and 8 (13%) patients died in the control group (P = 1.0). Nineteen patients received tocilizumab in the SOT group compared to 29 patients in the control group. Among these patients, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R) levels increased after tocilizumab and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels decreased after tocilizumab. Overall, SOT patients had comparable mortality to non-SOT patients, although numerically more SOT patients received tocilizumab (63% vs 48%) and steroids (37% vs 20%). Larger, multi-center studies are needed to ascertain these findings. Lastly, the complex cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 remains an area of intense research and the analysis of key interleukin levels (IL-6, IL-10, and sIL2R) in this study contributes to the understanding of this process.","Ringer, Matthew; Azmy, Veronica; Kaman, Kelsey; Tang, Daiwei; Cheung, Harry; Azar, Marwan M; Price, Christina; Malinis, Maricar",Transpl Infect Dis,,740

The postponing aimed to protect the public from an unknown risk caused by COVID-19. At the beginning of the outbreak, for public health authorities, the aerosol-generating procedures and the close proximity between dental care workers and patients in dentistry represented sufficient justification for the delay of dental visits. Dental care is a priority, and for many years, studies have proven that the lack and delay of dental care can cause severe consequences for the oral health of the general population, which can cause a high global burden of oral diseases. Safety is necessary while resuming dental activities, and risk assessment is an efficient method for understanding and preventing the COVID-19 infectious threats facing the dental industry and affecting dental care workers and patients. In this study, for safe dental care delivery, we adapted risk assessment criteria and an approach and an occupational classification system.

264114,Providing safe virtual health care,2020,"Today, as many work and socialize completely online, we are more acutely aware than ever of the cybernetic relationship between the body (in-situ) and the virtually or digitally extended self. However, even before the onset of the current global pandemic (COVID-19), the contemporary ‘body’ had to be understood as extended beyond physical flesh, through global communications systems. How do our practices on these platforms reveal our evolving relationships with a distributed and digitally mutable body? Drawing on my own construction of cyborg theory as a subset of posthuman discourse, this paper links the practices of explicitly cyborg performance, like Stelarc and ORLAN, with the increasingly banal practice of body-hacking as it is realized in the performance of the self (both consciously and unconsciously) on distributed, social media platforms. These discussions touch both on identified trends in contemporary self-representation as well as artists whose work within those spaces acts as a comment, critique, and application of those practices. Through this discussion, I show how these practices can be understood as body hacking and how that body hacking can both reflect an increasing sense of personal empowerment in relation to the body as well as a morally ambiguous algorithmic redefinition of the paradigmatic body. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Stoyanova, M.",International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media,,740

Worldwide stay-at-home directives and emergency changes in healthcare policy and reimbursement have smoothed the trail for broad implementation of technology-based remote mental health services for children. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is particularly well-positioned to address some of the most pressing child and parental needs that arise during stressful times, and telehealth formats of PCIT, such as Internet-delivered PCIT (iPCIT), have already been supported in controlled trials.

Neste estudo, entende-se crianças em vulnerabilidade social as vítimas de abandono, violência física, psicológica, e emocional. Trata-se de uma esquisa participativa de abordagem qualitativa, realizada em uma escola pública da rede municipal de ensino da cidade de Pelotas, no estado do Rio Grande do Sul/Brasil. As atividades lúdicas com os cães foram desenvolvidas no espaço escolar (quadra de esportes). Os participantes deste estudo foram cinco crianças, na faixa etária entre 6 e 9 anos, cursando do 1º ao 4º ano do ensino fundamental. Os cães fazem parte do Projeto de Extensão do Curso de Medicina Veterinária da Universidade Federal de Pelotas/UFPel, conhecido na comunidade como Projeto Pet Terapia, com aprovação no COCEPE sob nº 52702026. A coleta de dados ocorreu entre os meses de junho e julho de 2016. Foi utilizado o método photovoice, que possibilitou aos participantes fazerem registros de suas percepções em relação às IAAS através da foto. A escolha desta metodologia se deu por entender-se que as crianças precisam ser vistas e ouvidas nas pesquisas, possibilitando que ganhem voz através das suas narrativas visuais. Para analisar os dados, utilizou-se a Análise Temática, da qual emergiu o tema: O olhar da criança sobre a intervenção lúdica com os cães. A metodologia empregada permitiu que a criança pudesse externalizar seus medos e anseios de forma descontraída, lúdica e divertida, por meio do ato de fotografar. O photovoice mostrou ser um instrumento valioso para estudos cujo o objetivo é tornar a criança protagonista de suas histórias de vida. Constatou- se que as IAAS, aliadas ao método photovoice, elevou a autoestima e a autoconfiança das crianças, observado durante os momentos de brincadeiras entre elas e os cães. Acariciar e afagar o cão foi um incremento importante para a redução do estresse e da ansiedade. A presença dele promoveu um conforto emocional e atmosfera acolhedora. Além de estimular o vínculo de amizade entre o grupo, melhorou a relação com seus pares. Neste sentido, pretende-se com os resultados obtidos neste estudo contribuir para divulgação desta abordagem terapêutica e apoiar a sua utilização como uma forma eficiente e inovadora, para promover as ações de cuidado à saúde de crianças em contextos de vulnerabilidade social.","PEREIRA, VIVIANE RIBEIRO",,,740

Here we present antibody and T cell responses after vaccination with BNT162b1 from a second, non-randomized open-label phase I/II trial in healthy adults, 18-55 years of age. Two doses of 1-50 µg of BNT162b1 elicited robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and strong antibody responses, with RBD-binding IgG concentrations clearly above those seen in serum from a cohort of individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Geometric mean titres of SARS-CoV-2 serum-neutralizing antibodies on day 43 were 0.7-fold (1-µg dose) to 3.5-fold (50-µg dose) those of the recovered individuals.

Here, we present a sensor, the Soil Water Profiler (SWaP), which can determine local soil water content (Î¸) with a precision of 6.10-5 cm3cm-3, an accuracy of 0.002 cm3cm-3, a temporal resolution of 24 minutes and a one-dimensional spatial resolution of 1 cm. The sensor comprises two copper sheets, integrated into a sleeve and connected to a coil, thereby forming a resonant circuit. A vector network analyzer, inductively coupled to the resonant circuit, measures the resonance frequency, against which Î¸ was calibrated. The sensors were integrated into a positioning system, which measures Î¸ along the depth of cylindrical tubes. When combined with modulating light (4-hour period) and resultant modulating plant transpiration, the SWaP enables quantification of the component of root water uptake distribution that varies proportionally with total plant water uptake, and distinguishes it from soil water redistribution via soil pores and roots. Additionally, as a young, growing maize (Zea mays) plant progressively tapped its soil environment dry, we observed clear changes in plant-driven root water uptake and soil water redistribution profiles. Our SWaP setup can measure the root water uptake and redistribution of sandy soil water content with unprecedented precision. The SWaP is therefore a promising device offering new insights into soil-plant hydrology, with applications for functional root phenotyping in non-saline, temperature controlled conditions, at low cost.","van Dusschoten, Dagmar; Kochs, Johannes; Kuppe, Christian; Sydoruk, Viktor A; Couvreur, Valentin; Pflugfelder, Daniel; Postma, Johannes A",Plant physiol,,740
287768,Public policy responses to the covid-19 epidemic - The case of family policy in the Czech Republic,2021,"Effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed to control this current pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action. Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA. Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps. A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP. In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2'-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed. These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral.","Gordon, Calvin J; Tchesnokov, Egor P; Woolner, Emma; Perry, Jason K; Feng, Joy Y; Porter, Danielle P; Götte, Matthias",J Biol Chem,,740

Indeed, several studies and trials have begun to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanisms of vitamin D in the pathogenesis of Covid-19. We consider whether deficiency of vitamin D may be one of the underlying biological factors that could explain the excess mortality seen among non-Caucasians. We also raise several important questions which need to be addressed to provide a clear picture of the extent to which vitamin D supplementation may benefit patients with Covid-19, particularly those with underlying risk factors.","Teymoori-Rad, Majid; Marashi, Sayed Mahdi",Rev Med Virol,,740

289537,Acces aux soins des personnes en difficulte : de la tuberculose au coronavirus,2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of statins on COVID-19 outcomes is important given the high prevalence of their use among individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. Our aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy is maintained during hospitalization. METHODS: This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54-0.83, p < 0.001); lower incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6-0.97, p = 0.025), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn. In addition, statin therapy was associated with a decreased probability that patients with COVID-19 will develop AKI, ARDS, or sepsis and decreases the need for IMV.","Torres-Peña, José David; Pérez-Belmonte, Luis M; Fuentes-Jiménez, Francisco; López Carmona, Mª Dolores; Pérez-Martinez, Pablo; López-Miranda, José; Carrasco Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Vargas Núñez, Juan Antonio; Del Corral Beamonte, Esther; Magallanes Gamboa, Jeffrey Oskar; González García, Andrés; González Moraleja, Julio; Cortés Troncoso, Andrés; Taboada Martínez, María Luisa; Del Fidalgo Montero, María Del Pilar; Seguí Ripol, José Miguel; Gil Sánchez, Ricardo; Alegre González, Diana; Boixeda, Ramon; Cortés Rodríguez, Begoña; Ena, Javier; García García, Gema María; Ventura Esteve, Ana; Ramos Rincón, José Manuel; Gómez-Huelgas, Ricardo",Drugs,,740
289756,Erratum,2020,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic with its countermeasures, e.g. lock-downs, resulted in decreases in emissions of various trace gases. Here we investigate the changes of ozone over Europe associated with these emission reductions using a coupled global/regional chemistry climate model. We conducted and analysed a business as usual and a sensitivity (COVID19) simulation. A source apportionment (tagging) technique allows us to make a sector-wise attribution of these changes, e.g. to natural and anthropogenic sectors such as land transport. Our simulation results show a decrease of ozone of 8% over Europe in May 2020 due to the emission reductions. The simulated reductions are in line with observed changes in ground-level ozone. The source apportionment results show that this decrease is mainly due to the decreased ozone precursors from anthropogenic origin. Further, our results show that the ozone reduction is much smaller than the reduction of the total NO x emissions (around 20%), mainly caused by an increased ozone production efficiency. This means that more ozone is produced for each emitted NO x molecule. Hence, more ozone is formed from natural emissions and the ozone productivities of the remaining anthropogenic emissions increase. Our results show that politically induced emissions reductions cannot be transferred directly to ozone reductions, which needs to be considered when designing mitigation strategies.","Mertens, Mariano Jöckel Patrick Matthes Sigrun Nützel Matthias Grewe Volker Sausen Robert",Environmental Research Letters,,740

There are several reasons to hypothesize that the eye, and the retina in particular, could be a target of organ damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This cohort observational study analyzes OCT angiography and structural OCT of 70 post-COVID-19 patients evaluated at 1-month hospital discharge and 22 healthy control subjects. Primary outcomes were macular vessel density (VD) and vessel perfusion (VP); structural OCT features were evaluated as secondary outcomes. In addition, patients and healthy volunteers were evaluated for best corrected visual acuity, slit lamp photograph, and fundus photo image. RESULTS: VD and VP in 3 × 3 and 6 × 6 mm scans for SCP and DCP showed no significant differences between the groups. Similarly, CMT and GCL did not reveal significant differences between post-COVID-19 and healthy patients. Nine patients (12.9%) featured retinal cotton wool spots and 10 patients had vitreous fibrillary degeneration. The prevalence of epiretinal membrane and macular hole was similar in the two groups. One case of extra papillary focal retinal hemorrhage was reported in the post-COVID-19 group.

We sought to decipher factors predictive of a deterioration in phenotype ('transition') in patients initially presenting with non-severe disease. METHODS: Patients from the 'Attikon' cohort with disease duration &#8805;1 year were included. Disease at diagnosis was categorised as mild, moderate or severe, based on the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group manifestations and physician judgement. 'Transition' in severity was defined as an increase in category of severity at any time from diagnosis to last follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify baseline factors associated with this transition. RESULTS: 462 patients were followed for a median (IQR) of 36 (120) months. At diagnosis, more than half (56.5%) had a mild phenotype. During disease course, transition to more severe forms was seen in 44.2%, resulting in comparable distribution among severity patterns at last follow-up (mild 28.4%, moderate 33.1%, severe 38.5%). Neuropsychiatric involvement at onset (OR 6.33, 95% CI 1.22 to 32.67), male sex (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.23 to 16.60) and longer disease duration (OR 1.09 per 1 year, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.14) were independently associated with transition from mild or moderate to severe disease. Patients with disease duration &#8805;3 years who progressed to more severe disease had more than 20-fold increased risk to accrue irreversible damage.

Currently, surgeries for cancer patients with COVID-19 are generally suggested to be properly delayed. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented a 69-year-old Chinese female colon cancer patient with COVID-19, the first case accepted the surgical treatment during the pandemic in China. The patient developed a fever on January 28, 2020. After treatments with Ceftriaxone and Abidol, her fever was not moderated yet. A repeat chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed significantly exacerbated infectious lesions with a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid. An abdomen CT scan indicated the tumor of ascending colon with local wrapped changes. She was diagnosed with 'Severe novel coronavirus pneumonia' and 'Incomplete bowel obstruction: Colon cancer?'. After actively anti-inflammatory and anti-viral therapies, a right colectomy with lymph node dissection was performed on March 11, followed by a pathological examination. The patient successfully recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia and incomplete bowel obstruction after surgery without any postoperative related complications and was discharged on the 9th day after operation. Significant degeneration, necrosis and slough of focal intestinal and colonic mucosal epithelial cells were observed under microscope.

Consenso de nutrición en enfermedad renal crónica e infección por SARS-CoV-2,2021,Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and public health measures to control it have resulted in unique challenges in the management of patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS). We report our experience with the management of acute worsening of symptoms due to battery exhaustion in 3 patients with DBS. Methods: Patients with DBS for movement disorders who visited the emergency room due to battery exhaustion during the nationwide lockdown from April to May 2020 were included. Results: Two patients with subthalamic nucleus-DBS for Parkinson's disease (PD) and one with globus pallidus interna-DBS for generalized dystonia presented with acute worsening of symptoms due to battery exhaustion. Urgent battery replacement was performed in both patients with PD. The patient with generalized dystonia was managed with medication adjustment as he chose to defer battery replacement. Conclusion: DBS battery replacement can be an emergency. Decisions regarding DBS battery replacement should be individualized during this COVID-19 pandemic.,"Holla, Vikram Venkappayya; Neeraja, Koti; Surisetti, Bharath Kumar; Prasad, Shweta; Kamble, Nitish; Srinivas, Dwarakanath; Yadav, Ravi; Pal, Pramod Kumar",,,740

It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.","Kowalski, Luiz P; Sanabria, Alvaro; Ridge, John A; Ng, Wai Tong; de Bree, Remco; Rinaldo, Alessandra; Takes, Robert P; Mäkitie, Antti A; Carvalho, Andre L; Bradford, Carol R; Paleri, Vinidh; Hartl, Dana M; Vander Poorten, Vincent; Nixon, Iain J; Piazza, Cesare; Lacy, Peter D; Rodrigo, Juan P; Guntinas-Lichius, Orlando; Mendenhall, William M; D039,; Cruz, Anil; Lee, Anne W M; Ferlito, Alfio",Head Neck,,740

The frustrating thing is that, right now, this virus is still new. It only came to the attention of the World Health Organization at the end of December. Very few cases in thalassemia have so far been reported; is this due to lack of testing or a true lack of infection/susceptibility? However, we believe that more data should be collected to better characterise the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with thalassemias. Therefore, a multicenter registry and the collection of comprehensive data from both positive COVID-19 thalassemia major and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia are necessary to clarify debated issues.

Present work focuses on the study of the dynamics of recurrent neural networks trained to perform Boolean-like tasks with temporal stimuli that emulate being sensory signals. The contribution here is the description of the dynamics through the classification and interpretation carried out with a set of numerical simulations corresponding to networks trained to process time stimuli with AND, OR, XOR, and Flip Flop tasks.

We aimed to identify factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks among staff and residents in LTCFs. Methods: We did a national cross-sectional survey of all LTCFs providing dementia care or care to adults aged 65 years or older in England between May 26 and June 19, 2020. The survey collected data from managers of eligible LTCFs on LTCF characteristics, staffing factors, the use of disease control measures, and the number of confirmed cases of infection among staff and residents in each LTCF. Survey responses were linked to individual-level SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results obtained through the national testing programme in England between April 30 and June 13, 2020. The primary outcome was the weighted period prevalence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in residents and staff reported via the survey. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with infection in staff and residents, an outbreak (defined as at least one case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a resident or staff member), and a large outbreak (defined as LTCFs with more than a third of the total number of residents and staff combined testing positive, or with >20 residents and staff combined testing positive) using data from the survey and from the linked survey-test dataset. Findings: 9081 eligible wLTCFs were identified, of which 5126 (56·4%) participated in the survey, providing data on 160â033 residents and 248â594 staff members. The weighted period prevalence of infection was 10·5% (95% CI 9·9-11·1) in residents and 3·8% (3·4-4·2) in staff members. 2724 (53·1%) LTCFs reported outbreaks, and 469 (9·1%) LTCFs reported large outbreaks. The odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·80 [95% CI 0·75-0·86], p<0·0001) and staff (0·70 [0·65-0·77], p<0·0001), and of large outbreaks (0·59 [0·38-0·93], p=0·024) were significantly lower in LTCFs that paid staff statutory sick pay compared with those that did not. Each one unit increase in the staff-to-bed ratio was associated with a reduced odds of infection in residents (0·82 [0·78-0·87], p<0·0001) and staff (0·63 [0·59-0·68], p<0·0001. The odds of infection in residents (1·30 [1·23-1·37], p<0·0001) and staff (1·20 [1·13-1·29], p<0·0001), and of outbreaks (2·56 [1·94-3·49], p<0·0001) were significantly higher in LTCFs in which staff often or always cared for both infected or uninfected residents compared with those that cohorted staff with either infected or uninfected residents. Significantly increased odds of infection in residents (1·01 [1·01-1·01], p<0·0001) and staff (1·00 [1·00-1·01], p=0·0005), and of outbreaks (1·08 [1·05-1·10], p<0·0001) were associated with each one unit increase in the number of new admissions to the LTCF relative to baseline (March 1, 2020). The odds of infection in residents (1·19 [1·12-1·26], p<0·0001) and staff (1·19 [1·10-1·29], p<0·0001), and of large outbreaks (1·65 [1·07-2·54], p=0·024) were significantly higher in LTCFs that were for profit versus those that were not for profit. Frequent employment of agency nurses or carers was associated with a significantly increased odds of infection in residents (aOR 1·65 [1·56-1·74], p<0·0001) and staff (1·85 [1·72-1·98], p<0·0001), and of outbreaks (2·33 [1·72-3·16], p<0·0001) and large outbreaks (2·42 [1·67-3·51], p<0·0001) compared with no employment of agency nurses or carers. Compared with LTCFs that did not report difficulties in isolating residents, those that did had significantly higher odds of infection in residents (1·33 [1·28-1·38], p<0·0001) and staff (1·48 [1·41-1·56], p<0·0001), and of outbreaks (1·84 [1·48-2·30], p<0·0001) and large outbreaks (1·62 [1·24-2·11], p=0·0004). Interpretation: Half of LTCFs had no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first wave of the pandemic. Reduced transmission from staff is associated with adequate sick pay, minimal use of agency staff, an increased staff-to-bed ratio, and staff cohorting with either infected or uninfected residents. Increased transmission from residents is associated with an increased number of new admissions to the facility and poor compliance with isolation procedures.

IL-6 plays roles in chronic inflammation (closely related to chronic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer) and even in the cytokine storm of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Acute inflammation during the immune response and wound healing is a well-controlled response, whereas chronic inflammation and the cytokine storm are uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Non-immune cells and immune cells, cytokines such as IL-1ß, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) and transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) play central roles in inflammation. Synergistic interactions between NF-&#954;B and STAT3 induce the hyper-activation of NF-&#954;B followed by the production of various inflammatory cytokines. Because IL-6 is a NF-&#954;B target, simultaneous activation of NF-&#954;B and STAT3 in non-immune cells triggers a positive feedback loop of NF-&#954;B activation by the IL-6-STAT3 axis. This positive feedback loop is called the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 Amp) and is a key player in the local initiation model, which states that local initiators, such as senescence, obesity, stressors, infection, injury and smoking, trigger diseases by promoting interactions between non-immune cells and immune cells. This model counters dogma that holds that autoimmunity and oncogenesis are triggered by the breakdown of tissue-specific immune tolerance and oncogenic mutations, respectively. The IL-6 Amp is activated by a variety of local initiators, demonstrating that the IL-6-STAT3 axis is a critical target for treating diseases.","Hirano, Toshio",Int. immunol,,740

Dr. Abdurrahman Yurtaslan Ankara Oncology Hospital has been considered as a 'non-pandemic' center ('clean') in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey. The other state hospitals that also take care of cancer patients in Ankara were defined as 'pandemic' centers. This study aimed to evaluate hospital admission changes and the precautionary measures in clean and pandemic centers during the pandemic. The effect of these measures and changes on COVID-19 spreading among cancer patients was also evaluated. METHODS: The patients admitted to the medical oncology follow-up, new diagnosis, or chemotherapy (CT) outpatient clinics during the first quarter of pandemic period (March 15-June 1, 2020) of each center were determined and compared with the admissions of the same frame of previous year (March 15-June 1, 2019). COVID-19 PCR test results in clean and pandemic centers were compared with each other. Telemedicine was preffered in the clean hospital to keep on follow-up of the cancer patients as 'noninfected'. RESULTS: In the clean hospital, COVID-19-infected patients that needed to be hospitalized were referred to pandemic hospitals. COVID-19 test positivity rate was eight-fold higher for outpatient clinic admissions in pandemic hospitals (p < 0.001). The number of patients admitted new diagnosis outpatient clinics in both clean and pandemic hospitals decreased significantly during the pandemic compared with the previous year. CONCLUSION: We consider that local strategic modifications and defining 'clean' hospital model during infectious pandemic may contribute to protect and treat cancer patients during pandemic.","Karacin, Cengiz; Acar, Ramazan; Bal, Oznur; Eren, Tulay; Sendur, Mehmet Ali Nahit; Acikgoz, Yusuf; Karadurmus, Nuri; Imamoglu, Goksen Inanc; Oksuzoglu, Omur Berna; Dogan, Mutlu",Support. care cancer,,740

It is a challenging problem as one needs to consider both intra-series temporal correlations and inter-series correlations simultaneously. Recently, there have been multiple works trying to capture both correlations, but most, if not all of them only capture temporal correlations in the time domain and resort to pre-defined priors as inter-series relationships. In this paper, we propose Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to further improve the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN captures inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies \textit{jointly} in the \textit{spectral domain}. It combines Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) which models inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) which models temporal dependencies in an end-to-end framework. After passing through GFT and DFT, the spectral representations hold clear patterns and can be predicted effectively by convolution and sequential learning modules. Moreover, StemGNN learns inter-series correlations automatically from the data without using pre-defined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN.

The underlying causes of malnutrition are multi-sectoral and are mainly due to inequalities, inadequate food practices, and limited access to healthcare services. Based on the report The Economic and Social Impacts of Child Undernutrition in Sudan, this study assesses the impact that malnutrition has on health, education, and productivity in Sudan. The country is estimated to have lost an equivalent of about 11.6 billion Sudanese pound in 2014, which represented 2.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Productivity-related losses contributed the largest costs at 1.5% of GDP followed by health and education sectors at 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively. In 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic further exposed the fragility of Sudan's health, social, and economic system. It is mandatory that all stakeholders address child nutrition as a main concern and stunting is incorporated in the center of the development agenda. In particular, the national development frameworks should be updated to ensure the reduction of the stunting prevalence and to put in place a comprehensive multi-sectoral nutrition policy, strategy, and plan of action.","Abu-Fatima, Osman; Abbas, Akram Abdel Gayoum; Racalbuto, Vincenzo; Smith, Lee; Pizzol, Damiano",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,740

AIMS: To establish the perception of knowledge and confidence levels relating to the emergency management of neck stomas among UK nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A nationwide prospective electronic survey of both primary and secondary care nurses via the Royal College of Nursing and social media. FINDINGS: 402 responses were collated: 81 primary care and 321 secondary care; the majority (n=130) were band 5. Forty-nine per cent could differentiate between a laryngectomy and a tracheostomy; ENT nurses scored highest (1.56; range 0-2) on knowledge. Fifty-seven per cent could oxygenate a tracheostomy stoma correctly and 54% could oxygenate a laryngectomy stoma correctly. Sixty-five per cent cited inadequate neck stoma training and 91% felt inclusion of neck stoma training was essential within the nursing curriculum. CONCLUSION: Clinical deficiencies of management identified by nurses can be attributed to a lack of confidence secondary to reduced clinical exposure and education.","Senior, Andrew; Chan, Jacquline; Brookes, Kim; Jolly, Karan; Darr, Adnan; Ameen, Rohan",Br J Nurs,,740

This may account for some of the diversity in clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19. Although age is a risk factor for COVID-19, how age affects SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses remains unknown. We found that some pre-existing T cell responses to specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins, Spike (S) and Nucleoprotein (N), were significantly lower in elderly donors (>70 years old) who were seronegative for S than in young donors. However, substantial pre-existing T cell responses to the viral membrane (M) protein were detected in some elderly donors. These responses likely compensate for loss of T cell responses specific to S and N. In contrast, young and elderly donors exhibited comparable T cell responses to S, N, and M proteins after infection with SARS-CoV-2. M-specific responses were mediated by CD4 T cells producing interferon-{gamma} in both seronegative and seropositive individuals. T cells in seronegative elderly donors responded to various M-derived peptides, while the response after SARS-CoV-2 infection was apparently focused on a single peptide. These data suggest that diversity of target antigen repertoire for pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells declines with age, but the magnitude of pre-existing T cell responses is maintained by T cells reactive to specific viral proteins such as M. A better understanding of the role of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells that are less susceptible to age-related loss may contribute to development of more effective vaccines for elderly people.","Taira, Naoyuki; Toguchi, Sakura; Miyagi, Mio; Mori, Tomoari; Tomori, Hiroaki; Oshiro, Koichi; Tamai, Osamu; Kina, Mitsuo; Miyagi, Masatake; Tamaki, Kentaro; Collins, Mary K; Ishikawa, Hiroki",,,740

There are still many unresolved questions regarding the pathogenesis of this disease and especially the reasons underlying the extremely different clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic forms to severe manifestations, including the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 showed phylogenetic similarities to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, and some of the clinical features are shared between COVID-19 and previously identified beta-coronavirus infections. Available evidence indicate that the so called ""cytokine storm"" an uncontrolled over-production of soluble markers of inflammation which, in turn, sustain an aberrant systemic inflammatory response, is a major responsible for the occurrence of ARDS. Chemokines are low molecular weight proteins with powerful chemoattractant activity which play a role in the immune cell recruitment during inflammation. This review will be aimed at providing an overview of the current knowledge on the involvement of the chemokine/chemokine-receptor system in the cytokine storm related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The gold standard for its diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) performed on a nasopharyngeal swab. In contrast, testing saliva has significant advantages as a diagnostic method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We searched for articles evaluating saliva as a diagnostic method for COVID-19 on the PUBMED/MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE, and SCIELO platforms. We initially found 233 articles and 20 were selected for inclusion following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol: 18 cross-sectional studies and 2 case reports, including 8 from America, 8 from Asia, and 4 from Europe. The studies evaluated the presence of viral RNA, IgG, IgM, and IgA in samples of unstimulated saliva from adults with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The vast majority of the studies performed RT-qPCR on the saliva samples and compared the results with the gold standard (a nasopharyngeal swab of the same patient). RESULTS: Saliva samples analyzed by RT-qPCR, reverse transcription isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) offer high sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the early stages of the disease and among asymptomatic patients as compared to nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR. In addition, the self-collection of saliva offers the possibility of receiving telemedicine instructions to carry out the test, reducing the risk of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of COVID-19 through saliva is sensitive, non-invasive, and is of low risk for the healthcare professionals. However, further studies are recommended to validate its clinical use.","Sagredo-Olivares, K; Morales-Gómez, C; Aitken-Saavedra, J",Med. oral patol. oral cir. bucal (Ed.impr.),,740

Recent reports have shown a decline in hospitalization for emergency cardiac conditions. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalization and particularly mortality due to acute heart failure has not been thoroughly described. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single-centre observational study, we examined referrals to the acute heart failure team over a period of 16 weeks (7 January to 27 April 2020) spanning the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; 283 patients referred to our acute heart failure services over the study period were included on the basis of typical symptoms, raised BNP, and echocardiogram. There was a substantial but statistically non-significant drop in referrals with 164 referred in the 8 weeks before the first UK death due to COVID-19 on 2 March 2020 (BC), compared with 119 referred after (AC) in the subsequent 8 weeks, representing a 27% reduction overall (P = 0.06). The 30 day case fatality rate was increased from 11% in the BC group compared with 21% in the AC group (risk ratio = 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.09-3.3). Age, gender, length of stay, left ventricular ejection fraction, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were similar between the groups. Admission creatinine, age, and AC cohort status were found to be univariable predictors of mortality. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, only age (hazard ratio 1.04, P = 0.03) and AC cohort status (hazard ratio 2.1, P = 0.017) remained significant predictors of mortality. On sensitivity analysis, this increased mortality was driven by COVID-19 positive status. CONCLUSIONS: There was a reduction in referral of patients with acute heart failure with significant increase in mortality in the 8 weeks following the first reported UK death due to COVID-19. The observation of increased mortality does not appear related to a change in population in terms of demographics, left ventricular ejection fraction, or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. The observed increased mortality appears to be related to the coexistence of COVID19 infection with acute heart failure. The study highlights the need for widespread preventative and shielding measures particularly in this group of patients especially in the light of the second wave. Longer follow-up with inclusion of data from other centres and community heart failure services will be needed.","Doolub, Gemina; Wong, Chih; Hewitson, Lynsey; Mohamed, Ahmed; Todd, Fraser; Gogola, Laisha; Skyrme-Jones, Andrew; Aziz, Shahid; Sammut, Eva; Dastidar, Amardeep",ESC Heart Fail,,740

Thus, our meta-analysis was conducted toevaluate this matter. Methods We compared the predetermined variables in this meta-analysis during the early and late pandemic. Using a combination of adapted search terms to fit the requirements of several search engines (PubMed, EuropePMC, SCOPUS, ProQuest, and EBSCOhost), we reviewed all observational studies citing our outcomes of interest before and during the outbreak. Results Thirty-five records comprising a total of 62,244 participants were identified. Overall, our meta-analysis showed that there was a huge reduction of nearly 80% for STEMI admission during the outbreak (n=10,263) in contrast to before the outbreak period (n=51,984). STEMI patients who were admitted during the outbreak received less primary PCI and had longer symptom-to-FMC (first medical contact) time along with prolonged door-to-balloon time. A decrease in the achievement of final TIMI 3 flow after primary PCI was also observed in this study. However, the number of in-hospital mortality was similar between two groups. Conclusion There was a decrease in the STEMI care performance and worsening of clinical outcomes in STEMI patients, especially in the early pandemic period. Overall, concise health services must be implemented followinga responsibility to obey health protocols to deliver high-quality services related to STEMI systems of care amidst the global pandemic.","Kamarullah, William Sabrina Adelia Putri Alexander Marthin Rocky Gozali Darius Revin",Indian Heart Journal,,740

The coordinated response by Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (The Network) undertaken with the support of NSW Ministry of Health, in partnership with Corrective Services NSW (CSNSW), Youth Justice and private jails has ensured that the NSW correctional system has remained otherwise COVID-free. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A research study of how a range of partners which support the operations of NSW Correctional System developed an effective approach for the prevention a COVID-19 epidemic amongst its inmates. FINDINGS: Establishment of effective partnerships, early coordination of representatives from all aspects of the NSW correctional system, limited access to the correctional environment, reduced prison population and strict isolation of all new receptions have all contributed to maintaining this COVID-free status despite other NSW settings with similar risk profiles, such as aged care facilities and cruise ship arrivals, experiencing serious outbreaks. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Although Australia/New Zealand context of suppressed community infection rates for COVID-19 (which are approaching elimination in some jurisdictions) is in contrast to the situation in other parts of the world, the principles described in this paper will be useful to most other correctional systems. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Modelling was used to underline our approach and reinforced the veracity of following this approach. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The Network and CSNSW has been able to mount an effective, integrated response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been sustainable through the first peak of COVID-19 cases. This case study catalogues the process of developing this response and details each intervention implemented with inventive use of tables to demonstrate the impact of the range of interventions used.","Blogg, James; McGrath, Colette; Galouzis, Jennifer; Grant, Luke; Hoey, Wendy",International journal of prisoner health (Online),,740

Neither curative anti-viral drugs nor a protective vaccine is currently available for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Recently, new clinical syndromes associated with coagulopathy and vasculopathy have emerged as a cause of sudden death and other serious clinical manifestations in younger patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, is a transmembrane protein expressed by lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes, and vascular endothelial cells, whose physiologic role is to induce the maturation of angiotensin I to generate angiotensin 1-7, a peptide hormone that controls vasoconstriction and blood pressure. In this review, we provide the general context of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on endothelial cells, describe the vasculopathy and coagulopathy syndromes in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and outline current understanding of the underlying mechanistic aspects.","Labò, Nazzarena; Ohnuki, Hidetaka; Tosato, Giovanna",,,740

Methods: From January 20, 2020 to February 8, 141 COVID-19 patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, 77 males and 64 females, with a median age of 49 (9,87) , were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, laboratory examination indexes and HRCT evolution findings of 141 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results: Laboratory examinations of 141 COVID-19 patients showed a decrease in white blood cell count and lymphocyte ratio. Among the 141 patients with COVID-19, fever (>37.5 â) was the most common clinical manifestation in 139 cases (98.58%) , and occasionally non-respiratory symptoms such as diarrhea in 4 cases (2.84%) . 141 patients with COVID-19 had abnormal HRCT. 52 (36.88%) chest HRCT images showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) , mainly under pleural; 23 (16.31%) GGO with focal consolidation; 27 (19.15%) small flaky shadows; 20 cases (14.18%) large flaky consolidation shadows; 48 cases (34.04%) bronchovascular bundle thickening and vascular penetrating signs; 5 cases (3.55%) had air bronchial signs; 7 cases (4.96%) of small nodule shadows; 5 cases (3.55%) of fibrosis, grid shadows or strand shadows.135 cases (95.74%) were positive for the first time nucleic acid test, 6 cases (4.26%) were negative, and 71 cases (50.35%) of common type, 47 cases (33.33%) of severe type and 23 cases (16.31%) of critical type were found during the same period. The average time from onset of each type to the first CT examination was: (2.51±1.32) , (5.02±2.01) , and (5.91±1.76) days; 19 (19/47, 40.43%) of which were severe for the first time CT classification worsened at the second examination and lessened at the third examination. 141 cases (100%) were positive for the second nucleic acid test, and the HRCT results for the same period were 44 cases (31.21%) of common type, 53 cases (37.59%) of severe type, and 44 cases (31.21%) of critical type; the average interval time was (3.32±1.61) , (3.93±1.84) , (4.15±1.57) days;the third nucleic acid test were positive among 113 cases and 28 cases were negative, HRCT results of the same period were 79 cases (56.03%) of common type, 46 cases (32.62%) of severe type, and 16 cases (11.35%) of critical type;the average interval from the first CT examination were: (5.59±1.83) , (7.32±1.37) , (7.55±1.78) days. The differences in CT typing at different time were statistically significant (P<0.05) . Conclusion: The clinical features of COVID-19 and HRCT images are diverse, extensive GGO and infiltrates in both lungs are typical. Viral nucleic acid tests usually occur earlier or at the same time as the CT examination positive, and there are false negatives in nucleic acid tests. In some epidemiological backgrounds, CT imaging manifestations and evolutionary characteristics are of great significance for early warning of lung injury, assessment of disease severity, and assistance in clinical typing and post-treatment follow-up.","Lu, X F; Gong, W; Wang, L; Li, L; Xie, B J; Peng, Z F; Zha, Y F",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,740

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether concern about COVID-19 and workloads predict psychological distress in healthcare workers. METHODS: Predictive study in which 367 workers (nurses, doctors, nursing assistants, obstetricians, dentists, psychologists, nutritionists, among others) from 12 health networks in the Puno region participated, selected through intentional non-probabilistic sampling. The data were collected via the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, the COVID-19 Scale of Concern and the Workload Scale. RESULTS: It was found that there are no significant differences between men and women in psychological discomfort and concern about COVID-19 infection and workload. Furthermore, highly significant correlations were found between the study variables (p <0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed an adequate adjustment for the model (F = 94.834; p <0.001), where concern about COVID-19 (ß = -0.436; p <0.01) and workload (ß = 0.239; p <0.01) are variables that significantly predict psychological discomfort (adjusted R2 = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: Concern about COVID-19 and work overload predict psychological distress in health personnel in the Puno region.","Esteban, Renzo Felipe Carranza; Mamani-Benito, Oscar Javier; Quinteros-Zúñiga, Dámaris; Farfán-Solís, Rosa",Rev. colomb. psiquiatr,,740

Parte II - Medula espinhal: eqüino com incoordenação motora,2000,"Machine learning has recently demonstrated impressive progress in predictive accuracy across a wide array of tasks. Most ML approaches focus on generalization performance on unseen data that are similar to the training data (In-Distribution, or IND). However, real world applications and deployments of ML rarely enjoy the comfort of encountering examples that are always IND. In such situations, most ML models commonly display erratic behavior on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) examples, such as assigning high confidence to wrong predictions, or vice-versa. Implications of such unusual model behavior are further exacerbated in the healthcare setting, where patient health can potentially be put at risk. It is crucial to study the behavior and robustness properties of models under distributional shift, understand common failure modes, and take mitigation steps before the model is deployed. Having a benchmark that shines light upon these aspects of a model is a first and necessary step in addressing the issue. Recent work and interest in increasing model robustness in OOD settings have focused more on image modality, while the Electronic Health Record (EHR) modality is still largely under-explored. We aim to bridge this gap by releasing BEDS-Bench, a benchmark for quantifying the behavior of ML models over EHR data under OOD settings. We use two open access, de-identified EHR datasets to construct several OOD data settings to run tests on, and measure relevant metrics that characterize crucial aspects of a model's OOD behavior. We evaluate several learning algorithms under BEDS-Bench and find that all of them show poor generalization performance under distributional shift in general. Our results highlight the need and the potential to improve robustness of EHR models under distributional shift, and BEDS-Bench provides one way to measure progress towards that goal.","Avati, Anand; Seneviratne, Martin; Xue, Emily; Xu, Zhen; Lakshminarayanan, Balaji; Dai, Andrew M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08189v1.pdf,740

Moreover, pharmacological treatment concerns arise for psychiatrists and the other specialists who deal with psychiatric patients affected by an infectious disease or with patients with an infectious disease that may develop a number of psychiatric symptoms. The mental health consequences of a pandemic may be related to the sequelae of the disease itself or to the preventive measures aimed at containing the spread of infections. In addition, fear of death, drastic changes in family organization and work routines, closings of schools, companies and public places can play a role. Furthermore, stress derived from working activity or economic losses should not be underestimated. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, first studies have shown the presence of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia in the general population, health-care workers, and people affected by COVID-19. It appears likely that there will be substantial increases in a broad range of other mental disorders, suicide, behavioral disorders, loneliness, domestic violence and child abuse. From these considerations, the evaluation and monitoring of psychological/psychiatric conditions of involved populations, and the provision of focused aid must be part of the care intervention during the initial stage of a pandemic and beyond. The aim of this review is to summarize the current evidence on how mental health outcomes of COVID-19 outbreak have been measured and managed.","Talevi, Dalila; Pacitti, Francesca; Socci, Valentina; Renzi, Giulio; Alessandrini, Maria Cristina; Trebbi, Edoardo; Rossi, Rodolfo",J.

We describe caregiver and child mental health over 12 months using Australias only nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional survey of caregivers with children (0-17 years). N=2020 caregivers in June 2020, N=1434 in September 2020, and N=2508 in July 2021 provided data. Caregivers rated their mental health (Kessler-6), and impacts of the pandemic on their own and their childrens mental health. Data were weighted using national distribution of age, gender, number of children, state/territory and neighbourhood-level disadvantage. Mental health measures worsened over time. There was an unequal distribution of impacts based on caregiver gender, child age and family socioeconomic characteristics. Negative impacts were more common with current or cumulative lockdown. The indirect impacts of COVID-19 are real and concerning. Mental health must be central to the immediate and ongoing pandemic responses for families and children. What is known about this topic?- The global evidence shows that, for general adult populations, psychological distress peaked in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic before appearing to rebound. - Less is known about long-term mental health consequences of living through the pandemic, especially for caregivers and children. There are urgent calls for research. - Due to low infection rates, Australias experience can provide insight into the mental health impacts of lockdown without the compounding direct harms of the virus. What this study adds- From June 2020 to July 2021, caregivers reported declining mental health and increasing negative mental health impacts of COVID-19 for themselves and their children. - There was an unequal distribution of mental health impacts based on caregiver gender, child age and family socioeconomic characteristics. - Lockdown (current or cumulative) was detrimental for caregivers and childrens mental health.

Considering the shortage of medical resources and the need to prevent nosocomic infection, the respiratory-treatment strategy in these nonstandard ICUs is different from those in general wards and standard ICUs. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) plays an important role in nonstandard ICUs and is beneficial to the patients therein. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this study, we analyzed four cases of HFNC-treated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a makeshift ICU and summarized our experience. DIAGNOSES: Four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 according to World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were admitted to the makeshift ICU. INTERVENTIONS: All patients had oxygen treatment with HFNC, as well as regular treatment of antivirals and traditional Chinese medicine. OUTCOMES: Two patients survived after treatment, while the other two died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and heart failure, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 often have poor prognoses after mechanical ventilation, exhibiting corresponding complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and deep-vein thrombosis, which significantly prolongs length of stay in the ICU. HFNC could prevent intubation in some patients, thereby avoiding the above complications; however, this needs confirmation in further clinical studies. This treatment reduced difficulty and workloads for healthcare professionals, had good tolerability for patients, might not significantly increase the risk of infection for healthcare professionals, and do not require additional preventive measures against nosocomic infection. HFNC treatment has its advantages in providing oxygen therapy in COVID-19, but healthcare professionals should still pay close attention to changes in patients’ oxygenation rates and respiratory frequency.","Lu, Xiao; Xu, Shanxiang",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32481340/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020393,740

Gut microbial dysbiosis has been proved to be associated with COVID-19 severity and probiotics is an adjunctive therapy for COIVD-19. However, the potential benefit of probiotics in COVID-19 has not been studied. We aimed to assess the relationship of probiotics use with clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a propensity-score matched retrospective cohort study of adult patients with COVID-19. Eligible patients received either probiotics plus standard care (probiotics group) or standard care alone (non-probiotics group). The primary outcome was the clinical improvement rate, which was compared among propensity-score matched groups and in the unmatched cohort. Secondary outcomes included the duration of viral shedding, fever, and hospital stay. RESULTS: Among the propensity-score matched groups, probiotics use was related to clinical improvement rates (log-rank p = 0.028). This relationship was driven primarily by a shorter (days) time to clinical improvement [difference, −3 (−4 to −1), p = 0.022], reduction in duration of fever [−1.0 (−2.0 to 0.0), p = 0.025], viral shedding [−3 (−6 to −1), p < 0.001], and hospital stay [−3 (−5 to −1), p = 0.009]. Using the Cox model with time-varying exposure, use of probiotics remained independently related to better clinical improvement rate in the unmatched cohort. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that probiotics use was related to improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Further studies are required to validate the effect of probiotics in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Lina; Han, Huanqin; Li, Xuan; Chen, Caozhen; Xie, Xiaobing; Su, Guomei; Ye, Shicai; Wang, Cuili; He, Qing; Wang, Fang; Huang, Fang; Wang, Zhaoqin; Wu, Jiayuan; Lai, Tianwen",Therap Adv Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.1177/17562848211035670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394726/,740

As the amount of spatial data being produced has increased, coupled with increasingly complex software solutions being developed, there is a need for platforms that address these needs. In this paper, we present a distributed and light streaming system for combating pandemics and give a case study on spatial analysis of the COVID-19 geo-tagged Twitter dataset. In this system, three of the major components are the translation of tweets matching with user-defined bounding boxes, name entity recognition in tweets, and skyline queries. Apache Pulsar addresses all these components in this paper. With the proposed system, end-users have the capability of getting COVID-19 related information within foreign regions, filtering/searching location, organization, person, and miscellaneous based tweets, and performing skyline based queries. The evaluation of the proposed system is done based on certain characteristics and performance metrics. The study differs greatly from other studies in terms of using distributed computing and big data technologies on spatial data to combat COVID-19.

This project aims to propose an SSE tele-exercise (Tele-SSE) protocol to evaluate its effects on the motor and cognitive development of children aged between 3 and 6 years. A randomized controlled trial with experimental (Tele-SSE) and control (general education) groups will be carried out. The application of Tele-SSE will be performed for 9 months (three times per week) and one additional follow-up after the intervention at the beginning of the next academic year. One-hundred and two preschoolers will be recruited and randomly distributed into the two groups: experimental (n = 51) and control (n = 51). Although the main outcome will be balance due to the nature of the SSE, outcomes will include physical and motor (body mass index, waist circumference, handgrip and lower-limb strength, speed-agility, and cardiorespiratory fitness) and cognitive (executive functions and attention, episodic memory, and language assessment, using the Fitness Assessment in the Preschool Battery (PREFIT) and The National Institutes of Health Toolbox—Early Childhood Cognition Battery.

Evidence of rare thrombotic events associated with ChAdOx1-nCoV19 (Vaxzevria, ChAdOx) has lead several European countries to recommend a heterologous booster with mRNA vaccines for certain age groups (e.g. persons <60years in Germany), who have already received one dose of ChAdOx, although data on reactogenicity and safety of this vaccination regimen are still missing. Here we report reactogenicity data of homologous BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BNT) or heterologous ChAdOx/BNT prime-boost immunisations in a prospective observational cohort study of 326 healthcare workers. Reactogenicity of heterologous ChAdOx/BNT booster vaccination was largely comparable to homologous BNT/BNT vaccination and overall well-tolerated. No major differences were observed in the frequency or severity of local reactions after either of the vaccinations. In contrast, notable differences between the regimens were observed for systemic reactions, which were most frequent after prime immunisation with ChAdOx (86%, 95CI: 79-91), and less frequent after homologous BNT/BNT (65%, 95CI: 56-72), or heterologous ChAdOx/BNT boosters (48%, 95CI: 36-59).

620595,L’hospitalisation en chambre dédiée au risque épidémique et biologique : quels impacts sur les patients et les soignants ? Une approche qualitative,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging pathogen that causes lower respiratory tract infection in humans. Camels are the likely animal source for zoonotic infection, although exact transmission modes remain to be determined. Human-to-human transmission occurs sporadically. The wide geographic distribution of MERS-CoV among dromedary camels and ongoing transmissions to humans provides concern for the evolution of a MERS-CoV variant with efficient human-to-human transmission capabilities. Phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV has occurred by analysis of full-length genomes or multiple concatenated genome fragments, which is time-consuming, costly and limited to high viral load samples. OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple, reliable MERS-CoV variant typing assay to facilitate monitoring of MERS-CoV diversity in animals and humans. STUDY DESIGN: Phylogenetic analysis of presently known full-length MERS-CoV genomes was performed to identify genomic regions with sufficient phylogenetic content to allow reliable MERS-CoV variant typing. RT-PCR assays targeting these regions were designed and optimized. RESULTS: A reverse-transcription PCR assay for MERS-CoV targeting a 615 bp spike fragment provides a phylogenetic clustering of MERS-CoV variants comparable to that of full-length genomes. The detection limit corresponds to a cycle treshold value of ∼35 with standard upE real time PCR assays on RNA isolated from MERS-CoV EMC. Nasal swabs from RT-PCR positive camels (Ct values 12.9–32.2) yielded reliable sequence information in 14 samples. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple, reliable MERS-CoV variant typing assay which is crucial in monitoring MERS-CoV circulation in real time with relatively little investment on location.","Smits, Saskia L.; Raj, V.

For establishing some preliminary views on decontamination and disinfection, surrogate CoVs have commonly been assessed. This review serves to examine the existing science in regards to CoV containment generically and then to translate these findings into timely applications for COVID‐19. There is widespread dissemination of CoVs in the immediate patient environment, and CoVs can potentially be spread via respiratory secretions, urine, and stool. Interpretations of the spread however must consider whether studies examine for viral RNA, virus viability by culture, or both. Pre‐symptomatic, asymptomatic, and post‐fourteen day virus excretion from patients may complicate the epidemiology. Whereas droplet spread is accepted, there continues to be controversy over the extent of possible airborne spread and especially now for SARS‐CoV‐2. CoVs are stable in body secretions and sewage at reduced temperatures. In addition to temperature, dryness or relative humidity, initial viral burden, concomitant presence of bioburden, and the type of surface can all affect stability. Generalizing, CoVs can be susceptible to radiation, temperature extremes, pH extremes, peroxides, halogens, aldehydes, many solvents, and several alcohols. Whereas detergent surfactants can have some direct activity, these agents are better used as complements to a complex disinfectant solution. Disinfectants with multiple agents and adverse pH are more likely to be best active at higher water temperatures. Real‐life assessments should be encouraged with working dilutions. The use of decontamination and disinfection should be balanced with considerations of patient and caregiver safety. Processes should also be balanced with considerations for other potential pathogens that must be targeted. Given some CoV differences and given that surrogate testing provides experimental correlates at best, direct assessments with SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, and SARS‐CoV‐2 are required.

Thus, apparently contradictory model mechanisms can result in decade long discussions about the correct interpretation of data and the true theory behind it. However, often such opposing views turn out to be special cases of a more comprehensive and superior concept. Molecular dynamics (MD) and the more advanced molecular mechanical and quantum mechanical approach (QM/MM) provide a relatively consistent framework to treat enzymatic mechanisms, in particular, the activity of proteolytic enzymes. In line with this, computational chemistry based on experimental structures came up with studies on all major protease classes in recent years; examples of aspartic, metallo-, cysteine, serine, and threonine protease mechanisms are well founded on corresponding standards. In addition, experimental evidence from enzyme kinetics, structural research, and various other methods supports the described calculated mechanisms. One step beyond is the application of this information to the design of new and powerful inhibitors of disease-related enzymes, such as the HIV protease. In this overview, a few examples demonstrate the high potential of the QM/MM approach for sophisticated pharmaceutical compound design and supporting functions in the analysis of biomolecular structures.","Elsässer, Brigitta; Goettig, Peter",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810118/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22063232,740

Findings: The peaks of fitting curves for the OD values of IgM and IgG antibodies against N appeared simultaneously, while those against S1 were delayed compared with N. The OD values of IgM against N and IgG against both N and S1 were significantly higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases at 11 days after symptom onset. The seroconversion rates of IgG were higher than those of IgM against both N and S1 during the clinical course based on the optimal cut-off values defined in this study. The seroconversion rates of IgG and IgM against N and S1 were higher in the severe and critical cases than in the mild cases. Conclusion: Our findings show that a stronger antibody response occurred in COVID-19 patients with greater disease severity and there were low seroconversion rates of antibodies against N and S1 in the mild cases.

Detecting antibodies against the virus is an essential tool for tracking infections and developing vaccines. Such tests, primarily utilizing the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) principle, can be either qualitative (reporting positive/negative results) or quantitative (reporting a value representing the quantity of specific antibodies). Quantitation is vital for determining stability or decline of antibody titers in convalescence, efficacy of different vaccination regimens, and detection of asymptomatic infections. Quantitation typically requires two-step ELISA testing, in which samples are first screened in a qualitative assay and positive samples are subsequently analyzed as a dilution series.

Particles were graded by size as ≤ 2.5 μm PM (PM(2.5)) or > 2.5 μm PM (large PM). Operative procedures were categorized as either open surgery (n = 14) or laparoscopic surgery (n = 17). RESULTS: The median patient age was 72 (range 41–89) years and 58.1% were male. The total PM(2.5), PM(2.5) per hour, and maximum PM(2.5) per minute counts during operation were significantly higher in open surgery than in laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.029, respectively). Large PM counts (total, per hour, and maximum per minute) were also higher in the open surgery group than in the laparoscopic surgery group. The maximum PM(2.5) concentration recorded was 38.6 µm/m(3), which is considered “unhealthy for sensitive groups” according to the U.S. Environment Protection Agency air quality index standards, if it was a 24-h period mean value. CONCLUSION: Exposure to surgical smoke is lower during laparoscopic surgery than during open surgery for colorectal diseases.

Studying the biological significances of carbohydrates has been challenging due in part to their structural diversity and the limited access to complex carbohydrate-containing molecules. Conventional methods such as isothermal titration calorimetry and enzyme-linked lectin assay can be laborious and require significant amounts of time and materials. The emerging of glycan microarrays as high-throughput technology for studying carbohydrate interactions has overcome some of these challenges, and has greatly contributed to our understanding of the biological roles of carbohydrates and their glycoconjugates. In addition, glycan microarrays offer new applications in biomedical research, drug discovery and development. This chapter will focus on the biomedical applications of glycan microarrays and their potential role in drug discovery and development.","Muthana, Saddam M.",Carbohydrates in Drug Discovery and Development,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128166758000063; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128166758000063,740

The adoption of this term may help the implementation of more accurate strategies of early diagnosis, prognosis, and in-hospital treatment. We accurately quantified 110 metabolites using targeted metabolomics, and 13 cytokines/chemokines in plasma samples of 121 COVID-19 patients with different levels of severity, and 37 non-COVID-19 individuals. Analyses revealed an integrated host-dependent dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil activation chemokines, glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and lipid metabolism typical of sepsis processes distinctive of a mild disease. Dysregulated metabolites and cytokines/chemokines showed differential correlation patterns in mild and critically ill patients, indicating a crosstalk between metabolism and hyperinflammation. Using multivariate analysis, powerful models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 induced sepsis were generated, as well as for mortality prediction among septic patients. A metabolite panel made of kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, IL-6, LysoPC a C18:2, and phenylalanine discriminated non-COVID-19 from sepsis patients with an area under the curve (AUC (95%CI)) of 0.991 (0.986–0.995), with sensitivity of 0.978 (0.963–0.992) and specificity of 0.920 (0.890–0.949).

AIMS: We designed the study to evaluate the association of sociodemographic and comorbidities with the prognosis of adverse health outcomes in patients with COVID-19 in Bangladesh. METHODS: A multivariate retrospective cohort study was conducted on data from 966 RT-PCR positive patients from eight divisions during December 13, 2020, to February 13, 2021. Variables included sociodemographic, comorbidities, symptoms, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and access to health facilities. Major outcome was fatality. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization, duration of hospital stay, requirement of mechanical ventilation and severity. RESULTS: Male (65.8%, 636 of 966) was predominant and mean age was 39.8 ± 12.6 years. Fever (79%), dry cough (55%), and loss of test/smell (51%) were frequent and 74% patients had >3 symptoms.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare characteristics, complications, and outcomes between severe RV- and influenza virus (IFV)-associated pneumonia in adults. STUDY DESIGN: We used prospective cohort data of adult patients with severe pneumonia who had been admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital over a 4-year period. The clinical features and outcomes of 27 patients with RV-positive bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were compared to those of 51 pneumonia patients with IFV-positive BAL fluid or IFV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens. RESULTS: Of 356 patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL and respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RV was the most commonly identified virus (8.1%) from BAL fluid. Patients with RV-associated pneumonia were more likely to be immunocompromised than patients with IFV-associated pneumonia (81.5% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.001). Bacterial coinfection tended to be less common in the RV group (18.5% vs. 37.3%, p = 0.09). Although septic shock was less common in the RV group (29.6% vs. 54.9%, p = 0.03), other clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiologic patterns were similar between the groups. The 28-day mortality of patients with severe RV- and IFV-associated pneumonia was similarly high (29.6% vs. 35.3% respectively, p = 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Severe RV-associated pneumonia patients were more likely to be immunocompromised and less likely to present septic shock. Overall clinical features were similar and mortalities of both groups were comparably high.

Social distancing, economic insecurity and increasing prevalence rates of mental disorders may cause an increase in risk factors for suicide. Methods Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations in suicide risk, data from 2020 were compared to data from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes A total of 333 suicides were registered and 2,791,131 life years (LY) were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 42 suicides and 300,834 LY accounted for the year 2020. In 2020, suicide rates (SR, suicides per 100,000 LY) were lower in periods with moderate (SR = 8.5, X^2 = 4.374, p = 0.037) or severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.0, X^2 = 3.999, p = 0.046) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 18.0). A comparison with preceding years showed that differences cannot be attributed to seasonal variations. No age- or gender differences were found. Interpretation SR decreased during the COVID-19 restrictions; we expect SR to rise in the medium term. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is therefore urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalized.

The virus has caused great economic loss to the Chinese swine production during the past years. Herein, we experimentally infected SPF pigs using two strains of PRRSV with different pathogenicity and observed the lung pathological changes looking for new sights on the possible pathogenesis associated with the virulence of HP-PRRSV. The results indicated that the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs died and exhibited severe pathological changes of lungs featuring increased neutrophils, mast cells and mononuclear macrophages, compared with the pigs inoculated with low pathogenic (LP-) PRRSV. Furthermore, the pigs infected with HP-PRRSV showed the higher levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, interleukin (IL)-8 and histamine, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), platelet activation factor (PAF) in sera than those inoculated with LP-PRRSV. Additionally, the fibrosis of lung was observed in the HP-PRRSV-infected pigs. At present, our findings suggest that the aberrant immune responses triggered by HP-PRRSV infection are closely related to acute lung injury (ALI), and especially the pathological changes in lung vascular system are of particular significance. These associated pathological changes of lung are in part responsible for the additional morbidity and mortality observed in HP-PRRSV infection.","Han, Deping; Hu, Yanxin; Li, Limin; Tian, Haiyan; Chen, Zhi; Wang, Lin; Ma, Haiyan; Yang, Hanchun; Teng, Kedao",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514000224; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2013.12.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113514000224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472226/,740

665283,CV1 / Sommaire,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex clinical diagnosis with various possible etiologies. One common feature, however, is pulmonary permeability edema, which leads to an increased alveolar diffusion pathway and, subsequently, impaired oxygenation and decarboxylation. A novel inhaled peptide agent (AP301, solnatide) was shown to markedly reduce pulmonary edema in animal models of ARDS and to be safe to administer to healthy humans in a Phase I clinical trial. Here, we present the protocol for a Phase IIB clinical trial investigating the safety and possible future efficacy endpoints in ARDS patients. METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study. Patients with moderate to severe ARDS in need of mechanical ventilation will be randomized to parallel groups receiving escalating doses of solnatide or placebo, respectively. Before advancing to a higher dose, a data safety monitoring board will investigate the data from previous patients for any indication of patient safety violations. The intervention (application of the investigational drug) takes places twice daily over the course of 7 days, ensued by a follow-up period of another 21 days. DISCUSSION: The patients to be included in this trial will be severely sick and in need of mechanical ventilation. The amount of data to be collected upon screening and during the course of the intervention phase is substantial and the potential timeframe for inclusion of any given patient is short. However, when prepared properly, adherence to this protocol will make for the acquisition of reliable data. Particular diligence needs to be exercised with respect to informed consent, because eligible patients will most likely be comatose and/or deeply sedated at the time of inclusion.

Many infectious microbial and viral diseases have been shown to respond to A. annua and communities around the world use the plant as a medicinal tea, especially for treating malaria. AIM OF THE STUDY: SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of Covid-19) globally has infected and killed millions of people. Because of the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of artemisinin that includes blockade of SARS-CoV-1, we queried whether A. annua suppressed SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, we measured anti viral activity SARS-CoV-2 activity against fully infectious virusof dried leaf extracts of seven cultivars of A. annua sourced from four continents. IC(50)s were calculated and defined as (the concentrations that inhibited viral replication by 50%.) and CC50s (the concentrations that kill 50% of cells) were calculated. RESULTS: Hot-water leaf extracts based on artemisinin, total flavonoids, or dry leaf mass showed antiviral activity with IC(50) values of 0.1-8.7 μM, 0.01-0.14 μg, and 23.4-57.4 μg, respectively. Antiviral efficacy did not correlate with artemisinin or total flavonoid contents of the extracts. One dried leaf sample was >12 years old, yet the hot-water extract was still found to be active. The UK and South African variants, B1.1.7 and B1.351, were similarly inhibited. While all hot water extracts were effective, concentrations of artemisinin and total flavonoids varied by nearly 100-fold in the extracts. Artemisinin alone showed an estimated IC(50) of about 70 μM, and the clinically used artemisinin derivatives artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin were ineffective or cytotoxic at elevated micromolar concentrations. In contrast, the antimalarial drug amodiaquine had an IC(50) = 5.8 μM. Extracts had minimal effects on infection of Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells by a reporter virus pseudotyped by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. There was no cytotoxicity within an order of magnitude above the antiviral IC(90) values. CONCLUSIONS: A. annua extracts inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the active component(s) in the extracts is likely something besides artemisinin or a combination of components that block virus infection at a step downstream of virus entry. Further studies will determine in vivo efficacy to assess whether A. annua might provide a cost-effective therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Nair, M.S.; Huang, Y.; Fidock, D.A.; Polyak, S.J.; Wagoner, J.; Towler, M.J.; Weathers, P.J.",J Ethnopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716085/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874121002439?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874121002439; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2021.114016,740

Previous phylogenetic analyses based on sequence alignments show that SARS-CoVs form a new group distantly related to the other three groups of previously characterized coronaviruses. In this paper, a geometric approach based on the Z-curve representation of the whole genome sequence is proposed to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of coronaviruses. The evolutionary distances are obtained through measuring the differences among the three-dimensional Z-curves. The Z-curve is approximately described by its geometric center and the associated three eigenvectors, which indicate the center position and the trend of the Z-curve, respectively. Although some information is lost due to the approximate description of the Z-curve, the phylogenetic tree constructed based on these parameters is consistent with those of previous analyses. The present method has the merits of simplicity and intuitiveness, but it is still in its premature stage. Because the phylogenetic relationships are inferred from the whole genome, instead of some individual genes, the present method represents a new direction of phylogeny study in the post-genome era.","Zheng, Wen-Xin; Chen, Ling-Ling; Ou, Hong-Yu; Gao, Feng; Zhang, Chun-Ting",Mol Phylogenet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1055790305001077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890535/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790305001077,740

OBJECTIVE: Description of the concept and implementation in the student teaching at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University Medical Center Mainz in complete digital form in spring 2020. PRESENTATION OF CONCEPT: Lectures, examination course and practical training in ophthalmology take place in the 5th and 6th semester of the study of human medicine. The basis of the new concept were the former course curricula. Implemented concepts included a complete revision and implementation of lectures as video podcasts, examination videos, online examination conferences, interactive patient cases, narrated videos of surgery, anamnesis videos of patients and the design of the virtual patient room, a live online practice with presentation and examination of patients including transmission of the slit-lamp image to reproduce anterior and posterior segment examination. An evaluation showed a very positive reception of the new concept by students. DISCUSSION: Within a tight timeframe of 4 weeks a complete revision of the ophthalmology course was achieved. The implementation was time-consuming, with the largest share in the media production of examination videos, interactive patient cases and video podcasts of the lectures. We consider a reduction of classroom teaching for parts of the learning objectives that can be represented by such videos to be possibly useful.

The simultaneous use of different treatments for COVID-19 was taken into account, both in sub-cohorts matching and in COX regression. Results There were 187 patients treated with glucocorticoids; of these, 25 patients could be matched with an equivalent number of control patients. In the analysis of these matched sub-cohorts, no significant difference was observed in time to discharge (log-rank: p = 0.291) or the increment in SAFI at 48 hours of treatment (glucocorticoides: −0.04; controls: +0.37; p = 0.095). Multivariate models using Cox regression showed a significantly longer time to discharge in patients treated with glucocorticoids (hazard ratio: 7.26; 95% IC: 3.30–15.95). Conclusions We have not found improvement in respiratory function or time until discharge, associated with the use of glucocorticoids at high doses.","Rodríguez-Molinero, Alejandro; Pérez-López, Carlos; Gálvez-Barrón, César; Miñarro, Antonio; Rodríguez Gullello, Ezequiel A.; Collado Pérez, Isabel; Milà Ràfols, Núria; Mónaco, Ernesto E.; Hidalgo García, Antonio; Añaños Carrasco, Gemma; Chamero Pastilla, Antonio; Alberti Casas, Anna; Avalos Garcia, Jose L.; Borrego Ruiz, Manel; Campo Pisa, Pedro L.; Capielo Fornerino, Ana M.; Dapena, María Dolores; Fenollosa Artes, Andreu M.D.; Gris Ambros, Clara; Hernandez Martinez, Lourdes; López, Gabriela F.; Martín Puig, Mireia; Martínez, Sergi; Macho Pérez, Oscar; Molina Hinojosa, José C.; Peramiquel Fonollosa, Laura; Pisani Zambrano, Italo G.; Rives, Juan P.; Robles, Maria Teresa; Sabria Bach, Enric; Sanchez Rodriguez, Yris M.; Segura Martín, Maria del Mar; Tremosa Llurba, Gemma; Ventosa Gili, Ester; Venturini Cabanellas, Florencia I.; Vidal Meler, Natàlia",Med Clin (Engl Ed),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcle.2020.08.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263084/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2387020620305738; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2387020620305738?v=s5,740

IMPLICACIONES PARA RETIRADA DE AISLAMIENTO,2020-04-29,"Most U.S. overnight youth camps did not operate during the summer of 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic* (1). Several that did operate demonstrated that multiple prevention strategies, including pre- and postarrival testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, masking, and physical distancing helped prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19; in contrast, camps that relaxed prevention strategies, such as requiring a single prearrival test without subsequent testing, experienced outbreaks (2-4). The availability of COVID-19 vaccines for persons aged ≥12 years enabled implementation of an additional prevention strategy that was not available in summer 2020. This study assessed the number of COVID-19 cases and potential secondary spread among 7,173 staff members and campers from 50 states, 13 countries, and U.S. military overseas bases at nine independently operated U.S. summer youth camps affiliated with the same organization. The camps implemented multiple prevention strategies including vaccination, testing, podding (cohorting), masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene during June-August 2021. Vaccination coverage was 93% among eligible persons aged ≥12 years. All staff members (1,955) and campers (5,218) received site-specific, protocol-defined screening testing, which included prearrival testing and screening tests during the camp session (38,059 tests). Screening testing identified six confirmed COVID-19 cases (one in a staff member and five in campers) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing (screening test positivity rate = 0.02%). Three additional cases (in two staff members and one camper) were identified based on symptoms and were confirmed by RT-PCR testing. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, isolation, and quarantine in a population with high vaccination coverage resulted in no known secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 identified during camp. Implementation of multicomponent strategies is critical for prevention of COVID-19 outbreaks in congregate settings, including overnight youth camps.","Van Naarden Braun, Kim; Drexler, Mark; Rozenfeld, Ranna A; Deener-Agus, Eytan; Greenstein, Rebecca; Agus, Michael; Joffe, Mark; Kasowitz, Andrea; Levy, Philip; Nerwen, Cliff",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34618796/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7040e1,740
681755,Infeccion Por Sars-Cov-2 En La Paciente Obstetrica: Una Perspectiva Desde El Cuidado Critico,2020-04-15,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the decision-making process regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) into focus. The aim of this study is to compare rates of Do-Not-Attempt CPR (DNACPR) documentation in older hospitalised patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective repeated cross-sectional study. Data including co-morbidities and resuscitation status was collected on 300 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised from March 1(st) to May 31(s t) 2020. DNACPR documentation rates in patients aged ≥65 years with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared to those without COVID-19 admitted during the same period and also compared to documentation rates pre-COVID-19 pandemic (March 1(st) to May 31(s t) 2019). Results: Of 300 COVID-19-positive patients, 28% had a DNACPR order documented during their admission. Of 131 older (≥65 years) patients with COVID-19, 60.3% had a DNACPR order compared to 25.4% of 130 older patients without COVID-19 (p < 0.0001). During a comparable time period pre-pandemic, 15.4% of 130 older patients had a DNACPR order in place (p < 0.0001). Fifty percent of DNACPR orders were recorded within 24 hours of a positive swab result for SARS-CoV-2. Of older COVID-19-positive patients, 39.2% were referred to palliative care services and 70.2% survived. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted more widespread and earlier decision-making regarding resuscitation status. Although case-fatality-rates were higher for older hospitalised patients with COVID-19, many older patients survived the illness. Advance care planning should be prioritised in all patients and should remain good clinical practice despite the pandemic.","Connellan, D; Diffley, K; McCabe, J; Cotter, A; McGinty, T; Sheehan, G; Ryan, K; Cullen, W; Lambert, J S; Callaly, E L; Kyne, L",Age Ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909020/,740
684922,Brève : Covid-19 – Proposition pour un vaccin oral monodose,2021-07-30,"If there is something we have learned from the antibiotic era, it is that indiscriminate use of a therapeutic agent without a clear understanding of its long-term evolutionary impact can have enormous health repercussions. This knowledge is particularly relevant when the therapeutic agents are remarkably adaptable and diverse biological entities capable of a plethora of interactions, most of which remain largely unexplored. Although phage therapy (PT) undoubtedly holds the potential to save lives, its current efficacy in case studies recalls the golden era of antibiotics, when these compounds were highly effective and the possibility of them becoming ineffective seemed remote. Safe PT schemes depend on our understanding of how phages interact with, and evolve in, highly complex environments. Here, we summarize and review emerging evidence in a commonly overlooked theme in PT: bacteria-phage interactions. In particular, we discuss the influence of quorum sensing (QS) on phage susceptibility, the consequent role of phages in modulating bacterial cooperation, and the potential implications of this relationship in PT, including how we can use this knowledge to inform PT strategies. We highlight that the influence of QS on phage susceptibility seems to be widespread but can have contrasting outcomes depending on the bacterial host, underscoring the need to thoroughly characterize this link in various bacterial models. Furthermore, we encourage researchers to exploit competition experiments, experimental evolution, and mathematical modeling to explore this relationship further in relevant infection models. Finally, we emphasize that long-term PT success requires research on phage ecology and evolution to inform the design of optimal therapeutic schemes.","Cazares, Adrián; García-Contreras, Rodolfo; Pérez-Velázquez, Judith",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281786/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.590294,740
685947,Les engelures observées au printemps 2020 sont-elles liées à l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 ?,2021-10-31,"Background The entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into type II pneumocytes is dependent on a modification of viral spike proteins by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) expressed on the surface of human cells. TMPRSS2 is regulated by the androgen receptor, hence, SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is indirectly dependent on androgenic status and phenotype. Previously, we have reported that men affected by androgenetic alopecia (AGA) are overrepresented in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, we have reported that men taking antiandrogenic drugs, e.g., 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis), are less likely to have severe COVID-19. Here we aimed to test whether the androgen receptor antagonist, Proxalutamide, would be a beneficial treatment for subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Male and female subjects were recruited to a double-blinded, randomized, prospective, investigational study of Proxalutamide for the treatment of COVID-19. Mild to moderate, non-hospitalized subjects, who were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2, were treated with either Proxalutamide 200 mg/day or placebo. Endpoints for the study were remission time (days) and the percentage of subjects confirmed negative for SARS-CoV-2 on Day 7 after treatment. A negative SARS-CoV-2 test was defined by concentration-time (Ct)>40 determined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR). Results Two-hundred thirty-six (2360 subjects were included in the study (108 female, 128 male); 171 were randomized to the Proxalutamide arm and 65 were in the placebo group. On Day 7, SARS-CoV-2 became non-detectable with rtPCR (cT>40) in 82% of the subjects in the Proxalutamide group versus 31% in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The average clinical remission time for patients treated with Proxalutamide was 4.2 ±5.4 days versus 21.8 ±13.0 days in the placebo arm (p < 0.001). Conclusion Proxalutamide significantly accelerated viral clearance on Day 7 in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients versus placebo. Further, the time to clinical remission was significantly reduced in patients treated with Proxalutamide versus placebo.","Cadegiani, Flavio A; McCoy, John; Gustavo Wambier, Carlos; Vaño-Galván, Sergio; Shapiro, Jerry; Tosti, Antonella; Zimerman, Ricardo A; Goren, Andy",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633920/,740
687550,Predicción del desarrollo de tromboembolia pulmonar en pacientes con infección por SARS-CoV-2,2021-05-07,"Estonia, with a population of 1.3 million, is the smallest country in the three Baltic States. As a post-soviet country, Estonia over the past 30 years has built up a new health care system, including the pharmaceutical sector. The GDP allocated to cover health care costs is significantly lower in Estonia compared to the EU average. Despite this, Estonia has excelled in the development of digital e-services in healthcare at both the domestic and international levels. The development and integration of the Estonian community pharmacy sector into primary health care has been influenced and affected by the liberalization within pharmaceutical policy and the lack of cooperation with the rest of the health care sector. Community pharmacy ownership and location matters have been prevalent. The promotion of the pharmacy services has mostly taken place on the basis of a professional initiative, as cooperation with the state has not been active. Possibly the professional fragmentation of the pharmacy sector may have played a negative role. The community pharmacy network in Estonia, especially in cities, enables fast and convenient access to the pharmacy services. Community Pharmacy Service Quality Guidelines support the harmonization of the provided services and patient-centered concept to enhance the patient role and involvement in their care. In recent years, community pharmacies in Estonia have also offered various extended services that are more or less integrated with the primary health care system. New developments may be affected by frequent changes in legislation and a shortage of professional staff in community pharmacies. The ownership reform of pharmacies in 2020 has so far not had a significant impact on the operation of pharmacies or the quality of services provided.","Sepp, Kristiina; Tuula, Anita; Bobrova, Veera; Volmer, Daisy",Pharm Pract (Granada),https://doi.org/10.18549/pharmpract.2021.2.2404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035870/,740
688824,Tiroiditis indolora en infección por SARS-Cov2,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND: Fatal human respiratory disease associated with influenza A subtype H5N1 has been documented in Hong Kong, and more recently in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. We previously demonstrated that patients with H5N1 disease had unusually high serum levels of IP-10 (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10). Furthermore, when compared with human influenza virus subtype H1N1, the H5N1 viruses in 1997 (A/Hong Kong/483/97) (H5N1/97) were more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-a) and chemokines (e.g. IP-10) from primary human macrophages in vitro, which suggests that cytokines dysregulation may play a role in pathogenesis of H5N1 disease. Since respiratory epithelial cells are the primary target cell for replication of influenza viruses, it is pertinent to investigate the cytokine induction profile of H5N1 viruses in these cells. METHODS: We used quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA to compare the profile of cytokine and chemokine gene expression induced by H5N1 viruses A/HK/483/97 (H5N1/97), A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Vietnam/3046/04 (both H5N1/04) with that of human H1N1 virus in human primary alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. RESULTS: We demonstrated that in comparison to human H1N1 viruses, H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 viruses were more potent inducers of IP-10, interferon beta, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in primary human alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Recent H5N1 viruses from Vietnam (H5N1/04) appeared to be even more potent at inducing IP-10 than H5N1/97 virus. CONCLUSION: The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus. We suggest that this hyper-induction of cytokines may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease.","Chan, MCW; Cheung, CY; Chui, WH; Tsao, SW; Nicholls, JM; Chan, YO; Chan, RWY; Long, HT; Poon, LLM; Guan, Y; Peiris, JSM",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16283933/,740
