3139,3139,3139,Physicians’ and nurses’ thoughts and concerns about introducing neonatal male circumcision in Thailand: a qualitative study,22.53138,4.2659044,2018-04-11,"BACKGROUND: Neonatal male circumcision (NMC) is an alternative approach to adult male circumcision for HIV prevention. Recent studies found that NMC was rarely performed in Thailand and that most Thai health professionals did not recognize that NMC could reduce the risk of HIV infection and would not want NMC services in their hospitals. This study explored the thoughts and concerns of Thai government health staff regarding the introduction of NMC in government health facilities as a public health measure. METHODS: In-depth interviews with physicians, nurses and physician administrators from four different levels of government hospitals in four provinces representing 4 regions of Thailand were conducted after provision of education regarding the benefits and risks of NMC. Interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to develop themes. RESULTS: Six themes emerged from the data of 42 respondents: understanding of the benefits of NMC; risks of NMC; need for a pilot project; need for staff training and hospital readiness; need for parental/family education; and need for public awareness educational campaign. Major concerns included possible medical complications of NMC, infringement of child rights, and lack of understanding from staff and parents. The respondents emphasized the need for a clear policy, proper training of staff, financial and equipment support, and piloting NMC rollout before this measure could be fully implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Thai health professionals who took part in this study expressed several concerns if NMC had to be performed in their health care facilities. There is significant preparation that needs to be done before NMC can be introduced in the country.

The growing demand of dengue diagnostics especially in low-resource settings gave rise to many rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). This study evaluated the accuracy and utility of ViroTrack Dengue Acute - a new biosensors-based dengue NS1 RDT, SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1/IgM/IgG combo - a commercially available RDT, and SD Dengue NS1 Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for the diagnosis of acute dengue infection. METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study consecutively recruited 494 patients with suspected dengue from a health clinic in Malaysia. Both RDTs were performed onsite. The evaluated ELISA and reference tests were performed in a virology laboratory. The reference tests comprised of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and three ELISAs for the detection of dengue NS1 antigen, IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The diagnostic performance of evaluated tests was computed using STATA version 12. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of ViroTrack were 62.3% (95%CI 55.6–68.7) and 95.0% (95%CI 91.7–97.3), versus 66.5% (95%CI 60.0–72.6) and 95.4% (95%CI 92.1–97.6) for SD NS1 ELISA, and 52.4% (95%CI 45.7–59.1) and 97.7% (95%CI 95.1–99.2) for NS1 component of SD Bioline, respectively. The combination of the latter with its IgM and IgG components were able to increase test sensitivity to 82.4% (95%CI 76.8–87.1) with corresponding decrease in specificity to 87.4% (95%CI 82.8–91.2). Although a positive test on any of the NS1 assays would increase the probability of dengue to above 90% in a patient, a negative result would only reduce this probability to 23.0–29.3%. In contrast, this probability of false negative diagnosis would be further reduced to 14.7% (95%CI 11.4–18.6) if SD Bioline NS1/IgM/IgG combo was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of ViroTrack Dengue Acute was comparable to SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA. Addition of serology components to SD Bioline Dengue Duo significantly improved its sensitivity and reduced its false negative rate such that it missed the fewest dengue patients, making it a better point-of-care diagnostic tool. New RDT like ViroTrack Dengue Acute may be a potential alternative to existing RDT if its combination with serology components is proven better in future studies.","Chong, Zhuo Lin; Sekaran, Shamala Devi; Soe, Hui Jen; Peramalah, Devi; Rampal, Sanjay; Ng, Chiu-Wan",BMC Infect Dis,392,5

To understand the health profile of older adults in Brazil is fundamental for planning public policies. METHODS: The estimates were derived from data obtained through the collaboration between the Brazilian Ministry of Health and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation of the University of Washington. The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics provided the population estimates. Data on causes of death came from the Mortality Information System. To calculate morbidity, population-based studies on the prevalence of diseases in Brazil were comprehensively searched, in addition to information obtained from national databases such as the Hospital Information System, the Outpatient Information System, and the Injury Information System. We presented the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 estimates among Brazilian older adults (60+ years old) for life expectancy at birth (LE), healthy life expectancy (HALE), cause-specific mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), from 2000 to 2017. RESULTS: LE at birth significantly increased from 71.3 years (95% UI to 70.9-71.8) to 75.2 years (95% UI 74.7-75.7). There was a trend of increasing HALE, from 62.2 years (95% UI 59.54-64.5) to 65.5 years (95% UI 62.6-68.0). The proportion of DALYs among older adults increased from 7.3 to 10.3%. Chronic noncommunicable diseases are the leading cause of death among middle aged and older adults, while Alzheimer’s disease is a leading cause only among older adults. Mood disorders, musculoskeletal pain, and hearing or vision losses are among the leading causes of disability. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in LE and the decrease of the DALYs rates are probably results of the improvement of social conditions and health policies. However, the smaller increase of HALE than LE means that despite living more, people spend a substantial time of their old age with disability and illness. Preventable or potentially controllable diseases are responsible for most of the burden of disease among Brazilian older adults. Health investments are necessary to obtain longevity with quality of life in Brazil.","de Azeredo Passos, Valéria Maria; Champs, Ana Paula Silva; Teixeira, Renato; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda Furtado; Kirkwood, Renata; Veras, Renato; Nascimento, Bruno Ramos; Nogales, Ana Maria; Schmidt, Maria Inês; Duncan, Bruce Bartholow; Cousin, Ewerton; Naghavi, Mohsen; Souza, Fatima Marinho",Popul Health Metr,392,5

However, a broad applicability of TCR-based therapies in cancer is still limited by the restricted number of TCRs, often also of suboptimal potency, available for clinical use. In addition, targeting of tumor neoantigens with TCR-engineered T cell therapy moves the field towards a highly personalized treatment, as tumor neoantigens derive from somatic mutations and are extremely patient-specific. Therefore, relevant TCRs have to be de novo identified for each patient and within a narrow time window. The naïve repertoire of healthy donors would represent a reliable source due to its huge diverse TCR repertoire, which theoretically entails T cells for any antigen specificity, including tumor neoantigens. As a challenge, antigen-specific naïve T cells are of extremely low frequency and mostly of low functionality, making the identification of highly functional TCRs finding a “needle in a haystack.” In this review, we present the technological advancements achieved in high-throughput mapping of patient-specific neoantigens and corresponding cognate TCRs and how these platforms can be used to interrogate the naïve repertoire for a fast and efficient identification of rare but therapeutically valuable TCRs for personalized adoptive T cell therapy.","D’Ippolito, Elvira; Wagner, Karolin I.; Busch, Dirk H",Int J Mol Sci,392,18

Primary health care (PHC) workers have faced problems that can lead to the development of stress and abdominal obesity. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of abdominal adiposity among primary health care physicians in the metropolitan mesoregion of Salvador, Bahia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted with physicians from the family health units (FHUs) of the metropolitan mesoregion of Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. The number of FHUs corresponded to 41 teams (52 physicians). Anamnesis was performed and a questionnaire was applied. The clinical examination consisted of measuring waist circumference (WC), blood pressure levels (BP), and body mass index (BMI), as well as examining for acanthosis nigricans. Blood samples were collected for biochemical dosages. The data obtained were analyzed by SPSS version 22.0. Results: The sample included 41 physicians (response rate: 78.8%), of which 18 were women (44.0%). The percentage of overweight participants represented by BMI was 31.7%. The hypertriglyceridemia prevalence was 29.2%. HDL-c was low in 48.7% of the participants.

The γ-PGA has the potential to replace synthetic non-degradable counterparts, but the main obstacle is the high production cost and lower productivity. Extensive research has been carried out to reduce the production cost by using different waste; however, it is unable to match the commercialization needs. This review focuses on the biosynthetic mechanism of γ-PGA, its production using the synthetic medium as well as different wastes by L-glutamic acid-dependent and independent microbial strains. Furthermore, various metabolic engineering strategies and the recovery processes for γ-PGA and their possible applications are discussed. Finally, highlights on the challenges and unique approaches to reduce the production cost and to increase the productivity for commercialization of γ-PGA are also summarized.","Nair, Pranav; Navale, Govinda R.; Dharne, Mahesh S.",Biomass Convers Biorefin,392,5

The metal-complex nature of its ligand, iron protoporphyrin IX (Heme), enables the REV-ERBβ to be used for multiple therapeutic modalities as a photonuclease, a photosensitizer, or a fluorescence imaging agent. The replacement of iron with cobalt as the metal center of protoporphyrin IX changes the ligand from an agonist to an antagonist of REV-ERBβ. The mechanism behind that phenomenon is still unclear, despite the availability of crystal structures of REV-ERBβ in complex with Heme and cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP). This study used molecular dynamic simulations to compare the effects of REV-ERBβ binding to Heme and CoPP, respectively. The initial poses of Heme and CoPP in complex with agonist and antagonist forms of REV-ERBβ were predicted using molecular docking. The binding energies of each ligand were calculated using the MM/PBSA method. The computed binding affinity of Heme to REV-ERBβ was stronger than that of CoPP, in agreement with experimental results. CoPP altered the conformation of the ligand-binding site of REV-ERBβ, disrupting the binding site for nuclear receptor corepressor, which is required for REV-ERBβ to regulate the transcription of downstream target genes. Those results suggest that a subtle change in the metal center of porphyrin can change the behavior of porphyrin in cancer cell signaling. Therefore, modification of porphyrin-based agents for cancer therapy should be conducted carefully to avoid triggering unfavorable effects.","Fakih, Taufik Muhammad; Kurniawan, Fransiska; Yusuf, Muhammad; Mudasir, Mudasir; Tjahjono, Daryono Hadi",Molecules,392,18

The aim of this study is to find out what experience older people have had with death education and the importance they give to health education. A qualitative methodological design was selected using a semi-structured interview. The survey consisted of interviews with 28 participants from the city of Granada (Spain) aged 61 to 78. This qualitative-descriptive study is based on an analysis of older people’s experience of education and preparation for death throughout their lives. The results show that, in most cases, the only information received was in childhood and always from a religious perspective. Death and health are closely related, so working on death education helps to improve the quality of life of elderly people. Health education offers ways of coping with the end of life through the transmission of values and practices that make it possible to anticipate and resolve situations of instability or anxiety. Facing death naturally and as just another part of life will help to make healthy ageing possible, through educational proposals related to the integral health of elderly people.","Martínez-Heredia, Nazaret; Soriano Díaz, Andrés; Amaro Agudo, Ana; González-Gijón, Gracia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,392,18

To reduce the redundancy of the contents of the image, thus increasing the ability to store or transfer information in optimal form, an image processing approach needs to be considered. So, in this study, two compression techniques, namely lossless compression and lossy compression, were applied for image compression, which preserves the image quality. Moreover, some enhancing techniques to increase the quality of a compressed image were employed. These methods were investigated, and several comparison results are demonstrated. Finally, the performance metrics were extracted and analyzed based on state-of-the-art methods. PSNR, MSE, and SSIM are three performance metrics that were used for the sample medical images.

Africa is already faced with many socio-economic and health crises. Many countries in Africa can seldom boast of a standardized health care facility comparable to those in developed countries. Yet, the non-therapeutic use of COL has been banned in developed countries. However, in Africa, except for South Africa, COL is an over-the-counter (OTC) medication sold and dispensed by non-professionals/without a veterinarian’s supervision. The ban of non-therapeutic COL in developed countries has proven to reduce the development of mobile colistin resistance (MCR) in humans and animals. The unregulated use of COL has been proven to select pathogenic and commensal bacteria resistance. A transmissible plasmid-mediated colistin determinant, mobile COL resistance (mcr) gene, which is rapidly transferred/acquired horizontally or laterally intra/inter-species/genera, has been reported. A highly promiscuous mobile genetic element like plasmids containing transposons, insertion sequences, and integrons aid the carriage/rapid transfer and acquisition of these mcr genes. Hence, we highlight the danger posed by escalating colistin (COL) resistance in the continent and the impetus to halt the indiscriminate and non-therapeutic use of COL to protect public health.","Anyanwu, Madubuike Umunna; Jaja, Ishmael Festus; Oguttu, James Wabwire; Jaja, Chinwe Juliana; Chah, Kennedy Foinkfu; Shodeinde Shoyinka, Vincent",,392,5

Most of the existing work focuses on concurrency bugs such as data races and deadlocks, since concurrency bugs are difficult to detect and debug. In this paper, we discuss an under-examined defect in OpenMP applications: memory anomalies. These occur when the application issues illegal memory accesses that may result in a non-deterministic result or even a program crash. Based on the latest OpenMP 5.0 specification, we analyze some OpenMP usage errors that may lead to memory anomalies. Then we illustrate three kinds of memory anomalies: use of uninitialized memory (UUM), use of stale data (USD), and use after free (UAF). While all three anomalies can occur in sequential programs, their manifestations in parallel OpenMP programs can be different, and debugging such anomalies in the context of parallel programs also imposes an additional complexity relative to sequential programs. To measure the effectiveness of memory anomaly detectors on OpenMP applications, we have evaluated three state-of-the-art tools with a group of micro-benchmarks. These micro-benchmarks are either selected from the DRACC benchmark suite or constructed from our own experience.

In this work, we analyze the resilience/preparedness of public health systems, the confinement measures introduced by governments, and their socio-economic effects. We also investigate the relationships between these elements by focusing on the EU Member States. We conduct an after-action review (AAR) study based on three indices. The first index indicates the preparedness of the countries’ health systems to deal with a potential health shock resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. The second index shows the strictness of confinement measures taken per Member State in spring 2020. Finally, the third index captures the expected socio-economic effects of such measures on each country for the year 2020. Our findings show that on average, countries with less prepared health systems implemented stricter confinement measures and that higher levels of stringency in the confinement measures are associated with stronger, negative, socio-economic impacts. However, the results differ across countries in the case of each index. Overall, the results call for health systems to be better prepared to handle public health crises and for a more coordinated EU approach to overcome divergences across countries.","Aristodemou, Katerina; Buchhass, Lucas; Claringbould, Duco",Eurasian Econ Rev,392,16

Based on this, the design of computer-aided course teaching control system based on supervised learning algorithm is proposed. The hardware composition and software design of the system design are introduced. Through the main modules: login and registration module, learning mode selection module, learning content selection module, test module operation. Relying on the constraints of multiple identities in the teaching process by the logical structure of the database, the teaching management platform can control and supervise student learning. In order to better test the effectiveness of the system designed in this paper, a comparative experiment of system control learning and free learning is performed. The results prove that compared with free learning, the learning of computer-assisted curriculum teaching control system can better urge students to learn, and the learning effect is better. The teaching control system is superior to the traditional teaching system in improving students ‘interest and motivating students’ learning enthusiasm.","Zhou, Chun-rong; Zhou, Ji-yin","e-Learning, e-Education, and Online Training",392,1

From the view point of computerized verification, concluding the authenticity of a signature offers a challenging problem for the pattern classification community. A major proportion of computerized solutions treat signature verification as a two-class classification problem where both genuine and forged signatures are employed for training purposes. For most of the real world scenarios however, only genuine signatures of individuals are available. This paper presents a signature verification technique that relies only on genuine signature samples. More precisely, we employ convolutional neural networks for learning effective feature representations and a one-class support vector machine that learns the genuine signature class for each individual. Experiments are carried out in a writer-dependent as well as writer-independent mode and low error rates are reported by only employing genuine signatures in the training sets.","Shabbir, Safia; Malik, Muhammad Imran; Siddiqi, Imran",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,392,13

Visual information is an indispensable part of our life and tends to convey a lot more details than either speech or text. A visual portrayal of a story is generally more appealing and convincing. It is also useful in a variety of applications, such as an accident/crime scene analysis, education and treatment of various psychological or mental disorders like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Some individuals develop PTSD due to their exposure to some dangerous or shocking life experience, such as military conflict, physical or sexual assault, traffic or fire accident, natural disasters, etc. People suffering from PTSD can be treated using Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), where they are immersed in a virtual environment to face feared situations that may not be safe to encounter in real life. In addition, generated 3D scenes can also be used as a visual aid for teaching children. Since crating 3D context and scenarios for such situations is tedious, time-consuming and requires special expertise in 3D application development environments and software, there is a need for automatic 3D scene generation systems from simple text descriptions. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating 3D scenes from a user-provided simple text. This proposed framework allows us to incorporate motion as well as special effects into the created scenes. In particular, the framework extracts the objects and entities that are present in a given textual narrative as well as spatial relationships. Depending on the description, it then creates either a 3D scene or a 3D scene with corresponding animation. This framework allows creation of a visualization using a set of pre-existing objects using [Formula: see text] as an implementation environment.","Ahmad, Imran Shafiq; Kadiyala, Havish; Boufama, Boubakeur",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,392,30

Recent changes in the higher education sector, such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) Engagement and Impact Assessment (EIA), present us with a further set of challenges. One way forward, which can capitalize on our transdisciplinarity, is offered by Ottmar Ette, who suggests that we reconceptualize the humanities in terms of what kind of knowledge they produce, and how.

The first argument is known as the “ pessimistic induction” or the “pessimistic meta-induction.” In its original formulation, attributed to Larry Laudan (Philos Sci 48(1):19–49, 1981), the argument is based on a list of theories that are supposed to be counterexamples to the realist thesis that empirical success is a mark of (approximate) truth. Other formulations of the argument have it as an inductive argument from a sample of theories that were discarded in the past to the conclusion that our present scientific theories will probably be discarded as well. The second argument is a positive argument for Bas van Fraassen’s (The scientific image. Oxford University Press, New York, 1980) antirealist position, namely, Constructive Empiricism. The third argument proceeds from the observation that scientists cannot claim to be in a privileged epistemic position. According to this argument, it is unlikely that our best scientific theories are (approximately) true because scientists are not especially skilled at developing theories that are likely true or approximately true. A contemporary proponent of this argument for antirealism is Brad Wray (Int Stud Philos Sci 22(3):317–326, 2008). The fourth is an argument for antirealism from what Kyle Stanford (Exceeding our grasp: science, history, and the problem of unconceived alternatives. Oxford University Press, New York, 2006) calls the “Problem of Unconceived Alternatives” (PUA). According to Stanford, the historical record of science reveals that past scientists typically failed to conceive of alternatives to their favorite, then-successful theories. This is supposed to make it more likely that present scientists fail to conceive of alternatives to their favorite, now-successful theories. For these reasons, Stanford argues, we should not believe our present scientific theories are (approximately) true. The fifth argument purports to show that many of the scientific theories we currently accept will be discarded sometime in the future, as the “ pessimistic induction” does, but it proceeds from the premise that the research goals and interests of scientists change over time (Wray, Brad K., Resisting scientific realism. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2018).","Mizrahi, Moti",The Relativity of Theory,392,16

As a result, the current court has no serious problems of overload and, in fact, the number of cases has decreased by half compared to previous generations. Furthermore, the reduced caseload has not diminished the prominent role that the Supreme Court plays in American society today. But it was not always so. In its beginnings, the Supreme Court was a ‘feeble institution,’ with justices riding circuit, with almost no cases and with not enough justices showing up anyway. After the Civil War, the federal courts and the Supreme Court gained more jurisdiction on ‘federal questions’ and, consequently, more cases to resolve. This increase in powers was not accompanied by changes in the judicial structure—which produced a case overload problem—until 1891. In that year, the U.S. Congress abolished the task of riding circuit for Supreme Court justices and created the intermediate circuit courts of appeals. This reform, however, brought only temporary relief. Litigants kept an automatic right to appeal to the Supreme Court, increasing its caseload pressures again. In the Judiciary Act of 1925, combined with other reforms in a similar direction, Congress redefined the role of the Supreme Court by giving it near-complete control of its docket. This contribution recounts the long journey through which the U.S. Supreme Court became its own master and how case overload problems are now long forgotten.","Marcus, Richard",Supreme Courts Under Pressure,392,1

Base on the observational data, surface-level O3, vertical distribution characteristics boundary layer O3 as well as its effect on surface-level O3 are thoroughly analyzed. The O3 lidar results showed similar vertical O3 profiles both in pollution episodes and clean periods, from which a high O3 concentration layer between 300 and 500 m and a sub-high O3 concentration layer between 1300 and 1700 m (near the top of the mixing layer) can be found. Besides, the downward O3 transport paths from the high/sub-high O3 concentration layers could be observed along with the boundary layer evolution: At nighttime, large amounts of O3 were effectively stored into the residual layer (RL). Due to the upward development of Mixing layer (ML) in early morning, atmospheric vertical mixing carried the O3 inside the RL down to the surface, which led to a rapid increase in the surface-level O3. The sub-high O3 layer began the downward mixing at noon, and became well-mixed after the boundary layer was fully developed in the afternoon, by which the near surface O3 pollution deteriorated again. Further analysis of the heavy O3 pollution episodes show that, the high O3 concentration inside the RL contributed 54% ± 6% of the surface-level O3 at 9:00 LT and the average contribution of O3 in the sub-high concentration layer to the surface-level O3 at 14:00 LT was 26% ± 9%.

However, urine leakage is a common problem with an indwelling urinary catheter. This study aims to determine whether a modified catheterisation technique would reduce urine leakage incidence. METHODS: Participants were randomly divided into conventional or modified catheterisation groups. In the modified technique group, the volume of fluid that needed to be injected into the balloon to obtain a suitable catheter front-end curvature (120-145°) was measured before catheterisation. Baseline characteristics and first-time success rates and procedure durations were similar between groups. RESULTS: There were 30 patients in each group. Compared with conventional catheterisation, the modified catheterisation group had smaller residual urine volume (median 11 mL Vs. 30.5 mL, p<0.001) and more leakage-free days (30 days Vs. 10 days, p<0.001).

This is not surprising given the scale and scope of the crisis. Much of this research has been undertaken within social science disciplines. At the same time, the crisis has also been the subject of fiction – novels, poetry and drama, and there is also a small body of academic scholarship on fiction relating to the crisis (and on finance in fiction more generally). The purpose of this paper is to suggest that fiction can offer a new perspective on the global financial crisis and thereby enhance our understanding of it.Design/methodology/approachThis exploration draws upon three works of post-crisis fiction: the 2009 play by David Hare, The Power of Yes: A Dramatist Seeks to Understand the Financial Crisis (hereafter The Power of Yes);Other People’s Money, a novel by Justin Cartwright (2011);and Robert Harris’s novel The Fear Index also published in 2011. Its approach is based on close readings of the three texts in question.FindingsFinance fiction stimulates a reconceptualization of the global financial crisis as a crisis of innovation and technological change.Originality/valueThis paper is a viewpoint article.

Hospital-based simulation training requires a new approach. The realities of social distancing and the operational demands of hospital staffing ratios warrant creative adaptations of traditional simulation training methods. Hospitals used simulation to improve patient outcomes by training healthcare staff and students through telesimulation, and tested systems and equipment using in situ simulation (ISS). Latent safety threats (LSTs) were identified and corrected to improve patient outcomes. Hospital-based simulation has been incorporated into newly licensed registered nurses (NLRNs) residency programs to prepare them for competent practice. Simulations are also used for preparing staff for low-incidence, high-risk medical emergencies or disasters, such as active shooter events.

Here we show that the eukaryotic viperin has originated from a clade of bacterial and archaeal proteins that protect against phage infection. Prokaryotic viperins (pVips) produce a set of modified ribonucleotides that include ddhCTP, as well as ddhGTP and ddhUTP. We further provide evidence that pVips protect against T7 phage infection by inhibiting viral polymerase-dependent transcription, implying an anti-viral mechanism of action similar to the animal viperin.

Wounds can be a source of infection by allowing unconstrained entry of microorganisms into the body, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The development of new antimicrobials (particularly antibiotics) is not keeping pace with the evolution of resistant microorganisms and novel ways of addressing this problem are urgently required. One such initiative has been the development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, which educate healthcare workers, and control the prescribing and targeting of antimicrobials to reduce the likelihood of AMR. Of great importance has been the European Wound Management Association (EWMA) in supporting AMS by providing practical recommendations for optimising antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of wound infection. The use of wound dressings that use a physical sequestration and retention approach rather than antimicrobial agents to reduce bacterial burden offers a novel approach that supports AMS. Bacterial-binding by dressings and their physical removal, rather than active killing, minimises their damage and hence prevents the release of damaging endotoxins. AIM: Our objective is to highlight AMS for the promotion of the judicious use of antimicrobials and to investigate how dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressings can support AMS goals. METHOD: MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar were searched to identify published articles describing data relating to AMS, and the use of a variety of wound dressings in the prevention and/or treatment of wound infections. The evidence supporting alternative wound dressings that can reduce bioburden and prevent and/or treat wound infection in a manner that does not kill or damage the microorganisms (for example, by actively binding and removing intact microorganisms from wounds) were then narratively reviewed. RESULTS: The evidence reviewed here demonstrates that using bacterial-binding wound dressings that act in a physical manner (for example, DACC-coated dressings) as an alternative approach to preventing and/or treating infection in both acute and hard-to-heal wounds does not exacerbate AMR and supports AMS. CONCLUSION: Some wound dressings work via a mechanism that promotes the binding and physical uptake, sequestration and removal of intact microorganisms from the wound bed (for example, a wound dressing that uses DACC technology to successfully prevent/reduce infection). They provide a valuable tool that aligns with the requirements of AMS (for example, reducing the use of antimicrobials in wound treatment regimens) by effectively reducing wound bioburden without inducing/selecting for resistant bacteria.","Rippon, Mark G; Rogers, Alan A; Ousey, Karen",J Wound Care,392,22

This study aimed to evaluate visual display terminal (VDT)-related digital eye strain (ES) and dry eye disease (DED) symptoms in subjects whose work was changed to teleworking (TW) during the coronavirus pandemic. Methods. A digital self-reported survey was conducted on subjects in TW, including demographics, medical history, VDT time and ES-related symptoms before and during the pandemic and DED (dry eye questionnaire 5 [DEQ-5] questionnaire). Results. A total of 1797 questionnaires were analyzed. Mean age was 40.5 (SD 11.1) years, and 69.9% were female. The mean number of TW weeks was 10.2 (SD 3.0). The total VDT total hours increased from 7.4 (SD 3.3) to 9.5 (SD 3.3) (p < 0.001). All ES symptoms presented a significant increase (p < 0.001). The mean DEQ-5 score was 8.3 (SD 4.9).

However, safety concerns are warranted due to repeated exposure of X-rays over a short period of time. Recent advances in MRI suggested that ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) was valuable for pulmonary applications. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of UTE-MRI for assessing COVID-19. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: In all, 23 patients with COVID-19 and with an average interval of 2.81 days between hospital admission and image examination. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T; Respiratory-gated three-dimensional radial UTE pulse sequence. ASSESSMENT: Image quality score. Patient- and lesion-based interobserver and intermethod agreement for identifying the representative image findings of COVID-19. STATISTICAL TESTS: Wilcoxon-rank sum test, Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W), intraclass coefficients (ICCs), and weighted kappa statistics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the image quality of CT and UTE-MRI (CT vs. UTE-MRI: 4.3 ± 0.4 vs. 4.0 ± 0.5, P = 0.09). Moreover, both patient- and lesion-based interobserver agreement of CT and UTE-MRI for evaluating the image signs of COVID-19 were determined as excellent (ICC: 0.939-1.000, P < 0.05; Kendall's W: 0.894-1.000, P < 0.05.).

The genomes were from viruses recovered in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic in Houston and from viruses recovered in an ongoing massive second wave of infections. The virus was originally introduced into Houston many times independently. Virtually all strains in the second wave have a Gly614 amino acid replacement in the spike protein, a polymorphism that has been linked to increased transmission and infectivity. Patients infected with the Gly614 variant strains had significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis. We found little evidence of a significant relationship between virus genotype and altered virulence, stressing the linkage between disease severity, underlying medical conditions, and host genetics. Some regions of the spike protein-the primary target of global vaccine efforts-are replete with amino acid replacements, perhaps indicating the action of selection. We exploited the genomic data to generate defined single amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain of spike protein that, importantly, produced decreased recognition by the neutralizing monoclonal antibody CR3022. Our report represents the first analysis of the molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in two infection waves in a major metropolitan region. The findings will help us to understand the origin, composition, and trajectory of future infection waves and the potential effect of the host immune response and therapeutic maneuvers on SARS-CoV-2 evolution.IMPORTANCE There is concern about second and subsequent waves of COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus occurring in communities globally that had an initial disease wave.

As a result, there remains much to be learned about mechanisms of neonatal infection including potential vertical transmission, best methods of testing, and the spectrum of clinical findings. This communication describes the epidemiology, diagnostic test results and clinical findings of neonatal COVID-19 during the pandemic in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 19 neonates infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from 10 hospitals throughout Iran. We analyzed obstetrical information, familial COVID-19 status, neonatal medical findings, perinatal complications, hospital readmissions, patterns of repeated testing, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Eleven neonates had family members infected. Five mothers were negative for COVID-19 and four neonates had no identifiable family source of infection. The neonatal mortality rate from COVID-19 was 10%. Seven newborns (37%) were discharged from the hospital as healthy but required readmission for symptoms of COVID-19. There were 2 multifetal gestations - one set each of twins and triplets, each with disparate testing and clinical outcomes. Premature delivery was common, occurring in 12 of 19 infants (63%). Initial testing for COVID-19 was negative in 4 of the 19 neonates (21%) who subsequently became positive. In 2 cases, neonates tested positive at 1 and 2 h after birth which was suspicious for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: These cases have notable variation in the epidemiology, clinical features, results of testing and clinical outcomes among the infected newborns. Neonates initially testing negative for COVID-19 may require readmission due to infection. Two neonates were highly suspicious for intrauterine vertical transmission. Repeat testing of neonates who initially test negative for COVID-19 is recommended, without which 21% of neonatal infections would have been undiagnosed.","Schwartz, David A; Mohagheghi, Parisa; Beigi, Babak; Zafaranloo, Nazanin; Moshfegh, Fereshteh; Yazdani, Anita",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,392,16

To estimate whether test positivity may assist in policy-making, it was explored in the first 60 to 90 epidemic days in six Latin American countries that reported their first COVID-19 case between February and March, 2020: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, and Uruguay. Test positivity (TP) is the percentage of test-positive individuals recorded on a given day out of all individuals tested on the same day. The epidemic data of the country infected last (Uruguay) was first analyzed to evaluate TP as well as: (i) the daily ratio of secondary over primary infections (apparent reproductive ratio or ARR); (ii) tests conducted per million inhabitants (TPMI), (iii) the temporal data on the number of active cases (all test-positive cases minus deaths and recovered patients), and (iv) that of recovered patients. Later, significant patterns identified in the first step were assessed in the six countries. The Uruguayan data indicated that (i) TP was positively correlated with the ARR (r=.92, p<0.01); (ii) TP informed more than the ARR: while major data departures revealed by the ARR were also detected by TP, TP exhibited patterns not shown by ARR; and (iii) three temporal stages were observed, which differed from one another in both TP and TPMI medians (P<0.01) and, together, revealed a negative relationships between TPMI and TP. The six Latin American countries showed that TP was positively correlated with deaths/million inhabitants or DMI (r=.62, p<0.01). The temporal analysis of policies revealed four patterns: (1) low testing and high DMI, (2) high testing and low DMI; (3) an intermediate pattern, and (4) high testing and high DMI (where isolation was not pursued). Findings support the hypothesis that test positivity may inform as much as, if not more than classic metrics, such as the TPMI. If complemented with high-resolution geographical data, these indicators could inform policy-makers when and where epidemic control measures are or are not successful. .","Fasina, Folorunso O.; Salami, Mudasiru A.; Fasina, Modupe M.; Otekunrin, Olutosin A.; Hoogesteyn, Almira L; Hittner, James B.",Methods,392,20

In this paper, we conducted noise measurements of two UAVs of different performance (quadrotor and hexarotor) in flying up and down, hovering, and overflight procedures. Respondents of good hearing who were confirmed by audiogram measurement and had participated in the survey during UAV noise measurement gave their subjective assessments on the UAV noise perception. UAV noise measurements and subjective respondents’ assessments were analysed and related. UAV noise analysis showed that the parameters measured at the same measurement point for the hexarotor were higher than those for the quadrotor in flying up and down and flying-over procedures. Low frequency noise was present in the noise spectrum of both drones. Participants were able to distinguish between the noise of UAVs and had a generally more negative experience with the hexarotor.

We measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in the influent of twelve wastewater treatment plants from August 2020 to January 2021. Replicate samples demonstrated that N1 gene target concentrations varied by 21% RSD between technical replicate filters and by 14% RSD between duplicate assays. COVID-19 cases were correlated significantly (rho[≥]0.70) to wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations for seven plants, including large and small cities. SARS-CoV-2 data normalized to flow improved correlations to reported COVID-19 cases for some plants but normalizing to a spiked recovery control (BCoV) or a fecal marker (PMMoV or HF183) generally reduced correlations.

All-cause mortality was 10% overall (95% PI, 2 to 39%; 1687/14203 patients; 43 studies), 34% in patients admitted to intensive care units (95% PI, 8 to 76%; 659/2368 patients; 10 studies), 83% in patients requiring invasive ventilation (95% PI, 1 to 100%; 180/220 patients; 6 studies), and 75% in patients who developed ARDS (95% PI, 35 to 94%; 339/455 patients; 11 studies). On average, ARDS occurred in 14% of patients (95% PI, 2 to 59%; 999/6322 patients; 23 studies), acute cardiac injury in 15% (95% PI, 5 to 38%; 452/2389 patients; 10 studies), venous thromboembolism in 15% (95% PI, 0 to 100%; patients; 3 studies), acute kidney injury in 6% (95% PI, 1 to 41%; 318/4682 patients; 15 studies), coagulopathy in 6% (95% PI, 1 to 39%; 223/3370 patients; 9 studies), and shock in 3% (95% PI, 0 to 61%; 203/4309 patients; 13 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was very high in critically ill patients based on very low-quality evidence due to striking heterogeneity and risk of bias. The incidence of clinically relevant outcomes was substantial, although reported by only one third of the studies suggesting considerable underreporting.

Current screening and response protocols using rRT-PCR in homeless shelters are expensive, require specialized staff and have delays in returning results and implementing responses. Methods We piloted a program to offer frequent, rapid antigen-based tests (BinaxNOW) to residents and staff of congregate-living shelters in San Francisco, California, from January 15th to February 19th, 2021. We used the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the implementation. Results Reach: We offered testing at ten of twelve eligible shelters. Shelter residents and staff had variable participation across shelters; approximately half of eligible individuals tested at least once; few tested consistently during the study. Effectiveness: 2.2% of participants tested positive. We identified three outbreaks, but none exceeded 5 cases. All BinaxNOW-positive participants were isolated or left the shelters. Adoption: We offered testing to all eligible participants within weeks of the project's initiation. Implementation: Adaptations made to increase reach and improve consistency were promptly implemented. Maintenance: San Francisco Department of Public Health expanded and maintained testing with minimal support after the end of the pilot. Conclusion Rapid and frequent antigen testing for SARS-CoV2 in homeless shelters is a viable alternative to rRT-PCR testing that can lead to immediate isolation of infectious individuals. Using the RE-AIM framework, we evaluated and adapted interventions to enable the expansion and maintenance of protocols.","Aranda-Diaz, A.; Imbert, E.; Strieff, S.; Graham-Squire, D.; Evans, J.; Moore, J.; McFarland, W.; Fuchs, J.; Handley, M.; Kushel, M.

MMF is used widely in feed additives and human medicinal applications throughout the world; however, there have only been a few reports about the biostudy of its fermentation mechanism and medicinal ingredients. To safely use MMF, we observed the changes in the ingredients and amylase activity for several raw materials during the fermentation process of MMF. We are going to explore the basis of pharmacodynamic substances and the purpose of MMF to provide support for safe use in clinics. This biostudy data demonstrated that the ingredients such as amygdalin, benzaldehyde, and rutin were gradually degraded during the process of fermentation, and the fermented MMF did not contain amygdalin and benzaldehyde. The HPLC fingerprint of fermented MMF for 7 days is similar to the chemical composition of the original unfermented MMF with a similarity of only 0.106. Meanwhile, the activities of amylase in fermented MMF had gradually increased, and the content of organic acids also had increased. According to our biostudy, we found that the raw material chemical composition of MMF in the process of fermentation was affected by microorganisms and various substances. The conclusions of our study determined that the initial components of MMF are not identical to the pharmacodynamic components. We also conclude that amylase activity explains the pharmacological activity of MMF to a certain extent, but it is likely not the only factor. The implication not only provides the initial knowledge of MMF but also implies the further exploration of this popular traditional medicine.","Fu, Frank Qiang; Xu, Mingshu; Wei, Zhijiang; Li, Weidong",ACS Omega,392,20

RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of the abnormal chest CT scan, ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation opacity, and both of GGO and consolidation were also surveyed based on RT-PCR. The results showed that RT-PCR assay was negative in 23 (42.6%) patients and positive in 31 (57.4%) cases. Also, the patients with an abnormal chest CT scan comprised 37 (68.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of abnormal CT scan were 78.6% and 42.3%, respectively, based on the RT-PCR method.

Some athletes have access to facilities and equipment, while others have limited or no access, severely limiting their training practices. A primary concern is that the maintenance of key physical qualities (e. g. strength, power, high-speed running ability, acceleration, deceleration and change of direction), game-specific contact skills (e. g. tackling) and decision-making ability, are challenged, impacting performance and injury risk on resumption of training and competition. In extended periods of reduced training, without targeted intervention, changes in body composition and function can be profound. However, there are strategies that can dramatically mitigate potential losses, including resistance training to failure with lighter loads, plyometric training, exposure to high-speed running to ensure appropriate hamstring conditioning, and nutritional intervention. Athletes may require psychological support given the challenges associated with isolation and a change in regular training routine. While training restrictions may result in a decrease in some physical and psychological qualities, athletes can return in a positive state following an enforced period of rest and recovery. On return to training, the focus should be on progression of all aspects of training, taking into account the status of individual athletes.","Stokes, Keith A.; Jones, Ben; Bennett, Mark; Close, Graeme L.; Gill, Nicholas; Hull, James H.; Kasper, Andreas M.; Kemp, Simon P.T.; Mellalieu, Stephen D.; Peirce, Nicholas; Stewart, Bob; Wall, Benjamin T.; West, Stephen W.; Cross, Matthew",Int J Sports Med,392,29

AIMS: This study evaluated the impact of social distancing imposed by coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) on Brazilians’ mental health and QoL. METHOD: In this cross-sectional community-based online survey, data from 1156 community-dwelling adults were gathered between 11 May and 3 June 2020. We examined independent correlates of depression, anxiety and QoL, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, optimism/pessimism and spiritual/religious coping. Dependent variables were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety symptoms, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF for QoL. Correlates of depressive and anxiety disorder were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: There were high levels of depressive symptoms (41.9%) and anxiety symptoms (29.0%) in participants. Negative spiritual/religious coping was positively correlated with depressive disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14 95% CI 1.63–2.80; P < 0.001) and with anxiety disorder (OR = 2.46 95% CI 1.90–3.18; P < 0.001), and associated with worse social and environmental QoL (P < 0.001). Healthcare professionals were less likely to have depressive symptoms (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55–0.93; P < 0.001).

Results showed a high number of viral RNA copies (up to 10(11) copies/ml) within 48 h in C6/36 cells. In addition, the titers of the Yichang virus reached maximal levels of 10(7) PFU/mL at 6 d post-infection (dpi). The virus produced moderate cytopathic effects when the multiplicity of infection ranged from 0.001–0.1 at 6 dpi, but did not replicate in mammalian cells. Under electron microscopy, the virion of the Yichang virus appeared as spherical particles with diameters of ∼80 nm and large club-shaped projections. Although subsequent genomic sequence analysis revealed that the Yichang virus had similar protein patterns as those of other mesoniviruses, the nucleotide acids shared less than 20% BLAST query coverage with known viruses in the family Mesoniviridae, and showed a maximum sequence identity of 67% for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The putative protein sequences showed slightly higher identity (28%–68%), and the most conserved domain was RdRp.

A live attenuated vaccine (LAV) and glycoprotein E (gE) subunit vaccine were developed to prevent VZV‐induced diseases. We recently reported that single‐strand RNA (ssRNA) based on the intergenic region of the internal ribosome entry site of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) is an effective adjuvant for protein‐based and virus‐like particle‐based vaccines. Here, Chinese hamster ovary expression system and an LAV from Oka/SK strains. METHODS: We appraised the adjuvant effect of the same CrPV ssRNA encoding the gE gene formulated in the two vaccines using VZV‐primed C57BL/6 mice and guinea pigs. Humoral immunity and cell‐mediated immunity were assessed by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ELISPOT in gE subunit vaccine and by ELISA and fluorescent antibody to membrane antigen in LAV. RESULTS: The gE subunit vaccine‐induced gE‐specific antibodies and CD4(+) T‐cell responses (indicated by interferon‐γ [IFN‐γ] and interleukin‐2 secretion) in the ssRNA‐based adjuvant containing the VZV gE gene. Therefore, an ssRNA adjuvant combined with gE antigen can trigger the innate immune response and induce an adaptive immune response to ultimately activate humoral and cell‐mediated responses. VZV LAV could also induce VZV‐specific antibodies and IFN‐γ stimulated by LAV, whereas the effect of ssRNA as a vaccine adjuvant could not be confirmed. However, the ssRNA adjuvant increased VZV‐specific neutralizing antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results highlight that the gE subunit vaccine and LAV developed in this study can be functional VZV vaccines, and ssRNAs appear to function better as adjuvants in a subunit vaccine than in an LAV.","Lee, Su Jeen; Park, Hyo‐Jung; Ko, Hae Li; Lee, Jung Eun; Lee, Hyun Joo; Kim, Hun; Nam, Jae‐Hwan",Immun Inflamm Dis,392,11

Particularly vulnerable households include dual health care professional households, single-parent health care professional households, and households with health care professionals responsible for a high-risk family member (i.e., an older adult or immunocompromised person). While the demographics of these households are heterogeneous, it is expected that the professional and personal concerns specific to COVID-19 will be similar. These concerns include family safety, balancing full-time work with home-based schooling for children, the looming threat of illness to 1 or both partners, the potential of infecting high-risk family members, and the challenges of planning for the future during uncertain times. To elucidate these concerns in their department, the authors sought input from colleagues in dual health care professional households through an open-ended email communication. Respondents expressed a range of concerns centered on balancing professional and family responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, the authors propose several recommendations in the areas of support networks, leadership and culture, and operations and logistics that health care institutions can adopt to minimize the burden on these vulnerable households during states of emergency.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in acute situations, where it is associated with more complications and higher mortality. Methods Analysis of the international HOPE registry (NCT04334291). The objective was to assess the prognostic information of AF in COVID-19 patients. A multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed to assess the relationship between AF and mortality. We also evaluated the impact on mortality and embolic events of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in these patients. Results Among 6217 patients enrolled in the HOPE registry, 250 had AF (4.5%). AF patients had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. After propensity score matching, these differences were attenuated. Despite this, patients with AF had a higher incidence of in-hospital complications such as heart failure (19.3% vs 11.6%, P =.021) and respiratory insufficiency (75.9% vs 62.3%, P =.002), as well as a higher 60-day mortality rate (43.4% vs 30.9%, P =.005). On multivariate analysis, AF was independently associated with higher 60-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.234; 95%CI, 1.003-1.519). CHA2DS2-VASc score acceptably predicts 60-day mortality in COVID-19 patients (area ROC, 0.748; 95%CI, 0.733-0.764), but not its embolic risk (area ROC, 0.411; 95%CI, 0.147-0.675). Conclusions AF in COVID-19 patients is associated with a higher number of complications and 60-day mortality.
