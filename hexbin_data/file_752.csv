As our first contribution, we explore whether recently introduced word embeddings can be exploited for representing documents to improve diversification, and show a positive result. As a second improvement, we propose to automatically predict the size of candidate set on per query basis. Experimental evaluations using our BM25 runs as well as the best-performing ad hoc runs submitted to TREC (2009–2012) show that our approach improves the performance of implicit diversification up to 5.4% wrt. initial ranking.","Ulu, Yasar Baris; Altingovde, Ismail Sengor",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148034/,752
58858,,2021-10-07,"The meaning of “vaccine diplomacy (VD)” is defined as “the use of vaccines to increase a country's diplomatic relations and influence over other nations.” The golden era of vaccine science diplomacy started during the time of Cold War between the United States (US) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) with the development of a prototype of oral polio vaccine by the US Scientist Dr Albert Sabin working along with his Soviet counterparts. The foundation stone was already laid down by Edward Jenner when he shared his technique of the smallpox vaccine with other major countries to curb the spread of smallpox. Eventually, such a step led to the eradication of such a deadly disease. Only time has changed, not the tide. Even today, vaccines continue to remain as one of the important tools for achieving Millennium Developmental Goals (MDGs) and other targets in developing countries like India. During the wake of the Corona Virus Diseases-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, India's role in developing its vaccine science diplomacy has been a point of attraction. The phase-3 trial of Covaxin being developed by Bharat Biotech started in Lucknow and Gorakhpur in October 2020, and it is widely considered as the forerunner for the Indian vaccine market. As per the Union Health Ministry of India- “The Union Government is working on at least five distinct ways, ranging from free vaccines to guaranteed supply, in which it can help its immediate neighbours and countries in West Asia, Africa and even Latin America—officials familiar with the plan said on conditions of anonymity. The idea is to leverage the country's standing as the world's vaccine factory to merge diplomatic ties. Historically, it is observed that by the development and introduction of newer vaccines from time to time, many dismaying hurdles to vaccine science diplomacy (VSD) arise from ongoing wars and political instability. The current scenario is that both VSD and VD are at crossroads, and there is a possibility of getting a good direction if we make a piggyback policy approach of vaccine diplomacy along with the foreign policy. The lessons learned from the past must be followed now and, in the future, to make a better world for all. We acknowledge that the COVID-19 episode has again highlighted the dire need for VSD, and we assume that not only COVID-19 but in future, emerging and re-emerging diseases will occur so we have to prepare ourselves for combatting those future emerging and re-emerging diseases.","Bhattacharya, Sudip; Saleem, Sheikh Mohd; Shikha, Deep; Gokdemir, Ozden; Mehta, Kedar",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8483080/,752

64409,,2020-05-05,"Background Pelvic girdle pain is a common problem during pregnancy and postpartum with significant personal and societal impact and costs. Studies examining the effectiveness of interventions for pelvic girdle pain measure different outcomes, making it difficult to pool data in meta-analysis in a meaningful and interpretable way to increase the certainty of effect measures. A consensus-based core outcome set for pelvic girdle pain can address this issue. As a first step in developing a core outcome set, it is essential to systematically examine the outcomes measured in existing studies. Objective The objective of this systematic review was to identify, examine and compare what outcomes are measured and reported, and how outcomes are measured, in intervention studies and systematic reviews of interventions for pelvic girdle pain and for lumbopelvic pain (which includes pelvic girdle pain). Methods We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro and Embase from inception to the 11th May 2018. Two reviewers independently selected studies by title/abstract and by full text screening. Disagreement was resolved through discussion. Outcomes reported and their outcome measurement instruments were extracted and recorded by two reviewers independently. We assessed the quality of reporting with two independent reviewers. The outcomes were grouped into core domains using the OMERACT filter 2.0 framework. Results A total of 107 studies were included, including 33 studies on pelvic girdle pain and 74 studies on lumbopelvic pain. Forty-six outcomes were reported across all studies, with the highest amount (26/46) in the 'life impact' domain. 'Pain' was the most commonly reported outcome in both pelvic girdle pain and lumbopelvic pain studies. Studies used different instruments to measure the same outcomes, particularly for the outcomes pain, function, disability and quality of life. Conclusions A wide variety of outcomes and outcome measurements are used in studies on pelvic girdle pain and lumbopelvic pain. The findings of this review will be included in a Delphi survey to reach consensus on a pelvic girdle pain - core outcome set. This core outcome set will allow for more effective comparison between future studies on pelvic girdle pain, allowing for more effective translation of findings to clinical practice.

68358,,2020-11-09,"INTRODUCTION Syndromic surveillance allows early detection of changes in the population's morbidity pattern. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of indicators related to access to healthcare services, in COVID-19 surveillance. MATERIAL AND METHODS A time series analysis was performed using the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Mainland Portugal, between weeks 14/2020 (March 30 to April 5) and 25/2020 (June 15 to 21), and six indicators: 1) COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare; 2) number of COVID-19 emergency department visits; 3) number of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; 4) number of hospitalizations due to viral pneumonia; 5) proportion of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; and 6) proportion of hospitalizations for viral pneumonia. Pearson correlation and cross-correlations were computed. RESULTS A strong correlation was found between the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 and all indicators. [(1) 0.76; (2) 0.82; (3) 0.77; (4) 0.84; (5) 0.86; e (6) 0.90]. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia detect variations in the frequency of the disease with a one week lag compared to the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare and emergency department visits trail behind the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. The proportion of viral pneumonias in emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, is temporally aligned with the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19. DISCUSSION The delay found in the COVID-19 primary healthcare consultations and emergency department visits, may be related to changes in access to healthcare services and clinical coding. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia may be useful in the early detection of COVID-19. Viral pneumonia may have been coded as being of unknown origin. Future monitoring of these indicators is necessary to ascertain whether the incidence of COVID-19 is significantly influenced by changes in testing strategies. The indicators described in this study will be an asset for the optimization of testing strategies, allocation of healthcare resources to the communities that are most vulnerable to severe morbidity and assessing vaccination impact. As such, surveillance systems based on clinical data will be a valuable complementary tool to SINAVE. CONCLUSION The indicators under analysis could be used regularly, with special attention to viral pneumonias, to detect outbreaks of COVID-19. Information on pneumonia of unknown etiology may be considered in the surveillance of COVID-19.","Torres, Ana Rita; Silva, Susana; Kislaya, Irina; Martins, João Pedro; Matias Dias, Carlos; Rodrigues, Ana Paula",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.14593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971114/,752

83685,,2020-06-01,"Roux-en-Y-Gastric-Bypass (RYGB) reduces overall and diabetes-specific mortality by 40% and over 90%. This study aims to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of this effect. We evaluated time-courses of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and the incretin glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) following an oral glucose load. Insulin-sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic-clamp-test; glucose-turnover was determined using D-[6,6-(2)H(2)] glucose. Examinations were performed in six nondiabetic patients with excess weight before (PRE: BMI: 49.3 ± 3.2 kg/m(2)) and 7 months after RYGB (POST: BMI: 36.7 ± 2.9 kg/m(2)), in a lean (CON: BMI: 22.6 ± 0.6 kg/m(2)) and an obese control group (CONob) without history of gastrointestinal surgery (BMI: 34.7 ± 1.2 kg/m(2)). RYGB reduced fasting plasma concentrations of insulin and C-peptide (P < 0.01, respectively) whereas fasting glucose concentrations remained unchanged. After RYGB increase of C-peptide concentration following glucose ingestion was significantly higher compared to all other groups (dynamic-area under the curve (Dyn-AUC): 0-90 min: POST: 984 ± 115 ng·min/ml, PRE: 590 ± 67 ng·min/ml, CONob: 440 ± 44 ng·min/ml, CON: 279 ± 22 ng·min/ml, P < 0.01 respectively). Early postprandial increase of glucose concentration was however not affected. GLP-1 concentrations following glucose ingestion were sixfold higher after RYBG than before (P = 0.01). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake tended to increase postoperatively (M-value: PRE: 1.8 ± 0.5, POST: 3.0 ± 0.3, not significant (n.s.)). Endogenous glucose production (EGP) was unaffected by RYGB. Hepatic insulin resistance index improved after RYGB and was then comparable to both control groups (PRE: 29.2 ± 4.3, POST: 12.6 ± 1.1, P < 0.01). RYGB results in hyper-secretion of insulin and C-peptide, whereas improvements of insulin resistance are minor and seem to occur rather in the liver and the adipose tissue than in the skeletal muscle.","Promintzer-Schifferl, Miriam; Prager, Gerhard; Anderwald, Christian; Mandl, Martina; Esterbauer, Harald; Shakeri-Leidenmühler, Soheila; Pacini, Giovanni; Stadler, Marietta; Bischof, Martin G; Ludvik, Bernhard; Luger, Aanton; Krebs, Michael",Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1038/oby.2011.92; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21494227/,752

93663,,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND Minimal access techniques have transformed the way pediatric surgery is practiced. Due to various constraints, surgical residency programs have not been able to tutor adequate training skills in the routine setting. The advent of new technology and methods in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), has similarly contributed to the need for systematic skills' training in a safe, simulated environment. To enable the training of the proper technique among pediatric surgery trainees, we have advanced a porcine non-survival model for endoscopic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS The technical advancements over the past 3 years and a subjective validation of the porcine model from 114 participating trainees using a standard questionnaire and a 5-point Likert scale have been described here. Mean attitude scores and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis of the data. RESULTS Almost all trainees agreed or strongly agreed that the animal-based model was appropriate (98.35%) and also acknowledged that such workshops provided adequate practical experience before attempting on human subjects (96.6%). Mean attitude score for respondents was 19.08 (SD 3.4, range 4-20). Attitude scores showed no statistical association with years of experience or the level of seniority, indicating a positive attitude among all groups of respondents. CONCLUSIONS Structured porcine-based MIS training should be an integral part of skill acquisition for pediatric surgery trainees and the experience gained can be transferred into clinical practice. We advocate that laparoscopic training should begin in a controlled workshop setting before procedures are attempted on human patients.","Narayanan, Sarath Kumar; Cohen, Ralph Clinton; Shun, Albert",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-014-3502-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748108/,752
102031,,2021-02-01,"OBJECT Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) carries a high risk of stroke. Evaluation of ICAD has focused on assessing the absolute degree of stenosis, although plaque morphology has recently demonstrated increasing relevance. The authors provide the first report of the use of ultra-high-resolution C-arm cone-beam CT angiography (CBCT-A) in the evaluation of vessel stenosis as well as plaque morphology. METHODS Between August 2009 and July 2012, CBCT-A was used in all patients with ICAD who underwent catheter-based angiography at the authors' institution (n = 18). Lesions were evaluated for maximum degree of stenosis as well as plaque morphological characteristics (ulcerated, calcified, dissected, or spiculated) via digital subtraction angiography (DSA), 3D-rotational angiography (3DRA), and CBCT-A. The different imaging modalities were compared in their assessment of absolute stenosis as well as their ability to resolve different plaque morphologies. RESULTS Lesions were found to have similar degrees of stenosis when utilizing CBCT-A compared with 3DRA, but both 3DRA and CBCT-A differed from DSA in their assessment of the absolute degree of stenosis. CBCT-A provided the most detailed resolution of plaque morphology, identifying a new plaque characteristic in 61% of patients (n = 11) when compared with DSA and 50% (n = 9) when compared with 3DRA. CBCT-A identified all lesion characteristics visualized on DSA and 3DRA. CONCLUSIONS CBCT-A provides detailed spatial resolution of plaque morphology and may add to DSA and 3DRA in the evaluation of ICAD. Further prospective study is warranted to determine any benefit CBCTA-A may provide in clinical decision making and risk stratification over existing conventional imaging modalities.","Safain, Mina G; Rahal, Jason P; Patel, Samir; Lauric, Alexandra; Feldmann, Edward; Malek, Adel M",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.5.jns132201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24949672/,752
103935,,2020-07-01,"The current spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates a long-term fight against the widespread and exponential increase in morbidity and mortality across the globe. A variety of non-pharmacological strategies to mitigate and suppress virus transmission have been investigated and introduced. Currently, emerging studies focus mostly on the management of hospital-treated patients in the acute phase of the disease, including the legitimacy of using physiotherapeutic procedures. However, current literature lacks guidelines for rehabilitation related to maintaining continuity and universality of the therapy after the end of the acute phase of the disease and discharge from hospital. The authors suggest implementing an immediate rehabilitation program in post-infection patients as data from previous epidemics of respiratory-related viral diseases shows that COVID-19 survivors should be expected to have impaired lung ventilation function, and reduced exercise tolerance and muscular weakness, and prolonged return to work and participation. It should be assumed that only the introduction of immediate recommendations for the implementation of rehabilitation procedures based on simple and well-known tests, as well as their obligatory regime, can contribute to the reduction of respiratory disability leading, in a short time, to infections recurrence and, in the long run, to a lower quality of life and socioeconomic burden on the population. This article presents a respiratory rehabilitation program for COVID-19 survivors, recommended by the Polish Society of Physiotherapy. This program was approved by the Polish Minister of Health and implemented as a pilot program at the Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior and Administration in Głuchołazy, Poland.

112710,,2020-11-16,"Herein, we report for the first time a case of a surficial superficial non-ampullary duodenal cancer causing obscure intestinal bleeding that was identified by small-bowel capsule endoscopy and treated by endoscopic mucosal resection. A 73-year-old man underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to identify the cause of anemia. Although conventional duodenoscopy revealed a flat, elevated 5-mm lesion with a central recess and ""milk-white mucosa"" at the inferior duodenal angulus, capsule endoscopy revealed a white nodular 5-mm lesion with central recess at the duodenum slightly to the anal side from the major duodenal papilla. Pathohistological examination revealed a low-grade well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma growing locally in the mucosal layer. Although capsule endoscopy detected a nodular lesion, conventional endoscopy revealed a flat, elevated lesion. The cause of this difference in endoscopic findings is considered to be the degree of extension of the intestinal mucosa. In contrast, ""milk-white mucosa"" as a typical finding of superficial duodenal tumor in conventional endoscopy could be identified as a white mucosal color tone in capsule endoscopy. Conventional endoscopic findings of irregular surface structure in the lesion suggested malignancy. Pathohistologically, the ductal structure of the adenocarcinoma was also distorted. Unfortunately, it was difficult to suggest that the lesion was adenocarcinoma based on the endoscopic findings alone.","Ota, Kazuhiro; Kikutani, Satoshi; Kawasaki, Yuka; Sugawara, Noriaki; Harada, Satoshi; Kojima, Yuichi; Nouda, Sadaharu; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Akutagawa, Hiroshi; Higuchi, Kazuhide",Clinical journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12328-018-0911-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30259299/,752

118331,,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVES To assess patient needs and concerns after head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment and their possible correlations with long-term quality of life (QoL) and to examine the potential impact of psychological distress on these results. METHODS Alive and disease-free HNSCC patients at least 1 year after treatment were enrolled in this cross-sectional multicentric study and completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and H&N35 QoL questionnaires, the head and neck cancer-specific patient concerns inventory (PCI-HN) questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Correlations between QoL outcomes and patient needs and concerns were investigated using Spearman's correlation tests. RESULTS Seventy-two patients were enrolled in the study. Fear of cancer recurrence was the main patient concern followed by dental, salivary, fatigue, speech, and eating problems. The leading patient needs in terms of consultation were to be referred to the surgeon, the speech, and swallow therapist and the oral rehabilitation team. The number of patient concerns correlated negatively (r < .40) with functioning scales score and positively (r > .40) with general and head and neck symptoms. Psychological distress was the main determinant of QoL outcomes (p < .0001). We found a significant impact of gender (p = .002) on the number of patient concerns, and of patient age (p = .003) on the number of staff members selected by patients. CONCLUSION Identification of patient needs and concerns along with multidisciplinary management of persistent symptoms and psychological distress seem essential steps towards improving QoL of HNSCC patients.","Elaldi, Roxane; Roussel, Lise-Marie; Gal, Jocelyn; Scheller, Boris; Chamorey, Emmanuel; Schiappa, Renaud; Lasne-Cardon, Audrey; Louis, Marie-Yolande; Culié, Dorian; Dassonville, Olivier; Poissonnet, Gilles; Saada, Esma; Benezery, Karen; Babin, Emmanuel; Bozec, Alexandre",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06326-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901366/,752

127494,,2021-01-14,"PURPOSE Patients with varus and fixed flexion deformity (FFD) undergoing TKA may have a significant leg length change (LLC) after surgery. We aimed to determine the correlation between changes in HKA or FFD and leg length in patients undergoing TKA, the combined effect of coronal and sagittal plane deformity correction on LLC, and the possibility of estimating LLC mathematically. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective radiographic evaluation of 242 knees, which had undergone primary unilateral TKA for advanced OA with varus and FFD. Full-length standing calibrated anteroposterior radiographs were used to measure the hip-knee-ankle axis (HKA) and functional leg length after adjusting for magnification. Clinical evaluation of FFD was done using a handheld goniometer. RESULTS 224 knees (92.6%) showed increased limb length after TKA averaging 10.7 mm (SD 9.5 mm, P = .000). There was a significant correlation between the change in HKA and FFD from preoperatively to postoperatively with the amount of LLC (ρ 0.326 and 0.346, respectively, P = .000). FFD improvement from preoperatively to postoperatively was 8.1° to 1° (P = .000), respectively. A linear relationship was established between LLC and changes in HKA and FFD, where 10° improvement in HKA would result in an LLC of nearly 4 mm, and 10° improvement in FFD would result in a LLC of nearly 8 mm. CONCLUSION LLC may be substantial after correcting varus and FFD with unilateral TKA, it correlates with the change in HKA and FFD and can be mathematically estimated. CLINICAL TRIALS .

127965,,2020-11-01,"High temperatures can negatively influence plant growth and development. Besides yield, the effects of heat stress on fruit quality traits remain poorly characterised. In tomato, insights into how fruits regulate cellular metabolism in response to heat stress could contribute to the development of heat-tolerant varieties, without detrimental effects on quality. In the present study, the changes occurring in wild type tomato fruits after exposure to transient heat stress have been elucidated at the transcriptome, cellular and metabolite level. An impact on fruit quality was evident as nutritional attributes changed in response to heat stress. Fruit carotenogenesis was affected, predominantly at the stage of phytoene formation, although altered desaturation/isomerisation arose during the transient exposure to high temperatures. Plastidial isoprenoid compounds showed subtle alterations in their distribution within chromoplast sub-compartments. Metabolite profiling suggests limited effects on primary/intermediary metabolism but lipid remodelling was evident. The heat-induced molecular signatures included the accumulation of sucrose and triacylglycerols, and a decrease in the degree of membrane lipid unsaturation, which influenced the volatile profile. Collectively, these data provide valuable insights into the underlying biochemical and molecular adaptation of fruit to heat stress and will impact on our ability to develop future climate resilient tomato varieties.

138727,,2020-06-01,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential for embryonic development and adult homeostasis. How its signaling activity is fine-tuned in response to fluctuated Hh gradient is less known. Here, we identify protein phosphatase V (PpV), the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 6, as a homeostatic regulator of Hh signaling. PpV is genetically upstream of widerborst (wdb), which encodes a regulatory subunit of PP2A that modulates high-level Hh signaling. We show that PpV negatively regulates Wdb stability independent of phosphatase activity of PpV, by competing with the catalytic subunit of PP2A for Wdb association, leading to Wdb ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Thus, regulated Wdb stability, maintained through competition between two closely related phosphatases, ensures graded Hh signaling. Interestingly, PpV expression is regulated by Hh signaling. Therefore, PpV functions as a Hh activity sensor that regulates Wdb-mediated PP2A activity through feedback mechanisms to maintain Hh signaling homeostasis.","Liu, Min; Liu, Aiguo; Wang, Jie; Zhang, Yansong; Li, Yajuan; Su, Ying; Zhu, Alan Jian",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202010078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33373452/,752
138901,,2020-10-19,"The biceps pulley or ""sling"" is a capsuloligamentous complex that acts to stabilize the long head of the biceps tendon in the bicipital groove. The pulley complex is composed of the superior glenohumeral ligament, the coracohumeral ligament, and the distal attachment of the subscapularis tendon, and is located within the rotator interval between the anterior edge of the supraspinatus tendon and the superior edge of the subscapularis tendon. Because of its superior depiction of the capsular components, direct magnetic resonance arthrography is the imaging modality of choice for demonstrating both the normal anatomy and associated lesions of the biceps pulley. Oblique sagittal images and axial images obtained with a high image matrix are valuable for identifying individual components of the pulley system. Various pathologic processes occur in the biceps pulley as well as the rotator interval. These processes can be traumatic, degenerative, congenital, or secondary to injuries to the surrounding structures. The term hidden lesion refers to an injury of the biceps pulley mechanism and is derived from the difficulty in making clinical and arthroscopic identification. Pathologic conditions associated with pulley lesions include anterosuperior impingement, instability of the biceps tendon, biceps tendinopathy or tendinosis, superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions, and adhesive capsulitis. It is important to be familiar with the normal appearance of the biceps pulley so that abnormalities can be correctly assessed and effectively managed.","Nakata, Waka; Katou, Sakura; Fujita, Akifumi; Nakata, Manabu; Lefor, Alan T; Sugimoto, Hideharu","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.313105507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21571657/,752

158185,,2021-08-01,"BACKGROUND The Cochrane Collaboration, an international not-for-profit organization that prepares and maintains systematic reviews of randomized trials of health care therapies, has produced reviews summarizing much of the evidence on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Our objective was to review the evidence base according to Cochrane systematic reviews. METHODS In order to detect reviews focusing on TCM, we searched the titles and abstracts of all reviews in Issue 4, 2008 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. For each review, we extracted data on the number of trials included and the total number of participants. We provided an indication of the strength of the review findings by assessing the reviewers' abstract conclusions statement. We supplemented our assessment of the abstract conclusions statements with a listing of the comparisons and outcomes showing statistically significant meta-analyses results. RESULTS We identified 70 Cochrane systematic reviews of TCM, primarily acupuncture (n = 26) and Chinese herbal medicine (n = 42), and 1 each of moxibustion and t'ai chi. Nineteen (19) of 26 acupuncture reviews and 22/42 herbal medicine reviews concluded that there was not enough good quality trial evidence to make any conclusion about the efficacy of the evaluated treatment, while the remaining 7 acupuncture and 20 herbal medicine reviews and each of the moxibustion and t'ai chi reviews indicated a suggestion of benefit, which was qualified by a caveat about the poor quality and quantity of studies. Most reviews included many distinct interventions, controls, outcomes, and populations, and a large number of different comparisons were made, each with a distinct forest plot. CONCLUSIONS Most Cochrane systematic reviews of TCM are inconclusive, due specifically to the poor methodology and heterogeneity of the studies reviewed. Some systematic reviews provide preliminary evidence of Chinese medicine's benefits to certain patient populations, underscoring the importance and appropriateness of further research. These preliminary findings should be considered tentative and need to be confirmed with rigorous randomized controlled trials.","Manheimer, Eric; Wieland, Susan; Kimbrough, Elizabeth; Cheng, Ker; Berman, Brian M",Journal of alternative and complementary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2008.0414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19757977/,752
684947,,2021-06-01,"Chronic disease burden in Canada poses an imminent public health threat. The impact of respiratory disease in Canada alone is significant, affecting one in five and leading any other cause of repeat hospitalization in all age groups. Public health action is considered to be an important means of addressing these issues. Historical understanding of health has evolved to support the adoption of paradigms by professions that recognize the limitations of medical intervention in addressing the fundamental basis of disease when compared with the broader public health perspective. Several key historical events have shaped this understanding in the Canadian context including the Lalonde and Epp reports, and public health emergencies such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003. The profession of respiratory therapy has historically existed within a medicalized paradigm of practice; however, forces both internal and external to the profession are pressuring it to consider adopting broader social-and population-based approaches. As a rapidly evolving profession, there is a need to explore emerging areas of practice opportunities in the discipline. Investigating alternative knowledge and ideology can ensure that effective strategies for addressing the contemporary respiratory heath needs of Canadians are undertaken. The present article explores the rationale for a public health- and population-based approach to health in general, and its applicability to the respiratory therapist’s role in addressing respiratory health-related issues in Canada.","West, Andrew J",Can J Respir Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26078595/,752
