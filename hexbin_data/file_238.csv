783,Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis,2010-12-29,INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to demonstrate Interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions in comparison to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin and to study the change of expression after therapeutic interventions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 16 patients of different clinical subtypes of psoriasis. IL-18 gene expression analysis was performed using real-time quantitative PCR. Three biopsies were obtained from each patient. Two were taken from the lesional psoriatic skin and from uninvolved skin before starting treatment. A third lesional skin biopsy was taken at the end of two months' treatment course. The treatment was in the form of topical steroids or oral systemic methotrexate. RESULTS: Of all 16 studied patients significantly increased IL-18 expression was noted in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions before and after treatment when compared to keratinocytes from uninvolved skin (P = 0.001 and 0.002 respectively). The IL-18 expression in the skin lesions after treatment was significantly lower than lesional skin before treatment (P = 0.023). In psoriatic skin lesions of all studied patients IL-18 expression was significantly correlated with disease duration (r = 0.40 and P = 0.01) and clinical severity of psoriasis (r = 0.72 and P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased IL-18 expression in keratinocytes from psoriatic lesions of our patients and its correlation with disease duration and severity supported the concept which views psoriasis as a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. This could establish therapeutic and preventive approaches for psoriasis that ultimately lead to improved outcomes for patients.,"Mohamed Attia, Hanaa Rasmy; Mikhael, Nancy; Ismail, Somaia",Arch Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3302712/,238
4293,Cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide gene (CARTPT) polymorphism interacts with Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) to affect hypothalamic hormones and cardio-metabolic risk factors among obese individuals,2020-01-09,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies show that cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript prepropeptide (CARTPT) gene polymorphism modifies diet-obesity relationships. However, the interaction between CARTPT gene polymorphism and diet quality indices have not been investigated yet. The current study was aimed to evaluate the interaction between major dietary indices including Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and CARTPT gene rs2239670 variants among apparently healthy obese Iranians. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out by employing 288 apparently healthy obese adults aged 20–50 years with a BMI of 30–40 kg/m(2). Diet quality was evaluated by Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) using a 132-items semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire. The CARTPT gene rs2239670 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) technique. Blood concentrations of glycemic markers, lipid profile, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) were also measured. ANCOVA multivariate interaction model was used to analyze gene-diet interactions. RESULTS: The significant interactions were identified between CARTPT gene polymorphism and HEI, affecting BMR (P(Interaction) = 0.003), serum glucose (P(Interaction) = 0.009) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL concentrations (P(Interaction) = 0.03) after adjusting for the effects of sex and age. Also we found gene-diet interaction between CARTPT genotypes and DQI-I in terms of fat mass (FM; P(Interaction) = 0.02), waist circumference (WC; P(Interaction) < 0.001), body mass index (BMI; P(Interaction) < 0.001), basal metabolic rate (BMR, P(Interaction) < 0.001), serum fasting glucose (P(Interaction) < 0.01) and AgRP (P(Interaction) = 0.05) in individuals even after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Current study showed the effects of interaction between CARTPT genotype with adherence to HEI and DQI-I scores on obesity-related anthropometric and metabolic risk-factors.","Mahmoudi-Nezhad, Mahsa; Farhangi, Mahdieh Abbasalizad; Kahroba, Houman",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6953221/,238
4374,Long-term feeding issue and its impact on the daily life of congenital diaphragmatic hernia survivors: results of the first patient-led survey,2019-11-06,"BACKGROUND: CDH UK is a registered charity governed by a volunteer committee and providing informal support to patients, families and healthcare workers affected directly or indirectly with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) internationally. This is the first patient-led survey undertaken by CDH UK aiming for highlighting the feeding problems and their impact on the daily life of CDH survivors. METHODS: Answers from CDH survivors were collected through an online questionnaire (SurveyMonkey(®)) undertaken by CDH UK. The questionnaire contained questions about their feeding problems and support they were receiving for it. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, 151 patients answered some parts of the survey and 102 patients completed the questionnaire. Overall, 116 (76.8%) responders reported suffering from any type of feeding issue. Gastric acid reflux (GER) and growth retardation were the commonest symptoms experienced by 97 (91.5%) and 72 (62.2%) responders, respectively. Only 18 (17.0%) responders have received any written information on feeding or details of patient/parent support. Eighty (75.5%) responders are satisfied with the level of support they are receiving, but 78 (76.4%) answered that the whole experience associated with the disease has been very or extremely stressful. CONCLUSIONS: CDH survivors frequently have various issues with feeding, which may not be adequately supported or discussed clinically. It is desirable to assist the patients to reliable resources of long-term support, including multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach.","Power, Beverley; Shibuya, Soichi; Lane, Brenda; Eaton, Simon; De Coppi, Paolo",Pediatr Surg Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6976546/,238
4527,Miller Fisher syndrome with bilateral vocal cord paralysis: a case report,2020-02-18,"BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization reports, billions of people around the world are at risk for malaria disease and it is important to consider the preventive strategies for protecting the people that are living in high risk areas. One of the main reasons of disease survival is diversity of vectors and parasites in different malaria regions that have their specific features, behaviour and biology. Therefore, specific regional strategies are necessary for successful control of malaria. One of the tools that needs to be developed for elimination and prevention of reintroduction of malaria is a vaccine that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMTs). VIMT is a broad concept that should be adjusted to the biological characteristics of the disease in each region. One type of VIMT is a vector-based vaccine that affects the sexual stage of Plasmodium life cycle. According to recent studies, the aminopeptidase N-1 of Anopheles gambiae (AgAPN-1) is as a potent vector-based VIMT with considerable inhibition activity against the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasite. METHODS: Systems for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3ʹ-RACE) and genome walking methods were used for sequence determination of apn-1 gene from Anopheles stephensi and distinct bioinformatics software were used for structural analysis. AsAPN-1 was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell line using the baculovirus expression system. Recombinant AsAPN-1 was purified under the hybrid condition and its biological activity was assayed. RESULTS: Asapn-1 gene and its coded protein from An. stephensi were characterized for the first time in this study. Subsequently, the structural features and immunological properties of its coded protein were evaluated by in silico approaches. Enzymatic activity of the recombinant AsAPN-1, which was expressed in Sf9 insect cell line, was equal to 6 unit/μl. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed that AsAPN-1 is very similar to its counterpart in An. gambiae. In silico evaluation and fundamental data which are necessary for its evaluation as a VIMT-based vaccine in the next steps were acquired in this study and those could be useful for research groups that study on malaria vaccine for countries that An. stephensi is the main malaria vector there.","Dadgar Pakdel, Javad; Zakeri, Sedigheh; Raz, Abbasali; Dinparast Djadid, Navid",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7029531/,238
4806,Quality of neonatal resuscitation in Ethiopia: implications for the survival of neonates,2020-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Infections with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) pose a serious threat to patients with dysregulated immunity such as in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), but such infections have rarely been comprehensively characterized. Here, we present a fatal case of HLH secondary to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection complicated by both anti-viral drug resistance and sepsis from multiple MDROs including pandrug-resistant superbug bacteria. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy, six-year-old boy presented with a 45-day history of fever prior to a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and hemorrhagic colitis, both associated with CMV. On hospital admission, the patient was found to be colonized with multiple, multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and carbapenamase-producing organisms (CPO). He eventually developed respiratory, urine and bloodstream infections with highly drug-resistant, including pandrug-resistant bacteria, which could not be controlled by antibiotic treatment. Antiviral therapy also failed to contain his CMV infection and the patient succumbed to overwhelming bacterial and viral infection. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the MDR bacteria and metagenomic analysis of his blood sample revealed an unusual accumulation of a wide range of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in a single patient, including antiviral resistance to ganciclovir, and resistance mechanisms to all currently available antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The case highlights both the risk of acquiring MDR superbugs and the severity of these infections in HLH patients.","Hasan, Mohammad Rubayet; Sundaram, Manu Somasundaram; Sundararaju, Sathyavathi; Tsui, Kin-Ming; Karim, Mohammed Yousuf; Roscoe, Diane; Imam, Omar; Janahi, Mohammad A.; Thomas, Eva; Dobson, Simon; Tan, Rusung; Tang, Patrick; Lopez, Andres Perez",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7083060/,238
6464,Anabolic androgenic steroid induced necrotising myopathy,2009-10-27,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a principle neutrophil chemoattractant and activator in humans. There is interest in developing novel pharmacological inhibitors of IL-8 gene expression as a means for modulating inflammation in disease states such as acute lung injury. Herein we determined the effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a green tea-derived polyphenol, on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-mediated expression of the IL-8 gene in A549 cells. EGCG inhibited TNF-α-mediated IL-8 gene expression in a dose response manner, as measured by ELISA and Northern blot analysis. This effect appears to primarily involve inhibition of IL-8 transcription because EGCG inhibited TNF-α-mediated activation of the IL-8 promoter in cells transiently transfected with an IL-8 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid. In addition, EGCG inhibited TNF-α-mediated activation of IκB kinase and subsequent activation of the IκBα/NF-κB pathway. We conclude that EGCG is a potent inhibitor of IL-8 gene expression in vitro. The proximal mechanism of this effect involves, in part, inhibition of IκB kinase activation.","Chen, Philip C.; Wheeler, Derek S.; Malhotra, Vivek; Odoms, Kelli; Denenberg, Alvin G.; Wong, Hector R.",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101574/,238
6503,Cushing’s syndrome complicated by multiple opportunistic infections,2014-04-09,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is characterized by loss of liver function without pre-existing chronic liver disease. Drug toxicity and viral hepatitis have been identified as the main causes of ALF in Germany. The regeneration capability of the liver and overall prognosis are determined by the underlying etiology. Advances in intensive care medicine, supportive therapy, and transplantation surgery have improved the overall outcome of ALF over the last two decades. The clinical syndrome of ALF is mainly due to a release of inflammatory cytokines from necrotic hepatocytes, which lead to disastrous consequences in the immune system and hemodynamics. The main goals of supportive intensive care therapy in ALF are early identification and treatment of infections and the prevention and therapy of cerebral hypertension.","Koch , A.; Trautwein, C.",Intensivmed Notfallmed,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101637/,238
6509,Intestinal transplantation in children: current status,2016-03-31,"OBJECTIVE: To highlight the clinical presentations of influenza A (H1N1) infection, for early diagnosis and recognition by the pediatricians. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the medical records of inpatients with influenza A (H1N1) infection between November 1, 2009 and May 31, 2011were reviewed. RESULTS: Eighty pediatric in-patients with median age 41.9 mo were studied. ARDS (11/80), pneumothorax (8/80), pleural effusion (7/80) and encephalopathy (7/80) were the most frequent complications. Six of 11 ARDS patients died;all of them were under 5 y. The median days of viral shedding was 11.4 d. Slight increase of Il-6, Il-10 and TNF-γ were revealed in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: During late stage of pandemic wave, the majority of patients were young children. Children with severe Influenza A (H1N1) are prone to develop complications, and die from ARDS. If influenza-like illness is accompanied by neurologic signs, influenza A (H1N1) virus infection should be considered.

6723,A randomized study of imipenem compared to cefotaxime plus piperacillin as initial therapy of infections in granulocytopenic patients,1995,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, water-salt balance and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the physiologically active mediator and mediates the main pathophysiological actions in RAS. Ang II exerts the effects by activating its receptors, primarily type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R). Most of the known pathophysiological effects of Ang II are mediated by AT1R activation. The precise physiological function of AT2R is still not clear. Generally, AT2R is considered to oppose the effects of AT1R. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein scavenger receptor-1 (LOX-1) is one of the major receptors responsible for binding, internalizing and degrading ox-LDL. The activation of LOX-1 has been known to be related to many pathophysiological events, including endothelial dysfunction and injury, fibroblast growth, and vascular smooth muscle cell hypertrophy. Many of these alterations are present in atherosclerosis, hypertension, and myocardial ischemia and remodeling. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of a cross-talk between LOX-1 and Ang II receptors. Their interplays are embodied in the reciprocal regulation of their expression and activity. Their interplays are involved in a series of signals. Recent studies suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important signals responsible for their cross-talk. This paper reviews these aspects of dyslipidemia and RAS activation.","Wang, Xianwei; Phillips, M.

10865,Association between risk factors of metabolic syndrome with lung function,2019-08-19,"Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide and causes approximately 280,000 deaths per year. Inside the definitive host, eggs released by Schistosoma mansoni lodge in the intestine and especially in the liver where they induce a granulomatous inflammatory process, which can lead to fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms initiating or promoting hepatic granuloma formation remain poorly understood. Inflammasome activation has been described as an important pathway to induce pathology mediated by NLRP3 receptor. Recently, other components of the inflammasome pathway, such as NLRP6, have been related to liver diseases and fibrotic processes. Nevertheless, the contribution of these components in schistosomiasis-associated pathology is still unknown. In the present study, using dendritic cells, we demonstrated that NLRP6 sensor is important for IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation in response to soluble egg antigens (SEA). Furthermore, the lack of NLRP6 has been shown to significantly reduce periovular inflammation, collagen deposition in hepatic granulomas and mRNA levels of α-SMA and IL-13. Livers of Nlrp6(–/–) mice showed reduced levels of CXCL1/KC, CCL2, CCL3, IL-5, and IL-10 as well as Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Eosinophilic Peroxidase (EPO) enzymatic activity. Consistently, the frequency of macrophage and neutrophil populations were lower in the liver of NLRP6 knockout mice, after 6 weeks of infection. Finally, it was further demonstrated that the onset of hepatic granuloma and collagen deposition were also compromised in Caspase-1(–/–), IL-1R(–/–) and Gsdmd(–/–) mice. Our findings suggest that the NLRP6 inflammasome is an important component for schistosomiasis-associated pathology.","Sanches, Rodrigo C.

11246,Tracheoesophageal fistula in the developing world: are we ready for thoracoscopic repair?,2020-03-26,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death attributed to a single infectious organism. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), the standard vaccine against M. tuberculosis, is thought to prevent only 5% of all vaccine-preventable deaths due to tuberculosis, thus an alternative vaccine is required. One of the principal barriers to vaccine development against M. tuberculosis is the complexity of the immune response to infection, with uncertainty as to what constitutes an immunological correlate of protection. In this paper, we seek to give an overview of the immunology of M. tuberculosis infection, and by doing so, investigate possible targets of vaccine development. This encompasses the innate, adaptive, mucosal and humoral immune systems. Though MVA85A did not improve protection compared with BCG alone in a large-scale clinical trial, the correlates of protection this has revealed, in addition to promising results from candidate such as VPM1002, M72/ASO1E and H56:IC31 point to a brighter future in the field of TB vaccine development.","Brazier, Benedict; McShane, Helen",Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223498/,238
12054,The JNK pathway represents a novel target in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis through the suppression of MMP-3,2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND: To compare online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy (PS) with respect to dose to the organs at risk (OAR) for rectal cancer. METHODS: The first 20 patients treated with PS between May–September 2016 were included. This resulted in 10 short (SCRT) and 10 long (LCRT) course radiotherapy treatment schedules with a total of 300 Conebeam CT scans (CBCT). New dual arc VMAT plans were generated using auto-planning for both the online ART and PS strategy. For each fraction bowel bag, bladder and mesorectum were delineated on daily Conebeam CTs. The dose distribution planned was used to calculate daily DVHs. Coverage of the CTV was calculated, as defined by the dose received by 99% of the CTV volume (D99%). The volume of normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed fraction dose was calculated by calculating the volume receiving 95% of the prescribed fraction or more dose minus the volume of the CTV. For each fraction the difference between the plan selection and online adaptive strategy of each DVH parameter was calculated, as well as the average difference per patient. RESULTS: Target coverage remained the same for online ART. The median volume of the normal tissue irradiated with 95% of the prescribed dose dropped from 642 cm3 (PS) to 237 cm3 (online-ART)(p < 0.001). Online ART reduced dose to the OARs for all tested dose levels for SCRT and LCRT (p < 0.001). For V15Gy of the bowel bag the median difference over all fractions of all patients was − 126 cm(3) in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 206 cm(3) to − 40 cm(3). For SCRT the median difference was − 62 cm(3), while the range of the average difference per patient was − 105 cm3 to − 51 cm(3). For V15Gy of the bladder the median difference over all fractions of all patients was 26% in LCRT, while the average difference per patient ranged from − 34 to 12%. For SCRT the median difference of V95% was − 8%, while the range of the average difference per patient was − 29 to 0%. CONCLUSIONS: Online ART for rectal cancer reduces dose the OARs significantly compared to a clinically implemented plan selection strategy, without compromising target coverage.

13393,Patient General Condition at Diagnosis: A Systematic Evaluation for Adults Diagnosed with Hematologic Malignancies,2020-08-27,"Artemisia rupestris L. has long been used as a traditional herbal medicine owing to its immunomodulatory activity. Aqueous extracts of Artemisia rupestris L. (AEAR) contain the main functional component and can activate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance the adaptive immunity as the adjuvant against infections. To explore the underlying mechanism of immunomodulatory activities of AEAR, DCs were produced from bone-marrow cells of mice and the effects of AEAR on cell viability were assessed by the Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) method and annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays. Then, the effects of AEAR on the morphology, maturation, and function of DCs were detected using a microscope, flow cytometry-based surface receptor characterization, and endocytosis assays. The secretion levels of cytokines were then analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The activation state of DCs was evaluated by the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The activity of MAPKs and NF-κB pathways, which were involved in the regulation of AEAR on DCs, was further detected by Western blot. AEAR did not have a cytotoxic effect on DCs or mouse splenocytes. AEAR remarkably enhanced the phenotypic maturation of DCs and promoted the expression of costimulatory molecules and the secretion of cytokines in DCs. AEAR also significantly decreased the phagocytic ability of DCs and augmented the abilities of DCs to present antigens and stimulate allogeneic T-cell proliferation. Simultaneously, AEAR potently activated toll-like receptor (TLR)4-/TLR2-related MAPKs and induced the degradation of IκB and the translocation of NF-κB. In short, AEAR can profoundly enhance the immune-modulating activities of DCs via TLR4-/TLR2-mediated activation of MAPKs and NF-κB signaling pathways and is a promising candidate immunopotentiator for vaccines.","Yang, Yu; Wang, DanYang; Li, QuanXiao; He, Jiang; Wang, Bin; Li, Jinyao; Zhang, Ailian",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7565461/,238

A Re-Examination of the Royal Free Epidemic of 1955,2020-12-26,"Increasing microbial resistance, coupled with a lack of new antimicrobial discovery, has led researchers to refocus on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as novel therapeutic candidates. Significantly, the less toxic cecropins have gained widespread attention for potential antibacterial agent development. However, the narrow activity spectrum and long sequence remain the primary limitations of this approach. In this study, we truncated and modified cecropin 4 (41 amino acids) by varying the charge and hydrophobicity balance to obtain smaller AMPs. The derivative peptide C18 (16 amino acids) demonstrated high antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as yeasts. Moreover, C18 demonstrated a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 µg/mL against the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and showed synergy with daptomycin with a fractional inhibition concentration index (FICI) value of 0.313. Similar to traditional cecropins, C18 altered the membrane potential, increased fluidity, and caused membrane breakage at 32 µg/mL. Importantly, C18 eliminated 99% persisters at 10 × MIC within 20 min and reduced the biofilm adherence by ~40% and 35% at 32 and 16 µg/mL. Besides, C18 possessed a strong binding ability with DNA at 7.8 μM and down-regulated the expression of virulence factor genes like agrA, fnb-A, and clf-1 by more than 5-fold (p < 0.05). Interestingly, in the Galleria mellonella model, C18 rescued more than 80% of larva infected with the MRSA throughout 120-h post-infection at a single dose of 8 mg/kg (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study provides a reference for the transformation of cecropin to derive small peptides and presents C18 as an attractive therapeutic candidate to be developed to treat severe MRSA infections.","Peng, Jian; Mishra, Biswajit; Khader, Rajamohammed; Felix, LewisOscar; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824259/,238

15173,Thyroid Disrupting Effects of Old and New Generation PFAS,2021-01-19,"BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common hospital-acquired infection (HAI) in intensive care units (ICUs). Ventilator-associated event (VAE), a more objective definition, has replaced traditional VAP surveillance and is now widely used in the USA. However, the adoption outside the USA is limited. This study aims to describe the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of VAEs in China, based on a prospectively maintained registry. METHODS: An observational study was conducted using an ICU-HAI registry in west China. Patients that were admitted to ICUs and underwent mechanical ventilation (MV) between April 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, were included. The characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients with and without VAEs. The rates of all VAEs dependent on different ICUs were calculated, and the pathogen distribution of patients with possible VAP (PVAP) was described. RESULTS: A total of 20,769 ICU patients received MV, accounting for 21,723 episodes of mechanical ventilators and 112,697 ventilator-days. In all, we identified 1882 episodes of ventilator-associated condition (VAC) events (16.7 per 1000 ventilator-days), 721 episodes of infection-related ventilator-associated complications (IVAC) events (6.4 per 1000 ventilator-days), and 185 episodes of PVAP events (1.64 per 1000 ventilator-days). The rates of VAC varied across ICUs with the highest incidence in surgical ICUs (23.72 per 1000 ventilator-days). The median time from the start of ventilation to the onset of the first VAC, IVAC, and PVAP was 5 (3–8), 5 (3–9), and 6 (4–13) days, respectively. The median length of hospital stays was 28.00 (17.00–43.00), 30.00 (19.00–44.00), and 30.00 (21.00–46.00) days for the three VAE tiers, which were all longer than that of patients without VAEs (16.00 [12.00–23.00]). The hospital mortality among patients with VAEs was more than three times of those with non-VAEs. CONCLUSIONS: VAE was common in ICU patients with ≥ 4 ventilator days. All tiers of VAEs were highly correlated with poor clinical outcomes, including longer ICU and hospital stays and increased risk of mortality.

Increased evidence suggests that cancer metabolism not only plays a crucial role in cancer signaling for sustaining tumorigenesis and survival, but also has wider implications in the regulation of antitumor immune response through both the release of metabolites and affecting the expression of immune molecules, such as lactate, PGE(2), arginine, etc. Actually, this energetic interplay between tumor and immune cells leads to metabolic competition in the tumor ecosystem, limiting nutrient availability and leading to microenvironmental acidosis, which hinders immune cell function. More interestingly, metabolic reprogramming is also indispensable in the process of maintaining self and body homeostasis by various types of immune cells. At present, more and more studies pointed out that immune cell would undergo metabolic reprogramming during the process of proliferation, differentiation, and execution of effector functions, which is essential to the immune response. Herein, we discuss how metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells and immune cells regulate antitumor immune response and the possible approaches to targeting metabolic pathways in the context of anticancer immunotherapy. We also describe hypothetical combination treatments between immunotherapy and metabolic intervening that could be used to better unleash the potential of anticancer therapies.","Xia, Longzheng; Oyang, Linda; Lin, Jinguan; Tan, Shiming; Han, Yaqian; Wu, Nayiyuan; Yi, Pin; Tang, Lu; Pan, Qing; Rao, Shan; Liang, Jiaxin; Tang, Yanyan; Su, Min; Luo, Xia; Yang, Yiqing; Shi, Yingrui; Wang, Hui; Zhou, Yujuan; Liao, Qianjin",Mol Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7863491/,238

Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a novel accelerated form of stimulation, which more closely mimics the brain’s natural firing patterns and may have greater effects on cognitive performance. We report here the comparative assessment of the effect of conventional high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) protocols and TBS protocols on cognition enhancement in healthy controls. Sixty healthy adults (34 males and 26 females) were randomized and counterbalanced and assigned to HF-rTMS (n = 20), TBS (n = 20), or sham (n = 20) groups. The promotion effects of different parameters of prefrontal stimulation on working memory and executive function were compared, as assessed by performance in N-back tasks and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Both HF-rTMS and intermittent TBS (iTBS) groups displayed a significant improvement in N-back tasks, with an effect size of 0.79 and 1.50, respectively. Furthermore, the iTBS group displayed a significant improvement in the WCST, with an effect size of 0.84. The iTBS group demonstrated higher effect sizes than the HF-rTMS group (t = 2.68, p = 0.011), with an effect size of 0.85. However, no improvement in other tasks was observed (p > 0.05). Intermittent TBS has a stronger cognitive promoting effect than conventional rTMS. In summary, our findings provide direct evidence that iTBS may be a superior protocol for cognitive promotion.","Wu, Xingqi; Wang, Lu; Geng, Zhi; Wei, Ling; Yan, Yibing; Xie, Chengjuan; Chen, Xingui; Ji, Gong-Jun; Tian, Yanghua; Wang, Kai",eNeuro,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901150/,238

However, the liposome–erythrocyte interaction during the intravenous administration of liposomal drug formulations may result in changes within the red blood cells (RBCs). In this study, it was shown that phosphatidylcholine-composed liposomal formulations of Photolon, used as a drug model, significantly influences the transmembrane potential, stiffness, as well as the shape of RBCs. These changes caused decreasing the number of stomatocytes and irregular shapes proportion within the cells exposed to liposomes. Thus, the reduction of anisocytosis was observed. Therefore, some nanodrugs in phosphatidylcholine liposomal formulation may have a beneficial effect on the survival time of erythrocytes.","Cyboran-Mikołajczyk, Sylwia; Sareło, Przemysław; Pasławski, Robert; Pasławska, Urszula; Przybyło, Magdalena; Nowak, Kacper; Płóciennik, Michał; Podbielska, Halina; Kopaczyńska, Marta; Wawrzyńska, Magdalena",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7914935/,238
15797,Effect of First Long-Term Training on Whole Blood Count and Blood Clotting Parameters in Thoroughbreds,2021-02-09,"(1) Background: Renal cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in Western countries, with an unpredictable clinical outcome, partly due to its high heterogeneity and the scarcity of reliable biomarkers of tumour progression. (Pro)renin receptor (PRR) is a novel receptor of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) that has been associated with the development and progression of some solid tumours by RAS-dependent and -independent mechanisms. (2) Methods: In this study, we analysed the immunohistochemical expression of PRR at the centre and border in a series of 83 clear-cell renal cell (CCRCCs), 19 papillary (PRCC) and 7 chromophobe (ChRCC) renal cell carcinomas, and the benign tumour renal oncocytoma (RO, n = 11). (3) Results: PRR is expressed in all the tumour subtypes, with higher mean staining intensity in ChRCCs and ROs. A high expression of PRR at the tumour centre and at the infiltrative front of CCRCC tissues is significantly associated with high grade, tumour diameter, local invasion and stage, and with high mortality risk by UCLA integrated staging system (UISS) scale. (4) Conclusions: These findings indicate that PRR is associated with the development and progression of renal tumours. Its potential as a novel biomarker for RCC diagnosis/prognosis and as a promising therapeutic target should be taken into account in the future.","Solano-Iturri, Jon Danel; Echevarría, Enrique; Unda, Miguel; Loizaga-Iriarte, Ana; Pérez-Fernández, Amparo; Angulo, Javier C.; López, José I.; Larrinaga, Gorka",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916453/,238
16127,Dermatological Considerations in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Marginal Zone Lymphomas,2021-03-08,"BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stem cell–derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) promote angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium. This study examines the difference in vascular density, myocardial perfusion, molecular signaling, and gene expression between normal diet (ND) and high fat diet (HFD) groups at baseline and following intramyocardial injection of EVs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intact male Yorkshire swine fed either an ND (n=17) or HFD (n=14) underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left circumflex coronary artery. Subsequently, animals received either intramyocardial injection of vehicle‐saline as controls; (ND‐controls n=7, HFD‐controls, n=6) or EVs; (ND‐EVs n=10, HFD‐EVs n=8) into the ischemic territory. Five weeks later, myocardial function, perfusion, vascular density, cell signaling, and gene expression were examined. EVs improved indices of myocardial contractile function, myocardial perfusion, and arteriogenesis in both dietary cohorts. Interestingly, quantification of alpha smooth muscle actin demonstrated higher basal arteriolar density in HFD swine compared with their ND counterparts; whereas EVs were associated with increased CD31‐labeled endothelial cell density only in the ND tissue, which approached significance. Levels of total endothelial nitric oxide synthase, FOXO1 (forkhead box protein O1) , transforming growth factor‐β, phosphorylated VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2), and phosphorylated MAPK ERK1/ERK2 (mitogen‐activated protein kinase) were higher in ischemic myocardial lysates from ND‐controls compared with HFD‐controls. Conversely, HFD‐control tissue showed increased expression of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated FOXO1, VEGFR2, and MAPK ERK1/ERK2 with respect to ND‐controls. Preliminary gene expression studies indicate differential modulation of transcriptional activity by EVs between the 2 dietary cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: HFD produces a profound metabolic disorder that dysregulates the molecular mechanisms of collateral vessel formation in the ischemic myocardium, which may hinder the therapeutic angiogenic effects of EVs.","Aboulgheit, Ahmed; Potz, Brittany A.; Scrimgeour, Laura A.; Karbasiafshar, Catherine; Shi, Guangbin; Zhang, Zhiqi; Machan, Jason T.; Schorl, Christoph; Brodsky, Alexander S.; Braga, Karla; Pfeiffer, Melissa; Gao, May; Cummings, Olivia; Sodha, Neel R.; Abid, M.

17202,Thyroid Eye Disease: Navigating the New Treatment Landscape,2021-03-17,"High-quality and complete reference genome assemblies are fundamental for the application of genomics to biology, disease, and biodiversity conservation. However, such assemblies are available for only a few non-microbial species(1–4). To address this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium(5,6) has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal biological discoveries. These include the identification of many false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their regulatory regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a new era of discovery across the life sciences.","Rhie, Arang; McCarthy, Shane A.; Fedrigo, Olivier; Damas, Joana; Formenti, Giulio; Koren, Sergey; Uliano-Silva, Marcela; Chow, William; Fungtammasan, Arkarachai; Kim, Juwan; Lee, Chul; Ko, Byung June; Chaisson, Mark; Gedman, Gregory L.; Cantin, Lindsey J.; Thibaud-Nissen, Francoise; Haggerty, Leanne; Bista, Iliana; Smith, Michelle; Haase, Bettina; Mountcastle, Jacquelyn; Winkler, Sylke; Paez, Sadye; Howard, Jason; Vernes, Sonja C.; Lama, Tanya M.; Grutzner, Frank; Warren, Wesley C.; Balakrishnan, Christopher N.; Burt, Dave; George, Julia M.; Biegler, Matthew T.; Iorns, David; Digby, Andrew; Eason, Daryl; Robertson, Bruce; Edwards, Taylor; Wilkinson, Mark; Turner, George; Meyer, Axel; Kautt, Andreas F.; Franchini, Paolo; Detrich, H.

18455,Utility of Nebulized Magnesium Sulfate Therapy for Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of Newborn,2021-06-23,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by phenotypic heterogeneity. We investigated the molecular basis of the cardiac phenotype in two mouse models at established disease stage (mouse-HCM), and human myectomy tissue (human-HCM). We analyzed the transcriptome in 2 mouse models with non-obstructive HCM (R403Q-MyHC, R92W-TnT)/littermate-control hearts at 24 weeks of age, and in myectomy tissue of patients with obstructive HCM/control hearts (GSE36961, GSE36946). Additionally, we examined myocyte redox, cardiac mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), mt-respiration, mt-ROS generation/scavenging and mt-Ca(2+) handling in mice. We identified distinct allele-specific gene expression in mouse-HCM, and marked differences between mouse-HCM and human-HCM. Only two genes (CASQ1, GPT1) were similarly dysregulated in both mutant mice and human-HCM. No signaling pathway or transcription factor was predicted to be similarly dysregulated (by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) in both mutant mice and human-HCM. Losartan was a predicted therapy only in TnT-mutant mice. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment for several metabolic pathways, but only pyruvate metabolism was enriched in both mutant mice and human-HCM. Both mutant mouse myocytes demonstrated evidence of an oxidized redox environment. Mitochondrial complex I RCR was lower in both mutant mice compared to controls. MyHC-mutant mice had similar mtDNA-CN and mt-Ca(2+) handling, but TnT-mutant mice exhibited lower mtDNA-CN and impaired mt-Ca(2+) handling, compared to littermate-controls. Molecular profiling reveals differences in gene expression, transcriptional regulation, intracellular signaling and mt-number/function in 2 mouse models at established disease stage. Further studies are needed to confirm differences in gene expression between mouse and human-HCM, and to examine whether cardiac phenotype, genotype and/or species differences underlie the divergence in molecular profiles.","Vakrou, Styliani; Liu, Yamin; Zhu, Li; Greenland, Gabriela V.; Simsek, Bahadir; Hebl, Virginia B.; Guan, Yufan; Woldemichael, Kirubel; Talbot, Conover C.; Aon, Miguel A.; Fukunaga, Ryuya; Abraham, M.

19028,The patients’ perspective on the burden of idiopathic intracranial hypertension,2021-07-08,"Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a debilitating disease with major social and economic impacts. It frequently affects relatively young adults and has a predilection for rapid progression to femoral head collapse and end-stage hip arthritis. If not diagnosed and treated properly in the early stages, ONFH has devastating consequences and leads to mandatory total hip arthroplasty. The pathophysiology of non-traumatic ONFH is very complex and not fully understood. While multiple risk factors have been associated with secondary ONFH, there are still many cases in which a clear etiology cannot be established. Recognition of the prothrombotic state as part of the etiopathogeny of primary ONFH provides an opportunity for early medical intervention, with implications for both prophylaxis and therapy aimed at slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Hereditary thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis are associated with thrombotic occlusion of bone vessels. Anticoagulant treatment can change the natural course of the disease and improve patients’ quality of life. The present work focused on highlighting the association between hereditary thrombophilia/hypofibrinolysis states and ONFH, emphasizing the importance of identifying this condition. We have also provided strong arguments to support the efficiency and safety of anticoagulant treatment in the early stages of the disease, encouraging etiological diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention. In the era of direct oral anticoagulants, new therapeutic options have become available, enabling better long-term compliance.","Rezus, Elena; Tamba, Bogdan Ionel; Badescu, Minerva Codruta; Popescu, Diana; Bratoiu, Ioana; Rezus, Ciprian",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268880/,238

The Answer through a Review of the Best Available Current Evidence,2021-09-02,"The discharge of untreated hospital and domestic wastewater into receiving water bodies is still a prevalent practice in developing countries. Unfortunately, because of an ever-increasing population of people who are perennially under medication, these wastewaters contain residues of antibiotics and other antimicrobials as well as microbial shedding, the direct and indirect effects of which include the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and an increase in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that pose a threat to public and environmental health. This study assessed the taxonomic and functional profiles of bacterial communities, as well as the antibiotic concentrations in untreated domestic wastewater (DWW) and hospital wastewater (HWW), using high-throughput sequencing analysis and solid-phase extraction coupled to Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) analysis, respectively. The physicochemical qualities of both wastewater systems were also determined. The mean concentration of antibiotics and the concentrations of Cl(−), F(−) and PO(4)(3) were higher in HWW samples than in DWW samples. The phylum Firmicutes was dominant in DWW with a sequence coverage of 59.61% while Proteobacteria was dominant in HWW samples with a sequence coverage of 86.32%. At genus level, the genus Exiguobacterium (20.65%) and Roseomonas (67.41%) were predominant in DWW and HWW samples, respectively. Several pathogenic or opportunistic bacterial genera were detected in HWW (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas and Vibrio) and DWW (Clostridium, Klebsiella, Corynebacterium, Bordetella, Staphylocccus and Rhodococcus) samples. Functional prediction analysis indicated the presence of beta-lactam resistance, cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance and vancomycin resistance genes in HWW samples. The presence of these antibiotic resistance genes and cassettes were positively correlated with the presence of pathogens. These findings show the risk posed to public and environmental health by the discharge of untreated domestic and hospital wastewaters into environmental water bodies.","Selvarajan, Ramganesh; Sibanda, Timothy; Pandian, Jeevan; Mearns, Kevin",Antibiotics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470611/,238

A variety of molecular therapies have been developed, comprising vectors encoding micro- and minidystrophins as well as utrophin, a protein with partially overlapping functions. With the advent of the CRISPR-Cas9-nuclease, genome editing offers a novel option of correction of the disease-cuasing mutations. Full restoration of the healthy gene by homology directed repair is a rare event. However, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) may restore the reading frame by causing exon excision.

He was advised that the test (HIV serology) was positive and he requested a repeat test (anonymously) 1 month later, which was also reported as being positive. About 2 years later, he was assessed by a general practitioner for symptoms of depression and continued medical care. At that time, investigations revealed a CD4 T-cell count of about 700 cells/uL. Sometime in 1996 a repeat blood test revealed a CD4 cell count just <500 cells/uL. No consultation to an infectious diseases specialist or HIV clinic was made. The GP(general practitioner) then initiated a regimen consisting of didanosine, lamivudine, and saquinavir for HIV infection.

They are vitally important in life cycle and have become a main target for drug design. This Chapter is focused on a special protease that plays a key role in replicating SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) coronavirus, the culprit of SARS disease. The progresses reported here are mainly from various computational approaches, such as structural bioinformatics, pharmacophore modelling, molecular docking, and peptide-cleavage site prediction, among others. It is highlighted that the compounds C(28)H(34)O(4)N(7)Cl, C(21)H(36)O(5)N(6) and C(21)H(36)O(5)N(6), as well as KZ7088, a derivative of AG7088, might be the promising candidates for further investigation, and that the octapeptides ATLQAIAS and ATLQAENV, as well as AVLQSGFR, might be converted to effective inhibitors against the SARS protease. Meanwhile, how to modify these octapeptides based on the “distorted key” theory to make them become potent inhibitors is explicitly elucidated. Also, a brief introduction is given for how to use computer-generated graphs to rapidly diagnose SARS coronavirus. Finally, a step-by-step protocol guide is given on how to use ProtIdent, a web-server developed recently, to identify the proteases and their types based on their sequence information alone. ProtIdent is a very user-friendly bioin-formatics tool that can provide desired information for both basic research and drug discovery in a timely manner.

Maintaining uninterrupted supply chain flows is a prerequisite for the success of a supply chain in the marketplace. But there are always associated risks in each of these flows which require suitable strategies to mitigate them. The issue of risks in supply chains has assumed importance in wake of the understanding that supply chain failures are fatal to the existence of all the partners’ in a supply chain. The severity of supply chain failures are more felt by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who form the majority at tier II and tier III levels of a supply chain. This is because of the limited resources and lack of adequate planning to counter supply chain risks. Management of risk in supply chains is a multi-criteria decision making problem. The research presented in this chapter proposes a Fuzzy-AHP based framework to prioritize various risks in supply chains. An exhaustive literature review complimented with the experts’ opinion was undertaken from the perspective of SMEs to formulate a hierarchical structure of risks in supply chains. A fuzzy analytic hierarchical process (F-AHP) is then utilized to ascertain the relative weightings which are subsequently used to prioritize these risks. Understanding the priorities would help the firms to accord importance and develop suitable strategies to manage supply chain risks according to their relative importance. This provides effective management of scarce resources available to SMEs to manage risks resident in their supply chains.","Faisal, Mohd.

In particular, the management of both infectious and noninfectious organ complications has changed dramatically, with improved sensitivity for diagnostic testing for pathogens and tremendous improvements in our understanding of organ complications. Two organ complications in particular, pulmonary and hepatic, have been a major focus of investigation over the past several decades. The introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors for the management of acute, noninfectious lung injury and the introduction of an endothelial stabilizing agent (defibrotide) for the management of hepatic veno-occlusive disease have been major advances in the past decade.","Yanik, Gregory A.; Cooke, Kenneth R.; Ho, Vincent T.; Richardson, Paul G.",Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Children with Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123560/,238

To this end, the fashion designers are required to come up with a wide and diverse amount of fashion products in a short time frame. At the same time, the fashion retailers are oriented towards using technology, in order to design and provide products tailored to their consumers’ needs, in sync with the newest fashion trends. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence system which operates as a personal assistant to a fashion product designer. The system’s architecture and all its components are presented, with emphasis on the data collection and data clustering subsystems. In our use case scenario, datasets of garment products are retrieved from two different sources and are transformed into a specific format by making use of Natural Language Processes. The two datasets are clustered separately using different mixed-type clustering algorithms and comparative results are provided, highlighting the usefulness of the clustering procedure in the clothing product recommendation problem.","Kotouza, Maria Th.; Tsarouchis, Sotirios–Filippos; Kyprianidis, Alexandros-Charalampos; Chrysopoulos, Antonios C.; Mitkas, Pericles A.",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256565/,238

41740,EP04 Is this scleroderma lung or COVID-19 lung?,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND: The quality of healthcare in Israel is considered “high”, and this achievement is due to the structure and organization of the healthcare system. The goal of the present review is to describe the major achievements and challenges of quality improvement in the Israeli healthcare system. BODY: In recent years, the Ministry of Health has made major strides in increasing the public’s access to comparative data on quality, finances and patient satisfaction. Several mechanisms at multiple levels help promote quality improvement and patient safety. These include legislation, financial incentives, and national programs for quality indicators, patient experience, patient safety, prevention and control of infection and accreditation. Over the years, improvements in quality indicators, infection prevention and patient satisfaction can be demonstrated, but other fields show little change, if at all. Challenges and barriers include reluctance by unions, inconsistent and unreliable flow of information, the fear of overpressure by management and the loss of autonomy by physicians, and doubts regarding “gaming” of data. Accreditation has its own challenges, such as the need to adjust it to local characteristics of the healthcare system, its high cost, and the limited evidence of its impact on quality. Lack of interest by leaders, lack of resources, burnout and compassion fatigue, are listed as challenges for improving patient experience. CONCLUSION: Substantial efforts are being made in Israel to improve quality of care, based on the use of good data to understand what is working and what needs particular attention. Government and health care providers have the tools to continue to improve. However, several mechanisms for improving the quality of care, such as minimizing healthcare disparities, training for quality, and widespread implementation of the “choosing wisely” initiative, should be implemented more intensively and effectively.","Dreiher, Dalia; Blagorazumnaya, Olga; Balicer, Ran; Dreiher, Jacob",Isr J Health Policy Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7642577/,238
42136,German guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of neurosyphilis,2020-11-17,"ABSTRACT: Individuals born extremely preterm are at significant risk for impaired neurodevelopment. After discharge from the neonatal intensive care, associations between the child’s well-being and factors in the home and social environment become increasingly apparent. Mothers’ prenatal health and socioeconomic status are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, and emotional and behavioral problems. Research on early life risk factors and on mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in neurodevelopment later in life can inform the design of personalized approaches to prevention. Here, we review early life predictors of inter-individual differences in later life neurodevelopment among those born extremely preterm. Among biological mechanisms that mediate relationships between early life predictors and later neurodevelopmental outcomes, we highlight evidence for disrupted placental processes and regulated at least in part via epigenetic mechanisms, as well as perinatal inflammation. In relation to these mechanisms, we focus on four prenatal antecedents of impaired neurodevelopment, namely, (1) fetal growth restriction, (2) maternal obesity, (3) placental microorganisms, and (4) socioeconomic adversity. In the future, this knowledge may inform efforts to detect and prevent adverse outcomes in infants born extremely preterm. IMPACT: This review highlights early life risk factors and mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in neurodevelopment later in life. The review emphasizes research on early life risk factors (fetal growth restriction, maternal obesity, placental microorganisms, and socioeconomic adversity) and on mechanisms (disrupted placental processes and perinatal inflammation) underlying inter-individual differences in neurodevelopment later in life. The findings highlighted here may inform efforts to detect and prevent adverse outcomes in infants born extremely preterm.","Bangma, Jacqueline T.; Hartwell, Hadley; Santos, Hudson P.; O’Shea, T.

Gold nanoparticles (GNP) of average size 12 nm were synthesized by citrate reduction method followed by functionalization with cysteamine hydrochloride for nano-conjugation. Immune response of nano-conjugates of GNP with 26 kDa protein (368-606 amino acids) and 54 kDa protein (112-606 amino acids) were evaluated. In vitro release kinetics of GNP-conjugated 54 kDa (GNP54) and 26 kDa (GNP26) proteins showed slower rate of release of 54 kDa protein as compared to 26 kDa protein. Humoral immune response of mice immunized intramuscularly with GNP54, GNP26 and GNP alone, exhibited HEV-specific IgG titer of 7.9 ± 2.9, 5.686 ± 4.098 and 0.698 ± 0.089, respectively, after 14 days of booster immunization. In addition to this, HEV-specific cell-mediated immune response was demonstrated by splenocyte proliferation assay. Analysis of results using one-way ANOVA, showed statistically significant (p value < 0.05) increase in splenocyte proliferation for GNP54- and GNP26-immunized mice in comparison to GNP alone immunized mice. Stimulation index of HEV ORF2 proteins in GNP54/GNP26-immunized mice were comparable to Concanavalin A-treated positive control. These results indicate GNP-based vaccine as a promising candidate for efficiently mediating both humoral and cell-mediated immune response against HEV.","Rani, Dibya; Nayak, Baibaswata; Srivastava, Sudha",3 Biotech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799426/,238

Initially, the development of the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore had a slow start. The government stayed on top of the situation, handling a limited pool of imported and domestically transmitted cases with relative ease. The progression of the pandemic took a sudden turn for the worse in late March and early April 2020 when the highly infectious disease spread intensely among foreign migrant workers, a sizeable occupational group living in close proximity in purpose-built/factory-converted dormitories on the outskirt of Singapore or temporary quarters at construction sites.","Ji, Xianbai",The Reshaping of China-Southeast Asia Relations in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978834/,238

Animal models of infection with a number of these viruses have contributed to our knowledge of their pathogenesis and have been crucial for the development of therapeutics and vaccines that have been approved for human use. Most of these models use artificially high doses of virus, ensuring lethality in pre-clinical drug development studies. However, this can have a significant effect on the immune response generated. Here I discuss how the dose of antigen or pathogen is a critical determinant of immune responses and suggest that the current study of viruses in animal models should take this into account when developing and studying animal models of disease. This can have implications for determination of immune correlates of protection against disease as well as informing relevant vaccination and therapeutic strategies.","Warner, Bryce M.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7999429/,238

51616,Should cancer patients receiving ICIs received COVID-19 vaccination?,2021-04-17,"DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM: Staff and patients in institutions of organized health care experience and express a variety of adverse conditions of these organizations. Within a theoretical framework of institutional pathology we can explain some of these “miserable conditions” as effects of the activities of organizations belonging to the political system (health policy) and to the economic system (health economy). Clinical ethics committees (CECs) cannot effectively handle such adversities or even address them properly. Standard organizational ethics can address them but cannot handle them effectively. ARGUMENTS: I propose to strengthen organizational ethics by a theory of institutional pathology. Basic nosological distinctions such as disease, illness and sickness, whose primary reference is to biological organisms and persons, can be analogically extended to socially constituted entities (e.g. hospitals) in terms of functional deficiency, miserable conditions, and need for reform of such entities. A very promising focus for analysis are organizational disorders of responsibility allocation. This group of institutional pathological disorders engenders, amongst other kinds of miserable conditions, specifically morally relevant miserable conditions. CONCLUSION: The institutional pathology paradigm, oriented to concrete institutions and organizations, can help “clinical” organizational ethics to considerably expand, in theoretical ethics as well as in ethically guided practice e.g. for members of CECs and organizational ethics advisors, the capacities for observing, evaluating and, if necessary, amending disturbed relations of responsibility.","Kettner, Matthias",Ethik Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8040751/,238

Large international research collaboratives have successfully produced high quality COVID-related research. We aimed to investigate factors that influence trainee engagement in collaborative research and quantify engagement in our local area to propose methods to ensure all trainees have the opportunity to take part in impactful research. METHODS: This is a mixed methods study consisting of a survey to trainees regarding their experiences in research and an assessment of engagement in COVID-related research. The survey was circulated to undergraduates and trainees of all grades in February 2020. RESULTS: Engagement with the survey was poor, with a < 10% return rate. 43% of respondents stated that they had no experience of research. Engagement with collaborative research was popular, with responders declaring involvement with at least 7 other collaboratives. Reasons for participating in research were improving patient care (23%), producing high quality research (19%) and CV building (19%). Barriers included perceived lack of time (23%) and lack of knowledge about research (23%). The CASSH collaborative co-ordinated the local response to COVIDSurg, COVIDSurg|Cancer and the COVER study, involving 20 trainees contributing data on 368 patients. CONCLUSIONS: All research collaboratives rely on the enthusiasm of participants in order to succeed. We have presented some of the motivators and barriers to participation in our region and outlined how we have built on national projects to improve engagement on a local level. Further projects are planned to capitalise on this improved engagement.","Totty, J; Hitchman, L; Wilkins, A; Loubani, M; Totty, Joshua",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030130/,238

53070,P066 Telephone clinics: what are our patients saying?,2021-04-26,"Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a group of diseases characterized by a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which leads to right ventricular failure and premature death. There are multiple clinical manifestations that can be grouped into five different types. Pulmonary artery remodeling is a common feature in pulmonary hypertension (PH) characterized by endothelial dysfunction and smooth muscle pulmonary artery cell proliferation. The current treatments for PH are limited to vasodilatory agents that do not stop the progression of the disease. Therefore, there is a need for new agents that inhibit pulmonary artery remodeling targeting the main genetic, molecular, and cellular processes involved in PH. Chronic inflammation contributes to pulmonary artery remodeling and PH, among other vascular disorders, and many inflammatory mediators signal through the JAK/STAT pathway. Recent evidence indicates that the JAK/STAT pathway is overactivated in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PH of different types. In addition, different profibrotic cytokines such as IL-6, IL-13, and IL-11 and growth factors such as PDGF, VEGF, and TGFβ1 are activators of the JAK/STAT pathway and inducers of pulmonary remodeling, thus participating in the development of PH. The understanding of the participation and modulation of the JAK/STAT pathway in PH could be an attractive strategy for developing future treatments. There have been no studies to date focused on the JAK/STAT pathway and PH. In this review, we focus on the analysis of the expression and distribution of different JAK/STAT isoforms in the pulmonary arteries of patients with different types of PH. Furthermore, molecular canonical and noncanonical JAK/STAT pathway transactivation will be discussed in the context of vascular remodeling and PH. The consequences of JAK/STAT activation for endothelial cells and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells’ proliferation, migration, senescence, and transformation into mesenchymal/myofibroblast cells will be described and discussed, together with different promising drugs targeting the JAK/STAT pathway in vitro and in vivo.","Roger, Inés; Milara, Javier; Montero, Paula; Cortijo, Julio",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8124199/,238

The analysis shows that government support scheme reduces the number of SMEs with negative earnings to 49% and allows extending the residual life for SMEs with negative earnings to 194 days. In addition, the support scheme reduces the number of jobs at risk in our sample by around 20%. However, our results suggest that weaker firms benefit more than strong ones. Besides, industries that are worst hit by COVID-19 are not those that benefit most from the government support scheme.

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causality of the vitamin D—COVID-19 association. METHODS: We constructed a biologically plausible genetic instrument for serum vitamin D based on replicated genome-wide significant variants in genes related to vitamin D metabolism, and evaluated the validity of the genetic instrument in COVID-19 risk subgroups in the UK Biobank. We then performed two sample MR using publically available summary data for the association of the genetic instrument with serum vitamin D in the UK Biobank and with COVID-19 outcomes, including infection, severe respiratory infection, and hospitalization, in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We used the inverse-variance weighted MR method for all analyses. RESULTS: We found little to no evidence for an effect of genetically predicted serum vitamin D on susceptibility to or severity of COVID-19 infection. The odds ratio per standard deviation increase in genetically predicted serum vitamin D were: 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.18) for any COVID-19 infection vs. population controls, 1.05 (0.84–1.31) for hospitalized COVID-19 vs. population controls, 0.96 (0.64 to 1.43) for severe respiratory COVID-19 vs. population controls, 1.15 (0.99 to 1.35) for COVID-19 positive vs. COVID-19 negative and, 1.44 (0.75 to 2.78) for hospitalized COVID-19 vs. non-hospitalized COVID-19. Results were similar in analyses where the genetic instrument included all variants with genome-wide significant associations with serum vitamin D (i.e., including variants with no known relationship to vitamin D metabolism) and where the genetic instrument was for risk of vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that unconfounded, long-term differences in vitamin D status do not causally affect susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 infection. These findings are consistent with results of a recently published MR study and suggest that associations seen in observational studies may be driven by confounding. Future directions include extending this work to non-European ancestry populations and high-risk populations, for example persons with comorbid disease.

Diversification is key to creating an attractive, flourishing environment in a country and improving the quality of its institutions and its citizens’ lives. The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are accelerating their efforts to achieve economic diversification, with their national visions reflecting a shared aim of securing permanent high standards of living for future generations. After the first boom in oil prices in 1970, Saudi Arabia’s government introduced primary development plans to diversify its economy. In 2016, it announced its 2030 vision to establish sustainable growth through economic diversification. The economic diversification strategy of Saudi Arabia is founded on several pillars, including investment in human capital and education and investment in non-oil sectors such as tourism. This paper aims to analyze the economic diversification trends in the GCC region with a special focus on Saudi Arabia as a case study. Within this wider context, the paper will concentrate on Saudi Arabia’s efforts to achieve diversification by building a knowledge-based economy. Focusing on the quality of education and research improves the human capital available in the country which contributes to the growth of the economy. Results reveal that although Saudi Arabia has embarked on its diversification plans, the current status of oil prices, the deficit in the Saudi general budget, and the country’s traditional educational system will hinder and slow this process.","Al Naimi, Sarah Muhanna",Circ.Econ.Sust.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8397598/,238

Moreover, this paper uses mathematical statistics to group patients into groups, and the two groups of patients are comparable. After grouping, this paper conducts preexperiment processing and then conducts patient grooming through various basic tasks so that the test results have a certain degree of reliability. On this basis, this paper verifies the nursing intervention methods through controlled trials. Among them, the control group is treated with the hospital's conventional nursing methods and allowed patients to master self-nursing methods, while the test group is treated with 5Why-based nursing intervention on the basis of traditional nursing methods. Finally, this paper combines mathematical statistics to evaluate the effect of blood purification nursing. From the research results, it can be known that the 5Why-based nursing intervention method has certain effectiveness in blood purification nursing.","Cai, Ru; Fei, Yun; Li, XiaoPing; Xu, LinFang; Wu, Chun Lei; Wu, Na",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8487368/,238

The hypoglossal motor nucleus (HMN) innervates the tongue muscles but there is no pharmacological agent currently able to selectively manipulate a channel (e.g., Kir2.4) that is highly restricted in its expression to cranial motor pools such as the HMN. To model the effect of manipulating such a restricted target, we introduced a ""designer"" receptor into the HMN and selectively modulated it with a ""designer"" drug. We used cre-dependent viral vectors (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry) to transduce hypoglossal motoneurons of ChAT-Cre+ mice with hM3Dq (activating) receptors. We measured sleep and breathing in three conditions: (i) sham, (ii) after systemic administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 1 mg/kg) or (iii) vehicle. CNO activates hM3Dq receptors but is otherwise biologically inert. Systemic administration of CNO caused significant and sustained increases in tongue muscle activity in non-REM (261 ± 33% for 10 hrs) and REM sleep (217 ± 21% for 8 hrs), both P < 0.01 versus controls. Responses were specific and selective for the tongue with no effects on diaphragm or postural muscle activities, or sleep-wake states. These results support targeting a selective and restricted ""druggable"" target at the HMN (e.g., Kir2.4) to activate tongue motor activity during sleep.","Horton, Garret A; Fraigne, Jimmy J; Torontali, Zoltan A; Snow, Matthew B; Lapierre, Jennifer L; Liu, Hattie; Montandon, Gaspard; Peever, John H; Horner, Richard L",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep45860; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28383527/,238

The aim of this study was to investigate differences in exposures, demographics, and comorbidities between regressing and non-regressing patients. METHODS AND PROCEDURES We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from a cohort of BE patients participating in a single-center study comprised of all patients diagnosed with BE over a 10-year period. We collected information from the patient's electronic medical records regarding demographic data, endoscopic findings, histological findings, exposures, and history of antireflux surgery. RESULTS This study included 1,342 BE patients, 505 (37.6%) of which experienced regression. The regressed group was 52.3% male, while the non-regressing group was 68.3% male (p < 0.001). Mean age was 65.2 ± 12.8 and 62.0 ± 13.1 years for non-regressing and regressing patients, respectively (p < 0.001). No difference was seen in BMI between regressing and non-regressing groups (27.5 ± 5.7 vs. 27.7 ± 5.4, p = 0.52). No difference was seen between groups with respect to PPI use (93.5% non-regressing vs. 94.1% regressed patients, p = 0.70), but regressed patients were more likely to take vitamin D than non-regressing patients (34.1 vs. 42.1%, p = 0.003). Regressed patients had an average segment length of 1.48 cm (±1.58 cm), in contrast to those not regressing (3.58 ± 3.09 cm (p < 0.001)). Interestingly, one patient in the regression group progressed to dysplasia, while 101 of the non-regressing patients progressed to dysplasia/EAC, a result found to be independent of segment length on multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Currently, several studies have shown risk factors that can predict progression of non-dysplastic BE, but few investigate predictors for regression. Our study reports several factors that can be used to predict patients who will regress from BE and those who likely will not, tools that will be useful in tailoring therapeutic and surveillance strategies.","Brown, Craig S; Lapin, Brittany; Wang, Chi; Goldstein, Jay L; Linn, John G; Denham, Woody; Haggerty, Stephen P; Talamonti, Mark S; Howington, John A; Carbray, Joann; Ujiki, Michael B",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3548-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24789137/,238

Across the Arctic, patients' interactions with the healthcare system are influenced by challenges of access, historical inequities and social determinants. This scoping review sought to describe the range and nature of peer-reviewed literature on patient experience studies conducted within the circumpolar region. DESIGN In a partnership between Danish/Greenlandic, Canadian and American research teams, a scoping review of published research exploring patient experiences in circumpolar regions was undertaken. DATA SOURCES Seven electronic databases were queried: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, 'Global Health 1910 to 2019 Week 11', CINAHL, PsycINFO and SveMed+. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Articles were eligible for inclusion if they (a) took place in the circumpolar region, (b) reported patients' perspective and (c) were focussed primarily on patient experiences with care, rather than satisfaction with treatment outcome. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data extraction was conducted by four researchers. Bibliometric information such as publication date and country of origin was extracted, as was information regarding study design and whether or not the article contained results relevant to the themes of Indigenous values, rural and remote context, telehealth and climate change. Two researchers then synthesised and characterised results relevant to these themes. RESULTS Of the 2824 articles initially found through systematic searches in seven databases, 96 articles were included for data extraction. Findings from the review included unique features related to Indigenous values, rural and remote health, telehealth and climate change. CONCLUSIONS The review findings provide an overview of patient experiences measures used in circumpolar nations. These findings can be used to inform health system improvement based on patient needs in the circumpolar context, as well as in other regions that share common features. This work can be further contextualized through Indigenous methodologies such as sharing circles and community based participatory methods.","Ingemann, Christine; Hansen, Nathaniel Fox; Hansen, Nanna Lund; Jensen, Kennedy; Larsen, Christina Viskum Lytken; Chatwood, Susan",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042973; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020108/,238

METHODS Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, we estimated the number of childhood cancer survivors on December 31, 2016 for each childhood cancer diagnosis, multiplied this by the proportion of carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study, and projected the resulting number onto the U.S. POPULATION RESULTS Based on genome sequence data, 11.8% of 2450 SJLIFE participants carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in one of 156 cancer predisposition genes. Given this information, we estimate that 21 800 adult survivors of childhood cancer in the United States carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in one of these genes. The highest estimated absolute number of variant carriers are among survivors of central nervous system tumors (n = 4300), particularly astrocytoma (n = 1800) and other gliomas (n = 1700), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 4300), and retinoblastoma (n = 3500). The most frequently mutated genes are RB1 (n = 3000), NF1 (n = 2300), and BRCA2 (n = 800). CONCLUSION Given the increasing number of childhood cancer survivors in the United States, clinicians should counsel survivors regarding their potential genetic risk, consider referral for genetic counseling and testing, and, as appropriate, implement syndrome-specific cancer surveillance or risk-reducing measures.","Wilson, Carmen L; Wang, Zhaoming; Liu, Qi; Ehrhardt, Matthew J; Mostafavi, Roya; Easton, John; Mulder, Heather; Hedges, Dale J; Wang, Shuoguo; Rusch, Michael; Edmonson, Michael; Levy, Shawn; Lanctot, Jennifer Q; Currie, Kelsey; Lear, Matthew; Patel, Aman; Sapkota, Yadav; Brooke, Russell J; Moon, Wonjong; Chang, Ti-Cheng; Chen, Wenan; Kesserwan, Chimene A; Wu, Gang; Nichols, Kim E; Hudson, Melissa M; Zhang, Jinghui; Robison, Leslie L; Yasui, Yutaka",Pediatric blood & cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.28047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31736278/,238

Given the interactions between sensory and cognitive functioning, combining multisensory integration (MI) assessment with the neuropsychological assessment of older adults seems promising. This review aims to examine the characteristics and utility of MI tasks in functional and cognitive assessment of older adults, with or without neurocognitive impairment.Areas covered: A literature search was conducted following the quality assessment of narrative review criteria. Results focused on tasks of detection, discrimination, sensory illusion, temporal judgment, and sensory conflict. Studies were not consensual regarding the enhancement of MI with age, but most studies showed that older adults had an expanded time window of integration. In older adults with mild cognitive impairment or major neurocognitive disorder it was a mediating role of the magnitude of visual-somatosensory integration between neurocognitive impairment and spatial aspects of gait.Expert opinion: Recently, some concerns have been raised about how to maximize the ecological validity of the neuropsychological assessment. Since most of our activities of daily living are multisensory and older adults benefit from multisensory information, MI assessment has the potential to improve the ecological validity of the neuropsychological assessment.","Pinto, Joana O; Vieira De Melo, Bruno B; Dores, Artemisa R; Peixoto, Bruno; Geraldo, Andreia; Barbosa, Fernando",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737175.2021.1914592; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33890537/,238

MATERIAL/METHODS A total of 69 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (with Ct value ​≤ ​28) were tested. Samples included in this study were selected from 7 areas of eastern Poland. All samples were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using a 300-cycle MiSeq Reagent Kit v2. BWA was used for reads mapping on the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence. SAMTools were used for post-processing of reads to genome assembly. Pango lineage and Nexstrain were used to identify variants and amino acid mutations. Statistical analysis was performed with R 4.0.2. RESULTS This study shows the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland with the lineage B.1.351 (known as 501Y.V2 South African variant), as well as another 18 cases with epidemiologically relevant lineage B.1.1.7, known as British variant. Supplementary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in GISAID shows that the share of a new variant can change rapidly within one month. In addition, we show a complete, integrated concept of a networked system for analyzing the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which, used in the present study, generated data and a variant report within 6 days.

As a widely used drug for tumor therapy or bone marrow transplantation, busulfan has a severe side effect on SPCs population and causes a consequent infertility. Recently, accumulating evidence revealed the protective role of autophagy in stem cell maintenance under exogenous stress. To better understand the role of autophagy in SPCs fates, we investigated the potential function of autophagy in SPCs under busulfan stress, and found that treatment of busulfan induced the formation of autophagic vesicles and autophagosomes in mouse SPCs. Subsequently, a connection of autophagy and SPCs maintenance and survival was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mTOR was identified as an essential factor for autophagy in SPCs with a complicated mechanism: (1) mTOR is phosphorylated by AKT to activate its target genes, p70s6 kinase, resulting in the inhibition of autophagy during short-term busulfan treatment. (2) mTOR mediates autophagy with p53 together, to regulate the fate of SPCs. Collectively, observations from this study indicate that moderate autophagy effectively protects SPCs from the stress of chemotherapy, which may provide an important hint for fertility protection in clinic.","Wei, Rui; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Cai, Yihui; Liu, Hongyang; Wang, Bingyuan; Zhao, Xiaodong; Zou, Kang",Stem cell reviews and reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12015-020-10027-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839922/,238

Improving the quality of nutritional treatment in hospitals and post-discharge is necessary, as hospital stays tend to be short. We aimed to identify and map studies that assess the effectiveness of individualised nutritional care plans to reduce malnutrition during hospitalisation and for the first 3 months post-discharge. DESIGN This was a systematic scoping review. METHODS We systematically searched for all types of studies in the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE via PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, with no restriction on data or publication language. We also reviewed the reference lists of the included studies. The abstracts and full articles were simultaneously screened by two independent reviewers. Differences of opinion were discussed among the two investigators, and a third reviewer assisted with the discussion until consensus was reached. Studies in which the patients received an individual nutritional care plan related to their hospital stay and were followed up post-discharge were included. We then conducted a thematic content analysis of the extracted literature. RESULTS Nine randomised controlled trial studies met the inclusion criteria: six were conducted in Scandinavian countries. All studies were mainly conducted among elderly patients (mean ages varied from 75 to 88 years). The review studies measured 10 different outcomes; the most common outcomes were nutritional status and readmission. Six studies reported one or more significant positive intervention effect. Inconsistent results were identified for four outcome variables. CONCLUSIONS Individualised nutritional care plans and follow-up home visits might improve patients' nutritional status. However, there is need for a systematic review that assesses study quality and extends the time to 6 months post-discharge.","Ingstad, Kari; Uhrenfeldt, Lisbeth; Kymre, Ingjerd Gåre; Skrubbeltrang, Conni; Pedersen, Preben",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148761/,238

We found that SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein), a key molecule for viral entry, binds to calnexin, a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but not to calreticulin, a homolog of calnexin. Calnexin bound to most truncated mutants of S protein, and S protein bound to all mutants of calnexin. Pseudotyped virus carrying S protein (S-pseudovirus) produced by human cells that were treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for calnexin expression (calnexin siRNA-treated cells) showed significantly lower infectivity than S-pseudoviruses produced by untreated and control siRNA-treated cells. S-pseudovirus produced by calnexin siRNA-treated cells contained S protein modified with N-glycan side chains differently from other two S proteins and consisted of two kinds of viral particles: those of normal density with little S protein and those of high density with abundant S protein. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), which removes all types of N-glycan side chains from glycoproteins, eliminated the infectivity of S-pseudovirus. S-pseudovirus and SARS-CoV produced in the presence of α-glucosidase inhibitors, which disrupt the interaction between calnexin and its substrates, showed significantly lower infectivity than each virus produced in the absence of those compounds. In S-pseudovirus, the incorporation of S protein into viral particles was obviously inhibited. In SARS-CoV, viral production was obviously inhibited. These findings demonstrated that calnexin strictly monitors the maturation of S protein by its direct binding, resulting in conferring infectivity on SARS-CoV.","Fukushi, Masaya; Yoshinaka, Yoshiyuki; Matsuoka, Yusuke; Hatakeyama, Seisuke; Ishizaka, Yukihito; Kirikae, Teruo; Sasazuki, Takehiko; Miyoshi-Akiyama, Tohru",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01250-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22915798/,238

Using a field isolate that was found to be free from turkey astrovirus and avian reovirus we were able to reproduce the clinical disease associated with TCoV. Clinical signs and weight gain of poults during experimental infections were compared with age-matched, uninfected controls. Poults infected at 2 days of age had 100% morbidity and 10% mortality, and birds infected at 28 days of age showed 75% morbidity and no mortality. Diarrhoea was consistently seen in infected poults at 2 to 3 days post infection (d.p.i.) with a duration of about 3 to 5 days. Mean body weights of birds infected at 2 or 28 days of age were significantly reduced compared with uninfected birds by 7 d.p.i. and remained significantly lower for the duration of the study. At 44 days of age, poults infected at 2 or 28 days of age weighed only 68.1% or 77.7%, respectively, compared with uninfected turkeys of the same age on the same diet, a mean difference in body weights of 683 or 477g, respectively. Infected birds had profound villus atrophy with some compensatory crypt hyperplasia at 5 to 7 d.p.i. Villus heights in the duodenum were significantly reduced at 7 d.p.i. We were able to reproduce enteric disease using only a pathogenic field isolate (MG10) of TCoV that negatively affected growth performance and intestinal morphology of young turkey poults.","Gomaa, M H; Yoo, D; Ojkic, D; Barta, J R",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079450903055389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19937512/,238
64704,Longitudinal changes in plasma sex hormone concentrations correlate with changes in CT-measured regional adiposity among Japanese American men over 10 years.,2020-07-07,"Because membrane fusion is a crucial step in the process by which enveloped viruses invade host cells, membrane fusion inhibitors can be effective drugs against enveloped viruses. We found that surfactin from Bacillus subtilis can suppress the proliferation of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in epithelial cells at a relatively low concentration range (15 to 50 μg/ml), without cytotoxicity or viral membrane disruption. Membrane fusion inhibition experiments demonstrate that surfactin treatment significantly reduces the rate at which the virus fuses to the cell membrane. Thermodynamic experiments show that the incorporation of small amounts of surfactin hinders the formation of negative curvature by lamellar-phase lipids, suggesting that surfactin acts a membrane fusion inhibitor. A fluorescent lipopeptide similar to surfactin was synthesized, and its ability to insert into the viral membrane was confirmed by spectroscopy. In vivo experiments have shown that oral administration of surfactin to piglets protects against PEDV infection. In conclusion, our study indicates that surfactin is a membrane fusion inhibitor with activity against enveloped viruses. As the first reported naturally occurring wedge lipid membrane fusion inhibitor, surfactin is likely to be a prototype for the development of a broad range of novel antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE Membrane fusion inhibitors are a rapidly emerging class of antiviral drugs that inhibit the infection process of enveloped viruses. They can be classified, on the basis of the viral components targeted, as fusion protein targeting or membrane lipid targeting. Lipid-targeting membrane fusion inhibitors have a broader antiviral spectrum and are less likely to select for drug-resistant mutations. Here we show that surfactin is a membrane fusion inhibitor and has a strong antiviral effect. The insertion of surfactin into the viral envelope lipids reduces the probability of viral fusion. We also demonstrate that oral administration of surfactin protects piglets from PEDV infection. Surfactin is the first naturally occurring wedge lipid membrane fusion inhibitor that has been identified and may be effective against many viruses beyond the scope of this study. Understanding its mechanism of action provides a foundation for the development of novel antiviral agents.","Yuan, Lvfeng; Zhang, Shuai; Wang, Yongheng; Li, Yuchen; Wang, Xiaoqing; Yang, Qian",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00809-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30068648/,238

Methods We formulated a desensitization plan utilizing cetirizine and prednisone for a patient with previously diagnosed Graves disease who developed urticaria and arthralgias from methimazole. She was admitted for monitoring of rash, urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis. Her methimazole dose was increased as tolerated and then titrated as an outpatient. Results A 4-year-old girl presented with a heart rate of 195 beats/minute, blood pressure of 145/108, and subsequent labs of undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4 5.8 ng/dL, thyroid peroxidase antibody 11.5 IU/ml, and TSH receptor antibody 39.03 IU/L, consistent with Graves disease. She developed urticaria and arthralgias after 2.5 weeks on methimazole, which resolved with drug cessation. Because of her age, the risks of radioactive iodine ablation and surgery were concerning; therefore, methimazole desensitization was attempted. Prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) and cetirizine (5 mg/day) were started prior to low-dose methimazole reintroduction and continued for 7 days. Methimazole was then gradually increased to a final dose of 15 mg daily (0.8 mg/kg/day). Free T4 normalized within a month (1.12 ng/dL), and her TSH normalized within 10 months (4.61 mcU/mL). Except for 2 possible breakthrough allergic responses that resolved with pulse steroids, she continues to tolerate methimazole. Conclusion We describe a case of methimazole desensitization. In this patient, pretreatment with prednisone, coupled with daily cetirizine, successfully induced methimazole tolerance when other treatment modalities were contraindicated.","Schneider Aguirre, Rebecca; Khalid, Ariba; Ismail, Heba M; Nabhan, Zeina",AACE clinical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aace.2021.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307852/,238
65718,Pulmonary Nodules in Patients With Nonpulmonary Cancer: Not Always Metastases.,2016,"BACKGROUND Citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) is an important citrus disease caused by the sharpshooter-transmitted bacterium Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca. Information about the efficacy of its disease management is bounded to either inoculum reduction or vector control. This study aimed to assess the role of different frequencies of roguing of symptomatic trees combined with different chemical control programs of the sharpshooters' on CVC temporal progress. The experimental area was set up in October 2005 and had a 3 X 3 factorial design. Symptomatic tree removal intervals were every 28, 56, and 112 days until May 2012. Vector control treatments were no control, programs A (PA), and B (PB). Contact insecticides were sprayed every 28 (PA) or 14 (PB) days. Trees within both treatment programs were treated with systemic and foliar insecticides until October 2008. After this, the systemic insecticides were discontinued and only foliar treatments were applied. The number of diseased trees and sharpshooter population were assessed until April 2015. RESULTS The detection of the first symptomatic trees was similar for all treatments and occurred, on average, at the 50th month after planting. Sharpshooter population and cumulative disease incidence were similar for all roguing intervals and between vector control programs, differing in plots with no control. We observed a reduction over 85% of disease incidence for both PA and PB, compared to no control. CONCLUSION These results reinforce the systematic control of the sharpshooters as an efficient strategy for reducing CVC progress. This article is protected by copyright.

Similar to the rest of the country, the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the state indicates health disparities among Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals, the presence of hotspots, or counties with high numbers of infected persons, and clusters of transmission among congregate living facilities. There have been many advances in diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 and therapies for hospitalized patients nationwide. Public health strategies have included widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2, optimal management of cases, contact tracing efforts, and a phased reopening of sectors/activities in North Carolina with masks and physical distancing to minimize spread of the virus. In this issue, several authors, researchers, and public health leaders discuss the challenges that North Carolinians have experienced with respect to COVID-19 and several factors that are likely contributing to the health disparities among racial/ethnic minorities who have had the highest number of cases and deaths from SARS-CoV-2. Additional strategies also reported in this issue include the use of strike teams and mobile units to reach populations at high risk for infection and severe illness. Promoting individual and population-level strategies for minimizing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially among the most vulnerable, and consistent public health messaging based on science are critical as we face the new year and continued uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic.","Seña, Arlene C; Weber, David J",North Carolina medical journal,https://doi.org/10.18043/ncm.82.1.37; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33397753/,238

It has also challenged conventional wisdom and empirical understandings in the comparative politics and policy of health. Three major questions present themselves: First, some of the countries considered to be the most prepared-having the greatest capacity for outbreak response-have failed to respond effectively to the pandemic. How should our understanding of capacity shift in light of COVID-19, and how can we incorporate political capacity into thinking about pandemic preparedness? Second, several of the mechanisms through which democracy has been shown to be beneficial for health have not traveled well to explain the performance of governments in this pandemic. Is there an authoritarian advantage in disease response? Third, after decades in which coercive public health measures have increasingly been considered counterproductive, COVID-19 has inspired widespread embrace of rigid lockdowns, isolation, and quarantine enforced by police.

Currently, cuff pressure is intermittently monitored with a pressure gauge and adjusted when necessary in a routine practice. However, this method results in wide variations in pressure, and adequate management is difficult due to the spontaneous release of air from the cuff, which reduces cuff pressure. In order to continuously maintain a uniform cuff pressure, we developed a new automated cuff pressure controller and compared its properties with existing devices. METHODS The effectiveness of the new device was assessed with a model trachea/lung and tracheal tube by measuring cuff pressure while on mechanical ventilation. An electrically powered automatic cuff controller or manual cuff pressure control was used for comparison purposes. The effectiveness of the new device was also examined in patients receiving mechanical ventilation by continuously measuring cuff pressure for a 24-h period. RESULTS Cuff pressure was uniformly maintained with the new device. Moreover, in the clinical setting, variation in pressure from the set pressure was minimal with both the new device and existing device, relative to the intermittent monitoring method. This suggests that, as with the existing device, uniform cuff pressure management is possible with the new device. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate the ability of the new cuff pressure controller to manage cuff pressure without the need of a power source, highlighting its potential utility in clinical settings.","Michikoshi, Junichi; Matsumoto, Shigekiyo; Miyawaki, Hiroshi; Niu, Harushi; Seo, Katsuhiro; Yamamoto, Makoto; Tokunaga, Shu-Ichi; Kitano, Takaaki",Journal of intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40560-016-0126-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26759719/,238

67469,Transpapillary drainage has no added benefit on treatment outcomes in patients undergoing EUS-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts: a large multicenter study.,2016,"Although enveloped viruses typically trigger the prodigious secretion of alpha interferon (IFN-α) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), porcine pDC remain quiescent when exposed to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). This inactivity is likely due to virus-mediated interference since the typical IFN-α response by either purified or nonsorted porcine pDC to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) or the Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) D19, was markedly reduced in the presence of PRRSV. Suppression occurred independently of virus viability and acidification of pDC early endosomes but correlated with diminished levels of IFN-α mRNA. This change was attributed to an abrogation of transcription resulting from a decrease in the otherwise enhanced amounts of the requisite interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), whose gene expression in turn was limited as a consequence of a lessened availability of nuclear-localized signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1). While PRRSV also inhibited tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) synthesis by pDC responding to either agent, only the interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-6 production instigated by ODN D19 exposure was blocked. Likewise, PRRSV did not impact a specific TGEV-associated enhancement of IL-8 expression. Moreover, an augmented phosphorylation of NF-κB seen in activated pDC was not only unaffected by PRRSV but actually occurred in its presence. Thus, as supported by a demonstrated resilience of pDC to PRRSV infection, this pathogen may interact with a cell surface protein(s) to selectively impede the completion of cascades involved in cytokine production by stimulated pDC.","Calzada-Nova, Gabriela; Schnitzlein, William M; Husmann, Robert J; Zuckermann, Federico A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01616-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21191013/,238

The three monocyte subpopulations are thought to play an important role in this inflammatory state because they are endowed with numerous pattern recognition receptors, such as CD14, that have been associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury. By contrast, an exaggerated antiinflammatory response has also been described following cardiac arrest, which may be mediated by downregulation of antigen presentation receptor HLA-DR. We report the composition of monocyte subpopulations and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR following cardiac arrest. Blood specimens were collected from 32 patients at three timepoints in the first 48 h after cardiac arrest. Monocyte subset composition was determined by flow cytometry based on the expression of CD14, CD16, and HLA-DR. Monocyte subset composition and the expression of CD14 and HLA-DR were correlated with patient outcomes. The results were compared to 19 patients with coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrest patients showed a significant decline in the percentage of nonclassical monocytes. Monocyte CD14 expression was upregulated after 24 h and correlated with the time to return of spontaneous circulation. Downregulation of HLA-DR expression was observed mainly among classical monocytes and significantly correlated with the dose of norepinephrine used to treat shock. Downregulation of HLA-DR among nonclassical and intermediate monocytes was significantly associated with disease severity. Our data demonstrate the disturbance of monocyte subset composition with a significant decline in nonclassical monocytes at an early stage following cardiac arrest. Our findings suggest the simultaneous presence of hyperinflammation, as evidenced by upregulation of CD14, and monocyte deactivation, characterized by downregulation of HLA-DR. The extent of monocyte deactivation was significantly correlated with disease severity.","Asmussen, Alexander; Busch, Hans-Jörg; Helbing, Thomas; Bemtgen, Xavier; Smolka, Christian; Bode, Christoph; Fink, Katrin; Grundmann, Sebastian",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91948-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117334/,238

The literature has reported frequent cardiac involvement, up to 80%. This is characterized by myocardial injury with a significant increase of biomarkers such as serum troponins I and T, BNP, or NT-ProBNP coupled with varying degrees of ventricular dysfunction, pericarditis, valvulitis, and arrhythmias. Coronary compromise has also been described, which can occur in up to 23% of cases, and ranges from dila tations to aneurysms.

They are most commonly detected either within the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts. Primary hepatic leiomyoma (PHL) is a rare pathology. It is an isolated pathology within the liver, without evidence of any other coexisting leiomyomas. Very few cases have been described in literature. PHL may occur in healthy individuals although an association with immunodeficiency and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has been observed. Majority of the reported cases have been in females. A 20-year-old female patient presented with abdominal symptoms. MRI confirmed an 8 cm mass, with very low signal intensity on T2 images and peripheral rim enhancement on gadolinium. A laparoscopic left lateral sectorectomy was performed. Final histopathology confirmed the presence of benign lesion with spindle cell and smooth muscle proliferation and a fibro-vascular stroma compatible with a leiomyoma. There was no evidence of any leiomyomatous lesion elsewhere in the body. A rare diagnosis of PHL was therefore established. Acknowledging the rare incidence of this lesion, we report the same and review the relevant literature. PHL is usually a retrospective diagnosis, confirmed on histo-pathology assessment of the resected specimen. Liver resection is required in these patients due to the presence of symptoms, in the presence of a solid mass lesion within the liver.

The objective is to assess the hypotheses that this can be overcome by tracking distributions of linear models using anesthesia data, and that anesthetic brain state tracking performance of linear models is comparable to that of a high performing depth of anesthesia monitoring feature. METHODS Individuals' brain states are classified by comparing the distribution of linear (auto-regressive moving average-ARMA) model parameters estimated from electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained with a sliding window to distributions of linear model parameters for each brain state. The method is applied to frontal EEG data from 15 subjects undergoing propofol anesthesia and classified by the observers assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale. Classification of the OAA/S score was performed using distributions of either ARMA parameters or the benchmark feature, Higuchi fractal dimension. RESULTS The highest average testing sensitivity of 59% (chance sensitivity: 17%) was found for ARMA (2,1) models and Higuchi fractal dimension achieved 52%, however, no statistical difference was observed. For the same ARMA case, there was no statistical difference if medians are used instead of distributions (sensitivity: 56%). CONCLUSION The model-based distribution approach is not necessarily more effective than a median/short-term average approach, however, it performs well compared with a distribution approach based on a high performing anesthesia monitoring measure. SIGNIFICANCE These techniques hold potential for anesthesia monitoring and may be generally applicable for tracking brain states.","Kuhlmann, Levin; Manton, Jonathan H; Heyse, Bjorn; Vereecke, Hugo E M; Lipping, Tarmo; Struys, Michel M R F; Liley, David T J",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2016.2562261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27323352/,238
72008,Potential Neurologic Manifestations of COVID-19.,2021-04-01,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spurred a global health crisis. To date, there are no proven options for prophylaxis for those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, nor therapy for those who develop COVID-19. Immune (i.e. ""convalescent"") plasma refers to plasma that is collected from individuals, following resolution of infection and development of antibodies. Passive antibody administration through transfusion of convalescent plasma may offer the only short-term strategy to confer immediate immunity to susceptible individuals. There are numerous examples, where convalescent plasma has been used successfully as post-exposure prophylaxis and/or treatment of infectious diseases, including other outbreaks of coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-1, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]). Convalescent plasma has also been used in the COVID-19 pandemic; limited data from China suggest clinical benefit, including radiological resolution, reduction in viral loads and improved survival. Globally, blood centers have robust infrastructure to undertake collections and construct inventories of convalescent plasma to meet the growing demand. Nonetheless, there are nuanced challenges, both regulatory and logistical, spanning donor eligibility, donor recruitment, collections and transfusion itself. Data from rigorously controlled clinical trials of convalescent plasma are also few, underscoring the need to evaluate its use objectively for a range of indications (e.g., prevention vs treatment) and patient populations (e.g., age, comorbid disease). We provide an overview of convalescent plasma, from evidence of benefit, regulatory considerations, logistical work flow and proposed clinical trials, as scale up is brought underway to mobilize this critical resource. .","Bloch, Evan M; Shoham, Shmuel; Casadevall, Arturo; Sachais, Bruce S; Shaz, Beth; Winters, Jeffrey L; van Buskirk, Camille; Grossman, Brenda J; Joyner, Michael; Henderson, Jeffrey P; Pekosz, Andrew; Lau, Bryan; Wesolowski, Amy; Katz, Louis; Shan, Hua; Auwaerter, Paul G; Thomas, David; Sullivan, David J; Paneth, Nigel; Gehrie, Eric; Spitalnik, Steven; Hod, Eldad; Pollack, Lewis; Nicholson, Wayne T; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Bailey, Jeffrey A; Tobian, Aaron Ar",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci138745; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32254064/,238

METHODS Corneal densitometry (CD) values of 102 eyes were divided into three main groups: 33 DMEKs, 19 DSAEKs, and 50 healthy eyes without previous ocular surgery. The CD values were then analyzed and compared between the groups. We measured three main layers in depth and four different concentric zones at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS In the DMEK group, total CD significantly decreased from 38.02 ± 10.21 grayscale units (GSU) to 31.13 ± 9.25 GSU (P < 0.01) between the first and the sixth month postoperative. In the DSAEK group, we found significant changes only between the first and three months after surgery (from 42.62 ± 9.31 GSU to 38.71 ± 10.53 GSU (P < 0.01). Regarding the concentric zones, CD in the DMEK group significantly decreased in the central zone from 33.55 ± 12.07 GSU to 30.63 ± 10.15 GSU (P < 0.01) and significantly increased in the periphery from 30.63 ± 10.15 GSU to 36.72 ± 9.37 GSU, (P < 0.01). The DSAEK group showed no changes in the central zone (from 36.91 ± 13.80 GSU to 36.14 ± 11.47 GSU, P = 0.52) and CD significantly increased in the periphery (41.91 ± 9.28 GSU, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION When comparing CD values in DMEK versus DSAEK, we found no differences by layers or at central-paracentral concentric zones, although CD differences in the peripheral zones were statistically significant. This finding may be attributed to the thicker graft at periphery with a delayed clearance and less anatomical interphase in DSAEK.","Peraza-Nieves, Jorge; Sánchez-González, José-María; Rocha-de-Lossada, Carlos; Rachwani-Anil, Rahul; Sánchez-Valera, Miriam; Borroni, Davide; Torras-Sanvicens, Josep",International ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-021-01817-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763796/,238

Coronaviridae comprises a large family, of which at least seven members are known to cause respiratory diseases in humans. Coronaviruses have the ability to infect virtually all major groups of animals and, eventually, can infect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to cross the species barrier and infect humans. This virus was identified in an outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. Its entire genome is inscribed on a single strand of ribonucleic acid. Some proteins present on the surface of the virus act as facilitators for its entry into host cells, while others, apparently, are related to its pathogenesis. Coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections in humans and some animals. The infection is often mild to moderate in intensity, but some coronaviruses may cause serious illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which occurred in 2002, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses can activate an excessive and unregulated immune response, which may promote SARS development. Although the lungs are one of the target organs, the hypoxia mechanism is systemic and other organs begin to suffer both through lack of oxygen and through deregulation of inflammation control mechanisms.","Vieira, Luisane Maria Falci; Emery, Eduardo; Andriolo, Adagmar",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2020.0240.14052020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578747/,238

We analyzed Ag accumulation and oxidative stress biomarkers. The results showed high bioaccumulation after the AgNO3+HA exposure. An inhibition of glutathione-S-transferase enzymatic activity and depletion of reduced glutathione levels were registered after the AgNO3 exposure, and increased lipid peroxidation levels in the case of AgNP one. Oxidative responses were mitigated when the HA were present in the media.

74487,Covid-19: Breaking bad news with social distancing in pediatric oncology.,2020-07-03,"Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with high mortality. Despite documented kidney tropism of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are no consistent reports of viral detection in urine or correlation with AKI or COVID-19 severity. Here we hypothesize that quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediment from COVID-19 patients correlates with occurrence of AKI and mortality. Methods SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediments (U-viral load) was quantified by qRT-PCR in 52 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalized between March 15th and June 8th, 2020. Immunolabeling of SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike and Nucleocapsid was performed in two COVID-19 kidney biopsies and urine sediments. Viral infectivity assays were performed from 32 urine sediments. Results Twenty COVID-19 patients (39%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 U-viral load, of which 17 (85%) developed AKI with an average U-viral load 4-times higher than non-AKI COVID-19 patients. U-viral load was highest (7.7-fold) within two weeks after AKI diagnosis. A higher U-viral load correlated with mortality but not with albuminuria or AKI stage. SARS-CoV-2 proteins partially colocalized with the viral receptor ACE2 in kidney biopsies in tubules and parietal cells, and in urine sediment cells. Infective SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in urine sediments. Conclusion Our results further support SARS-CoV-2 kidney tropism. A higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load in urine sediments from COVID-19 patients correlated with increased incidence of AKI and mortality. Urinary viral detection could inform medical care of COVID-19 patients with kidney injury to improve prognosis.","Caceres, Paulo; Savickas, Gina; Murray, Shannon; Umanath, Kausik; Uduman, Junior; Yee, Jerry; Liao, Tang-Dong; Bolin, Steven; Levin, Albert; Khan, Moomal; Sarkar, Sarah; Fitzgerald, Jamie; Maskey, Dipak; Ormsby, Adrian; Sharma, Yuvraj; Ortiz, Pablo",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2021010059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088853/,238

When the patient has recovered from the primary insult, the cranioplasty restores protection and cosmesis, recovering fluid dynamics and improving neurological status. During this time, the bone flap must be stored, but there is a lack of standardization of tissue banking practices for this aim. In this work, we have reviewed the literature on tissue processing and storage practices. Most of the published articles are focused from a strictly clinical and surgical point of view, paying less attention to issues related to tissue manipulation. When bone resorption is avoided and the risk of infection is controlled, the autograft represents the most efficient choice, with the lowest risk of complication. Otherwise, depending on the degree of involvement, the patient may have to undergo new surgery, assuming further risks and higher healthcare costs. Therefore, tissue banks must implement protocols to provide products with the highest possible clinical effectiveness, without compromising safety. With a centralised management of tissue banking practices there may be a more uniform approach, thus facilitating the standardization of procedures and guidelines.","Mirabet, Vicente; García, Daniel; Yagüe, Nuria; Larrea, Luis Roberto; Arbona, Cristina; Botella, Carlos",Cell and tissue banking,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10561-020-09897-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423107/,238

The combination of ITV and supraglottic airway devices (SADs) has not been previously studied. This simulation study in a manikin aimed at analysing differences in ventilation with different SADs without and with an ITV. METHODS In a resuscitation manikin, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed with interrupted (30:2) and continuous chest compressions using facemask, tracheal tube and 10 SADs (six different laryngeal masks, LT-D, LTS-D, Combitube((R)) and Easy Tube((R))). Ventilation was performed with and without an ITV. A total of 550 CPR cycles of 3-min duration were performed with chest compressions and ventilation standardised by use of a mechanical thumper device and an emergency ventilator. RESULTS Sufficient ventilation was possible with all devices tested. For ventilation during continuous chest compressions, there were significantly reduced tidal volumes for all airway devices with ITV use. By contrast, during interrupted chest compressions, no differences in tidal volumes with the ITV occurred in the majority of devices. The maximum reduction of tidal volume for any device was 7.8% of the volume reached without the ITV. CONCLUSION Based on the findings of this manikin trial, the use of an ITV for ventilation during CPR is possible in combination with supraglottic airway devices. Merging these two strategies warrants further clinical evaluation to judge the relevance of tidal volume reduction found in this trial.","Genzwuerker, H V; Gernoth, C; Hinkelbein, J; Schmidbauer, W; Kerner, T",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2010.03.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20471153/,238

RECENT FINDINGS The most commonly reported cutaneous findings described for COVID-19 in adults and children were chilblains-like lesions, followed by maculopapular eruption, urticarial lesions, vesicular lesions, and livedoid lesions. Children can also present with erythema multiforme (EM)-like lesions and skin findings associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). SUMMARY There are numerous cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19, some of which are unique to children such as EM-like lesions and skin findings for MIS-C.

78406,Interleukin-6 as unfavorable prognostic factor in patients affected by Covid-19 and hip fracture.,2021-01-29,"OBJECTIVE Optimal platelet inhibition is an important therapeutic adjunct in patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing carotid artery stenting (CAS). Clopidogrel resistance is associated with increased periprocedural thromboembolic complications from neurovascular stent placement procedures. The addition of cilostazol to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) has been reported to reduce platelet reactivity and to improve clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention. This study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of adjunctive cilostazol in patients with CAS. METHODS Platelet function was assessed by light transmittance aggregometry using the VerifyNow assay. Sixty-four consecutive patients who underwent CAS received standard DAT, clopidogrel (75 mg daily), and aspirin (100 mg daily) more than 4 weeks before the procedure. From 2010 to 2011 (period I), 28 patients underwent CAS under standard DAT. From 2011 to 2013 (period II), 36 patients prospectively had preoperative assessment of platelet function, and 13 patients with clopidogrel resistance received adjunctive cilostazol (200 mg daily) in addition to standard DAT. The incidence of new ipsilateral ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging a day after CAS and ischemic or hemorrhagic events within 30 days was assessed. RESULTS Clopidogrel resistance was indentified in 12 patients (43%) in period I and 13 patients (36%) in period II (P = .615). In period II, the addition of cilostazol significantly decreased P2Y12 reaction units and % inhibition (P = .006 and P = .005, respectively), and there was a significant difference in P2Y12 reaction units between the two periods. New ipsilateral ischemic lesions were significantly decreased in period II (2/36 patients) compared with period I (7/28 patients; P = .034); however, there was no significant difference in hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS Adjunctive cilostazol (triple antiplatelet therapy) in clopidogrel-resistant patients reduces the rate of clopidogrel resistance and suppresses new ischemic lesions without hemorrhagic complications, as compared with standard DAT. Antiplatelet management based on the evaluation of antiplatelet resistance would be required for prevention of perioperative thromboembolic complications in CAS.","Nakagawa, Ichiro; Wada, Takeshi; Park, Hun Soo; Nishimura, Fumihiko; Yamada, Syuichi; Nakagawa, Hiroyuki; Kichikawa, Kimihiko; Nakase, Hiroyuki",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2013.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24239116/,238

The diagnosis of COVID-19 in these transplant recipients may require extensive laboratory testing and high clinical suspicion, as atypical clinical manifestations or other respiratory viral infections are common in this patient population. The underlying malignancies, immunosuppressed state, frequently observed coinfections, and advanced age in some patients may also predispose them to worse clinical outcomes. Similar outcomes have been previously described with other human coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Many hematopoietic stem cell transplant organizations have issued elaborative guidelines that aim to prevent transmission and hence adverse patient outcomes. All potential donors are thoroughly screened, and donated products are cryopreserved in advance. Potential hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients are also screened, and most nonurgent transplant cases with low risk of progression and/or death are deferred. Current hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients should adhere to precaution and isolation measures, while their transplant units should also follow strict safety protocols, similar to other infectious outbreaks. The prolonged susceptibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients to respiratory viral infections might necessitate extending these measures even after the peak of the outbreak until a gradually return to normality is possible.","Esagian, Stepan M; Giannis, Dimitrios; Ziogas, Ioannis A; Gianni, Panagiota; Sala, Elisa; Döhner, Hartmut",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2020.0326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33641657/,238
78590,Electrocardiographic QT Intervals in Infants Exposed to Hydroxychloroquine Throughout Gestation.,2020-09-09,"The preen gland is a holocrine sebaceous gland of the avian integument which produces an oily secretion that is spread on the plumage during preening. It has been suggested that birds may defend themselves against feather-degrading bacteria (FDB) and other potential pathogens using preen gland secretions. However, besides some in vitro studies, the in vivo bacterial inhibitory effects of the preen oil on the abundance of feather-associated bacterial species has not yet been studied in passerines. Here we tested the effect of gland removal on the abundance of FDB and other-cultivable bacterial loads (OCB) of male house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Our results did not support earlier results on in vitro antibacterial activity of preen oil against FDB since the absence of the preen gland did not significantly affect their loads related to the control birds. In contrast, we found that preen gland removal led to higher loads of OCB. This result suggests that the antimicrobial spectrum of the preen oil is broader than previously thought and that, by reducing the overall feather bacterial loads, the preen gland could help birds to protect themselves against a variety of potentially harmful bacteria.","Czirják, Gábor Arpád; Pap, Péter László; Vágási, Csongor István; Giraudeau, Mathieu; Mureşan, Cosmin; Mirleau, Pascal; Heeb, Philipp",Die Naturwissenschaften,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00114-012-1005-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23288399/,238

80007,Interhemispheric Pathways Are Important for Motor Outcome in Individuals with Chronic and Severe Upper Limb Impairment Post Stroke.,2017,"OBJECTIVE Online supermarkets are increasingly used both by consumers and as a source of data on the food environment. We compared product availability, nutritional information, front-of-pack (FOP) labelling, price and price promotions for food and drink products between physical and online supermarkets. DESIGN For physical stores we collected data on price, price promotions, FOP nutrition labels and nutrition information from a random sample of food and drinks from six UK supermarkets. For online stores we used foodDB, a research-ready dataset of over 14 million observations of food and drink products available in online supermarkets. SETTING Six large supermarket stores located near Oxford, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS General sample with 295 food and drink products, plus boost samples for both fruit and vegetables, and alcohol. RESULTS In the general sample, 85% (95% confidence intervals, 80,90%) of products found in physical stores could be matched with an online product. Nutritional information found in the two settings was almost identical e.g. concordance correlation coefficient for energy = 0.995 (0.993,0.996). Presence of FOP labelling and price promotions differed between the two settings (Cohen's kappa = 0.56 (0.45, 0.66) and 0.40 (0.26, 0.55) respectively). Prices were similar between online and physical supermarkets (concordance correlation coefficient > 0.9 for all samples). CONCLUSIONS Product availability, nutritional information and prices sourced online for these 6 retailers is a good proxy of that found in physical stores. Price promotions and FOP labelling varies between the two settings. Further research should investigate whether this could impact on health inequalities.","Bhatnagar, Prachi; Scarborough, Peter; Kaur, Asha; Dikmen, Derya; Adhikari, Vyas; Harrington, Richard",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980020004346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33109282/,238

80124,Prevention of retinopathy of prematurity in preterm infants through changes in clinical practice and SpO₂technology.,2011,"BACKGROUND Tourniquets are a critical tool in the immediate response to life-threatening extremity hemorrhage, however, the optimal tourniquet type and effectiveness of non-commercial devices remain unclear. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of five tourniquets in a perfused-cadaver model. METHODS This prospective study used a perfused-cadaver model with standardized Superficial Femoral Artery injury bleeding at 700 ml/min. Five tourniquets were tested: CAT (combat application tourniquet), RATS (rapid application tourniquet system), SWAT-T (Stretch, Wrap, And Tuck Tourniquet), an improvised triangle bandage windlass, and a leather belt. 48 medical students underwent a practical hands-on demonstration of each tourniquet. Using a random number generator, they placed the tourniquets on the bleeding cadaver in random order. Time to hemostasis, time to secure devices, estimated blood loss (EBL) and difficulty rating were assessed. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare efficacy between the tourniquets in achieving the outcomes. RESULTS Participant age: 25±2.6 years, male: 29 (60%). All but one tourniquet was able to stop bleeding, but the RATS had a 4% failure rate. Time to hemostasis and EBL did not differ significantly (p>0.05). SWAT-T required the longest time to be secured (47.8±17.0 s), the belt was fastest (15.2±6.5 s; p<0.001). The improvised windlass was rated easiest to learn and apply, with 22 participants (46%) assigning a score of 1. CONCLUSION Four of five tourniquets evaluated, including both non-commercial devices, effectively achieved hemostasis. A standard leather belt was the fastest to place and was able to stop the bleeding. However, it required continuous pressure to maintain hemostasis. The improvised windlass was as effective as the commercial devices and was the easiest to apply. In an emergency setting where commercial devices are not available, improvised tourniquets may be an effective bridge to definitive care.

80269,Ultrasound-guided thoracic wall nerve blocks in cardiac surgery: has the best yet to come?,2020-10-15,"PURPOSE Acute ischemic strokes caused by steno-occlusive lesion of the cervical internal carotid artery are associated with poor clinical outcome. We evaluated the clinical efficacy of emergent carotid artery stenting for the management of these lesions. We compared the clinical outcomes regarding the intracranial lesion, namely tandem occlusions versus isolated cervical internal carotid artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent carotid artery stenting for cervical internal carotid artery steno-occlusive lesion between 2011 and 2018. After dividing the patients into two groups according to the presence or absence of intracranial lesions (tandem group and isolated cervical group), we analyzed demographic data, angiographic findings, and clinical outcomes. A modified Rankin Scale score ≤2 was defined as a favorable clinical outcome. RESULTS Of 75 patients, 46 patients (61.3%) had tandem lesions, and the remaining 29 had only cervical internal carotid artery steno-occlusive lesion. Successful stenting was performed in all patients with favorable clinical outcomes (64.0%). Successful reperfusion score (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction ≥2 b) was 84.0%; tandem group (76.1%) versus isolated cervical group (96.6%) of cases. Mean modified Rankin Scale score at 90-days was 2.09. The rate of favorable clinical outcome showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.454). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to cervical internal carotid artery steno-occlusive lesion is a technically feasible and clinically effective intervention regardless of intracranial occlusion. Therefore, we recommend endovascular treatment regardless of the presence of concomitant intracranial artery occlusion for patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by cervical internal carotid artery steno-occlusive lesion.","Park, Sung E; Choi, Dae S; Baek, Hye J; Ryu, Kyeong H; Ha, Ji Y; Choi, Ho C; Lee, Sangmin; Won, Jungho; Jung, Seunguk","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919899755; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31992107/,238

At any given time, CSU is believed to affect 0.5-1% of the global population. Omalizumab (a recombinant, humanized anti-immunoglobulin-E antibody) is the only approved treatment for antihistamine refractory CSU. However, ~ 30% of patients remain symptomatic at licensed doses of omalizumab 150 mg and 300 mg, even after a treatment period of over 6 months. In the recent years, there have been several studies on updosing of the drug, suggesting that the individualized approach for urticaria treatment with omalizumab is useful. In this article, we provide an overview of these studies and the real-world data on omalizumab updosing as it became necessary to obtain complete CSU symptom control in a proportion of patients. Published observational studies (from June 2003 to October 2019) on the updosing of omalizumab in CSU were identified using PubMed and Ovid databases. Reports mainly show that updosing/dose adjustment evaluated with the assessment of disease activity (Urticaria Activity Score) and control (Urticaria Control Test) achieves better clinical response to omalizumab with a good safety profile in a pool of patients with CSU. These real-world data will provide an overview of updosing of omalizumab in CSU and aid in setting informed clinical practice treatment expectations.","Metz, Martin; Vadasz, Zahava; Kocatürk, Emek; Giménez-Arnau, Ana M",Clinical reviews in allergy & immunology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-020-08794-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418171/,238

METHODS We recruited, via Instagram, a sample of full-time college students aged 18-22 from across the U.S. We surveyed them in April (baseline; N = 707; mean age = 20.0, SD = 1.3) and July (follow-up) 2020. This study presents overall levels of perceived stress and general anxiety symptoms and inequalities across each of these outcomes by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and household income. We also explore potential explanations for these health issues by analyzing baseline qualitative data. RESULTS All students, on average, were suffering from perceived stress and anxiety, with especially high levels in April. We also identified inequalities in college student mental well-being, particularly by gender identity and sexual orientation. Women reported worse well-being compared with men; transgender and gender diverse and sexual minority youths reported worse outcomes than their cisgender, heterosexual peers at both time points. Qualitative data illustrate how the COVID-19 pandemic has generated educational, economic, and environmental stressors that are affecting college students' well-being. CONCLUSIONS As colleges and universities think about how to manage and mitigate the infectious disease dimensions of COVID-19 among their student populations, they must also consider who is most at risk for increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.","Hoyt, Lindsay Till; Cohen, Alison K; Dull, Brandon; Maker Castro, Elena; Yazdani, Neshat",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288459/,238

The effects of container shape (wide and shallow vs. narrow and deep), soil depth (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 cm), and temperature (28°, 32°, or 35° C) on pupation success was measured. Diet influenced larval survivorship, but did not have a strong effect on larval weight. The larvae fed only bee brood survived the shortest period of time. The larvae that were denied pupation substrate, fed only honey and pollen, and no other food or water after 20 days, had a median survivorship of 47.6 days, with a maximum of 61 days, while those fed only brood had a median survivorship of 18.2 days. Pupation substrate was essential for successful pupation, and the depth of the substrate, not its top surface area, was the crucial factor. Pupation success in narrow and deep containers was 95.6% on average, but only 12.5% in wide and shallow containers, using the same soil volume. In narrow and deep containers, most or all larvae kept in 4-8 cm of soil pupated at all temperatures, few larvae kept at 2 cm soil depth pupated, one out of 240 kept at 1.0 cm pupated, and no larvae kept at soil depths of 0 or 0.5 cm pupated.","Meikle, W G; Diaz, R",Journal of insect science,https://doi.org/10.1673/031.012.11801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23451773/,238

83672,COVID-19 Severity and Outcomes in Patients With Cancer: A Matched Cohort Study.,2020-09-28,"PURPOSE The field of implementation science has emerged as a response to the challenges experienced in translating evidence-based practice and research findings to healthcare settings. Whilst the field has grown considerably in recent years, comparatively, there is a conspicuous lack of attention paid to the work of pre-implementation, that is, how we effectively engage with organisations to support the translation of research into practice. Securing the engagement and commitment of healthcare organisations and staff is key in quality improvement and organisational research. In this paper the authors draw attention to the pre-implementation phase, that is, the development of an amenable context to support implementation research. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH Drawing from examples across an interdisciplinary group of health systems researchers working across a range of healthcare organisations, the authors present a reflective narrative viewpoint. They identify the principal challenges experienced during the course of their work, describe strategies deployed to effectively mitigate these challenges and offer a series of recommendations to researchers based on their collective experiences of engaging in collaborations with healthcare organisations for research and implementation. This reflective piece will contribute to the narrative evidence base by documenting the challenges, experiences and learning emerging from the authors' work as university researchers seeking to engage and collaborate with healthcare organisations. FINDINGS The RELATE model is presented to guide researchers through six key steps and sample strategies in working to secure organisational buy-in and creating a context amenable to implementation and research. The six stages of the RELATE model are: (1) Recognising and navigating the organisation's complexity; (2) Enhancing understanding of organisational priorities and aligning intervention; (3) Leveraging common values and communicating to key individuals the value of implementation research; (4) Aligning and positioning intervention to illustrate synergies with other initiatives; (5) Building and maintaining credibility and trust in the research team; and (6) Evolving the intervention through listening and learning. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS The authors hope this guidance will stimulate thinking and planning and indeed that it will encourage other research teams to reflect and share their experiences and strategies for successful engagement of organisations, thus developing a knowledge base to strengthen implementation efforts and increase efficacy in this important enterprise. ORIGINALITY/VALUE Researchers must relate to the world's everyday reality of the healthcare managers and administrators and enable them to relate to the potential of the research world in enhancing practice if we are to succeed in bringing the evidence to practice in a timely and efficient manner. Climates receptive to implementation must be developed incrementally over time and require actors to navigate messy and potentially unfamiliar organisational contexts. In this paper, the often invisible and lamentably underreported work of how we begin to work with healthcare organisations has been addressed. The authors hope this guidance will stimulate thinking and planning and indeed that it will encourage other research teams to reflect and share their experiences and strategies for successful engagement of organisations, thus developing a knowledge base to strengthen implementation efforts and increase efficacy in this important enterprise.","De Brún, Aoife; McAuliffe, Eilish",Journal of health organization and management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jhom-08-2020-0335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156176/,238

While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced. However, within Europe travel resumed in the summer of 2020. Here we report on a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20E (EU1), that emerged in Spain in early summer, and subsequently spread across Europe. We find no evidence of increased transmissibility, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant's success. Despite travel restrictions, we estimate 20E (EU1) was introduced hundreds of times to European countries by summertime travelers, likely undermining local efforts to keep SARS-CoV-2 cases low. Our results demonstrate how a variant can rapidly become dominant even in absence of a substantial transmission advantage in favorable epidemiological settings. Genomic surveillance is critical to understanding how travel can impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes.","Hodcroft, Emma B; Zuber, Moira; Nadeau, Sarah; Vaughan, Timothy G; Crawford, Katharine H D; Althaus, Christian L; Reichmuth, Martina L; Bowen, John E; Walls, Alexandra C; Corti, Davide; Bloom, Jesse D; Veesler, David; Mateo, David; Hernando, Alberto; Comas, Iñaki; Candelas, Fernando González; Stadler, Tanja; Neher, Richard A",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03677-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098568/,238

These workers have been dealing with drastic changes in the care they provide to their residents including cancelation of group activities and communal dining and even restrictions of activities outside rooms. Healthcare workers have also been devoting more time and energy to perform COVID-related medical duties. Geriatric facilities have been facing shortages in equipment and supplies, as well as staffing shortages. Finally, healthcare workers have been facing challenges regarding their personal safety and that of their families. Consequently, we hypothesized the presence of high levels of burnout among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS To evaluate burnout in healthcare workers in French acute care geriatric facilities, we used an online survey based on the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Eighty-four healthcare workers answered the survey, during April of 2020. RESULTS Analysis demonstrated that they were experiencing medium levels of burnout, exhaustion, and disengagement. CONCLUSION This level of burnout reflected their fatigue, loss of energy, and/or feelings of being overextended and exhausted. Considering the expected cumulative impact of various stressors, the medium level of burnout observed has come as a surprise to us and might actually be considered as relatively good news. Nevertheless, no level of burnout is negligible and has wide ranging negative consequences.","El Haj, Mohamad; Allain, Philippe; Annweiler, Cédric; Boutoleau-Bretonnière, Claire; Chapelet, Guillaume; Gallouj, Karim; Kapogiannis, Dimitrios; Roche, Jean; Boudoukha, Abdel Halim",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-201029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33044186/,238

RESULTS In high RNS group, the mean age of the patients was 53 years (male:female = 15:3). Mean diameter of tumors was 6.28 cm (3.0-10.5 cm). Mean operative time was 173.61 ± 52.66 min and mean warm ischemia time was 27.85 ± 5.27 min. Mean estimated blood loss (EBL) was 363.89 ± 296.45 ml. Mean hospital length of stay was 5.39 ± 1.91 days (3-9 days). When compared with low and intermediate RNS, only EBL and need for pelvicalyceal system repair was significantly higher in high RNS group. Postoperative complications, renal function preservation and oncological outcomes at 3 months were comparable in all the three groups. CONCLUSION Robot-assisted NSS is feasible with comparable outcomes in tumors with high RNS.","Bora, Girdhar S; Mavuduru, Ravimohan S; Sharma, Aditya P; Devana, Sudheer K; Kakkar, Nandita; Lal, Anupam; Singh, Shrawan K; Mandal, Arup K",Indian journal of urology : IJU : journal of the Urological Society of India,https://doi.org/10.4103/iju.iju_331_16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28717275/,238
84657,Completeness of reporting for systematic reviews of point-of-care ultrasound: a meta-research study.,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND Cancer cachexia (CCx) is a multifactorial wasting disorder characterized by involuntary loss of body weight that affects many cancer patients and implies a poor prognosis, reducing both tolerance to and efficiency of anticancer therapies. Actual challenges in management of CCx remain in the identification of tumour-derived and host-derived mediators involved in systemic inflammation and tissue wasting and in the discovery of biomarkers that would allow for an earlier and personalized care of cancer patients. The aim of this study was to identify new markers of CCx across different species and tumour entities. METHODS Quantitative secretome analysis was performed to identify specific factors characteristic of cachexia-inducing cancer cell lines. To establish the subsequently identified phospholipase PLA2G7 as a marker of CCx, plasma PLA2G7 activity and/or protein levels were measured in well-established mouse models of CCx and in different cohorts of weight-stable and weight-losing cancer patients with different tumour entities. Genetic PLA2G7 knock-down in tumours and pharmacological treatment using the well-studied PLA2G7 inhibitor darapladib were performed to assess its implication in the pathogenesis of CCx in C26 tumour-bearing mice. RESULTS High expression and secretion of PLA2G7 were hallmarks of cachexia-inducing cancer cell lines. Circulating PLA2G7 activity was increased in different mouse models of CCx with various tumour entities and was associated with the severity of body wasting. Circulating PLA2G7 levels gradually rose during cachexia development. Genetic PLA2G7 knock-down in C26 tumours only partially reduced plasma PLA2G7 levels, suggesting that the host is also an important contributor. Chronic treatment with darapladib was not sufficient to counteract inflammation and tissue wasting despite a strong inhibition of the circulating PLA2G7 activity. Importantly, PLA2G7 levels were also increased in colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients with CCx. CONCLUSIONS Overall, our data show that despite no immediate pathogenic role, at least when targeted as a single entity, PLA2G7 is a consistent marker of CCx in both mice and humans. The early increase in circulating PLA2G7 levels in pre-cachectic mice supports future prospective studies to assess its potential as biomarker for cancer patients.","Morigny, Pauline; Kaltenecker, Doris; Zuber, Julia; Machado, Juliano; Mehr, Lisa; Tsokanos, Foivos-Filippos; Kuzi, Hanna; Hermann, Chris D; Voelkl, Michael; Monogarov, German; Springfeld, Christoph; Laurent, Victor; Engelmann, Bernd; Friess, Helmut; Zörnig, Inka; Krüger, Achim; Krijgsveld, Jeroen; Prokopchuk, Olga; Fisker Schmidt, Søren; Rohm, Maria; Herzig, Stephan; Berriel Diaz, Mauricio","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcsm.12758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34427055/,238
84718,Heart Rhythm Abnormalities Following Acute Verapamil Overdose.,2020-10-02,"BACKGROUND Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent in young adults with obesity. Obesity is associated with relative growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and data from animal studies and from humans with pituitary GH deficiency suggest a role for GH deficiency in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. The effects of GH on NAFLD in those with obesity are unknown, however, prompting this pilot study to assess effects of GH administration on measures of NAFLD in young adults. METHODS Twenty-four men and women aged 18-29 years with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 , hepatic fat fraction (HFF) ≥ 5% on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) z-score ≤ 0 were randomized to treatment with recombinant human GH (rhGH) versus no treatment for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in HFF. RESULTS Compared to no treatment, the effect size of rhGH on absolute HFF over 24 weeks was -3.3% (95% confidence interval: -7.8%, 1.2%; p = .14). At 24 weeks, HFF < 5% was achieved in 5 of 9 individuals receiving rhGH versus 1 of 9 individuals receiving no treatment (p = .04). rhGH did not significantly reduce ALT, AST or GGT. Serum IGF-1 increased as expected with rhGH treatment, and there were no changes in fasting lipids, C-reactive protein, fasting glucose or 2-h glucose following an oral glucose tolerance test. CONCLUSION Data from this pilot study suggest that rhGH treatment in young adults with obesity and NAFLD may have benefits to reduce liver fat content, although larger studies are needed to confirm this effect.","Pan, Chelsea S; Weiss, Julian J; Fourman, Lindsay T; Buckless, Colleen; Branch, Karen L; Lee, Hang; Torriani, Martin; Misra, Madhusmita; Stanley, Takara L",Clinical endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.14344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33037656/,238
84993,Olfactory bulb and mucosa abnormalities in persistent COVID-19 induced anosmia: a Magnetic Resonance Imaging study.,2020-09-16,"PURPOSE The purpose of the paper was to conduct a legal-realist assessment of the South African prison system response to COVID-19. Severely congested and ill-resourced prison systems in Africa face unprecedented challenges amplified by COVID-19. South Africa has recorded the highest COVID-19 positivity rate in Africa and, on March 15th 2020, declared a national state of disaster. The first prison system case was notified on April 6th 2020. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A legal-realist assessment of the South African prison system response to COVID-19 in the 12 months following initial case notification focused on the minimum State obligations to comply with human rights norms, and the extent to which human, health and occupational health rights of prisoners and staff were upheld during disaster measures. FINDINGS A legal-realist account was developed, which revealed the indeterminate nature of application of South African COVID-19 government directives, ill-resourced COVID-19 mitigation measures, alarming occupational health and prison conditions and inadequate standards of health care in prisons when evaluated against the rule of law during State declaration of disaster. ORIGINALITY/VALUE This legal-realist assessment is original by virtue of its unique evaluation of the South African prison system approach to tackling COVID-19. It acknowledged State efforts, policymaking processes and outcomes and how these operated within the prison system itself. By moving beyond the deleterious impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the already precarious South African prison system, the authors argue for rights assurance for those who live and work in its prisons, improved infrastructure and greater substantive equality of all deprived of their liberty in South Africa.","Van Hout, Marie Claire; Wessels, Jakkie",International journal of prisoner health,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijph-05-2021-0046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34596983/,238
85101,Screening for Intracranial Aneurysms in Coarctation of the Aorta: A Decision and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND FLAURA, the prospective trial of osimertinib as a first-line therapy compared with first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), did not show superior survival benefit for osimertinib in either the subgroup of Asians or the subgroup with the L858R mutation. In addition, the superiority of osimertinib compared with second-generation EGFR-TKI is thus far unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS We reviewed the clinical data of all consecutive patients who were treated with osimertinib or afatinib as first-line therapy between May 2016 and October 2019 from 15 institutions in Japan. We defined the groups based on first-line EGFR-TKI as the afatinib group and the osimertinib group. Outcomes included time to discontinuation of any EGFR-TKI (TD-TKI), overall survival (OS), and time to treatment failure, with propensity score analysis carried out as an exploratory analysis in the survival and subgroup analyses. RESULTS A total of 554 patients were enrolled. Data on 326 patients in the osimertinib group, and 224 patients in the afatinib group were analyzed. TD-TKI adjusted by propensity score in the afatinib and osimertinib groups was 18.6 months (95% confidence interval 15.8 to 22.0) and 20.5 months (95% confidence interval 13.8 to not reached), respectively, without significant difference (P = 0.204). OS adjusted by propensity score favored the afatinib group with a significant difference (P = 0.018). Subgroup analysis with propensity score showed that patients with L858R and without brain metastasis had superior survival benefit with afatinib compared with osimertinib (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS TD-TKI in the afatinib group was not significantly prolonged compared with the osimertinib group in the practical data. In the exploratory analysis of patients with L858R-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer without brain metastasis, afatinib showed more benefit in OS over osimertinib.","Ito, K; Morise, M; Wakuda, K; Hataji, O; Shimokawaji, T; Takahashi, K; Furuya, N; Takeyama, Y; Goto, Y; Abe, T; Kato, T; Ozone, S; Ikeda, S; Kogure, Y; Yokoyama, T; Kimura, M; Yoshioka, H; Murotani, K; Kondo, M; Saka, H",ESMO open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984681/,238

We applied difference-in-differences models to nationally representative data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey to examine changes in unmet health-related social needs and mental health among unemployment insurance beneficiaries before and after initial expiration of FPUC. The initial expiration was associated with a 10.79-percentage-point increase in risk for self-reported missed housing payments. Further, risk for food insufficiency, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms also increased among households that reported receiving unemployment insurance benefits, relative to the period when FPUC was in effect. As further unemployment insurance reform is debated, policy makers should recognize the potential health impact of unemployment insurance.","Berkowitz, Seth A; Basu, Sanjay",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600235/,238

METHODS A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using direct and indirect data from five randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of secukinumab 150 mg every 4 weeks and ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks (IXEQ2W) or every 4 weeks (IXEQ4W) in active AS patients. RESULTS Data from 1433 patients were analyzed. The Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society evaluation 20% response rates (ASAS20) were significantly higher with secukinumab 150 mg, IXEQ2W, IXEQ2W, and adalimumab 40 mg (odds ratio [OR] 2.75, 95% Bayesian credible interval [CrI] 2.04-3.69; OR 2.59, 95% CrI 1.69-3.98; OR 2.45, 95% CrI 1.60-3.75; and OR 1.94, 95% CrI 1.13-3.37, respectively) compared to the placebo group. Efficacies of secukinumab and ixekizumab were numerically higher compared to adalimumab 40 mg, although there was no significant difference in the ASAS20 response rates. The ASAS40 response rate showed a pattern of distribution similar to the ASAS20 response rate, with the exception of the ixekizumab group, which was associated with the most favorable surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for the ASAS40 response rate. Based on the SUCRA rating, secukinumab 150 mg had the highest probability of being the best ASAS20 response rate therapy, followed by IXEQ2W, IXEQ4W, adalimumab 40 mg, and placebo. There was no significant difference between the treatments regarding the number of serious adverse events (SAEs). CONCLUSION Secukinumab and ixekizumab were effective in active AS treatment, without the risk of SAEs.","Lee, Y H; Song, G G",Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00393-020-00837-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648054/,238

METHODS We summarized and analyzed the clinical features, infection status, outcome and infection prevention and control measures of bedside blood purification treatment patients in COVID-19 isolation ward from February 8, 2020 to March 31, 2020, analyzed the COVID-19 cross-infection between the patients and medical staffs, and the blood-borne pathogens cross-infection situation between the patients, and analyzed the effect of bundle prevention and control measures in controlling the occurrence and spread of cross-infection. RESULTS A total of 101 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in this COVID-19 isolation ward, of whom 10 patients (9.90%) received bedside blood purification treatment and the blood purification treatment method was continuous hemodialysis filtration (CVVHDF), and the 10 patients received 79 times of blood purification treatment in total. The prevention and control management measures adopted included divisional isolation, patient behavior isolation and patient placement, operator personal protection and hand hygiene, dialysis waste fluid disposal, isolation room air purification, object surfaces, medical devices and medical fabrics dis-infection management. There were no occurrence and spread of COVID-19 in the medical healthcare workers and blood-borne pathogens cross-infection in the patients. And all the twice throat swabs (two sampling interval > 1 day) of the medical staffs in COVID-19 virus nucleic acid test were negative. The 2 suspected COVID-19 patients' throat swab virus nucleic acid test and the COVID-19 IgG, IgM were always both negative, the chest CT showed no viral pneumonia. CONCLUSION Bedside blood purification treatment in the COVID-19 isolation ward, the occurrence and spread of healthcare associated infection can be effectively controlled through effective infection prevention and control management, including divisional isolation, patient behavior isolation and patient placement, operator personal protection and hand hygiene, dialysis waste fluid disposal, isolation room's air purification, object surfaces, medical devices and medical fabrics disinfection, which can provide experience for diagnosis, treatment and prevention and control of patients in the respiratory infectious disease ward.","Chen, M L; Gao, Y; Guo, W; Zuo, L; Wang, T B",Beijing da xue xue bao.

86343,COVID-19 and hereditary spherocytosis: A recipe for hemolysis.,2020-07-25,"Pain is the major debilitating symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), which is difficult to treat. In OA patients joint tissue damage only poorly associates with pain, indicating other mechanisms contribute to OA pain. Immune cells regulate the sensory system, but little is known about their involvement in OA pain. Here we report that macrophages accumulate in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) distant from the site of injury in two rodent models of OA. DRG macrophages acquired a M1-like phenotype and depletion of DRG macrophages resolved OA pain in male and female mice. Sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee joint shape DRG macrophages into a M1-like phenotype. Persisting OA pain, accumulation of DRG macrophages, and their programming into M1-like phenotype was independent of Nav1.8 nociceptors. Inhibition of M1-like macrophages in the DRG, by intrathecal injection of a IL4-IL10 fusion protein or M2-like macrophages resolved persistent OA pain. In conclusion, these findings reveal a crucial role for macrophages in maintaining OA pain independent of the joint damage and suggest a new direction to treat OA pain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn osteoarthritis (OA) patients pain poorly correlates with joint tissue changes indicating mechanisms other than only tissue damage cause pain in OA. We identified that DRG containing the somata of sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee are infiltrated with macrophages that are shaped into a M1-like phenotype by sensory neurons. We show that these DRG macrophages actively maintain OA pain remotely and independent of joint damage. The phenotype of these macrophages is crucial for their pain promoting role. Targeting the phenotype of DRG macrophages with either M2-like macrophages or a cytokine fusion protein that skews macrophages into M2-like phenotype OA pain resolves pain. Our works reveals a mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of OA pain distant from the affected knee joint and suggest that dorsal root ganglia macrophages are a target to treat osteoarthritis chronic pain.","Raoof, Ramin; Martin Gil, Christian; Lafeber, Floris P J G; de Visser, Huub M; Prado, Judith; Versteeg, Sabine; Pascha, Mirte N; Heinemans, Anne L P; Adolfs, Youri; Pasterkamp, R Jeroen; Wood, John N; Mastbergen, Simon C; Eijkelkamp, Niels",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1787-20.2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400519/,238

Hoyt had the foresight to institute a digital communications platform upon which the College collected data for its clinical programs and conducted many of its meetings. Through internet portals, online communities, and social media it broadcasted news and information to the membership. When the global COVID-19 pandemic struck, the College was able to quickly mobilize its leaders and scientific experts to disseminate credible information, recommend protocols to maintain patient and provider safety in operating room environments, provide a rational scheme of prioritization of urgent surgical operations, and a sensible means of resumption of normal surgical practice. As the financial impact of the outbreak on surgical practice became apparent, the ACS represented the interests of surgeons in the White House, Capitol, federal agencies, and governors' mansions and statehouses. In an interview by Steven Wexner, a member of the ACS Board of Regents, Hoyt described the response of the ACS to an unprecedented threat to the surgical care of patients in the country and the world.

All countries collaborating in the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer were approached to participate. Experts from 28 European countries responded to a web-based survey providing data on key organisational and policy characteristics of breast screening at the national or regional level. A total of 35 responses were received including data from regionally organised breast screening in several countries. 27 respondents, covering 21 countries, reported the existence of a policy towards IFD and stated that they communicated to women about the benefit and risks. Few countries had attempted to measure the proportion of women making an informed choice. A cluster analysis of the survey responses allowed to identify three categories: countries in a confirmation phase who have adopted a policy specific to mammography screening; countries in an implementation phase with generic polices and limited administrative support dedicated yet to IFD; and countries in a decision phase who are deliberating how to address IFD. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the key policy and organisational characteristics of approaches taken to facilitate IFD in Europe. The results demonstrate a broad adoption of the principle of enabling IFD but indicate heterogeneity of implementation.","Ritchie, David; Van Hal, Guido; Van den Broucke, Stephan",Health policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2020.05.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709368/,238

METHODS We conducted this randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study in two urban emergency departments (ED). Participants who experienced head trauma and presented to our EDs within 10 days with a headache fulfilling criteria for acute post-traumatic headache were included. We randomized participants in a 1:1 ratio to M+D or placebo. Participants, care givers, and outcome assessors were blinded to assignment. The primary outcome was improvement in pain on a 0-10 scale between baseline and one hour post treatment. RESULTS This study was completed between August 2017 and March 2020.We screened 414 patients for participation and randomized 160, 81 to M+D and 79 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. All enrolled participants provided primary outcome data.

Understanding how it regulates its oxygen supply is therefore key for designing interventions to preserve its function. However, studies of neurovascular function in the hippocampus in vivo have been limited by its relative inaccessibility. Here we compared hippocampal and visual cortical neurovascular function in awake mice, using two photon imaging of individual neurons and vessels and measures of regional blood flow and haemoglobin oxygenation. We show that blood flow, blood oxygenation and neurovascular coupling were decreased in the hippocampus compared to neocortex, because of differences in both the vascular network and pericyte and endothelial cell function. Modelling oxygen diffusion indicates that these features of the hippocampal vasculature may restrict oxygen availability and could explain its sensitivity to damage during neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, where the brain's energy supply is decreased.","Shaw, K; Bell, L; Boyd, K; Grijseels, D M; Clarke, D; Bonnar, O; Crombag, H S; Hall, C N",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23508-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045465/,238

Single Port Laparoscopic Surgery (SPLS) is being increasingly employed in colorectal surgery for benign and malignant diseases. The particular role for SPLS in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has not been determined yet. In this review article we summarize technical aspects and short term results of SPLS resections in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Methods. A systematic review of the literature until January 2012 was performed. Publications were assessed for operative techniques, equipment, surgical results, hospital stay, and readmissions. Results. 34 articles, published between 2010 and 2012, were identified reporting on 301 patients with IBD that underwent surgical treatment in SPLS technique. Surgical procedures included ileocolic resections, sigmoid resections, colectomies with end ileostomy or ileorectal anastomosis, and restorative proctocolectomies with ileum-pouch reconstruction. There was a wide variety in the surgical technique and the employed equipment. The overall complication profile was similar to reports on standard laparoscopic surgery in IBD. Conclusions. In experienced hands, single port laparoscopic surgery appears to be feasible and safe for the surgical treatment of selected patients with IBD. However, evidence from prospective randomized trials is required in order to clarify whether there is a further benefit apart from the avoidance of additional trocar incisions.","Rijcken, Emile; Mennigen, Rudolf; Senninger, Norbert; Bruewer, Matthias",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/106878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22619710/,238
87880,Evaluation of cerebral oxygenation in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis.,2014,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells exploit an aberrant transcriptional program to sustain their infinite growth and progression. Emerging evidence indicates that the continuous and robust transcription of oncogenes in cancer cells is often driven by super-enhancers (SEs). In this study, we systematically compared the SE landscapes between normal liver and HCC cells and revealed that the cis-acting SE landscape was extensively reprogrammed during liver carcinogenesis. HCC cells acquired SEs at multiple prominent oncogenes to drive their vigorous expression. We identified sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) as an SE-associated oncogene, and we used this gene as an example to illustrate the impact of SEs on the activation of oncogenes in HCC. Concurrently, we also showed that the critical components of the trans-acting SE complex, namely, cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), E1A binding protein P300 (EP300), and mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1), were frequently overexpressed in human HCCs and were associated with the poor prognosis of patients with HCC. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system and specific small-molecule inhibitors, we further demonstrated that HCC cells were highly sensitive to perturbations of the SE complex. The inactivation of CDK7, BRD4, EP300, and MED1 selectively repressed the expression of SE-associated oncogenes in HCC. Finally, we demonstrated that THZ1, which is a small-molecule inhibitor of CDK7, exerted a prominent anticancer effect in both in vitro and in vivo HCC models. Conclusion: The SE landscape and machinery were significantly altered in human HCCs. HCC cells are highly susceptible to perturbations of the SE complex due to the resulting selective suppression of SE-associated oncogenes. Our results suggest that targeting SE complex is a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","Tsang, Felice Ho-Ching; Law, Cheuk-Ting; Tang, Tsz-Ching Chloe; Cheng, Carol Lai-Hung; Chin, Don Wai-Ching; Tam, Wing-Sum Vincy; Wei, Lai; Wong, Carmen Chak-Lui; Ng, Irene Oi-Lin; Wong, Chun-Ming",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.30544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30723918/,238

The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of transdisciplinary evaluation of the pre- and post-operative assessment of patients with SCRCs, from imaging to molecular investigations. METHODS Six patients with SCRCs presented with two carcinomas each. In addition to the microsatellite status (MSS), the epithelial mesenchymal transition was checked in each tumor using the biomarkers β-catenin and E-cadherin, same as KRAS and BRAF mutations. RESULTS In two of the patients, the second tumor was missed at endoscopy, but diagnosed by a subsequent computed-tomography-scan (CT-scan). From the six patients, a total of 11 adenocarcinomas (ADKs) and one squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were analyzed. All the examined carcinomas were BRAF-wildtype microsatellite stable tumors with an epithelial histological subtype. In two of the six cases, KRAS gene status showed discordance between the two synchronous tumors, with mutations in the index tumors and wildtype status in the companion ones. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative CT-scans can be useful for detection of synchronous tumors which may be missed by colonoscopy. Where synchronous tumors are identified, therapy should be based on the molecular profile of the indexed tumors.","Simu, Patricia; Jung, Ioan; Banias, Laura; Kovacs, Zsolt; Fulop, Zsolt Zoltan; Bara, Tivadar; Simu, Iunius; Gurzu, Simona",Diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11020314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671994/,238
88151,Risk factors of non-adherence to guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19 among young adults with asthma in a region with a high risk of a COVID-19 outbreak.,2020-09-02,"INTRODUCTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there are additional benefits of 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) supplementation in preventing recurrent spontaneous preterm birth in women with a prophylactic cerclage. MATERIAL AND METHODS Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO, EMBASE, Scielo and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched for studies published before June 2018. Keywords included ""preterm birth"", ""prophylactic cerclage"", ""history-indicated cerclage"", ""pregnancy"" and ""17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate"". Studies comparing history-indicated cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC were included. The primary outcome measure was preterm birth at <24 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcome measures include preterm birth at <28 weeks, <32 weeks and <37 weeks of gestation, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, fetal birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit stay, mean gestational age at delivery, fetal/neonatal death, neurological morbidity (intraventricular hemorrhage plus periventricular leukomalacia), neonatal sepsis and a composite of severe neonatal morbidity. Severe neonatal morbidity was defined as a composite measure of periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage (grades III and IV), necrotizing enterocolitis or respiratory distress syndrome. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. Risk of bias and quality assessment were performed using the ROBINS-I and GRADE tools, respectively. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42018094559. RESULTS Five studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Of the 546 women, 357 (75%) received history-indicated cerclage alone and 189 (35%) received adjuvant 17-OHPC. The composite endpoint, severe neonatal morbidity, was present in 84 of 1515 neonates. Though there was a trend toward a reduced risk of preterm birth, the summary estimate of effect was not statistically significant when comparing cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC at <24 weeks (relative risk [RR] .86, 95% confidence interval [CI] .45-1.65). Similarly, we found no differences in preterm birth at <37 weeks (RR .90, 95% CI .70-1.17) and <28 weeks (RR .85, 95% CI .54-1.32) when comparing cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC. There were no differences in fetal birthweight, respiratory distress syndrome or necrotizing enterocolitis comparing cerclage alone with cerclage+17-OHPC. CONCLUSIONS Intramuscular 17-OHPC in combination with prophylactic cerclage in women with prior preterm birth had no synergistic effect in reducing spontaneous recurrent preterm birth or improving perinatal outcomes.","Eke, Ahizechukwu C; Sheffield, Jeanne; Graham, Ernest M",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30339274/,238

In psychology, IDA has been conducted using different fixed-effects and multilevel modeling (MLM) approaches. However, evaluations regarding the performance of these models in an IDA context are limited. The goal of this article is to evaluate three fixed-effects models (aggregated vs. disaggregated vs. study-specific coefficients regressions) and two MLMs (fixed-slope vs. random-slopes MLM) for cross-sectional IDA. Using a simulation study with study sample sizes and numbers of studies consistent with applied IDA (e.g., two to 35 studies), we evaluated estimation bias and type I error rates for participant-level and study-level effects and variance components for these models; for the MLMs, we evaluated different estimation methods (i.e., constrained vs. unconstrained variance estimation and five degrees of freedom methods). Disaggregated and study-specific coefficients regressions and both MLMs yielded fixed effects estimates with ignorable bias, but only the random-slopes MLM fully modeled between-study heterogeneity and, consequently, provided well-controlled type I error rates for testing both fixed effects. Overall, we found that MLMs could be feasible under IDA conditions with three to six studies and well-chosen estimation methods. A real-data IDA example is used to illustrate and compare the application of the five models. We hope our results will help researchers choose appropriate modeling methods when conducting IDA.

The normal day-to-day routines have been altered for a number of reasons, including changes to scheduled training rotations, physical distancing requirements, trainee redeployment, and heightened level of concern. Medical educators will likely need to adapt their programs to maximize learning, maintain effective care delivery, and ensure competent graduates. Along with a continued focus on learner/faculty wellness, medical educators will have to optimize existing training experiences, adapt those that are no longer viable, employ new technologies, and be flexible when assessing competencies. These practical tips offer guidance on how to adapt medical education programs within the constraints of the pandemic landscape, stressing the need for communication, innovation, collaboration, flexibility, and planning within the era of competency-based medical education.","Hall, Andrew K; Nousiainen, Markku T; Campisi, Paolo; Dagnone, J Damon; Frank, Jason R; Kroeker, Karen I; Brzezina, Stacey; Purdy, Eve; Oswald, Anna",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1766669; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32450049/,238

In this study, we describe the use of immersive virtual reality (iVR) as a teaching aid for veterinary medicine students during their orthopedics clinical rotation. Student sentiments were assessed using voluntary electronic surveys taken by veterinary students before and after the rotation. The most noteworthy benefits students reported were improved engagement with the course content, information retention, radiographic interpretation, and clinical reasoning skills. Obstacles encountered during the initial stages of the program included financial and temporal investment in equipment and content development, technical troubleshooting, and motion sickness. Though it is unlikely that iVR will ever fully replace hands-on learning experiences, it presents an educational opportunity to supplement traditional learning methods, motivate students, and fill information gaps. As iVR technology continues to evolve and improve, potential applications in the veterinary curriculum grow, making the modality's use progressively more advantageous. Although this study describes its application in an orthopedic setting, the versatility of the iVR modality lends the potential for it to be implemented in a number of clinical and didactic settings.","McCaw, Katherine; West, Andrew; Duncan, Colleen; Frey, Danielle; Duerr, Felix",Journal of veterinary medical education,https://doi.org/10.3138/jvme-2021-0009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102095/,238
89224,Cardiac findings in pediatric patients with spinal muscular atrophy types 2 and 3.,2020-10-11,"Pioneer factors are transcriptional regulators with the capacity to bind inactive regions of chromatin and induce changes in accessibility that underpin cell fate decisions. The FOXA family of transcription factors is well understood to have pioneer capacity. Indeed, researchers have uncovered numerous examples of FOXA-dependent epigenomic modulation in developmental and disease processes. Despite the presence of FOXA being essential for correct epigenetic patterning, the need for continued FOXA presence postchromatin modulation has been debated. In a recent study in this issue of Genes & Development, Reizel and colleagues (pp. 1039-1050) show that the tissue-specific ablation of FOXA1/2/3 in the adult mouse liver results in the collapse of the epigenetic profile that maintains the hepatic gene expression profile. Thus, FOXA functions as a key, opening regions of chromatin during development, and as a doorstep, maintaining the established euchromatic structure in adult tissue.","Heslop, James A; Duncan, Stephen A",Genes & development,https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.340570.120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747476/,238

Here, we describe the concept of augmented synthetic lethality (ASL): depletion of a third gene product enhances a pre-existing synthetic lethal combination. We show that loss of the DNA repair protein XPA markedly augments the synthetic lethality between MK2 and p53, enhancing anti-tumor responses alone and in combination with cisplatin chemotherapy. Delivery of siRNA-peptide nanoplexes co-targeting MK2 and XPA to pre-existing p53-deficient tumors in a highly aggressive, immunocompetent mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma improves long-term survival and cisplatin response beyond those of the synthetic lethal p53 mutant/MK2 combination alone. These findings establish a mechanism for co-targeting DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints in combination with repair of cisplatin-DNA lesions in vivo using RNAi nanocarriers, and motivate further exploration of ASL as a generalized strategy to improve cancer treatment.","Kong, Yi Wen; Dreaden, Erik C; Morandell, Sandra; Zhou, Wen; Dhara, Sanjeev S; Sriram, Ganapathy; Lam, Fred C; Patterson, Jesse C; Quadir, Mohiuddin; Dinh, Anh; Shopsowitz, Kevin E; Varmeh, Shohreh; Yilmaz, Ömer H; Lippard, Stephen J; Reinhardt, H Christian; Hemann, Michael T; Hammond, Paula T; Yaffe, Michael B",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17958-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807787/,238
89733,The understanding of the immunopathology in COVID-19 infection.,2021-05-25,"There are many techniques for performing video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) thymectomy. This article describes one particular technique that we employ in thymectomies as well as lobectomies. The principles of both operations are as follows, and have been presented in greater detail for lobectomies previously: (I) the use of ports no greater than 5-mm in the intercostal spaces; (II) the use of a 12-mm subxiphoid port; (III) subxiphoid removal of the specimen; (IV) carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation; (V) vision enabled through a 5-mm camera; (VI) in microlobectomies, the use of a 5-mm stapling device. These principles are particularly suited to thymectomy, as there are no large vascular structures that require stapling and a large number of the instruments required for thymectomy are already 5-mm in diameter, including energy devices, graspers, clip applicators and suction devices. We believe that this technique, which eliminates the need for large incisions in the intercostal spaces, is less painful than other techniques that we have employed, including intercostal uniportal surgery. It also allows the use of CO2 insufflation, which is very useful indeed in endoscopic thymectomies. Furthermore, microthymectomy is technically easier than subxiphoid-only techniques, in that it requires little modification compared to a more conventional VATS thymectomy. We describe this technique in detail in this article.","Dunning, Joel",Annals of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.3978/j.issn.2225-319x.2015.11.04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26693152/,238
89851,Human plasma biomarker responses to inhalational general anaesthesia without surgery.,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND Ventral rectopexy to the promontory has become one of the most strongly advocated surgical treatments for patients with full-thickness rectal prolapse and deep enterocele. Despite its challenges, laparoscopic ventral rectopexy with or without robotic assistance for selected patients can be performed with relatively minimal patient trauma thus creating the potential for same-day discharge. The aim of this prospective case-controlled study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and cost of day case robotic ventral rectopexy compared with routine day case laparoscopic ventral rectopexy. METHODS Between February 28, 2014 and March 3, 2015, 20 consecutive patients underwent day case laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for total rectal prolapse or deep enterocele at Michallon University Hospital, Grenoble. Patients were selected for day case surgery on the basis of motivation, favorable social circumstances, and general fitness. One out of every two patients underwent the robotic procedure (n = 10). Demographics, technical results, and costs were compared between both groups. RESULTS Patients from both groups were comparable in terms of demographics and technical results. Patients operated on with the robot had significantly less pain (p = 0.045). Robotic rectopexy was associated with longer median operative time (94 vs 52.5 min, p < 0.001) and higher costs (9088 vs 3729 euros per procedure, p < 0.001) than laparoscopic rectopexy. CONCLUSIONS Day case robotic ventral rectopexy is feasible and safe, but results in longer operative time and higher costs than classical laparoscopic ventral rectopexy for full-thickness rectal prolapse and enterocele.","Faucheron, J-L; Trilling, B; Barbois, S; Sage, P-Y; Waroquet, P-A; Reche, F",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-016-1518-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27530905/,238

A major sensor of DNA that triggers the innate immune response is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which produces the second messenger cGAMP. cGAMP activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which activates a signaling cascade leading to the production of type I interferons and other immune mediators. Recent research has demonstrated an expanding role of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway in many physiological and pathological processes, including host defense against microbial infections, anti-tumor immunity, cellular senescence, autophagy, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Biochemical and structural studies have elucidated the mechanism of signal transduction in the cGAS pathway at the atomic resolution. This review focuses on the structural and mechanistic insights into the roles of cGAS and STING in immunity and diseases revealed by these recent studies.","Zhang, Xuewu; Bai, Xiao-Chen; Chen, Zhijian J",Immunity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.05.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668227/,238

Despite recent reports of ubiquitous invertebrate decline, the ecosystem consequences have been rarely documented. We exposed standardized plant communities grown in the iDiv Ecotron to different levels of invertebrate numbers and biomass and tracked effects on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities associated with flowers and leaves of Scorzoneroides autumnalis and Trifolium pratense using next-generation 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our data indicate that invertebrate decline reduces bacterial richness and $\beta $-diversity and alters community composition. These effects may result from direct effects of invertebrates that may serve as dispersal agents of bacteria; or from indirect effects where animal-induced changes in the plant's phenotype shape the niches plants provide for bacterial colonizers. Because bacteria are usually not dispersal limited and because species sorting, i.e. niche-based processes, has been shown to be a dominant process in bacterial community assembly, indirect effects may be more likely. Given that a healthy microbiome is of fundamental importance for the wellbeing of plant, animals (including humans), and ecosystems, a loss of bacterial diversity may be a dramatic yet previously unknown consequence of current invertebrate decline.","Junker, Robert R; Eisenhauer, Nico; Schmidt, Anja; Türke, Manfred",FEMS microbiology ecology,https://doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiab088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151344/,238
90173,Cancer Risk in Families Fulfilling the Amsterdam Criteria for Lynch Syndrome.,2017,"BACKGROUND Attention to global health security governance is more important now than ever before. Scientists predict that a possible influenza pandemic could affect 1.5 billion people, cause up to 150 million deaths and leave US$3 trillion in economic damages. A public health emergency in one country is now only hours away from affecting many others. METHODS Using regime analysis from political science, the principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures by which states govern health security are examined in the historical context of their punctuated evolution. This methodology illuminates the catalytic agents of change, distributional consequences and possible future orders that can help to better inform progress in this area. FINDINGS Four periods of global health security governance are identified. The first is characterized by unilateral quarantine regulations (1377-1851), the second by multiple sanitary conferences (1851-92), the third by several international sanitary conventions and international health organizations (1892-1946) and the fourth by the hegemonic leadership of the World Health Organization (1946-????). This final regime, like others before it, is challenged by globalization (e.g. limitations of the new International Health Regulations), changing diplomacy (e.g. proliferation of global health security organizations), new tools (e.g. global health law, human rights and health diplomacy) and shock-activated vulnerabilities (e.g. bioterrorism and avian/swine influenza). This understanding, in turn, allows us to appreciate the impact of this evolving regime on class, race and gender, as well as to consider four possible future configurations of power, including greater authority for the World Health Organization, a concert of powers, developing countries and civil society organizations. CONCLUSIONS This regime analysis allows us to understand the evolution, etiology and eventualities of the global health security regime, which is essential for national and international health policymakers, practitioners and academics to know where and how to act effectively in preparation for tomorrow's challenges.","Hoffman, Steven J",Health policy and planning,https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czq037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20732860/,238

STUDY DESIGN Data were collected during a prospective observational near-infrared spectroscopy survey conducted on a convenience sample of 500-1250 g neonates during the first 10 postnatal days. A before-after analysis of UA blood sampling effects on CrSO2 absolute values and variability was performed. The present analysis was not designed a priori and was conducted following the bedside observation of CrSO2 decrements contiguous with UA blood draws. RESULTS Fifteen very low birth weight neonates had 201 UA blood draws. Baseline CrSO2 (mean ± SEM) decreased following UA blood sampling, from 70 ± 1% to a nadir of 63 ± 1% (P < .001) occurring 4 ± 3 (range 2-24) minutes following blood draws. CrSO2 subsequently increased to 70 ± 1% (P < .001 compared with nadir) at 10 ± 4 (range 4-28) minutes following UA blood sampling. Coefficients of variation (mean ± SEM) increased from 0.02 ± 0.001 at baseline to 0.05 ± 0.004 (P < .001), followed by a decrease to 0.03 ± 0.003 (P < .001 for all comparisons), thus denoting increased CrSO2 variability following UA blood sampling. CONCLUSIONS UA blood sampling is associated with significant CrSO2 decrements with increased variability over clinically significant intervals.

Currently, little is known of how the pandemic has impacted patients with cardiovascular disease. The primary focus of this study was to determine whether emergency cardiovascular surgeries can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Between 17 January 2020 and 11 February 2020, 13 patients were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital for emergency cardiovascular surgery. During this time, Wuhan was a COVID-19 epicenter, and Wuhan Union Hospital is a sentinel hospital located in this area. These patients' epidemiological histories, clinical records, laboratory assessments, imaging findings, and surgical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Throat swabs were collected from some patients preoperatively and all patients postoperatively for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to determine whether these patients had COVID-19. Results This cohort included 5 cases of acute aortic dissection, 3 cases of congenital heart disease, 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with end-stage heart failure, 1 case of aortocoronary fistula that had undergone previous surgery, 1 case of subacute infective endocarditis with cerebral infarction, and 1 case of multivessel coronary disease. Six patients were suspected COVID-19 cases (46.2%). There were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in this cohort. None of the patients in this cohort died and none developed severe acute respiratory syndrome, renal failure, or septic shock after surgery. No cross-infection occurred with other patients or medical staff who came into close contact with this cohort. Conclusions Emergency surgery is crucial and unavoidable for many patients with acute and severe cardiovascular disease, regardless of the pandemic. Our study indicates that, with adequate preparation and the provision of appropriate treatment, satisfactory outcomes can be achieved for such patients.","Hu, Xingjian; Wang, Yin; Xia, Jiahong; Dong, Nianguo; Shi, Jiawei",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-1649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282367/,238
90668,Current prevalence of self-monitoring of blood pressure during pregnancy: the BUMP Survey.,2021-01-04,"Background and Purpose- Relative signal intensity of acute ischemic stroke lesions in fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery relative signal intensity [FLAIR-rSI]) magnetic resonance imaging is associated with time elapsed since stroke onset with higher intensities signifying longer time intervals. In the randomized controlled WAKE-UP trial (Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke Trial), intravenous alteplase was effective in patients with unknown onset stroke selected by visual assessment of diffusion weighted imaging fluid-attenuated inversion recovery mismatch, that is, in those with no marked fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the region of the acute diffusion weighted imaging lesion. In this post hoc analysis, we investigated whether quantitatively measured FLAIR-rSI modifies treatment effect of intravenous alteplase. Methods- FLAIR-rSI of stroke lesions was measured relative to signal intensity in a mirrored region in the contralesional hemisphere. The relationship between FLAIR-rSI and treatment effect on functional outcome assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) after 90 days was analyzed by binary logistic regression using different end points, that is, favorable outcome defined as mRS score of 0 to 1, independent outcome defined as mRS score of 0 to 2, ordinal analysis of mRS scores (shift analysis). All models were adjusted for National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at symptom onset and stroke lesion volume. Results- FLAIR-rSI was successfully quantified in stroke lesions in 433 patients (86% of 503 patients included in WAKE-UP). Mean FLAIR-rSI was 1.06 (SD, 0.09). Interaction of FLAIR-rSI and treatment effect was not significant for mRS score of 0 to 1 (P=0.169) and shift analysis (P=0.086) but reached significance for mRS score of 0 to 2 (P=0.004). We observed a smooth continuing trend of decreasing treatment effects in relation to clinical end points with increasing FLAIR-rSI. Conclusions- In patients in whom no marked parenchymal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity was detected by visual judgement in the WAKE-UP trial, higher FLAIR-rSI of diffusion weighted imaging lesions was associated with decreased treatment effects of intravenous thrombolysis. This parallels the known association of treatment effect and elapsing time of stroke onset.","Cheng, Bastian; Boutitie, Florent; Nickel, Alina; Wouters, Anke; Cho, Tae-Hee; Ebinger, Martin; Endres, Matthias; Fiebach, Jochen B; Fiehler, Jens; Galinovic, Ivana; Puig, Josep; Thijs, Vincent; Lemmens, Robin; Muir, Keith W; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Pedraza, Salvador; Simonsen, Claus Z; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.119.027390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662118/,238

Besides having great impact on public health, this phenomenon raises the question if immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after primary challenge, and despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease.","Brustolin, Marco; Rodon, Jordi; Rodríguez de la Concepción, María Luisa; Ávila-Nieto, Carlos; Cantero, Guillermo; Pérez, Mónica; Te, Nigeer; Noguera-Julián, Marc; Guallar, Víctor; Valencia, Alfonso; Roca, Núria; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Blanco, Julià; Clotet, Bonaventura; Bensaid, Albert; Carrillo, Jorge; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Segalés, Joaquim",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1913974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33825619/,238

In this article we discussed the potential of Positive Technology to augment and enhance the existing strategies for generating psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular different positive technologies-m-Health and smartphone apps, stand-alone and social virtual reality, video games, exergames, and social technologies-have the potential of enhancing different critical features of our personal experience-affective quality, engagement/actualization, and connectedness-that are challenged by the pandemic and its social and economic effects. In conclusion, although the focus of tackling the direct impact of COVID-19 is important, positive technologies can be extremely useful to reduce the psychological burden of the pandemic and to help individuals in flourishing even during difficult and complex times.","Riva, Giuseppe; Mantovani, Fabrizia; Wiederhold, Brenda K","Cyberpsychology, behavior and social networking",https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.29194.gri; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833511/,238

Methods: Using a church-based participatory approach, I conducted a rapid ethnographic assessment, part of which included an online survey (N=137). Results: I found that 54.74% of the sample of reported hazardous drinking over the past 12 months, 33.48% reported driving under the influence at some point in life, and 0% sought any treatment. Participant observation and unstructured interviews revealed that at this particular church, drunkenness was considered sinful among key informants, but many church members still drank heavily, often with other church members. Conclusion: We observed an interaction between religious and drinking cultures among second generation Korean American young and middle aged adults. Future research can explore the potential ways in which Korean Americans accommodate religious proscriptions and heavy drinking, and how awareness of discrepancies between behaviors and values may figure into preventive interventions.","Oh, Hans Y",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2020.1818104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912035/,238
91792,Gamut of cardiac manifestations and complications of COVID-19: a contemporary review.,2020-10-19,"INTRODUCTION At present, neither specific curative treatment nor vaccines for novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) are available. There is an urgent need to look for alternative strategies for COVID-19 treatment especially in the case of severe and/or critically ill patients with cytokine release syndrome (CRS). AIM Convalescent plasma proved to increase survival rates in other severe viral infections. Therefore, convalescent plasma could be a promising treatment option for severe COVID-19 patients. METHOD In our article, we present the first two critically ill Hungarian patients with COVID-19 infection treated with convalescent fresh frozen plasma. RESULTS At the time of plasma therapy both patients were on mechanical ventilation and received antiviral agents and a full scale of supportive care. Each patient received 3 × 200 mL of convalescent plasma of recently recovered donors with sufficient novel anti-coronavirus IgG titers. Subsequent to convalescent plasma infusion, oxygenization improved and inflammatory markers decreased in both individuals. As compared to pretransfusion, lymphocyte counts increased and interleukin-6 level lessened. Both patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. No severe adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS Our experience indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is well tolerated and could potentially improve clinical outcomes. Optimal dose and timing as well as precise assessment of clinical benefit of convalescent plasma therapy will need further investigation in larger, well-controlled trials. This is the first report of the successful use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection in Hungary.

92065,Circulating CD34+VEGFR-2+ endothelial progenitor cells correlate with revascularization-mediated long-term improvement of cardiac function in patients with coronary chronic total occlusions.,2020-08-15,"PURPOSE The lack of reliable testing methods limits the evidence-based practice of surgical sealants in treating alveolar air leak (AAL). We developed an in vitro lung model to evaluate sealants' efficacy and tested the widely used human thrombin-fibrinogen sponge, TachoSil as an example. MATERIALS AND METHODS The caudal lobe of freshly excised swine lung (n = 10) was intubated and ventilated. A focal superficial parenchymal defect (40 × 25 mm) was created in the inflated lung. AAL was assessed with increasing inspired tidal volume (TVi). After sealant application, AAL was assessed in the same way until burst failure, defined as an AAL exceeding 20 mL. To evaluate the elasticity of the sealant, the length of defect was recorded in the inflated lung. RESULTS Superficial parenchymal defects resulted in AAL increasing with ascending TVi. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed strong correlation between AAL and maximal inspiratory pressure, compliance and resistance. At TVi = 400, 500, and 600 mL, TachoSil achieved sealing in ten, eight, and seven tests, respectively. As TVi increased, superficial defects were still sealed in four, two, and two tests at TVi = 700, 800, and 900 mL, respectively. The burst pressure was 42 ± 5 cmH2O. Adhesive failures were found at the burst pressure in all tests. Concerning elasticity, TachoSil allowed an expansion of the covered lung defect of 7 ± 6 mm. CONCLUSIONS TachoSil demonstrated a strong sealing efficiency and marked elasticity in treating AAL. These results are consistent to that of the previously published animal experiment, suggesting the reliability of the presented in vitro model.","Zhang, Ruoyu; Bures, Maximilian; Höffler, Hans-Klaus; Jonigk, Danny; Haverich, Axel; Krüger, Marcus",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.3109/08941939.2015.1010023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26204492/,238

In Bangladesh, the government mostly uses the preparedness policy for pandemic outbreak case management. With regard to the limitations arising from the pandemic outbreak the current research will investigate the following questions: when facing a devastating situation, what exactly is the nature of the pandemic outbreak management model incorporated at the governmental level? Keeping these questions in mind, the intention of the existing model is to provide smooth and appropriate assistance to recover from a pandemic outbreak, and to implement effective governance of the situation. This research will identify deficiencies in the current epidemic management policy in Bangladesh, and will assist in forming a new model and developing a systematic procedure for managing future pandemic outbreak situations. The main deficiency in Bangladesh's pandemic management is that the policy paper has failed to identify all hazardous events that may occur in a pandemic outbreak. In most cases, it has underestimated the issues of bioethical responsibility toward the different stakeholders affected during the devastating situation of a pandemic outbreak. The policy does not emphasize the bioethical model; therefore, it fails to encourage support for either public protection or an ethically friendly management system. The model proposed in this article demonstrates an appropriate way to reduce or, if possible, avoid potential damages and losses from a pandemic outbreak. The model aims to prioritize the problems that need assistance to recover from the outbreak.","Bhuiyan, A S M Anwarullah",Developing world bioethics,https://doi.org/10.1111/dewb.12287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32893429/,238

Numerous studies on ARC show that its beneficial health effects correlate with the health effects of both BGP and B. dracunculifolia. Its wide range of pharmacological benefits include antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, gastroprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-cancer effects. Most studies have focused on anti-oxidation, inflammation, diabetic, and cancers using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Mechanisms underlying anti-cancer properties of ARC are apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, and the inhibition of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), a protein characterized in many human diseases/disorders including COVID-19 infection. Therefore, further pre-clinical and clinical studies with ARC are necessary to explore its potential as intervention for a wide variety of diseases including the recent pandemic coronaviral infection. This review summarizes the comprehensive data on the pharmacological effects of ARC and could be a guideline for its future study and therapeutic usage.","Shahinozzaman, Md; Basak, Bristy; Emran, Rashiduzzaman; Rozario, Patricia; Obanda, Diana",Fitoterapia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2020.104775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152464/,238

Methods We performed global micro-RNA (miRNA) analysis in plasma in two cohorts encompassing 375 individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with late diabetic kidney disease and targeted proteomics analysis in plasma in four cohorts encompassing 746 individuals with late and early diabetic kidney disease. We examined structural lesions in kidney biopsies from the 105 individuals with early diabetic kidney disease. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the effects of miRNA mimics or inhibitors on regulation of candidate proteins. Results In the late diabetic kidney disease cohorts, we identified 17 circulating miRNAs represented by four exemplars (miR-1287-5p, miR-197-5p, miR-339-5p, miR-328-3p), which were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD. These miRNAs targeted proteins in the axon guidance pathway. Circulating levels of six of these proteins-most notably EFNA4 and EPHA2-were strongly associated with 10-year risk of ESKD in all cohorts. Furthermore, circulating levels of these proteins correlated with severity of structural lesions in kidney biopsies. In contrast, expression levels of genes encoding these proteins had no apparent effects on the lesions. In in vitro experiments, mimics of miR-1287-5p and miR-197-5p and inhibitors of miR-339-5p and miR328-3p upregulated concentrations of EPHA2 in either cell lysate, supernatant, or both. Conclusions This study reveals novel mechanisms involved in progression to ESKD and points to the importance of systemic factors in the development of diabetic kidney disease. Some circulating miRNAs and axon guidance pathway proteins represent potential targets for new therapies to prevent and treat this condition.","Satake, Eiichiro; Saulnier, Pierre-Jean; Kobayashi, Hiroki; Gupta, Manoj; Looker, Helen; Wilson, Jonathan; Md Dom, Zaipul; Ihara, Katsuhito; O'Neil, Kristina; Krolewski, Bozena; Pipino, Caterina; Pavkov, Meda; Nair, Viji; Bitzer, Markus; Niewczas, Monika; Kretzler, Matthias; Mauer, Michael; Doria, Alessandro; Najafian, Behzad; Kulkarni, Rohit; Duffin, Kevin; Pezzolesi, Marcus; Kahn, C Ronald; Nelson, Robert; Krolewski, Andrzej",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2021010105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140396/,238

Pregnant cows (n = 75) were randomly assigned to fescue endophyte type: 1) endophyte-infected ergot alkaloid producing tall fescue (E+) or 2) novel endophyte-infected, non-toxic tall fescue (NOV) within maternal (A|A, n = 38 and G|G, n = 37) DRD2 genotype to examine changes in cow/calf performance and milk production during late gestation and early lactation. Grazing E+ fescue pastures during late gestation reduced cow body weight gain but did not alter calf birth weight compared to NOV. Milk production and calf ADG during the first 30 day of lactation were lower for E+ than NOV. The calving rate was reduced, but not calving interval for E+ cows. The adjusted 205-day weight of calves was lower in those grazing E+ with their dams compared to NOV. There were no interactions between DRD2 genotype and fescue endophyte type indicating that genotype was not associated with response to E+ fescue in this study. Overall, grazing NOV tall fescue pastures rather than E+ during critical stages of production improved cow gain during late gestation, calving rate, early milk production and calf growth.","Wilbanks, Sarah A; Justice, Susan Maggie; West, Thomas; Klotz, James L; Andrae, John G; Duckett, Susan K",Toxins,https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins13030195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803203/,238

METHODS A wellness program was established to address institutional and personal factors of burnout. The program focused on interventions to improve efficiency of practice, provide personal and career support, and create a culture of wellness. The components of the program were designed with input from radiology faculty, and the program was financially supported by the hospital's physician organization. A survey was performed 6 months after the initiation of the program to determine radiologist engagement and satisfaction. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new survey was administered to identify needs of faculty and adjust initiatives. This study was exempt from institutional review board approval. RESULTS The majority of radiologists (79%) agreed or strongly agreed that the wellness program provided opportunities to connect with coworkers. All radiologists agreed that the program was helpful and should be continued. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 49% of physicians requested initiatives focused on well-being, emotional health, and mindfulness to support them during the crisis. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of a faculty wellness program in an academic radiology department addressed institutional and personal factors of burnout, allowed faculty to connect with coworkers, and was found to be helpful by all radiologists. The COVID-19 pandemic shifted needs to well-being and emotional health initiatives. Follow-up data are necessary to assess its effect on burnout reduction.","Buch, Karen A; Daye, Dania; Wood, Monica J; Alvarez, Carmen; Del Carmen, Marcela G; Mehta, Darshan H; Bredella, Miriam A",Journal of the American College of Radiology : JACR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958082/,238

We report a multicenter experience using a combined aspiration and stent retriever technique for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 32 consecutive MT patients using a novel, combined approach of Stent retriever Assisted Vacuum-locked Extraction (SAVE) by 3 operators at 3 stroke centers. Primary endpoint was successful first-pass reperfusion with a modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) score of 3. Secondary endpoints were number of passes, time from groin puncture to reperfusion, embolization to new territories (ENT), postinterventional symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and clinical outcome at discharge. RESULTS First-pass mTICI 3 reperfusion was achieved in 23 out of 32 patients (72%) with a mean groin puncture to reperfusion time of 36.0 min ± 15.8 and mTICI 3 was accomplished in 25 out of 32 cases (78%) with a maximum of 3 attempts. Successful reperfusion (mTICI ≥ 2b) was achieved in all patients (100%) with a mean time from groin puncture to reperfusion of 44.5 min ± 25.8 and an average of 1.2 ± 0.7 attempts. The rate of ENT was 0% and 1 patient with sICH after MT died on postoperative day 4. At discharge, the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 4 (range 0-17) and favorable neurological outcome by the modified Rankin score (mRS ≤ 2) was achieved in 19 out of 32 patients (59%).

We demonstrated that HOCl is unstable against ultraviolet (UV) light, sunshine, contact with air, and elevated temperature (≧25℃). Furthermore, in the HOCl solution, the presence of excess NH2- or CHO-containing organic compounds such as proteins and carbohydrates, or of inorganic ions such as NO2-, SO3-, PO3-, Fe2+, Cu2+, and CuS, resulted in the rapid consumption of HOCl by oxidation reactions, and significantly decreased the microbicidal activity of the HOCl solution against coliform bacteria and total viable cell count. Thus, production of stable HOCl solution requires formulation in pure water harboring concentrations as low as possible of various compounds and ions, as well as storage in dark and cool conditions (<10℃) to maintain the concentration of HOCl molecules and microbicidal activity.","Ishihara, Masayuki; Murakami, Kaoru; Fukuda, Koichi; Nakamura, Shingo; Kuwabara, Masahiro; Hattori, Hidemi; Fujita, Masanori; Kiyosawa, Tomoharu; Yokoe, Hidetaka",Biocontrol science,https://doi.org/10.4265/bio.22.223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29279579/,238

96351,Changes in the electroencephalogram during anaesthesia and their physiological basis.,2015,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) has gained worldwide acceptance, due to its minimally invasive character, feasibility and low rate of complications. Animal experiments have shown marked adhesions to the intraperitoneal mesh (IPM), the clinical consequences being unclear. This study aimed to describe the extension of adhesions to the mesh, 5-7 years after LVHR, using two validated non-invasive radiologic methods. METHODS Real-time transabdominal ultrasonography (TAU) and cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to 30 patients with prior LVHR and implantation of IPM (Intramesh W3, Cousin Biotech, France). The visceral slide was measured in nine predefined abdominal segments. Values <or=1 cm were defined as an area with adhesion. RESULTS The mean time between LVHR and TAU/cine MRI was 67 months (range, 58-80 months). We found adhesion to the mesh in 90% of the patients using TAU and 100% of the patients using cine MRI. In the latter, 65% were between the bowel and IPM. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is known to reduce recurrences and postoperative complications, while improving patient outcome. The intraperitoneal placement of the mesh has been shown to induce adhesions; the amount and extension in the clinical setting is unclear. The present study showed a marked proportion of adhesions to the mesh with an average surgery to scan time of 5.6 years, despite an anti-adhesive barrier on the visceral surface of the mesh. Together with existing data, this result increases the concern related to the long-term consequences of an IPM. As a consequence, a comprehensive and comparable test system for medical devices, i.e. IPM, is needed.","Zinther, N B; Zeuten, A; Marinovskij, E; Haislund, M; Friis-Andersen, H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-010-0676-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20490585/,238

The uptake of different assessment and optimisation strategies is variable. The aim of this study was to explore healthcare professional opinion about these issues using a mixed methods design. METHODS Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with healthcare professionals from a single UK region involved in the treatment, assessment and optimisation of colorectal surgery patients. Interviews were analysed using the Framework approach. An online questionnaire survey was subsequently designed and disseminated to UK surgeons to quantitatively assess the importance of interview themes. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse questionnaire data. RESULTS Thirty-seven healthcare professionals out of 42 approached (response rate 88%) were interviewed across five hospitals in the South Yorkshire region. Three broad themes were developed: attitudes towards treatment of the older patient, methods of assessment of suitability and optimisation strategies. The questionnaire was completed by 103 out of an estimated 256 surgeons (estimated response rate 40.2%). There was a difference in opinion regarding the role of major surgery in older patients, particularly when there is co-existing dementia. Assessment was not standardised. Access to optimisation strategies was limited, particularly in the emergency setting. CONCLUSION There is wide variation in the process of assessment and provision of optimisation strategies in UK practice. Lack of evidence-based guidelines, cost and time constraints restrict the development of services and pathways. Differences in opinion between surgeons towards patients with frailty or dementia may account for some of the variation in colorectal cancer outcomes.","Daniels, S L; Burton, M; Lee, M J; Moug, S; Kerr, K; Wilson, T R; Brown, S R; Wyld, L",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046988/,238

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data of confirmed COVID-19 outpatients over a 4-month period were analyzed retrospectively. Public Health Management System (HSYS) was used for the case-based follow-up. Patients on antiviral therapy for at least five days, including hydroxychloroquine and / or favipiravir and patients who were followed-up for 30 days were included in this analysis. RESULTS We enrolled 1489 patients in this study. Overall, 775 (52%) patients were male and a mean age of patients was 38.9±11.1 years. Of these patients, 537 of them were received favipiravir, 545 of them were received hydroxychloroquine and 407 of them were received both favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. Symptoms improvement on the 14th day of follow-up was 1.8 times higher in the group of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine compared to patients who received favipiravir (p=0.003). On the 3rd day of follow-up, PCR negativity rate was higher in patients who received hydroxychloroquine (p=0.004). Hospitalization rates were similar in patients receiving favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine (p=0.144). However, in the presence of pneumonia at the time of diagnosis, the hospitalization rate was 6.6 times higher in patients who received favipiravir than those who received hydroxychloroquine.

98112,Prevention of periprosthetic joint infection: what are the effective strategies?,2014,"Since the outbreak of the pandemic, anecdotal observations have been accumulating rapidly that sudden anosmia and dysgeusia are peculiar symptoms associated with the COVID-19 infection. Prof C. Hopkins, as President of British Rhinological Society, published a letter describing ""the loss of sense of smell as a marker of COVID-19 infection"" and proposed that adults presenting with anosmia but no other symptoms should self-isolate for seven days. The Hopkins team published the first case report and case series as well as other evidence that isolated sudden onset anosmia (ISOA), should be considered highly suspicious for SARS-CoV-2(1). Subsequently, a larger series of 2428 patients presenting with new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported, of whom 16% report loss of sense of smell as an isolated symptom. Only 51% reported the recognized symptoms of cough or fever.

FD treatment planning using computational virtual stenting and flow simulation requires accurate representation of the expanded FD geometry. We have recently developed a high fidelity virtual stenting (HiFiVS) technique based on finite element analysis to simulate detailed FD deployment processes in patient-specific aneurysms (Ma et al. J. Biomech. 45:2256-2263,(2012)). This study tests if HiFiVS simulation can recapitulate real-life FD implantation. We deployed two identical FDs (Pipeline Embolization Device) into phantoms of a wide-necked segmental aneurysm using a clinical push-pull technique with different delivery wire advancements. We then simulated these deployment processes using HiFiVS and compared results against experimental recording. Stepwise comparison shows that the simulations precisely reproduced the FD deployment processes recorded in vitro. The local metal coverage rate and pore density quantifications demonstrated that simulations reproduced detailed FD mesh geometry. These results provide validation of the HiFiVS technique, highlighting its unique capability of accurately representing stent intervention in silico.","Ma, Ding; Dumont, Travis M; Kosukegawa, Hiroyuki; Ohta, Makoto; Yang, Xinjian; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui",Annals of biomedical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-013-0808-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23604850/,238

Consequently, the pollution of the soil with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is of great concern to humanity. The objective of this study is to investigate the source apportionment, concentration levels and spatial distribution of PTEs in selected soils in Frýdek-Místek District of the Czech Republic. The total number of soil samples was 70 (topsoil 49 and 21 subsoils) and was analysed using a portable XRF machine. Contamination factor and the pollution index load were used for the assessment and interpreting the pollution and distribution of PTEs in the soils. The inverse distance weighting was used for the spatial evaluation of the PTEs. The results of the analysis showed that the area is composed of low-to-high pollution site. PTEs displayed spatial variation patterns. The average PTE concentration decreases in this Fe > Ti > Ba > Zr > Rb > Sr > Cr > Y>Cu > Ni > Th order for the topsoil and also decreases in this Fe > Ti > Zr > Ba > Rb > Sr > Cr > Y > Cu > Ni > and Th order for the subsoil. These PTEs Cr, Ni, Cu, Rb, Y, Zr, Ba, Th, and Fe were far above the baseline European average value and the World average value level, respectively. The source apportionment showed the dominance of Cr, Ni, Rb, Ti, Th, Zr, Cu, Fe in the topsoil, while the subsoil was dominated by all the PTEs (factor 1 to 6) except Ba. The study concludes that indiscriminate human activities have an enormous effect on soil pollution.","Agyeman, Prince Chapman; Ahado, Samuel Kudjo; Kingsley, John; Kebonye, Ndiye Michael; Biney, James Kobina Mensah; Borůvka, Luboš; Vasat, Radim; Kocarek, Martin",Environmental geochemistry and health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10653-020-00743-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079286/,238

Methods We searched Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CBM, Wanfang Data and CNKI from their inception to March 31, 2020. In addition, we searched related studies on COVID-19 published before March 31, 2020 through Google Scholar. We evaluated the risk of bias of included studies, and synthesized the results using a qualitative synthesis. Results Six studies met our inclusion criteria. Five studies on SARS showed an overall risk of death of 7.2% to 20.0%. One study of SARS patients who used macrolides, quinolones or beta lactamases showed that the mean duration of hospital stay was 14.2, 13.8 and 16.2 days, respectively, and their average duration of fever was 14.3, 14.0 and 16.2 days, respectively. One cohort study on MERS indicated that macrolide therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in 90-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.47-1.51, P=0.56) and improvement in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted HR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.47-1.64, P=0.68). According to the findings of 33 studies, the proportion of antibiotics use ranged from 19.4% to 100.0% in children and 13.2% to 100.0% in adults, despite the lack of etiological evidence. The most commonly used antibiotics in adults were quinolones, cephalosporins and macrolides and in children meropenem and linezolid. Conclusions The benefits of antibiotic agents for adults with SARS or MERS were questionable in the absence of bacterial coinfections. There is no evidence to support the use of antibiotic agents for children with COVID-19 in the absence of bacterial coinfection.","Wang, Jianjian; Tang, Yuyi; Ma, Yanfang; Zhou, Qi; Li, Weiguo; Baskota, Muna; Yang, Yinmei; Wang, Xingmei; Li, Qingyuan; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566556/,238

The efavirenz population pharmacokinetic profile among HIV-positive smokers is still unknown. We aimed to assess the association of smoking with efavirenz and the differences in HIV clinical outcomes. METHODS A total of 154 stable HIV-positive patients on efavirenz in northern Malaysia were recruited with a sparse sampling for this multicentre prospective cohort study. The association between smoking and efavirenz pharmacokinetic parameters was determined using the non-linear mixed-effect model (NONMEM). A mixture model of clearance was adopted to describe the metaboliser status because genetic data is unavailable. The effect of smoking on HIV clinical markers (CD4, CD4/CD8 ratio and viral blips) for at least two years after the antiretroviral initiation was also investigated. RESULTS Our data were best fitted with a one-compartment mixture model with first-order absorption without lag time. Smoking significantly associated with higher clearance (CL/F) (β = 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07 to 1.91), while weight affected both CL/F and volume (V/F). From the mixture model, 20% of patients were in the slow clearance group, which mimic the genotype distribution of slow metaboliser. An efavirenz dose reduction is not recommended for smokers ≥60kg with normal metabolism rate. Smoking significantly associated with slower normalisation of CD4 and CD4/CD8 ratio. CONCLUSION HIV-positive smokers presented with significantly higher efavirenz clearance and unfavourable clinical outcomes. Close monitoring of adherence and clinical response among smokers is warranted.","Chow, Ngah Kuan; Harun, Sabariah Noor; Wong, E-Jinq; Low, Lee Lee; Sheikh Ghadzi, Siti Maisharah; Khan, Amer Hayat",British journal of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33608883/,238

Exhaustive analysis from the Rhone-Alpes region.,2020-09-07,"Violence against children occurs in all countries, affecting children of all ages, genders, race and socio-economic strata. A multiplicity of factors contributes to children's experience of violence. Social and gender norms can act as risk and protective factors exposing children to violence or preventing them from having well-being and healthy development. This Special Symposium was conceived of during the first International Viable and Operable Ideas for Child Equality (VOICE) Conference in 2018 in Bali, Indonesia. The four manuscripts in this Special Symposium illustrate with evidence the importance of social norms to preventing violence against children and the importance of understanding norms in context. The authors find that understanding how geographic location, social cohesion, group roles and identities, age and gendered expectations inform whether, when and which children experience violence, who perpetrates it, and how individuals and communities respond to it. The global COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated how rapidly behaviours can shift towards caregiving and health, as well as against it. If we are to prevent violence against children, and ensure the safety, well-being, and opportunity to thrive for all children, advancing our understanding of norms in relation to violence against children is critical to effective programming and learning.","Kohli, Anjalee; Agastya, Ni Luh Putu Maitra; Cislaghi, Ben; Schulte, Marie-Celine",Global public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1921240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024252/,238

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-3). SETTING Academic center. PATIENTS All patients undergoing fresh IVF-ET between January 2004 and July 2013 after treatment of an ectopic pregnancy with MTX or salpingectomy in the preceding IVF-ET cycle were analyzed for potential inclusion. INTERVENTION MTX or laparoscopic salpingectomy for an ectopic pregnancy followed by a subsequent IVF-ET cycle. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 144 patients with sonographically confirmed ectopic pregnancies were identified during the study period. Of these, 107 (74.3%) patients were treated with MTX and 37 (25.7%) were treated with laparoscopic salpingectomy. Eighty-eight patients (82.2%) in the MTX group and 22 patients (59.4%) patients in the salpingectomy group underwent a subsequent IVF-ET cycle. There were no significant differences in demographic data or baseline cycle characteristics between the 2 groups. No difference was observed in basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level before and after MTX or salpingectomy treatment. Indicators of ovarian responsiveness, including total days of stimulation, total dosage of gonadotropins, and number of mature oocytes before and after either treatment, were comparable in the 2 groups. The number of doses of MTX (1 vs > 1) did not correlate with changes in ovarian response. The pregnancy outcomes, specifically live birth, were equivalent in the 2 groups. Comparing post-MTX cycles and post-salpingectomy cycles, patients in the latter group required higher doses of gonadotropins (+705 IU vs +221.5 IU; p < .01), although the number of mature oocytes remained similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION Treatment of ectopic pregnancies with MTX or salpingectomy might not adversely affect ovarian reserve, ovarian responsiveness, or subsequent IVF cycle outcomes. However, in our study cohort, patients treated with MTX, those s treated with laparoscopic salpingectomy required higher gonadotropin doses in a subsequent cycle to attain the same number of mature oocytes.","Pereira, Nigel; Gerber, Deanna; Gerber, Rachel S; Lekovich, Jovana P; Elias, Rony T; Spandorfer, Steven D; Rosenwaks, Zev",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2015.04.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25917279/,238

Caring for patients who have AN is particularly challenging for nursing staff, who are on the front line and have the closest contact with patients. However, little is known about how nursing staff care for adolescent patients with AN in Taiwan. This study aimed to explore nurses' perceptions on and experiences in conflict situations in caring for adolescents with AN. A qualitative study approach was conducted. Through semi-structured interviews, ten nursing staff from the paediatric ward at a university-affiliated medical centre in central Taiwan shared their experiences. Recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed by content analysis. This analysis identified three themes with eight subthemes: (i) struggling to develop therapeutic relationships, (ii) selective focusing, and (iii) difficulty changing minds. The findings of this study indicated a need for ongoing support for nursing staff, the development of therapeutic relationships with adolescent patients with AN, extensive nursing staff preparation, and the development of in-service training programs to enable nursing staff to care for these patients with greater understanding.","Wu, Wan-Ling; Chen, Shu-Ling",International journal of mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047043/,238

METHODS Pseudo-continuous ASL imaging with a three PLDs protocol was performed in 90 healthy adult volunteers from January 2018 to February 2019. Healthy subjects were divided into youth group (mean age, 30.63 years; age range, 20-44 years), middle-aged group (mean age, 52.16 years; age range 45-59 years) and elderly group (mean age, 66.07 years; age range, 60-77 years). After preprocessing, analyses of variance (ANOVA) and volume-of-interest (VOI) were conducted to compare the CBF in each brain region. According to the trends of CBF changing with PLD and the results of ANOVA, we optimized the PLD for ASL imaging in different brain regions and age groups. RESULTS The CBF values of 87 VOIs [global gray matter (global GM) and other 86 VOIs] for each subject were obtained. Young people had less statistically significant VOIs than middle-aged and elderly people [Numbers of VOIs which had statistical significance (P < .05) in the analysis of ANOVA: 42 (youth group), 79 (middle-aged group), and 71 (elderly group)]. In youth group, the deep GM, occipital lobe and temporal lobe were more affected by PLDs than limbic system, frontal lobe and parietal lobe [VOIs with statistical significance (P < .05)/total VOIs: 8/8 (deep GM) > 8/12 (occipital lobe) > (8/14) (temporal lobe) > 5/12 (limbic system) > 11/28 (frontal lobe) > (2/12) parietal lobe]. In middle-aged group, the limbic system, deep GM and temporal lobe were more affected by PLDs than parietal lobe, frontal lobe and occipital lobe [VOIs with statistical significance (P < 0.05)/total VOIs: 12/12 (limbic system) = 8/8 (deep GM) > (13/14) (temporal lobe) > (11/12) parietal lobe > 25/28 (frontal lobe) > 9/12 (occipital lobe)]. In elderly group, the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe were more affected by PLDs than occipital lobe, limbic system, and deep GM [VOIs with statistical significance (P < .05)/total VOIs: 14/14 (temporal lobe) > 12/12 (parietal lobe) > 22/28 (frontal lobe) > 9/12 (occipital lobe) > 8/12 (limbic system) > 5/8 (deep GM)]. The optimal PLD for most VOIs in youth group was 1525 ms. However, for middle-aged and elderly group, the optimal PLD for most VOIs was 2525 ms. CONCLUSION Young people are less affected by PLDs than middle-aged and elderly people. The middle-aged people are most affected by PLDs. In addition, the spatial distributions of PLD effect were different among the three age groups. Optimizing the PLD for ASL imaging according to age and brain regions can obtain more accurate and reliable CBF values.","Hu, Ying; Lv, Fajin; Li, Qi; Liu, Rongbo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629629/,238

C. difficile was isolated from 176 of 999 (17.6 %) faecal samples or swabs of diarrhoeic calves from 603 farms collected between January 2010 and August 2012 by eight federal laboratories of six states. Strains were assigned to 17 PCR ribotypes. PCR ribotypes 033 (57 %), 078 (17 %) and 045/FLI01 (closest match to 045 in the WEBRIBO database; 9 %) were found the most frequently. Nine per cent of all culture-positive tested animals shed more than one multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) or PCR ribotype. Eight PCR ribotypes with related profiles (including 033, 078 and 045/FLI01) representing 92 % of all isolates were grouped into three clusters. Molecular relatedness was supported by the absence of the MLVA locus A6Cd only in clustered strains and identical toxin gene profiles for strains within each cluster. Previously reported mulitilocus sequence typing analysis for PCR ribotypes that were also recovered in this study found identical sequence types and a tcdC deletion (Δ39 bp) for 033, 045, 078 and 126 (ST-11), confirming this clustering. A different geographical occurrence of PCR ribotypes was shown for cluster 033 (found more frequently in southern Germany) and 045 (found more frequently in northern Germany). This study showed that clusters of C. difficile PCR ribotypes related to 033, 078 and 045 are predominant in diarrhoeic calves in Germany. The high number of strains belonging to PCR ribotype 078 demonstrated that diarrhoeic calves are also potential reservoirs for human pathogenic C. difficile strains.","Schneeberg, Alexander; Neubauer, Heinrich; Schmoock, Gernot; Grossmann, Ernst; Seyboldt, Christian",Journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.056473-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639987/,238

A limitation, however, is that it requires a hundred million cells per experiment, which hampers its broad application in biomedical research, particularly in studies in which it is impractical to obtain a large number of cells from rare samples. To reduce the required input cell number while retaining high data quality, we developed an in situ ChIA-PET protocol, which requires as few as 1 million cells. Here, we describe detailed step-by-step procedures for performing in situ ChIA-PET from cultured cells, including both an experimental protocol for sample preparation and data generation and a computational protocol for data processing and visualization using the ChIA-PIPE pipeline. As the protocol significantly simplifies the experimental procedure, reduces ligation noise, and decreases the required input of cells compared to previous versions of ChIA-PET protocols, it can be applied to generate high-resolution chromatin contact maps mediated by various protein factors for a wide range of human and mouse primary cells. © 2021 The Authors.

102573,Synergy of pandemics-social isolation is associated with worsened Parkinson severity and quality of life.,2020-10-08,"Endometriosis is a highly prevalent gynecological disease with severe negative impacts on life quality and financial burden. Unfortunately, there is no cure for this disease, which highlights the need for further investigation about the pathophysiology of this disease to provide clues for developing novel therapeutic regimens. Herein, we identified that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, a potent lymphangiogenic factor, is up-regulated in endometriotic cells and contributes to increased lymphangiogenesis. Bioinformatic analysis and molecular biological characterization revealed that VEGF-C is negatively regulated by an orphan nuclear receptor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII). Further studies demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines, via suppression of COUP-TFII level, induce VEGF-C overexpression. More importantly, we show that functional VEGF-C is transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance the lymphangiogenic ability of lymphatic endothelial cells. Autotransplanted mouse model of endometriosis showed lenvatinib treatment abrogated the increased lymphatic vessels development in the endometriotic lesion, enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and immune cells infiltration, indicating that blocking VEGF-C signaling can reduce local chronic inflammation and concomitantly endometriosis development. Evaluation of EV-transmitted VEGF-C from patients' sera demonstrates it is a reliable noninvasive way for clinical diagnosis. Taken together, we identify the vicious cycle of inflammation, COUP-TFII, VEGF-C, and lymphangiogenesis in the endometriotic microenvironment, which opens up new horizons in understanding the pathophysiology of endometriosis. VEGF-C not only can serve as a diagnostic biomarker but also a molecular target for developing therapeutic regimens.","Li, Wan-Ning; Hsiao, Kuei-Yang; Wang, Chu-An; Chang, Ning; Hsu, Pei-Ling; Sun, Chung-Hsien; Wu, Shang-Rung; Wu, Meng-Hsing; Tsai, Shaw-Jenq",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920037117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004630/,238

She was investigated with a head CT, cerebral angiogram, and digital subtraction angiography which led to a diagnosis of Moyamoya disease. She was treated conservatively and scheduled for follow-up. Clinical discussion Although ischemic attacks are the common presenting symptoms in cases of Moyamoya disease, hemorrhagic forms are seen too especially among adults compared to children. Identifying Moyamoya disease can significantly affect the treatment options and give insight into managing the chronic nature of the disease to both the physicians and patients. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of searching for underlying cause in a young female presenting with intracranial haemorrhage for the first time and keeping Moyamoya disease as a differential.","Gurung, Suja; Gaire, Suman; Bajracharya, Aliza; Paudel, Anuj Krishna; Budhathoki, Pravash",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123376/,238

Using World Health Organization data and program evaluation indicators collected by CDC in 2013, we retrospectively evaluated progress made 4-9 years after the start of influenza surveillance capacity strengthening in the countries. Our results showed substantial increases in laboratory and sentinel surveillance capacities, which are essential for knowing which influenza strains circulate globally, detecting emergence of novel influenza, identifying viruses for vaccine selection, and determining the epidemiology of respiratory illness. Twenty-eight of 35 countries responding to a 2013 questionnaire indicated that they have leveraged routine influenza surveillance platforms to detect other pathogens. This additional surveillance illustrates increased health-system strengthening. Furthermore, 34 countries reported an increased ability to use data in decision making; data-driven decisions are critical for improving local prevention and control of influenza around the world.","Polansky, Lauren S; Outin-Blenman, Sajata; Moen, Ann C",Emerging infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.3201/eid.2206.151521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27192395/,238
104544,Higher risk of allergies at 4-6 years of age aftersystemic antibiotics in the first week of life.,2021-03-27,"OBJECTIVE Burn injuries have an annual incidence exceeding 40,000. The Burn Center Referral Criteria published by the American Burn Association (ABA) serve to guide health centers in determining appropriateness of patient transfer to a specialized center. With inappropriate transfer rates reaching up to 77%, reliance on the ABA criteria is critical as the decision to transfer a patient can impose significant costs to both the patient and healthcare system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the appropriateness of all burn patient transfers to a single burn center over a 5-year period and assess the potential role of telemedicine to optimize the assessment and care of this patient population. METHODS A 5-year retrospective review was conducted to all burn patients transferred or consulted for transfer to our burn center between January 2013 and January 2017. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 767 cases were analyzed, with 612 ultimately being transferred. Outcome measures included basic clinical and demographic information, as well as logistical burn and transfer data such as percent total body surface area and transfer distance. After data collection, 5-year descriptive trends were analyzed, and the ABA criteria were applied to each patient case to evaluate appropriateness of transfer. Patients transferred despite not meeting at least one of the ABA criteria were classified as inappropriately transferred. RESULTS A total of 25 patients (3.2%) were found to be inappropriate transfers. Statistical analysis compared appropriately transferred patients (n = 587) with those inappropriately transferred. Overall, inappropriately transferred patients were more likely to have superficial partial thickness burns (76% vs 46%, P = 0.05), were less likely to need surgery (4% vs 22%, P < 0.05), and had a higher incidence of upper extremity burns (32% vs 4%, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Our study increases awareness of the most commonly seen presentation of inappropriately transferred burn patients over a 5-year period at our center. Given the advent of telemedicine, the ability of institutions to pinpoint a subset of patients most vulnerable to inappropriate transfer will allow for a streamlining of resources that will serve to benefit both patients and the health system.","Slavin, Benjamin; Shoucair, Sami; Klifto, Kevin; Grzelak, Michael; Shetty, Pragna; Cox, Carrie; Javia, Vidhi; Asif, Mohammed; Hultman, C Scott",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000002464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881747/,238

People with multiple diseases find difficulties in managing their daily lives due to the implications each disease brings; attending and keeping up to date with hospital appointments, being prescribed and taking various medications, the effects of mental health and quality of life, and the impact it has on their families. Most research in clinical trials often exclude individuals with multimorbidity and observational studies mainly focus on single disease outcomes, therefore there is an opportunity to encourage future research in an area which could help prevent further cases and improve the lives of those already living with multimorbidity.

106326,Letter: unknown denominator and misleading conclusions in COVID-19.,2020-10-01,"Drug compulsion manifests in some but not all individuals and implicates multifaceted processes including failures in top-down cognitive control as drivers for the hazardous pursuit of drug use in some individuals. As a closely related construct, impulsivity encompasses rash or risky behaviour without foresight, and underlies most forms of drug taking behaviour, including drug use during adverse emotional states (i.e., negative urgency). While impulsive behavioural dimensions emerge from drug-induced brain plasticity, burgeoning evidence suggests that impulsivity also predates the emergence of compulsive drug use. Although the neural substrates underlying the apparently causal relationship between trait impulsivity and drug compulsion are poorly understood, significant advances have come from the interrogation of defined limbic cortico-striatal circuits involved in motivated behaviour and response inhibition, together with chemical neuromodulatory influences from the ascending neurotransmitter systems. We review what is presently known about the neurochemical mediation of impulsivity, in its various forms, and ask whether commonalities exist in the neurochemistry of compulsive drug-motivated behaviours that might explain individual risk for addiction.","Jones, Jolyon A; Zuhlsdorff, Katharina; Dalley, Jeffrey W",Journal of neurochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1111/jnc.15380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931861/,238
106537,Management of an Immunocompromised Pediatric Patient With Multiple Hospitalizations for Symptomatic COVID-19.,2020-11-23,"The sustainable development of agriculture is facing problems such as high resource consumption and serious environmental pollution. The development of the circular economy model integrating planting and breeding (CEMIPB) has become an effective way to realize the sustainable development of agriculture. Due to the great difference of natural resource attributes in different regions of China, CEMIPB shows diverse characteristics on the whole. Based on this, this paper constructs a coupling model based on emergy analysis (EMA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) called EM-LCA model and conducts an empirical analysis using a typical CEMIPB in Fujian Province, China, as a case. By comparing the results of the EM-LCA and EMA models, the former effectively compensates for the deficiencies of the latter in terms of economic and environmental impact assessment, and the evaluation results can better reflect the actual situation of the system. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is introduced to identify key processes and substances. Based on the reduce-reuse-recycle (3R) principle, several optimization suggestions, such as reducing the input of corn and veterinary drugs, are put forward. The construction of the aforementioned methodology system can provide a new perspective for research in similar fields and provide a scientific basis for local government decision making.","Wang, Qingsong; Zhang, Yujie; Tian, Shu; Yuan, Xueliang; Ma, Qiao; Liu, Mengyue; Li, Yue; Liu, Jixiang",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15101-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212321/,238
106729,Remdesivir for the Treatment of Covid-19 - Preliminary Report.,2020-07-10,"INTRODUCTION Maternal and newborn infections are important causes of mortality but morbidity data from low- and middle-income countries is limited. We used telephone surveillance to estimate infection incidence and risk factors in women and newborns following hospital childbirth in Dar es Salaam. METHODS We recruited postnatal women from two tertiary hospitals and conducted telephone interviews 7 and 28 days after delivery. Maternal infection (endometritis, caesarean or perineal wound, or urinary tract infection) and newborn infection (umbilical cord or possible severe bacterial infection) were identified using hospital case-notes at the time of birth and self-reported symptoms. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess the association between potential risk-factors and infection. RESULTS We recruited 879 women and interviewed 791 (90%). From day 0-7, 6.7% (49/791) women and 6.2% (51/762) newborns developed infection. Using full follow-up data, the infection rate was higher in women with caesarean childbirth versus women with a vaginal delivery (aHR 1.93, 95%CI 1.11-3.36). Only 24% of women received pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis before caesarean section. Infection was higher in newborns resuscitated at birth versus newborns who were not resuscitated (aHR 4.45, 95%CI 2.10-9.44). At interview, 66% (37/56) of women and 88% (72/82) of newborns with possible infection had sought health-facility care. CONCLUSIONS Telephone surveillance identified a substantial risk of postnatal infection, including cases likely to have been missed by hospital-based data-collection alone. Risk of maternal endometritis and newborn possible severe bacterial infection were consistent with other studies. Caesarean section was the most important risk-factor for maternal infection. Improved implementation of pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis is urgently required to mitigate this risk.","Woodd, Susannah L; Kabanywanyi, Abdunoor M; Rehman, Andrea M; Campbell, Oona M R; Kagambo, Asila; Martiasi, Warda; TinaDay, Louise M; Aiken, Alexander M; Graham, Wendy J",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197559/,238

107700,Occurrence of and risk factors for electroencephalogram burst suppression during propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia.,2011,"OBJECTIVE We use a single-alveolar-compartment model to describe the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in exhaled breath, as recorded in time-based capnography. Respiratory parameters are estimated using this model, and then related to the clinical status of patients with obstructive lung disease. METHODS Given appropriate assumptions, we derive an analytical solution of the model, describing the exhalation segment of the capnogram. This solution is parametrized by alveolar CO2 concentration, dead-space fraction, and the time constant associated with exhalation. These quantities are estimated from individual capnogram data on a breath-by-breath basis. The model is applied to analyzing datasets from normal (n = 24) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 22) subjects, as well as from patients undergoing methacholine challenge testing for asthma (n = 22). RESULTS A classifier based on linear discriminant analysis in logarithmic coordinates, using estimated dead-space fraction and exhalation time constant as features, and trained on data from five normal and five COPD subjects, yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.99 in classifying the remaining 36 subjects as normal or COPD. Bootstrapping with 50 replicas yielded a 95% confidence interval of AUCs from 0.96 to 1.00. For patients undergoing methacholine challenge testing, qualitatively meaningful trends were observed in the parameter variations over the course of the test. SIGNIFICANCE A simple mechanistic model allows estimation of underlying respiratory parameters from the capnogram, and may be applied to diagnosis and monitoring of chronic and reversible obstructive lung disease.","Abid, Abubakar; Mieloszyk, Rebecca J; Verghese, George C; Krauss, Baruch S; Heldt, Thomas",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2017.2699972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28475040/,238
107954,Acute effects of insulin on circulating natriuretic peptide levels in humans.,2018,"BACKGROUND The objective of this International Patient Decision Aids Standard (IPDAS) review is to update and synthesize theoretical and empirical evidence on how balanced information can be presented and measured in patient decision aids (PtDAs). METHODS A multidisciplinary team conducted a scoping review using 2 search strategies in multiple electronic databases evaluating the ways investigators defined and measured the balance of information provided about options in PtDAs. The first strategy combined a search informed by the Cochrane Review of the Effectiveness of Decision Aids with a search on balanced information. The second strategy repeated the search published in the 2013 IPDAS update on balanced presentation. RESULTS Of 2450 unique citations reviewed, the full text of 168 articles was screened for eligibility. Sixty-four articles were included in the review, of which 13 provided definitions of balanced presentation, 8 evaluated mechanisms that may introduce bias, and 42 quantitatively measured balanced with methods consistent with the IPDAS criteria in PtDAs. The revised definition of balanced information is, ""Objective, complete, salient, transparent, evidence-informed, and unbiased presentation of text and visual information about the condition and all relevant options (with important elements including the features, benefits, harms and procedures of those options) in a way that does not favor one option over another and enables individuals to focus attention on important elements and process this information."" CONCLUSIONS Developers can increase the balance of information in PtDAs by informing their structure and design elements using the IPDAS checklist. We suggest that new PtDA components pertaining to balance be evaluated for cognitive bias with experimental methods as well by objectively evaluating patients' and content experts' beliefs from multiple perspectives.","Martin, Richard W; Brogård Andersen, Stina; O'Brien, Mary Ann; Bravo, Paulina; Hoffmann, Tammy; Olling, Karina; Shepherd, Heather L; Dankl, Kathrina; Stacey, Dawn; Dahl Steffensen, Karina",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x211021397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196241/,238
108002,"How (or Do) People ""Think"" About Cancer Risk, and Why That Matters.",2020-05-21,"PURPOSE To evaluate if the authors of published systematic reviews (SRs) reported the level of quality of evidence (QoE) in the top 5 impact factor infertility journals and to analyze if they used an appropriate wording to describe it. METHODS This is a cross-sectional study. We searched in PubMed for SRs published in 2017 in the five infertility journals with the highest impact factor. We analyzed the proportion of SRs published in the top 5 impact factor infertility journals that reported the SRs' QoE, and the proportion of those SRs in which authors used consistent wording to describe QoE and magnitude of effect. RESULTS The QoE was reported in only 21.4% of the 42 included SRs and in less than 10% of the abstracts. Although we did not find important differences in the report of QoE of those that showed statistically significant differences or not, p value was associated with the wording chosen by the authors. We found inconsistent reporting of the size the effect estimate in 54.8% (23/42) and in the level of QoE in 92.9% (39/42). Whereas the effect size was more consistently expressed in studies with statistically significant findings, QoE was better expressed in those cases in which the p value was over 0.05. CONCLUSION We found that in 2017, less than 25% of the authors reported the overall QoE when publishing SRs. Authors focused more on statistical significance as a binary concept than on methodological limitations like study design, imprecision, indirectness, inconsistency, and publication bias. Authors should make efforts to report the QoE and interpret results accordingly.","Glujovsky, Demian; Sueldo, Carlos E; Bardach, Ariel; Del Pilar Valanzasca, María; Comandé, Daniel; Ciapponi, Agustín",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10815-019-01663-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31867689/,238

Comment on the article by Atiquzzaman et al.,2020-07-14,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study is to present a preliminary series of six children affected by an anterior mediastinal mass, resulting in a thymoma. We treated this pediatric population by a video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective study from January 2000 to January 2012 of all children affected by an anterior mediastinal mass, resulting in a thymoma. Data included sex, age at surgery, clinical and radiological features, surgical procedure, follow-up, and complications. RESULTS Video-assisted thoracoscopic thymectomy was performed in six children (five boys and one girl). Four patients presented with dyspnea and/or thoracic pain treated with analgesic and corticosteroid therapy without any benefits. Two patients were asymptomatic. Preoperatively, exams included radiological imaging, blood, and immunological test. All 6 patients were treated with a thoracoscopic approach; of these patients, 5 were treated with a thoracoscopic right-side thymectomy and 1 with a left-side approach. Patients were treated by a three-trocar technique, and thymectomy was performed using Valleylab (now Covidien) (Boulder, CO) LigaSure™. The mean operative time was 120 minutes. The mean hospital stay was 5 days. In all cases histological findings revealed no malignancy. The mean follow-up was 38 months. DISCUSSION Thoracoscopic thymectomy facilitated the goal of early thymectomy. The right-side approach is preferred because it gains a good visualization of the venous anatomy for dissection. The left side allows a good extended resection of both the thymus and perithymic fat. Thoracoscopic thymectomy should be consider a valid, less invasive alternative to the most radical open approach.","Molinaro, Francesco; Garzi, Alfredo; Cerchia, Elisa; Angotti, Rossella; Di Maggio, Giovanni; Valla, Jean S; Messina, Mario",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed of premature infants undergoing ROP screening before (cohort A) and after (cohort B) implementation of an oxygen therapy protocol to inhibit further progression for those with stage 2 ROP or worse. Statistical analysis with χ2, Fisher's exact test, or Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed; and logistic regression models were created to determine the odds ratio of cohort B developing ROP progression beyond stage 2, compared to cohort A, adjusting for other risk factors for ROP. Results In cohort A, without oxygen therapy protocol (2002-2007), 44% (54/122) of infants progressed beyond stage 2, compared to 23% (24/103) of infants after protocol implementation (cohort B, 2008-2012) (P = 0.001). No significant differences between cohort A and B were found for gestational age, birth weight, survival, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, oxygen at discharge, or need for diuretics. Infants with stage 2 ROP in cohort B, with oxygen therapy protocol, had significantly decreased risk of ROP beyond stage 2 (odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.67; P = 0.0013), compared to cohort A, correcting for differences in birth weight and necrotizing enterocolitis. Conclusions Progression from stage 2 to stage 3 ROP in premature infants was significantly decreased after implementation of an oxygen therapy protocol, without a corresponding increase in pulmonary morbidity. This study suggests that appropriate oxygen therapy may play a role in inhibiting progression of stage 2 ROP, potentially decreasing the risk of lifelong visual loss in this vulnerable population.","Colaizy, Tarah T; Longmuir, Susannah; Gertsch, Kevin; Abràmoff, Michael David; Klein, Jonathan M",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.16-20822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28159975/,238

METHODS We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis. The search was carried out in 5 bibliographic databases and in ClinicalTrials.gov. No restriction on language or date of publication was applied. This was complemented by references of the studies found and studies of evidence synthesis, manual search of abstracts of relevant congresses/scientific meetings and contact with experts. We included primary studies (observational, quasi-experimental and experimental studies) on parents of children with CA reporting the outcome quality of life (primary outcome) of parents, independently of the intervention/exposure studied. RESULTS We included 75 studies (35 observational non-comparatives, 31 observational comparatives, 4 quasi-experimental and 5 experimental studies). We identified 27 different QoL instruments. The two most frequently used individual QoL instruments were WHOQOL-Bref and SF-36. Relatively to family QoL tools identified, we emphasized PedsQL FIM, IOFS and FQOL. Non-syndromic congenital heart defects were the CA most frequently studied. Through the analysis of comparative studies, we verified that parental and familial QoL were impaired in this population. CONCLUSIONS This review highlights the relevance of assessing QoL in parents with children with CA and explores the diverse QoL assessment tools described in the literature.

This study was performed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel approach combining proximal balloon occlusion and distal aspiration to prevent distal thrombembolic complications. METHODS Patients with ischemic stroke meeting the following inclusion criteria were eligible: occlusion in the anterior circulation, neurothrombectomy using a balloon catheter for proximal flow arrest, and an intermediate catheter for distal aspiration. Pre- and post-interventional Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scores were assessed. Clinical presentation at admission and discharge and after 3 months was also evaluated and complications (particularly new thrombembolic events) were recorded. RESULTS We retrospectively identified 31 patients from our prospectively collected stroke database who met the inclusion criteria. In all patients the initial TICI was 0. A TICI score of ≥2b was achieved in 96.8%. No new thrombembolic complications occurred. The median NIH Stroke Scale score was 19 at admission and 4.5 at discharge. After 3 months, 51.6% of the patients had a favorable clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) and 19.3% had died. CONCLUSIONS A combination of proximal internal carotid artery occlusion using a balloon catheter and distal aspiration through an intermediate catheter represents a safe and efficient adjunct to mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers.

METHODS The study population consisted of acute ischemic stroke patients who were admitted to PSCs participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. Measures of care quality and outcomes were compared among the 4 different PSC certifications. RESULTS A total of 477 297 acute ischemic stroke admissions were identified from 977 certified PSCs (73.8% JC, 3.7% Det Norske Veritas, 1.2% Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program, and 21.3% State-based). Composite care quality was generally similar among the 4 groups of hospitals, although State-based PSCs underperformed JC PSCs in a few key measures, including intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator use. The rates of tissue-type plasminogen activator use were higher in JC and Det Norske Veritas (9.0% and 9.8%) and lower in State and Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program certified hospitals (7.1% and 5.9%) (P<0.0001). Door-to-needle times were significantly longer in Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program hospitals. State PSCs had higher in-hospital risk-adjusted mortality (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence intervals 1.07-1.41) compared with JC PSCs. CONCLUSIONS Among Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals with PSC certification, acute ischemic stroke quality of care and outcomes may differ according to which organization provided certification. These findings may have important implications for further improving systems of care.","Man, Shumei; Cox, Margueritte; Patel, Puja; Smith, Eric E; Reeves, Mathew J; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bhatt, Deepak L; Xian, Ying; Schwamm, Lee H; Fonarow, Gregg C",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.014426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28008094/,238

We performed detailed characterization of B cell responses through high-dimensional flow cytometry to reveal substantial heterogeneity in both effector and immature populations. More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation and shared B cell repertoire features previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large antibody-secreting cell expansion and early production of high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies. Yet, these patients had severe disease with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multiorgan failure and death. Overall, these findings strongly suggest a pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of patients with COVID-19.

110305,Survival after bariatric surgery among high-risk patients.,2011,"OBJECTIVE Financial incentives are often applied to motivate desirable performance across organisations in healthcare systems. In the 2016/2017 financial year, the National Health Service (NHS) in England set a national performance-based incentive to increase uptake of the influenza vaccination among frontline staff. Since then, the threshold levels needed for hospital trusts to achieve the incentive (ie, the targets) have ranged from 70% to 80%. The present study examines the impact of this financial incentive across eight vaccination seasons. DESIGN A retrospective observational study examining routinely recorded rates of influenza vaccination among staff in all acute NHS hospital trusts across eight vaccination seasons (2012/2013-2019/2020). The number of trusts included varied per year, from 127 to 137, due to organisational changes. McCrary's density test is conducted to determine if the number of hospital trusts narrowly achieving the target by the end of each season is higher than would be expected in the absence of any responsiveness to the target. We refer to this bunching above the target threshold as a 'threshold effect'. RESULTS In the years before a national incentive was set, 9%-31% of NHS Trusts reported achieving the target, compared with 43%-74% in the 4 years after. Threshold effects did not emerge before the national incentive for payment was set; however, since then, threshold effects have appeared every year. Some trusts report narrowly achieving the target each year, both as the target rises and falls. Threshold effects were not apparent at targets for partial payments. CONCLUSIONS We provide compelling evidence that performance-based financial incentives produced threshold effects. Policymakers who set such incentives are encouraged to track threshold effects since they contain information on how organisations are responding to an incentive, what enquiries they may wish to make, how the incentive may be improved and what unintended effects it may be having.","Liaqat, Adiba; Gallier, Suzy; Reeves, Katharine; Crothers, Hannah; Evison, Felicity; Schmidtke, Kelly; Bird, Paul; Watson, Samuel I; Khunti, Kamlesh; Lilford, Richard",BMJ quality & safety,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2021-013671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583977/,238

However, eggs of ground-nesting species can be exposed when pesticide applications occur during laying or incubation. We simulated environmentally realistic exposures of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) eggs to an herbicide (2,4-D) and a fungicide (tebuconazole) applied to winter cereal crops during the breeding season of most farmland birds. We analyzed effects on hatching success, offspring survival and physiology. Exposure by overspray led to greater pesticide accumulation in the eggshell or content than exposure through contact with treated soil (3.1 to 13.7 times higher, depending on the pesticide and target sample). Egg overspray with tebuconazole significantly increased chick mortality, which was 26% higher than that of controls. 2,4-D caused a similar but close to significant increase (chick mortality 24% higher than controls). Exposure to either pesticide through contact with treated soils did not affect chick survival but altered some biochemical parameters post-hatching. Our experiment shows that egg spraying with pesticides should be considered as a relevant exposure scenario in risk assessment procedures, given its potential to affect the reproductive success of ground-nesting farmland birds.","Ortiz-Santaliestra, Manuel E; Alcaide, Vicente; Camarero, Pablo R; Mateo, Rafael; Mougeot, Francois",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c04203; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911930/,238

Considering their unfavourable features, the process of searching for new antidepressant drugs with better safety and tolerability requires consistent efforts and many complementary studies. Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor is considered as an interesting target of antidepressant therapy. In the present study, the intrinsic activity at different signaling pathways coupled to serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, antidepressant-like and pharmacokinetic properties, and the safety profile of two novel imidazopurine-2,4-dione derivatives, namely compounds AZ-853 (8-(4-(4-(2-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1,3-dimethyl-1H- imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4(3H,8H)-dione) and AZ-861 (1,3-dimethyl-8-(4-(4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1H-imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4(3H,8H)-dione), were studied in animal models through in vitro and in vivo experiments. We demonstrated that AZ-853 and AZ-861, which structurally differ by one substituent and its placement in the phenyl ring, showed varied functional, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic properties as well as side effect profiles. AZ-861 exhibited stronger agonistic action in all functional assays. After acute and repeated administration in mice, both compounds showed antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim test, which was partially mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation. AZ-853 showed a more potent antidepressant-like effect, presumably due to its better penetration into brain structures. Both compounds did not show anticholinergic properties, but after repeated administration, they induced weak sedation and lipid metabolism disturbances without affecting serum glucose level. The stronger α1-adrenolytic effect of AZ-853 is responsible for decreased systolic blood pressure, and in contrast to AZ-861, AZ-853 induced weight gain in mice. The interesting comparative pharmacological profiles of AZ-853 and AZ-861 encourage to conduct further experiments to fully understand their mechanisms and differences in action.","Partyka, Anna; Zagórska, Agnieszka; Kotańska, Magdalena; Walczak, Maria; Jastrzębska-Więsek, Magdalena; Knutelska, Joanna; Bednarski, Marek; Głuch-Lutwin, Monika; Mordyl, Barbara; Janiszewska, Paulina; Wesołowska, Anna",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237196; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764777/,238

In this article we present the consumption of systemic antibiotics in Norway during the period of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHOD Total sales of systemic antibiotics in defined daily doses (DDD) were retrieved from the wholesaler-based medicinal product statistics for 2019 and 2020, and sales of antibiotics for use outside of healthcare institutions were retrieved from the Norwegian prescription database. Information was retrieved on the proportion of users (prevalence), doses (measured in DDD) and prescriptions. RESULTS Total sales of systemic antibiotics increased in March 2020, but sales to persons outside of healthcare institutions did not. Compared to previous years, both total consumption and use of antibiotics outside of institutions fell steeply in the months that followed. The reduction was greatest for antibiotics against respiratory infections and in the youngest age groups. INTERPRETATION The significant reduction in the use of systemic antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic is attributed to infection control measures and reduced contact with the health service. In 2016, the Norwegian government set a goal for a 30 % reduction in antibiotic use by the end of 2020. The pandemic has contributed to the achievement of that goal.","Blix, Hege Salvesen; Høye, Sigurd","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.1003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33685110/,238

RESULTS Over a six-month period, 181,759 passengers were screened for fever at the Cairns international airport, Queensland, Australia. Fever was identified in 118 (0.06%) of the arriving passengers and 76 were enrolled in the study. Only 19 of these passengers (25%) voluntarily underwent further evaluation. No differences were observed in the three approaches.

However, there remains substantial variation in evaluation methods and measures of these programs despite introduction of measurement frameworks in the last five years. In addition, for neonatal health care, assessing a telehealth program must measure its benefits and costs for four stakeholder groups - patients, providers, healthcare system, and payers. Because of differences in their role within the health system, each group's calculation of telehealth's value may align or not with one another, depending on how it is being used. Therefore, a common mental model for determining value is critical in order to use telehealth in ways that produce win-win situations for most if not all four stakeholder groups. In this chapter, we present important principles and concepts from previously published frameworks to propose an approach to telehealth evaluation that can be used for perinatal health. Such a framework will then drive future development and implementation of telehealth programs to provide value for all relevant stakeholders in a perinatal health care system.","Chuo, John; Chandler, Ali; Lorch, Scott",Seminars in perinatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semperi.2021.151429; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33994012/,238

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcomes of HCC patients with diaphragmatic resection (DR group) and HCC patients without diaphragmatic resection (non-DR group). We applied 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) to these subjects. RESULTS The study included 46 patients in DR group and 828 patients in non-DR group. The DR group cases were pathologically more advanced, and both overall and relapse-free survival among the patients in this group with pathological diaphragmatic invasion were similar to cases with pathological diaphragmatic fibrous adhesion. There were 40 patients from each group subjected to PSM. In these matched cohorts, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding perioperative outcomes, overall survival, and relapse-free survival. Multivariate analyses of our matched HCC patients revealed that alpha-fetoprotein expression and tumor size were independent prognostic factors for overall survival and poor differentiation for relapse-free survival, whereas neither diaphragmatic invasion nor diaphragmatic resection were prognostic indicators. The most frequent site of recurrence in non-DR group was the liver, whereas the most frequent site of recurrence in DR group was the lung before and after PSM. CONCLUSIONS The short- and long-term surgical outcomes of DR HCC cases are equivalent to their non-DR counterparts under a matched clinicopathological background. Hepatectomy combined with DR is an acceptable treatment for HCC with either diaphragmatic fibrous adhesion or diaphragmatic invasion.","Orimo, Tatsuya; Kamiyama, Toshiya; Wakayama, Kenji; Shimada, Shingo; Nagatsu, Akihisa; Asahi, Yoh; Sakamoto, Yuzuru; Kamachi, Hirofumi; Taketomi, Akinobu",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08754-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32588266/,238

IgA could also be used to modulate excessive immune responses in inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, secretory IgA is emerging as a major regulator of gut microbiota, which impacts intestinal homeostasis and global health as well. As such, IgA could be used to promote a healthy microbiota in a therapeutic setting.

Most RNA viruses have genomes with a distinct nucleotide composition, e.g. ranging from minimally 12.9 % to maximally 40.3 % (C- and U-count, respectively, in coronavirus HKU). We present a global analysis of diverse virus types, including plus-strand, minus-strand and double-strand RNA viruses, for the impact of this nucleotide preference on the predicted structure of the RNA genome that is packaged in virion particles and on the codon usage in the viral open reading frames. Several virus-specific features will be described, but also some general conclusions were drawn. Without exception, the virus-specific nucleotide bias was enriched in the unpaired, single-stranded regions of the RNA genome, thus creating an even more striking virus-specific signature. We present a simple mechanism that is based on elementary aspects of RNA structure folding to explain this general trend. In general, the nucleotide bias was the major determinant of the virus-specific codon usages, thus limiting a role for codon selection and translational control. We will discuss molecular and evolutionary scenarios that may be responsible for the diverse nucleotide biases of RNA viruses.","van Hemert, Formijn; van der Kuyl, Antoinette C; Berkhout, Ben",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27519195/,238

At present, it is believed that the etiology of TMD is multifactor. The occlusal factors and the occurrence of TMD are weakly related, but there are some common malocclusions such as occlusal interference on non-working side, excessive sliding between maximum intercuspid position (MIP) and retruded contact position (RCP), unstable MIP and so on, may be risk factors that promote the disease. The occurrence of TMD symptoms is promoted under the combined action of behavior, biology, environment, social cognition, mentality and other comprehensive factors. In student education and clinical work, the risk of iatrogenic occlusal trauma in promoting the occurrence of TMD cannot be ignored. The impact of the patient's social and psychological environment on the TMD should be paid attention, and comprehensive treatment strategies is advocated.","Jiang, T",Zhonghua kou qiang yi xue za zhi = Zhonghua kouqiang yixue zazhi = Chinese journal of stomatology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20210704-00314; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34404137/,238
113961,Dangerous interactions of gastrointestinal drugs with experimental treatments for COVID-19.,2020-05-22,"Background Adults with type two diabetes mellitus (DM2) show cognitive deficits within the executive function domain. The detrimental effects of DM2 over executive function (EF) performance may be mediated by factors such as cognitive reserve (CR). CR mediates cognitive performance by delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms from subjacent brain pathology or attenuating the severity of such symptoms. Our main goal was to study the effects of CR on executive functions of adults with DM2. Methods Data from a total of 1,034 adults were included (362 women, 672 men). Subjects were categorized into four groups: subjects with DM2 and high CR (n = 235), control subjects with high CR (n = 265), subjects with DM2 and low CR (n = 298), and control subjects with low CR (n = 236). CR was quantified through 3 proxies: education, occupational complexity, and leisure activities. Executive functions were evaluated through visual scanning, verbal fluency, and backwards counting tasks. First, a series of four one-way ANOVAs was performed where group was included as a between-subject factor and executive function as a dependent variable. Second, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess the weight of each CR proxy on EF performance. Results CR level significantly affected all executive function scores independently of the diabetes status. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that years of education accounted for most of the variance in the model for executive function performance. In this study, we found that there is a significant effect of CR on executive function performance of DM2 subjects and education is the most important CR proxy.","Peña-González, Paola; Mondragón-Maya, Alejandra; Silva-Pereyra, Juan; Roa-Rojas, Paloma",Journal of diabetes research,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7941543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083496/,238

Furthermore, stem cells have the potential to make new tissues and organs. Thus, some scientists propose that organ transplantation will significantly rely on stem cell technology and organogenesis in the future. Stem cells and its robust potential to differentiate into specific types of cells and regenerate tissues and body organs, have been investigated by numerous clinician scientists and researchers for their therapeutic effects. Degenerative diseases in different organs have been the main target of stem cell therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis, congenital cardiovascular diseases, and blood cell diseases such as leukemia are among the health conditions that have benefited from stem cell therapy advancements. One of the most challenging parts of the process of incorporating stem cells into clinical practice is controlling their division and differentiation potentials. Sometimes, their potential for uncontrolled growth will make these cells tumorigenic. Another caveat in this process is the ability to control the differentiation process. While stem cells can easily differentiate into a wide variety of cells, a paracrine effect controlled activity, being in an appropriate medium will cause abnormal differentiation leading to treatment failure. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the therapeutic effects of stem cells in diseases of various organ systems. In order to advance this new treatment to its full potential, researchers should focus on establishing methods to control the differentiation process, while policymakers should take an active role in providing adequate facilities and equipment for these projects. Large population clinical trials are a necessary tool that will help build trust in this method. Moreover, improving social awareness about the advantages and adverse effects of stem cell therapy is required to develop a rational demand in the society, and consequently, healthcare systems should consider established stem cell-based therapeutic methods in their treatment algorithms.","Ebrahimi, Alireza; Ahmadi, Hanie; Pourfraidon Ghasrodashti, Zahra; Tanide, Nader; Shahriarirad, Reza; Erfani, Amirhossein; Ranjbar, Keivan; Ashkani-Esfahani, Soheil",Bosnian journal of basic medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.17305/bjbms.2021.5508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255619/,238

Barrier protection at the time of this form of surgery has been used with varying results. The aim of this randomized study was to examine the efficacy of barrier retractional wound protection in the prevention of surgical site infections in open, elective colorectal surgery. METHODS One hundred thirty consecutive patients undergoing open elective colorectal resectional surgery were randomly assigned to have either barrier retractional wound protection or standard wound retraction. Patients were then followed up for a minimum of 30 days postoperatively. The primary end point was surgical site infection as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The secondary end point was performance of the wound protector as assessed by operating surgeons. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in the incidence of incisional surgical site infections when the wound protector was used: 3 of 64 (4.7%) vs 15 of 66 (22.7%); P = .004. Most surgical site infections were diagnosed after discharge from the hospital (78%), and there was no difference in the rates of reoperation, readmission, or formal wound drainage between the 2 groups. Surgeons found the wound protector to be helpful with retraction during surgery, with 88% (7/8) adopting it as part of their standard setup. CONCLUSIONS In this study the use of barrier wound protection in elective open colorectal resectional surgery resulted in a clinically significant reduction in incisional surgical site infections. Barrier wound protection of this nature should be considered routine in this type of surgery.","Reid, Kate; Pockney, Peter; Draganic, Brian; Smith, Stephen R",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181ed3f7e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20847618/,238

114890,Enhancing clinical judgement in virtual care for complex chronic disease.,2021-02-08,"BACKGROUND Delivery of supplemental oxygen is the initial vital management of hypoxemic acute lower respiratory infection (HALRI). Oxygen delivery systems include low-flow and high-flow devices. In high-flow devices such as the Venturi mask, a constant mixture of oxygen is delivered. As a result, increased rate of breathing does not affect the concentration of oxygen delivered. In this study, we compared the efficacy of oxygen masks and Venturi masks in the management of hypoxemia in pediatric patients. METHODS A total of 65 children, aged 3-36 months, diagnosed with HALRI, were enrolled. Patients were allocated into groups, via simple alternate randomization, to receive oxygen through an oxygen mask or through a Venturi mask. Respiratory rate, heart rate, retraction, blood gas parameters, oxygen saturation, length of hospitalization, and oxygenation were recorded before and after oxygen treatment. RESULTS After 24 h of treatment, respiratory rate was significantly lower among patients in the Venturi mask group compared with the oxygen mask group. Duration of supplemental oxygen and length of hospitalization were significantly lower in the Venturi mask group compared with the oxygen mask group. CONCLUSION In both groups, there was marked improvement in all measured parameters following introduction of supplemental oxygen. Oxygen was delivered more efficiently, however, by high-flow systems. The Venturi mask may decrease the total duration of oxygen usage time as well as the length of hospitalization among young children with HALRI through rapid symptom resolution.","Uygur, Pinar; Oktem, Sedat; Boran, Perran; Tutar, Engin; Tokuc, Gulnur",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.12750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26189844/,238

Complete TME is known to be associated with lower rates of recurrence. Robotic and endoscopic TaTME approaches are reported to offer excellent proximal and distal rectal dissection into the TME plane, however, combining both approaches in a hybrid procedure could potentially optimise visualisation of the dissection plane and confer improved circumferential and distal margin rates. The aim of this study was to analyse the feasibility of a hybrid robotic abdominal approach with conventional TaTME for rectal cancer. Furthermore, pathological and patient outcomes were assessed. A review of prospectively maintained databases was undertaken to assess all patients undergoing robotic TME surgery for rectal tumours from August 2016 to October 2017. Patient demographics, tumour characteristics and outcomes were collated from patient charts and hospital databases. All patients underwent a modified Cecil approach after multidisciplinary team discussion. Eight patients (7 male, 1 female) underwent a combined hybrid approach with a median age of 60 years (range 47-73) and BMI of 29.5 (range 20-39.1) kg/m2. Median distance from the anorectal junction (ARJ) was 7.5 (range 4-13) cm. Six patients underwent neoadjuvant treatment with chemoradiotherapy. Patients had a median length of stay (LOS) of 9 (range 4-33) days. There were no intra-operative complications encountered and no patients required a conversion to an open procedure. Complications included one anastomotic leak and one presacral collection. All patients had a complete TME with RO resection with a median number of lymph nodes harvested was 22 (range 6-37) lymph nodes. This hybrid technique is a feasible, practical and operatively favourable approach to rectal cancer surgery with initial pathological outcomes and complication profile equivalent to other approaches.","Nikolic, Amanda; Waters, Peadar S; Peacock, Oliver; Choi, Colin Chan-Min; Rajkomar, Amrish; Heriot, Alexander G; Smart, Philip; Warrier, Satish",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-019-01032-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625075/,238

Therefore, we investigated how potassium phosphite can be integrated into late blight control programs with reduced fungicides in field trials. Phosphite was somewhat less effective than the conventional fungicides at suppressing late blight in the foliage, and the tubers contained less starch. However, when we reduced the amount of phosphite and combined it with reduced amounts of conventional fungicides, we observed no differences in disease suppression, total yields, and tuber starch contents compared with the full treatments with conventional fungicides. The amount of phosphite detected in the harvested tubers was linearly associated with the amount of phosphite applied to the foliage. Our analyses indicate that phosphite could replace some fungicides without exceeding the current European Union standards for the maximum residue levels in potato tubers. No phosphite was detected in the starch from the tubers. In 1 of 2 years, early blight (caused by Alternaria solani) was less severe in the phosphite treatments than in the treatments without phosphite. The integration of phosphite into current treatment strategies would reduce the dependence on conventional fungicides.","Liljeroth, Erland; Lankinen, Åsa; Andreasson, Erik; Alexandersson, Erik",Plant disease,https://doi.org/10.1094/pdis-11-19-2296-re; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830998/,238

A quality-quantity tradeoff was recently discovered in spore forming bacteria, but whether it impacts fitness is unclear. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that the nutrient supply during spore revival determines the fitness advantage associated with different sporulation behaviors in Bacillus subtilis. By tuning sporulation rates we generate spore-yield and spore-quality strategists that compete with each other in a microscopic life-cycle assay. The quality (yield) strategist is favored when spore revival is triggered by poor (rich) nutrients. We also show that natural isolates from the gut and soil employ different life-cycle strategies that result from genomic variations in the number of rap-phr signaling systems. Taken together, our results suggest that a spore quality-quantity tradeoff contributes to the evolutionary adaptation of sporulating bacteria.","Mutlu, Alper; Kaspar, Charlotte; Becker, Nils; Bischofs, Ilka B",The ISME journal,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0721-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724142/,238

Methods A hospital-based study that used a 15-item questionnaire to collect data among patients scheduled for RCT. All scheduled subjects (N = 291) over a one-year period constituted the sample for the study. Using the SPSS software, associations between the subjects' variables, and the dental insurance status were carried out with Chi square and independent t test respectively at 95% confidence interval. Results Two hundred and ninety-one subjects were to have 353 RCTs within the study period. A high proportion (79.7%, p < 0.001) of the subjects had dental health insurance, majority (95.3%) of which was government funded. 20.9% of those with previous tooth loss was due to inability to afford cost of RCT.

Here, we outline how to realize non-disposable and highly comfortable respirators with light-triggered self-disinfection ability by bridging bioactive nanofiber properties and stimuli-responsive nanomaterials. The visionary road highlighted in this Concept is based on the possibility to develop a new generation of masks based on multifunctional membranes where the presence of nanoclusters and plasmonic nanoparticles arranged in a hierarchical structure enables the realization of a chemically-driven and on-demand anti-pathogen activities. Multilayer electrospun membranes have the ability to dissipate humidity present within the mask, enhancing the wearability and usability. The photo-thermal disinfected membrane is the core of these 3D printed and reusable masks with moisture pump capability. Personalized face masks with smart nano-assisted destruction of pathogens will bring enormous advantages to the entire global community, especially for front-line personnel, and will open up great opportunities for innovative medical applications.","De Sio, Luciano; Ding, Bin; Focsan, Monica; Kogermann, Karin; Pascoal-Faria, Paula; Petronella, Francesca; Mitchell, Geoffrey; Zussman, Eyal; Pierini, Filippo",Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202004875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33284500/,238

The current study examined patient-reported experiences in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS Participants in SUD treatment were recruited via online crowdsourcing from April 14, 2020 to May 26, 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis. Participants reported disruptions in SUD treatment, stress and anxiety caused by these disruptions on a 0-100 point visual analogue scale (VAS), stress associated with childcare responsibilities on a 0-100 VAS, current stress on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), anxiety symptoms on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), sleep disturbances on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and whether they used drugs or alcohol during the COVID-19 crisis. RESULTS Participants (N = 240) endorsed that at least 1 SUD treatment was switched to telemedicine (63.7%), had some appointments cancelled (37.5%), or was discontinued due to COVID-19 (29.6%). Participants who did versus did not endorse drug/alcohol use reported difficulty obtaining medications to treat their SUD (OR = 2.47, 95% CI, 1.17-5.22, χ2 = 5.98, P = .016), greater scores on VAS treatment-related stress (F1,197 = 5.70, P = .018) and anxiety (F1,197 = 4.07, P = .045), greater VAS stress related to childcare (F1,107 = 10.24, P = .002), and greater scores on the PSS (F1,235 = 19.27, P < .001), BAI (F1,235 = 28.59, P < .001), and ISI (F1,235 = 14.41, P < .001).

In India, the Rotavirus Vaccine (RVV) (2019) and the fractionated injectable polio vaccine (f-IPV) (2016) are more prone to wastage with high procurement costs. In this operational research study, we determined the effectiveness of a (self-designed) dose based reporting tool (DBRT) in reducing vaccine (f-IPV and RVV) wastage at primary care facilities in India during December 2019 to March' 2020. Data reports of all the immunization sessions conducted at three primary care facilities were analyzed to calculate the wastage rates of the RVV and the f-IPV for the following periods: (1). Period of initiation (August-November' 2019) (2). Pre-intervention with sensitization of healthcare providers (December' 2019-January' 2020) (3). Post-intervention after application of the DBRT. Intervention: The DBRT is a paper-based reporting format that assigns a unique code to each RVV and IPV vial. The health facility is required to report the total doses administered from each coded vial during every immunization session by updating it on the assigned reporting format. Pre-intervention, the average monthly wastage of f-IPV was 23.5% and of the RVV ranged from 18%-31%. Post-intervention, on using the DBRT, the monthly wastage of both RVV and f-IPV dropped significantly to 8.6% and 11.4%, respectively. During the subsequent month, the IPV wastage further decreased to only 4.7%. In conclusion, the DBRT reduces vaccine wastage in government primary care facilities by enabling a paper audit trail that promotes responsiveness and accountability among healthcare workers directly involved in vaccine administration.","Rustagi, Ruchir; Basu, Saurav; Sharma, Pragya; Sharma, Nandini",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1796427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835605/,238

This assay can be completed in two steps in a label-free fashion, yielding a ""signal-on"" signal readout, which usually cannot be attained by electrochemical label-free detection using no labels or markers to tag the target protein. The proposed assay also utilizes no antibodies or enzyme-based reagents. The method achieves this performance by moderating the frequency of electrochemical potential scanning such that the scanning rate keeps pace with, or ""resonances"" with, the molecular motion of the probe molecule. This method has been successfully applied to detect the three target proteins in serum samples collected from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results indicate a strong correlation with the risk of deteriorating into severe acute conditions after virus infection. Soon, the clinical application of this method may provide a low-cost but effective method for virus surveillance in the general public.","Zhou, Lei; Hao, Panpan; Li, Hao; Zhang, Zhongwen",ACS sensors,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.1c00022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33823114/,238

For this purpose, six fish were treated with implants containing 2.5 mg 11KT and a placebo group of six females of the same age and gametogenic stage were given a blank implant. The implants were intraperitoneally inserted into 4-year-old females at the previtellogenic stage (mean body weight 5580 ± 165 g) and maintained under culture conditions for 8 weeks. Ovary samples for gene expression analysis of lhr, fshr, dmrt1 and foxl2 were collected by biopsy at 3 and 8 weeks post-implantation. Diameters of oocytes increased in response to 11KT treatment, both at 3 and at 8 weeks post-implantation, but no obvious changes were evident in cytology. Three weeks of 11KT treatment did not affect target gene expression, but a tendency for a time-dependent decrease of lhr and dmrt1 mRNA levels was observed in both treatment and placebo groups. By 8 weeks of treatment, however, 11KT implants provoked the upregulation of fshr and foxl2 transcript levels. Furthermore, lhr and dmrt1 transcript abundances recovered by 8 weeks of exposure in both blank- and 11KT-implanted beluga. These results suggest that 11KT, either directly or indirectly, may affect gametogenesis and regulate some key components of the reproductive axis in female beluga.

Although generally successful over time, their success has been confined to certain therapeutic areas and, within those areas, certain diseases. Times have changed. The research and development (R&D) burdens and public health urgency that acted as an impetus for the FDA to intervene more actively for certain disease areas are now broadly experienced across many disease areas. This betokens the need for the FDA to make designation and implementation decisions with a view that reaches beyond the immediate horizons of political expediency and patient advocacy to encompass the broader expanse of factors that now influence R&D decisions--global competitiveness, the needs of investors, emerging sponsors, and patient-focused drug development.","Milne, C-P",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1038/clpt.2013.155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23917473/,238

We have used the modified Bateman SIZ algorithm to predict the effects of interventional measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS Model parameters, e.g., doubling time and rate of decrease in the number of infectious persons were obtained from published reports. Predictions were made for the status quo on June 1, 2020, and for interventional measures obtained for 4 scenarios. These included vaccination of the whole population using a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine having an efficacy of 50% and 100%, mass-testing for COVID-19 coronavirus and application of the Corona-Warn-App. RESULTS The principle findings were 1) without new measures to control the pandemic, the daily number of infectious persons could reach a peak of > 4,500 daily within 18 months when > 67,000 persons would have been infected. This could be prevented by using a vaccine with 50% efficacy which was almost equally effective as a vaccine with 100% efficacy. Application of the Corona-Warn-App was the most effective method and more effective than testing for COVID-19. The methodology used has been described in detail to enable other researchers to apply the modified Bateman SIZ model to obtain predictions for COVID-19 outbreaks in other regions. Application of the model has been verified by independent investigators using different commercial software packages. CONCLUSION The modified Bateman SIZ model has been verified and used to predict the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in Heidelberg. Lockdown measures alone are insufficient to control the pandemic during 2021. Vaccination, diagnostic tests, and use of the Corona-Warn-App with quarantine could successfully control the spread of the coronavirus infection in the community. The Corona-Warn-App applied correctly may be the most effective. The model showed that vaccination with 50% efficacy is almost as effective as vaccination with 100% efficacy.","Braun, Peter; Haffner, Steffen; Woodcock, Barry G",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646540/,238

BACKGROUND Patients with high PR on clopidogrel have a greater incidence of adverse ischemic events after stent implantation, whereas low PR may increase bleeding. Due to limited sample size, previous studies have not been able to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics that may confound the relationship of PR and outcomes. METHODS In the ADAPT-DES study, routine platelet function testing (VerifyNow) was performed following clopidogrel loading. To characterize the independent association between PR and clinical events, patients were stratified into quintiles of P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). RESULTS The PRU medians of the 5 quintiles were 57, 130, 187, 244, and 317 (most to least inhibited). There was a monotonic association between successively higher PRU quintiles and stent thrombosis, whereas for clinically relevant bleeding, the greatest risk occurred in the lowest PRU quintile, with similar risks across the 4 higher quintiles. These relationships remained significant in fully adjusted multivariable analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for stent thrombosis in Q5 versus Q1: 2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17 to 4.59; p = 0.02; adjusted HR for clinically relevant bleeding in Q5 versus Q1: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.77; p < 0.001). However, there were no significant independent associations between the level of PRU and mortality. CONCLUSIONS In this large observational study, increasing PRU was associated with a monotonic increase in stent thrombosis, whereas bleeding risk was confined to the lowest PRU quintile, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window of platelet inhibition at moderately inhibited PRU. However, there was no demonstrable threshold effect for PRU and mortality in adjusted analyses, perhaps due to the offsetting impact of bleeding and ischemia across the spectrum of platelet inhibition.

121245,[Malignant arterial hypertension (HTAM) with severe systolic dysfunction of the reversible left ventricle].,2019-11-14,"OBJECTIVES During the current covid-19 pandemic, healthcare students had to stop their face-to-face attendance at medical colleges and universities. This condition has resulted in a change in how learning and assessment of psychiatric and interprofessional practice occur. The pandemic has also increased clinical mentors' need to follow their mentees' educational progress via virtual technology, including smartphone-based educational apps. The aim of the study is to propose a model in psychiatric and medical interprofessional practice e-assessment. METHODS In this study, 228 undergraduate healthcare students underwent a training period in interprofessional practice across specialties being assessed by Ecological Momentary e-Assessment (EMeA), and consisting of ongoing or before/after Interprofessional Education (IPE) learning evaluations with the assistance of an IPE-app linked to online surveys. The Goodness of Fit Test Chi-square and t-test statistics analyzed the data. RESULTS Surveys during, at entry and exit points in IPE captured increased percentages of learners, specifically, reporting high patient satisfaction with interprofessional teams (c2=22.54; p<.01), learners experiencing very good quality of care when delivered by interprofessional teams (c2=30.02; p<.01) assessed by distance technology, and learners selecting less frequently peers from the same clinical background when support was needed in patient care (c2=19.84; p<.01). CONCLUSIONS Contextual assessment (in the real-time and real-world scenario) of IPE learning moments via EMeA shows its value and applicability during the current covid-19 pandemic when the assessment of learning cannot occur face-to-face between learners and teachers. All healthcare students, including those on psychiatric rotations, could log in their progress, self-reflective assessments, and responses to coordinated care in interprofessional teams, without needing direct contact with their clinical tutors, and while treating patients with mental and physical illnesses, also including covid-19 positive patients.","Lazzari, Carlo; Mcaleer, Sean; Nusair, Abdul; Rabottini, Marco",Rivista di psichiatria,https://doi.org/10.1708/3594.35765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899828/,238

However, it has become a predominant cancer and now accounts for approximately 10% of cancer-related mortality in western countries. The 'rise' of colorectal cancer in developed countries can be attributed to the increasingly ageing population, unfavourable modern dietary habits and an increase in risk factors, such as smoking, low physical exercise and obesity. New treatments for primary and metastatic colorectal cancer have emerged, providing additional options for patients; these treatments include laparoscopic surgery for primary disease, more-aggressive resection of metastatic disease (such as liver and pulmonary metastases), radiotherapy for rectal cancer, and neoadjuvant and palliative chemotherapies. However, these new treatment options have had limited impact on cure rates and long-term survival. For these reasons, and the recognition that colorectal cancer is long preceded by a polypoid precursor, screening programmes have gained momentum. This Primer provides an overview of the current state of the art of knowledge on the epidemiology and mechanisms of colorectal cancer, as well as on diagnosis and treatment.","Kuipers, Ernst J; Grady, William M; Lieberman, David; Seufferlein, Thomas; Sung, Joseph J; Boelens, Petra G; van de Velde, Cornelis J H; Watanabe, Toshiaki",Nature reviews.

AIM We aimed to evaluate safety and outcomes of intravenous thrombolysis treatment in stroke patients with prestroke disability. METHODS We analyzed 88,094 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis, recorded in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke (SITS) International Thrombolysis Register between January 2003 and December 2017, with available NIHSS data at stroke-onset and after 24 h. Of them, 4566 patients (5.2%) had prestroke disability, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3-5. Safety outcome measures included Symptomatic Intracerebral Hemorrhage, any type of parenchymal hematoma on 24 h imaging scans irrespective of clinical symptoms, and death within seven days. Early outcome measures were 24-h NIHSS improvement (≥4 from baseline to 24 h). RESULTS Patients with prestroke disability were older, had more severe strokes, and more comorbidities than patients without prestroke disability. When comparing patients with prestroke disability with patients without prestroke disability, there was however no significant increase in adjusted odds for symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio 0.83 (95% CI 0.60-1.15) (absolute difference in proportion 1.17% vs. 1.27%)) or for parenchymal hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio 0.96 (0.83-1.11) (7.51% vs. 6.34%)). The prestroke disability group had a significantly lower-adjusted odds ratio for a 24-h NIHSS improvement (adjusted odds ratio 0.79 (0.73-0.85) (45.95% vs. 48.45%)) and a higher adjusted odds ratio for seven-day mortality (aOR 1.40 (1.21-1.61) (10.40% vs. 4.93%)). CONCLUSIONS Intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke patients with prestroke disability was not associated with an increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or parenchymal hemorrhage.

The objective of this review was to discuss the modifications required in the operating room during COVID-19 times for minimal access, laparoscopy, and robotic surgery, especially with regard to minimally invasive surgical instruments, buffalo filter, trocars with smoke evacuator, and special personal protection equipment. We have discussed the safety measures to be followed for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient. In addition to surgical patients, health care workers should also protect themselves by following the guidelines and recommendations while treating these patients. Although there is little evidence of viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend modifications to surgical practice such as the use of safe smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use to reduce the risk of exposure to aerosolized particles to the health care team. Therefore, hospitals must follow specific protocols and arrange suitable training of the health care workers. Following well-established plans to accomplish un-deferrable surgeries in COVID-19-positive patients is strongly recommended.","Somashekhar, S P; Acharya, Rudra; Manjiri, S; Talwar, Sumit; Ashwin, K R; Rohit Kumar, C",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350620964323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026956/,238

We aimed to compare clinical and surgical outcomes between mini-laparoscopic surgery (MLS) and conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for benign adnexal masses. As far as we know, no comparative study exists between these two minimal invasive procedures. METHODS During the period between January 2014 and December 2016, a total number of 132 laparoscopic surgeries were performed for bening adnexal masses in our clinic. Seventy women underwent CLS and 62 women underwent MLS. Pathological results and operating time of procedures, estimated blood loss, preoperative and postoperative complications, patient scale and observer scale (POSAS) and length of hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS There was no difference between the two groups regarding preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative surgical procedure performed, and length of hospital stay. The groups were compared in terms of postoperative pathological diagnosis using the Chi-square test, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Comparing the operation time and hematocrit change, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups. Both patient and observer PSOAS scar scores were better in MLS group (P < 0.05).

Recently, local immunomodulation garnered interests as a way to improve the immune response. We were interested in improving the RFA immune response priming to propose a curative treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on antitumor immunity. First, we demonstrated that the RFA did not increase the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in secondary distant tumors of patients and in mice model and could not avoid relapse. Remarkably, RFA and in situ immunomodulation with GM-CSF-BCG hydrogel induced complete cure of microscopic secondary lesions in mice, related to a strong specific immune response. Then, we demonstrated that the immune escape of large secondary lesions was reversed by addition of the systemic PD-1 blockade to the in situ immunomodulation. The lack of an effective distant immune response in patients treated with RFA confirmed the relevance of this new combination strategy. Increasing the in situ priming response of radiofrequency ablation provides effective adjuvants to induce an abscopal effect. In the case of large lesions, synergy between PD1 blockade inhibitor, ineffective alone or after single RFA, with in situ immunomodulation, could lead to reconsideration of the use of checkpoint inhibition in metastatic MSS CRC.","Lemdani, Katia; Mignet, Nathalie; Boudy, Vincent; Seguin, Johanne; Oujagir, Edward; Bawa, Olivia; Peschaud, Frédérique; Emile, Jean-François; Capron, Claude; Malafosse, Robert",Oncoimmunology,https://doi.org/10.1080/2162402x.2018.1550342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30723580/,238

124613,Isolated pharmacomechanical thrombectomy for the management of chronic DVT.,2011,"Lack of a universal vaccine against all serotypes of influenza A viruses and recent progress on T cell-related vaccines against influenza A virus illuminate the important role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in anti-influenza virus immunity. However, the diverse HLA alleles among humans complicate virus-specific cellular immunity research, and elucidation of cross-HLA allele T cell responses to influenza virus specificity requires further detailed work. An ideal CTL epitope-based vaccine would cover a broad spectrum of epitope antigens presented by most, if not all, of the HLAs. Here, we evaluated the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus-specific T cell responses among the HLA-A24(+) population using a rationally designed peptide pool during the 2009 pandemic. Unexpectedly, cross-HLA allele T cell responses against the influenza A virus peptides were detected among both HLA-A11(+) and HLA-A24(+) donors. Furthermore, we found cross-responses in the entire HLA-A3 supertype population (including HLA-A11, -A31, -A33, and -A30). The cross-allele antigenic peptides within the peptide pool were identified and characterized, and the crystal structures of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complexes were determined. The subsequent HLA-A24-defined cross-allele peptides recognized by the HLA-A11(+) population were shown to mildly bind to the HLA-A*1101 molecule. Together with the structural models, these results partially explain the cross-allele responses. Our findings elucidate the promiscuity of the cross-allele T cell responses against influenza A viruses and are beneficial for the development of a T cell epitope-based vaccine applied in a broader population.","Liu, Jun; Zhang, Shihong; Tan, Shuguang; Yi, Yong; Wu, Bin; Cao, Bin; Zhu, Fengcai; Wang, Chen; Wang, Hua; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01841-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23015716/,238

This study investigates the knowledge and perceptions about SDF of graduating dental students in multiple U.S. dental schools, as well as their willingness to use SDF in their practices. METHODS A survey was designed consisting of 21 total questions: 6 questions regarding students' demographic information and their SDF content exposure contextualization, 8 questions tailored to investigate 2 domains regarding students' knowledge about SDF (properties and indication), and 7 questions aiming to investigate 3 domains regarding students' perceptions about SDF (SDF usefulness, appropriateness of using SDF, and willingness to use SDF when in private practice). The survey was then distributed to graduating dental students at 7 U.S. dental schools. RESULTS A total of 386 surveys (response rate of 55%) was collected from 7 schools in the Spring of 2019. The median score resulting from the SDF content exposure questions was 3 (SD = 1.43) from a range of 0-5. The median score from knowledge about SDF properties was 4 (SD = 1.18) from a range of 0 to 6. In the multivariate analysis, a linear model found that the covariates ""SDF Usefulness"", ""SDF Appropriateness"" and ""SDF Patient Willingness to Use"" were significantly associated with higher student willingness to use SDF (R2 = 0.395).

The dramatic rise in early onset NCDs - such as childhood obesity, the allergy epidemic and an increasing burden of mental ill health in children and youth - reflect the profound early impact of modern environments on developing systems. The ORIGINS Project is a research platform enabling world class investigation of early antecedent pathways to NCDs, and how to curtail these. As well as facilitating strategic long-term research capacity, ORIGINS is a pipeline for short-term productivity through a series of clinical trials, early interventions, mechanistic studies, and targeted research questions to improve maternal and paternal health and the early environment. Methods ORIGINS is a decade-long collaborative initiative between the Joondalup Health Campus (JHC) and the Telethon Kids Institute (TKI) to establish a Western Australian (WA) birth cohort of 10,000 families, enrolled during pregnancy. It is currently funded to follow up participating children and their families to five years of age. Comprehensive data and biological samples are collected from participants at up to 15 different timepoints, from the first antenatal clinic visit. In the process, ORIGINS is creating a major research platform, consisting of an extensive, world class biobank and databank. Of key strength and novelty, ORIGINS includes a series of harmonised nested sub-projects integrated with clinical and diagnostic services and providing real-time feedback to improve the health of individuals and the community. Conclusions At its core, ORIGINS aims to improve the health and quality of life of the next generation through improved pathways to optimise the early environment and reduce adversity by promoting primary prevention, early detection and early intervention.

125101,Proinflammatory biomarkers' level and functional genetic polymorphisms in periprosthetic joint infection.,2018,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a new local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we investigated the risk factors associated with local recurrence of HCC after single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion. From April 2003 to December 2007, we treated 138 HCC lesions by single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion using the Cool-tip RFA, RTC 2000 and RTC 3000 Systems. Risk factors for the local recurrence of these lesions and complications after RFA were analyzed. The mean size of the 138 lesions was 16.9±5.4 mm in diameter (range 7-33 mm). Local recurrence rates were 6.6 and 22.0% at 1 and 2 years, respectively, during the mean follow-up period of 16.4 months. Univariate analysis showed that tumor diameter (≥20 mm), tumor location, pre-treatment AFP-L3 fraction level and ablation pattern were significant variables. Multivariate analysis of these four variables identified only the tumor diameter as an independent risk factor for local recurrence. Complications occurred in 2.2% of the lesions (3/138). Single-session RFA is an effective treatment for HCC in that it reduces serious complications. This study demonstrated that a tumor size ≥20 mm influenced the local recurrence of single-session RFA with a single electrode insertion.","Shiozawa, Kazue; Watanabe, Manabu; Wakui, Noritaka; Ikehara, Takashi; Iida, Kazunari; Sumino, Yasukiyo",Molecular medicine reports,https://doi.org/10.3892/mmr_00000067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21475796/,238

Incorrect management of this population may lead to increased morbidity and mortality. A three-day simulation-based boot camp serves to provide one-on-one instruction with a critical care provider. These intensivists may dispense personalized immediate feedback as learners engage in hands-on practice with a real mechanical ventilator. Multiple different pathologies can be reviewed that may not be encountered in the clinical setting. Learners can visualize immediate consequences of their actions and may troubleshoot and ask questions, all while in a safe learning environment. We describe the use of human-patient simulators connected to breathing simulators and mechanical ventilators. Potential curriculum executors should be aware of the cost of the equipment and the time needed to dedicate to boot camp execution; however, this intensive interactive training has been shown to increase provider competency, knowledge, and confidence in ventilator management.

While dentistry is known as one of the most exposed and high-risk professions, dental care professionals are indeed at even greater risk. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, occupational health practices, personal protective equipment usage, and mental stressors during COVID-19 pandemic among dental care professionals. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental care professionals who were subscribers to a dental hygiene journal using a self-administered online survey (n = 1047 respondents). Cross-tabulations were performed to determine differences in the responses to the statements related to different domains. RESULTS COVID-19 impacted the healthy work-life balance (p < 0.001) and caused sleeping difficulty among the respondents (p < 0.001). Moreover, a lower response on changing respirators and gloves for each patient compared with before viral pandemic was observed (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Ongoing training on infection control, occupational health practices, and PPE usage can prevent the transmission of COVID-19 among dental care professionals and the public. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is a burden for applying occupational health practices in dental clinics and present a risk to the public. COVID-19 may contribute to developing psychological stress and disrupt healthy work-life balance among dental professionals.","Banaee, Sean; Claiborne, Denise M; Akpinar-Elci, Muge",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-205319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843712/,238

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Prospective cohort studies with any follow-up period. Studies had to develop or validate multifactorial prognostic models for falls in community-dwelling older adults (60+ years). Models had to be applicable for screening in a general population setting. INFORMATION SOURCE MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and Web of Science for studies published in English, Danish, Norwegian or Swedish until January 2020. Sources also included trial registries, clinical guidelines, reference lists of included papers, along with contacting clinical experts to locate published studies. DATA EXTRACTION AND RISK OF BIAS Two authors performed all review stages independently. Data extraction followed the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies checklist. Risk of bias assessments on participants, predictors, outcomes and analysis methods followed Prediction study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool. RESULTS After screening 11 789 studies, 30 were eligible for inclusion (n=86 369 participants). Median age of participants ranged from 67.5 to 83.0 years. Falls incidences varied from 5.9% to 59%. Included studies reported 69 developed and three validated prediction models. Most frequent falls predictors were prior falls, age, sex, measures of gait, balance and strength, along with vision and disability. The area under the curve was available for 40 (55.6%) models, ranging from 0.49 to 0.87. Validated models' The area under the curve ranged from 0.62 to 0.69. All models had a high risk of bias, mostly due to limitations in statistical methods, outcome assessments and restrictive eligibility criteria. CONCLUSIONS An abundance of prognostic models on falls risk have been developed, but with a wide range in discriminatory performance. All models exhibited a high risk of bias rendering them unreliable for prediction in clinical practice. Future prognostic prediction models should comply with recent recommendations such as Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis.

Current therapy for nonexudative AMD (neAMD) is aimed at modifying risk factors and vitamin supplementation to slow progression while intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) injections are the mainstay for treatment of choroidal neovascularization in exudative AMD (eAMD). AREAS COVERED Over the past decade, promising therapies have emerged that aim to improve the current standard of care for both diseases. Clinical trials for neAMD are investigating targets in the complement cascade, Vitamin A metabolism, metformin, and tetracycline whereas clinical trials for eAMD are aiming to decrease treatment burden through novel port delivery systems, increasing drug half-life, and targeting new sites of the VEGF cascade. Stem cell and gene therapy are also being evaluated for treatment of neAMD and eAMD. EXPERT OPINION With an aging population, the need for effective, long term, low burden treatment options for AMD will be in increasingly high demand. Current investigations aim to address the shortcomings of current treatment options with breakthrough treatment approaches. Therapeutics in the pipeline hold promise for improving the treatment of AMD, and are on track for widespread use within the next decade.","Asahi, Masumi G; Avaylon, Jaycob; Wallsh, Josh; Gallemore, Ron P",Expert opinion on emerging drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728214.2021.1931120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030572/,238

The placement of Insorb absorbable subcuticular staples (Insorb, Incisive Surgical, Plymouth, MN) may allow for a decreased closure time compared with other modalities. OBJECTIVES The authors evaluated the utility of Insorb staples for the closure of mammaplasty and abdominoplasty incisions. METHODS Sixty patients who underwent anterior abdominal dermatolipectomy, total circular abdominal dermatolipectomy, bilateral breast reduction, or bilateral mastopexy were evaluated in a prospective study. Dermal closure was achieved on 1 side of each patient with Insorb absorbable staples and on the other with absorbable monofilament sutures. Scar quality, pruritus, and pain were scored according to a modified Vancouver Scar Scale (mVSS) at 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS Closure with absorbable staples was approximately 7-fold faster than closure with absorbable sutures for all surgical procedures. No significant differences in mVSS scores were noted between incisions closed with staples vs sutures. CONCLUSIONS Absorbable staples enable faster closure of a surgical incision without compromising scar quality or patient comfort.

METHODS This retrospective observational study was conducted from 11 March to 4 May 2020 in the only intensive care unit (ICU) authorized to manage COVID-19 patients in Reunion Island, a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean region. All patients with unknown COVID-19 status were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on ICU admission; those who tested negative were transferred to the COVID-19-free area of the ICU. RESULTS Over the study period, 99 patients were admitted to our ICU. A total of 33 patients were hospitalized in the COVID-19 isolation ward, of whom 11 were positive for COVID-19. The main differential diagnoses of severe COVID-19 were: community-acquired pneumonia, dengue, leptospirosis causing intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The median age of COVID-19-positive patients was higher than that of COVID-19-negative patients (71 [58 - 74] vs. 54 [46 - 63.5] years, p=0.045). No distinguishing clinical, biological, or radiological characteristics were found between the two groups of patients. All COVID-19-positive patients had recently traveled or been in contact with a recent traveler.

Accurate prediction of blade metal temperature can avoid the use of excessive compressed bypass air and allow higher turbine inlet temperature, increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing emissions. Large eddy simulation (LES) has been established to predict heat transfer coefficients with good accuracy under various non-canonical flows, but is still limited to relatively simple geometries and low Reynolds numbers. It is envisioned that the projected increase in computational power combined with a drop in price-to-performance ratio will make system-level simulations using LES in complex blade geometries at engine conditions accessible to the design process in the coming one to two decades. In making this possible, two key challenges are addressed in this paper: working with complex intricate blade geometries and simulating high-Reynolds-number (Re) flows. It is proposed to use the immersed boundary method (IBM) combined with LES wall functions. A ribbed duct at Re=20 000 is simulated using the IBM, and a two-pass ribbed duct is simulated at Re=100 000 with and without rotation (rotation number Ro=0.2) using LES with wall functions. The results validate that the IBM is a viable alternative to body-conforming grids and that LES with wall functions reproduces experimental results at a much lower computational cost.","Tafti, Danesh K; He, Long; Nagendra, K","Philosophical transactions.

This study aimed to determine the exposure of cats to C. burnetii in four distinct cat subpopulations. An indirect immunofluoresence assay (IFA) and an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) used for detection of anti-C. burnetii antibodies in humans were adapted, verified for use on feline serum, and compared. Cat serum samples (n=712) were tested with IFA from four subpopulations [cattery-confined breeding cats, pet cats, feral cats and shelter cats]. The proportions of seropositive cats were; cattery-confined breeding cats (35/376, 9.3%), pets (2/198, 1%), feral cats (0/50), shelter cats (0/88). The significant variables in C. burnetii seropositivity were cattery-confined breeding cat subpopulation and sterilisation status, with infected cats 17.1 (CI 4.2-70.2; P<0.001) times more likely to be cattery-confined breeding cats and 6.00 (CI 2.13-16.89; P<0.001) times more likely to be entire than sterilised. ELISA was used on 143 of 712 sera tested with IFA, and the Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.75 indicated 92.2% agreement between the two assays. These results confirm that Australian cats have been exposed to C. burnetii and that a higher seroprevalence of C. burnetii is seen amongst cattery-confined breeding cats. Cat breeders and veterinary personnel involved in feline reproductive procedures may be at higher risk of exposure to C. burnetii.","Shapiro, Amanda J; Bosward, Katrina L; Heller, Jane; Norris, Jacqueline M",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25778545/,238

129886,Rare CT feature in a COVID-19 patient: cavitation.,2020-05-21,"Myeloid cells, including granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, are crucial players in innate immunity and inflammation. These cells constitutively or inducibly express a number of receptors of the TNFR and TLR families, whose signals are transduced by TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) molecules. In vitro studies showed that TRAF3 is required for TLR-induced type I IFN production, but the in vivo function of TRAF3 in myeloid cells remains unknown. In this article, we report the generation and characterization of myeloid cell-specific TRAF3-deficient (M-TRAF3(-/-)) mice, which allowed us to gain insights into the in vivo functions of TRAF3 in myeloid cells. We found that TRAF3 ablation did not affect the maturation or homeostasis of myeloid cells in young adult mice, even though TRAF3-deficient macrophages and neutrophils exhibited constitutive NF-κB2 activation. However, in response to injections with LPS (a bacterial mimic) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (a viral mimic), M-TRAF3(-/-) mice exhibited an altered profile of cytokine production. M-TRAF3(-/-) mice immunized with T cell-independent and -dependent Ags displayed elevated T cell-independent IgG3 and T cell-dependent IgG2b responses. Interestingly, 15- to 22-mo-old M-TRAF3(-/-) mice spontaneously developed chronic inflammation or tumors, often affecting multiple organs. Taken together, our findings indicate that TRAF3 expressed in myeloid cells regulates immune responses in myeloid cells and acts to inhibit inflammation and tumor development in mice.","Lalani, Almin I; Moore, Carissa R; Luo, Chang; Kreider, Benjamin Z; Liu, Yan; Morse, Herbert C; Xie, Ping",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1401548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25422508/,238
130092,"COVID-19 More Frequent, Severe in Cancer Patients.",2020-04-20,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopy training has become an integral part of surgical education. Suturing and knot tying is a basic, yet inherent part of many laparoscopic operations, and should be mastered prior to operating on patients. One common and standardized suturing technique is the C-loop technique. In the standard training setting, on a box trainer, the trainee learns the psychomotor movements of the task and the laparoscopic visuospatial orientation simultaneously. Learning the psychomotor and visuospatial skills separately and sequentially may offer a more time-efficient alternative to the current standard of training. METHODS This is a monocentric, two-arm randomized controlled trial. The participants are medical students in their clinical years (third to sixth year) at Heidelberg University who have not previously partaken in a laparoscopic training course lasting more than 2 hours. A total of 54 students are randomized into one of two arms in a 1:1 ratio to sequential learning (group 1) or control (group 2). Both groups receive a standardized introduction to the training center, laparoscopic instruments, and C-loop technique. Group 1 learn the C-loop using a transparent shoebox, thus only learning the psychomotor skills. Once they reach proficiency, they then perform the same knot tying procedure on a box trainer with standard laparoscopic view, where they combine their psychomotor skills with the visuospatial orientation inherent to laparoscopy. Group 2 learn the C-loop using solely a box trainer with standard laparoscopic view until they reach proficiency. Trainees work in pairs and time is recorded for each attempt. The primary outcome is mean total training time for each group. Secondary endpoints include procedural and knot quality subscore differences. Tertiary endpoints include studying the influence of gender and video game experience on performance. DISCUSSION This study addresses whether the learning of the psychomotor and visuospatial aspects of laparoscopic suturing and knot tying is optimal sequentially or simultaneously, by assessing total training time, procedural, and knot quality differences between the two groups. It will improve the efficiency of future laparoscopic suturing courses and may serve as an indicator for laparoscopic training in a broader context, i.e., not only for suturing and knot tying.

Preterm birth was induced at 131 days of gestation in 82 lambs; controls (n = 31) were born at term (145 days). Overall survival of preterm lambs was 60%; males had significantly lower survival than females (44% vs 76%); 94% of term lambs survived. Although the birth weight of preterm lambs was approximately 0.9 kg lower than in term lambs, the crown-to-rump and forelimb lengths were similar. At 9 weeks after term-equivalent age, there were no differences in body weight or dimensions between preterm and term lambs; when adjusted for body weight, the heart was 21% heavier in preterm than term lambs. We conclude that moderately preterm birth in sheep is characterized by a greater survival of female lambs than males and has significant effects on organ development.","De Matteo, Robert; Blasch, Natasha; Stokes, Victoria; Davis, Peter; Harding, Richard",Reproductive sciences,https://doi.org/10.1177/1933719110369182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20445008/,238

We state the consolidated and systematic approach for academic medical centres in response to the evolving pandemic outbreaks for sustaining medical education.Discussion: Academic medical centres need to establish a 'COVID-19 response team' in order to make time-sensitive decisions while managing pandemic threats. Major themes of medical education management include leveraging on remote or decentralised modes of medical education delivery, maintaining the integrity of formative and summative assessments while restructuring patient-contact components, and developing action plans for maintenance of essential activities based on pandemic risk alert levels. These core principles must be applied seamlessly across the various fraternities of academic centres: undergraduate education, residency training, continuous professional development and research. Key decisions from the pandemic response teams that help to minimise major disruptions in medical education and to control disease transmissions include: minimising inter-cluster cross contaminations and plans for segregation within and among cohorts; reshuffling academic calendars; postponing or restructuring assessments.Conclusions: While minimising the transmission of the pandemic outbreak within the healthcare establishments is paramount, medical education and research activities cannot come to a standstill each time there is a threat of one.","Ashokka, Balakrishnan; Ong, Say Yang; Tay, Kwang Hui; Loh, Ne Hooi Will; Gee, Chen Fun; Samarasekera, Dujeepa D",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1757634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401085/,238

One of the most difficult challenges that nurses faced in the midst of the crisis was the lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE). The lack of PPE left health care professionals with a complicated ethical dilemma: Is there an ethical duty to care for patients in the absence of proper PPE? This article seeks to help the individual nurse (a) understand the ethical dilemma and the tensions that it brings, (b) look to the literature for guidance, and (c) understand how individuals can apply these ethical principles. After careful analysis, the recommendation is for the individual nurse to make a thorough assessment of their personal situation. This will include consideration for their family, community, financial responsibilities, legal protections, organizational policies, and personal health risk.

However, minimally invasive approach is unable to match the outcome of classic surgical technique due to difficulty in creating some of linear ablation lines. Hybrid procedure using catheter mapping and ablation in addition to minimally invasive surgical ablation has gained interest to combine the advantages of both procedures. No large study has been conducted to date comparing this new technique to other existing treatments.

SOURCE MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ProQuest Dissertations were searched from inception to 29 June 2017 for studies that investigated the effects of interventions with potential to humanize care of the critically ill on the following outcomes: empathy among critical care professionals, anxiety among relatives, and burnout and compassion fatigue in either group. We defined a humanizing intervention as one with substantial potential to increase physical or emotional proximity to the patient. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and data quality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Twelve studies addressing four discrete interventions (liberal visitation, diaries, family participation in basic care, and witnessed resuscitation) and one mixed intervention were included. Ten studies measured anxiety among 1,055 relatives. Two studies measured burnout in 288 critical care professionals. None addressed empathy or compassion fatigue. Eleven of the included studies had an overall high risk of bias. No pooled estimates of effect were calculated as a priori criteria for data synthesis were not met. CONCLUSIONS We found insufficient evidence to make any quantitative assessment of the effect of humanizing interventions on any of these psychologic outcomes. We observed a trend towards reduced anxiety among family members who participated in basic patient care, liberal visitation, and diary keeping. We found conflicting effects of liberal visitation on burnout among healthcare professionals.","Galvin, Imelda M; Leitch, Jordan; Gill, Rebecca; Poser, Katherine; McKeown, Sandra",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-018-1227-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30315505/,238
132632,Klebsiella pneumoniae blaNDM-1 carrying a class 1 integron causing a hospital outbreak in a Mexican attention center.,2021-05-31,"Importance The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) indicated that urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures should continue during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although decreases in the frequency of critical procedures have been reported outside the field of ophthalmology, analyses are limited by volume, geography, and time. Objective To evaluate whether the frequency of ophthalmic surgical procedures deemed urgent or emergent by the AAO changed across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants Vitreoretinal practices from 17 institutions throughout the US participated in this multicenter cross-sectional study. The frequency of 11 billed vitreoretinal Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes across respective weeks was obtained from each practice between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020. Data were clustered into intravitreal injections (code 67028), lasers and cryotherapy (codes 67141, 67145, and 67228), retinal detachment (RD) repairs (codes 67107, 67108, 67110, and 67113), and other vitrectomies (codes 67036, 67039, and 67040). Institutions were categorized by region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West Coast), practice setting (academic [tax-exempt] or private [non-tax-exempt]), and date of respective statewide stay-at-home orders. Main Outcomes and Measures Nationwide changes in the frequency of billing for urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results A total of 526 536 CPT codes were ascertained: 483 313 injections, 19 257 lasers or cryotherapy, 14 949 RD repairs, and 9017 other vitrectomies. Relative to 2019, a weekly institutional decrease in injections was observed from March 30 to May 2, 2020, with a maximal 38.6% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 437.8 [436.3] to 273.8 [269.0] injections) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -259 to -69 injections; P = .002). A weekly decrease was also identified that spanned a longer interval, at least until study conclusion (March 16 to May 31, 2020), for lasers and cryotherapy, with a maximal 79.6% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 6.6 [7.7] to 1.5 [2.0] procedures) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -6.8 to -3.3 procedures; P < .001), for RD repairs, with a maximal 59.4% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 3.5 [4.0] to 1.6 [2.2] repairs) from April 13 to 19, 2020 (95% CI, -2.7 to -1.4 repairs; P < .001), and for other vitrectomies, with a maximal 84.3% decrease (from a mean [SD] of 3.0 [3.1] to 0.4 [0.8] other vitrectomies) from April 6 to 12, 2020 (95% CI, -3.3 to -1.8 other vitrectomies; P < .001). No differences were identified by region, setting, or state-level stay-at-home order adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance Although the AAO endorsed the continued performance of urgent or emergent vitreoretinal surgical procedures, the frequency of such procedures throughout the country experienced a substantial decrease that may persist after the COVID-19 pandemic's initial exponential growth phase. This decrease appears independent of region, setting, and state-level stay-at-home orders. It is unknown to what extent vitreoretinal intervention would have decreased without AAO recommendations, and how the decrease is associated with outcomes. Although safety is paramount during the COVID-19 pandemic, practices should consider prioritizing availability for managing high-acuity conditions until underlying reasons for the reduction are fully appreciated.","Breazzano, Mark P; Nair, Archana A; Arevalo, J Fernando; Barakat, Mark R; Berrocal, Audina M; Chang, Jonathan S; Chen, Andrew; Eliott, Dean; Garg, Sunir J; Ghadiali, Quraish; Gong, Dan; Grewal, Dilraj S; Handa, James T; Henderson, Matthew; Leiderman, Yannek I; Leng, Theodore; Mannina, Amar; Mendel, Thomas A; Mustafi, Debarshi; de Koo, Lisa C Olmos; Patel, Shriji N; Patel, Tapan P; Prenner, Jonathan; Richards, Paige; Singh, Rishi P; Wykoff, Charles C; Yannuzzi, Nicolas A; Yu, Hannah; Modi, Yasha S; Chang, Stanley",JAMA ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.0036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662093/,238

133135,Acute sore throat revisited: clinical and experimental evidence for the efficacy of over-the-counter AMC/DCBA throat lozenges.,2011,"BACKGROUND Studies of social distancing during epidemics have found that the strength of the response can have a decisive impact on the outcome. In previous work we developed a model of social distancing driven by individuals' risk attitude, a parameter which determines the extent to which social contacts are reduced in response to a given infection level. We showed by simulation that a strong response, driven by a highly cautious risk attitude, can quickly suppress an epidemic. However, a moderately cautious risk attitude gives weak control and, by prolonging the epidemic without reducing its impact, may yield a worse outcome than doing nothing. In real societies, social distancing may arise spontaneously from individual choices rather than being imposed centrally. There is little data available about this as opportunistic data collection during epidemics is difficult. Our study uses a simulated epidemic in a computer game setting to measure the social distancing response. METHODS Two hundred thirty participants played a computer game simulating an epidemic on a spatial network. The player controls one individual in a population of 2500 (with others controlled by computer) and decides how many others to contact each day. To mimic real-world trade-offs, the player is motivated to make contact by being rewarded with points, while simultaneously being deterred by the threat of infection. Participants completed a questionnaire regarding psychological measures of health protection motivation. Finally, simulations were used to compare the experimentally-observed response to epidemics with no response. RESULTS Participants reduced contacts in response to infection in a manner consistent with our model of social distancing. The experimentally observed response was too weak to halt epidemics quickly, resulting in a somewhat reduced attack rate and a substantially reduced peak attack rate, but longer duration and fewer social contacts, compared to no response. Little correlation was observed between participants' risk attitudes and the psychological measures. CONCLUSIONS Our cognitive model of social distancing matches responses to a simulated epidemic. If these responses indicate real world behaviour, spontaneous social distancing can be expected to reduce peak attack rates. However, additional measures are needed if it is important to stop an epidemic quickly.","Kleczkowski, Adam; Maharaj, Savi; Rasmussen, Susan; Williams, Lynn; Cairns, Nicole",BMC public health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-2336-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26415861/,238
133359,Angioedema: differential diagnosis and acute management.,2021-06-16,"This article argues that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures intended to slow the rate of transmission of the virus resulted in greater subjective isolation and community distrust, in turn adversely impacting psychological distress. To support this argument, we examine data from the Canadian Quality of Work and Economic Life Study, two national surveys of Canadian workers-one from late September 2019 (N = 2,477) and the second from mid-March 2020 (N = 2,446). Analyses show that subjective isolation and community distrust increased between the two surveys, which led to a substantial rise in psychological distress. Increases in subjective isolation were stronger in older respondents, resulting in a greater escalation in psychological distress. These findings support a Durkheimian perspective on the harm to social integration and mental health caused by periods of rapid social change but also illustrate how a life course context can differentiate individual vulnerability to disintegrative social forces.","Bierman, Alex; Schieman, Scott",Journal of health and social behavior,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146520970190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211540/,238

Its usual manifestations are fever, cough, and fatigue; although some cases present skin lesions. CASES REPORT The first case was a 30-year-old woman with a history of controlled solar urticaria who presented erythematous and pruritic wheals in malar and cervical regions and extremities; associated with general malaise, headaches, and nausea, in whom the presence of COVID-19 was confirmed; her condition improved with a quadruple dose of antihistamines. The second case was a 47-year-old woman with a history of wasp sting anaphylaxis, without mastocytosis, who presented nasal congestion, headaches, and hypogeusia associated with generalized, erythematous, and pruritic wheals, with confirmation of COVID-19; her condition improved with quadruple doses of antihistamines. CONCLUSIONS Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 are frequent and can be classified as inflammatory and vascular. Among them, urticarial lesions occupy the fourth place, and although there could be some predominance of these in patients with a history of allergies, more studies are required to define an association.","López, Catalina; Cardona, Ricardo",Revista alergia Mexico,https://doi.org/10.29262/ram.v68i3.869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634853/,238

134084,Changes in body composition by age and obesity status in preschool-aged children: the STEPS study.,2020-07-09,"Venous leg ulcers (VLUs) have a significant impact on approximately 3% of the adult population worldwide, with a mean NHS wound care cost of £7600 per VLU over 12 months. The standard care for VLUs is compression therapy, with a significant number of ulcers failing to heal with this treatment, especially with wound size being a risk factor for non-healing. This multicentre, prospective, randomised trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of autologous skin cell suspension (ASCS) combined with compression therapy compared with standard compression alone (Control) for the treatment of VLUs. Incidence of complete wound closure at 14 weeks, donor site closure, pain, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), satisfaction, and safety were assessed in 52 patients. At Week 14, VLUs treated with ASCS + compression had a statistically greater decrease in ulcer area compared with the Control (8.94 cm2 versus 1.23 cm2 , P = .0143). This finding was largely driven by ulcers >10 to 80 cm2 in size, as these ulcers had a higher mean percentage of reepithelialization at 14 weeks (ASCS + compression: 69.97% and Control: 11.07%, P = .0480). Additionally, subjects treated with ASCS + compression experienced a decrease in pain and an increase in HRQoL compared with the Control. This study indicates that application of ASCS + compression accelerates healing in large venous ulcers.","Hayes, Paul D; Harding, Keith G; Johnson, Susan M; McCollum, Charles; Téot, Luc; Mercer, Kevin; Russell, David",International wound journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/iwj.13293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32103603/,238

According to the most recent literature, bacteria could be considered also as one of the major causes of asthma exacerbations that we need to further explore. RECENT FINDINGS The availability of novel methods to detect large panels of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria specific for the upper respiratory tract, together with the capacity of evaluating how basophils are activated, has changed the point of view of the mechanisms related to asthma exacerbations. The recent finding that basophils are activated in the presence of suboptimal doses of allergens and bacteria has been recently described and may explain the clinical behavior of allergy exacerbation. Indeed the activation of basophils induces the secretion of mediators, which, at bronchial level, may cause bronchospasm that leads to an asthma exacerbation in patients with infection. The contrary is also true. SUMMARY Although the explanations for these facts are numerous, at present, bacteria seem to play a relevant role in the worsening of asthma in infected patients.","Melioli, Giovanni; Passalacqua, Giovanni; Baena-Cagnani, Carlos E; Canonica, Giorgio W",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aci.0b013e328350fd91; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22391753/,238

This report presents the case of a 29-year-old man who presented with a deep intraparenchymal hematoma on the left side secondary to the spontaneous rupture of a claustral AVM. Upon resorption of the hematoma, the patient underwent an initial therapeutic session of N-butyl-2 cyanoacrylate endovascular embolization, with the purpose of reducing the AVM volume and flow before performing Gamma Knife radiosurgery. After glue injection into one of the arterial feeders, the control angiography showed a partial migration of the glue cast into the straight sinus, with most of the nidus still visible. Because of the bleeding risk due to possible venous hypertension, it was decided to try to retrieve the glue from the vein by using a stent retriever via jugular access. This maneuver allowed a nearly complete removal of the glue cast, thereby restoring normal venous flow drainage. The patient showed no clinical worsening after the procedure. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the use of the Solitaire FR device as a rescue glue retriever. This method should be considered by physicians in cases of unintended glue migration into the venous circulation during AVM embolization.","Fahed, Robert; Clarençon, Frédéric; Sourour, Nader-Antoine; Chauvet, Dorian; Le Jean, Lise; Chiras, Jacques; Di Maria, Federico",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.5.jns15145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26613173/,238
134172,Propofol pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile and its electroencephalographic interaction with remifentanil in children.,2018,"BACKGROUND Wedge resection is the most commonly used method in laparoscopic partial gastrectomy for gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). However, this method can involve inadvertent resection of additional gastric tissue and cause gastric deformation. To minimize the volume of resected gastric tissue, we have developed a laparoscopic partial gastrectomy with seromyotomy which we call the 'lift-and-cut method' for gastric GIST. Here, we report a case series of this surgery. METHOD First, the seromuscular layer around the tumor is cut. Because the mucosa and submucosa are extensible, the tumor is lifted toward the abdominal cavity. After sufficient lifting, the gastric tissue under the tumor is cut at the submucosal layer with a linear stapler (thus 'lift-and-cut method'). Finally, the defect in the seromuscular layer is closed with a hand-sewn suture. RESULTS From April 2011 to December 2015, 28 patients underwent laparoscopic partial gastrectomy by this method at Osaka Red Cross Hospital. Average operation time was 126 min (range 65-302 min) and average blood loss was 10 ml (range 0-200 ml). No intraoperative complications including tumor rupture or postoperative complications regarded as Clavien-Dindo Grade II or higher occurred. All patients took sufficient solid diet at discharge. Median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range 5-21 days). On median follow-up of 26.6 months (range 6-54 months), no recurrence was reported. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic partial gastrectomy by the lift-and-cut method is safe and simple, and widely applicable for gastric GIST.","Okumura, Shintaro; Kanaya, Seiichiro; Hosogi, Hisahiro; Ito, Takeshi; Miura, Susumu; Okada, Toshihiro; Shimoike, Norihiro; Akagawa, Shin; Kawada, Hironori; Arimoto, Akira",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5367-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27924391/,238

OBJECTIVES The primary objective was to compare in-hospital outcomes of CDT plus anticoagulation with those of anticoagulation alone. The secondary objective was to evaluate the temporal trends in the utilization and outcomes of CDT in the treatment of proximal DVT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational study of patients with a principal discharge diagnosis of proximal or caval DVT from 2005 to 2010 in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. We compared patients treated with CDT plus anticoagulation with the patients treated with anticoagulation alone. We used propensity scores to construct 2 matched groups of 3594 patients in each group for comparative outcomes analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes included bleeding complications, length of stay, and hospital charges. RESULTS Among a total of 90,618 patients hospitalized for DVT (national estimate of 449,200 hospitalizations), 3649 (4.1%) underwent CDT. The CDT utilization rates increased from 2.3% in 2005 to 5.9% in 2010. Based on the propensity-matched comparison, the in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups (1.2% vs 0.9%) (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.88-2.25]) (P = .15). The rates of blood transfusion (11.1% vs 6.5%) (OR, 1.85 [95% CI, 1.57-2.20]) (P < .001), pulmonary embolism (17.9% vs 11.4%) (OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001), intracranial hemorrhage (0.9% vs 0.3%) (OR, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.40-5.30]) (P = .03), and vena cava filter placement (34.8% vs 15.6%) (OR, 2.89 [95% CI, 2.58-3.23]) (P < .001) were significantly higher in the CDT group. The CDT group had longer mean (SD) length of stay (7.2 [5.8] vs 5.0 [4.7] days) (OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.49-1.94]) (P < .001) and higher hospital charges ($85,094 [$69,121] vs $28,164 [$42,067]) (P < .001) compared with the anticoagulation group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, we did not find any difference in the mortality between the CDT and the anticoagulation groups, but evidence of higher adverse events was noted in the CDT group. In the context of this observational data and continued improvements in technology, a randomized trial with outcomes such as mortality and postthrombotic syndrome is needed to definitively address this comparative effectiveness.","Bashir, Riyaz; Zack, Chad J; Zhao, Huaqing; Comerota, Anthony J; Bove, Alfred A",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.3415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25047081/,238

The objective of this study is to compare survival of patients with residual disease and to study the effect of receipt of guideline vs. non-guideline concordant care. Methods The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify patients who underwent treatment naïve surgical resection with clinical stage T1-3N0-1M0 NSCLC between 2006-2016 and had pN2 disease, positive surgical margins, or both. Concordant care was determined based on form of chemotherapy and radiation, dosage, volume, modality, and duration. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used to compare five-year survival. Multivariable analysis using Cox proportional hazards modeling identified factors that contributed to worse overall survival. Results There were 8,189 patients included: pN2 (5,416), positive margins (2,386), and both (387). Five-year survival rates for all patients were pN2 (35.8%), positive margins (33.9%), and both (22.9%) (P<0.0001). On multivariable analysis, positive margins were an independent predictor of better survival relative to pN2 disease (HR =0.729, CI: 0.676, 0.787, P<0.0001). Receipt of non-guideline concordant treatment was an independent predictor of worse survival compared to receipt of guideline-concordant treatment (HR =1.61, CI: 1.504, 1.725, P<0.0001). Conclusions In upfront surgical patients, guideline-concordant treatment in the setting of residual disease is associated with better overall survival compared with non-guideline concordant treatment. Pathologic N2 disease is associated with a lower survival rate than positive resection margins, possibly reflecting the systemic nature of pN2 disease.","Lieu, Dustin K; Ding, Li; David, Elizabeth A; Wightman, Sean C; Atay, Scott M; McFadden, P Michael; Kim, Anthony W",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-21-110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164181/,238
135050,"Epidemiology, Clinical Characteristics of the First Cases of COVID-19.",2020-07-29,"INTRODUCTION Dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness have made automated management of fluid resuscitation more practical. We present initial simulation data for a novel closed-loop fluid-management algorithm (LIR, Learning Intravenous Resuscitator). METHODS The performance of the closed-loop algorithm was tested in three phases by using a patient simulator including a pulse-pressure variation output. In the first phase, LIR was tested in three different hemorrhage scenarios and compared with no management. In the second phase, we compared LIR with 20 practicing anesthesiologists for the management of a simulated hemorrhage scenario. In the third phase, LIR was tested under conditions of noise and artifact in the dynamic predictor. RESULTS In the first phase, we observed a significant difference between the unmanaged and the LIR groups in moderate to large hemorrhages in heart rate (76 ± 8 versus 141 ± 29 beats/min), mean arterial pressure (91 ± 6 versus 59 ± 26 mm Hg), and cardiac output (CO; (6.4 ± 0.9 versus 3.2 ± 1.8 L/min) (P < 0.005 for all comparisons). In the second phase, LIR intervened significantly earlier than the practitioners (16.0 ± 1.3 minutes versus 21.5 ± 5.6 minutes; P < 0.05) and gave more total fluid (2,675 ± 244 ml versus 1,968 ± 644 ml; P < 0.05). The mean CO was higher in the LIR group than in the practitioner group (5.9 ± 0.2 versus 5.2 ± 0.6 L/min; P < 0.05). Finally, in the third phase, despite the addition of noise to the pulse-pressure variation value, no significant difference was found across conditions in mean, final, or minimum CO.

135052,Variation in the pharmacokinetics of glucosamine in healthy individuals.,2020-09-09,"OBJECTIVE This study presents short-term outcomes related to changes in existing and de novo lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), pelvic pain, and bowel function following robot-assisted laparoscopic uterosacral ligament suspension (RALUSLS) and sacrocolpopexy (RALSC). METHODS Observational data for RALUSLS (n = 23) and RALSC (n = 25) collected between August 2014 and March 2016 from a single institute (The University of Texas Medical Branch) were evaluated retrospectively. Patient characteristics, concomitant procedures, and the occurrence of lower urinary tract, pelvic pain, and bowel symptoms were compared between patients undergoing RALUSLS and RALSC. RESULTS There was no significant difference in background characteristics between the 2 groups, except for parity, which was high in the RALUSLS group. In the RALUSLS group, patients experienced significant resolution of urinary urgency (P < .001) and frequency, urge and mixed incontinence, and pelvic pain (P < .05). In the RALSC group, there was significant resolution of nocturia, mixed incontinence, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia (P < .05). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of de novo symptoms in the RALUSLS and RALSC groups (P > .05), although newly appearing urinary urgency or frequency and stress or urge incontinence were more common after RALSC. CONCLUSION Mixed incontinence and pelvic pain improved significantly in patients after RALUSLS or RALSC. In RALUSLS patients, urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence also improved, whereas additional improvement in nocturia and dyspareunia was evident only in RALSC patients. De novo LUTS developing after these procedures, especially after RALSC, necessitate careful patient consultation prior to surgery.","Kurdoglu, Mertihan; Unlu, Serdar; Antonetti-Elford, Megan; Kurdoglu, Zehra; Kilic, Gokhan S",Lower urinary tract symptoms,https://doi.org/10.1111/luts.12219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29508556/,238

136403,Management of Newly-diagnosed Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: a Survey of UK Uro-oncologists.,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a hereditary disorder that has no cure and can result in end stage kidney failure. Searching for health information online and via social media is a common phenomenon in many medical conditions. However, no recent studies have documented the information needs, online behaviours, and concerns of people with PKD. The aim of this study was to explore the information needs of individuals with PKD and their carers by documenting (i) the information needs (ii) online information health seeking behaviours (iii) the perceived challenges of living with PKD and (iv) dietary concerns. METHODS A 17-item survey was constructed by undertaking a social listening analysis. This survey was then distributed via PKD related social media groups on Facebook. Seven groups distributed the survey with permission from the group owners. Open free text survey questions were analysed thematically using content analysis. RESULTS A total of 536 respondents completed the online survey (70.9 % female, 77 % aged 35-70, 70.2 % diagnosed more than 10 years ago). The major information need expressed by participants with PKD was for dietary information. Information regarding medications, medical management and symptom control were also desired. The overarching themes arising from the free text responses to the major challenge of living with PKD included 'learning to navigate dietary ambiguities'; 'managing social, psychological and emotional needs'; and 'accepting an uncertain future'. In addition to a strong desire for practical and specific dietary information, participants expressed a need for more online information pertaining to management of fatigue, pain, complications and how to manage mental health. Online peer support was also highly regarded and desired. CONCLUSIONS This study provides contemporary insights into the type of information desired by people with PKD. The results indicated that there was a strong desire for unambiguous information and guidance from health professionals to facilitate self-management, alleviate concerns, and address the complexities of living with Polycystic Kidney Disease. While diet is an important and frequently expressed need, there also remains a large demand for information on how to support psychological needs, and on medical management in order to support treatment decision making. Future work is required to develop specific, actionable and evidence-based resources for patients that are available online and through health professionals. Increased access to renal dietitians, peer support and additional training for health professionals could also improve patient-centered care and support self-management.","Ma, Tiffany; Lambert, Kelly",BMC nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02472-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34261447/,238
136414,Diagnosis and Treatment Plan for COVID-19 (Trial Version 6).,2020-03-17,"BACKGROUND Patient selection for surgery after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer depends on accurate restaging of mediastinal (N2) lymph nodes. Our objective is to assess the accuracy of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for restaging N2 lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS This is a retrospective review of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent staging with repeat computed tomography and positron emission tomography and had restaging EBUS for sampling of N2 lymph nodes. Endobronchial ultrasound was performed for suspicious nodes in stations 2R, 2L, 4R, 4L, and 7. Selected patients who were N2-negative underwent thoracotomy with complete thoracic lymphadenectomy. RESULTS There were 32 patients with N2 disease who underwent preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or both, and subsequently had restaging EBUS. There were 3 patients who had recalcitrant N2 nodal disease detected by EBUS. There were 5 patients with pulmonary function or comorbidities that were prohibitive for surgery. Of the remaining 24 patients with negative EBUS, 3 underwent mediastinoscopy and 2 had recalcitrant N2 disease. The remaining 22 patients underwent thoracotomy. Recalcitrant N2 disease was noted in 1 patient at thoracotomy in the EBUS-assessable nodal stations. Thus EBUS was falsely negative in 3 patients. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of restaging EBUS were 50% and 88%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Restaging EBUS is relatively accurate at predicting the absence of metastatic disease in N2 mediastinal lymph node in patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.","Nasir, Basil S; Bryant, Ayesha S; Minnich, Douglas J; Wei, Ben; Dransfield, Mark T; Cerfolio, Robert J",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2014.04.091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25069682/,238

136821,Utilization of acute gout prophylaxis in the real world: a retrospective database cohort analysis.,2020-08-15,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been shown to induce autophagy but the mechanisms underpinning this process remain to be elucidated. Induction of autophagy requires the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Vps34, which produces phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This recruits proteins with PI3P binding domains such as the double-FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1). DFCP1 generates cup-shaped protrusions from the ER membrane, termed omegasomes, which provide a platform for the production of autophagosomes. Here we present data demonstrating that both Vps34 and DFCP1 are required for HCV genome replication, in the context of both a subgenomic replicon and virus infection, but did not affect virus entry or initial translation. Using live cell fluorescence microscopy we demonstrated that early during HCV infection the nascent viral genome replication complexes (identified by using non-structural protein NS5A as a marker) transiently colocalize with DFCP1-positive punctae (omegasomes), before the two structures move apart from each other. This observation is reminiscent of the transient association of LC3 and DFCP1 during omegasome formation, and therefore we propose that omegasomes are utilized by HCV to generate the double-membrane vesicles which are the hallmark of HCV replication complexes.","Mohl, Bjorn-Patrick; Bartlett, Christopher; Mankouri, Jamel; Harris, Mark",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26727924/,238
137284,Isolated Cranial Nerve 6 Palsy in 2 Patients With COVID-19 Infection: Erratum.,2021-06-01,"Scientific culture and structure organize biological sciences in many ways. We make choices concerning the systems and questions we study. Our research then amplifies these choices into factors that influence the directions of future research by shaping our hypotheses, data analyses, interpretation, publication venues, and dissemination via other methods. But our choices are shaped by more than objective curiosity-we are influenced by cultural paradigms reinforced by societal upbringing and scientific indoctrination during training. This extends to the systems and data that we consider to be ethically obtainable or available for study, and who is considered qualified to do research, ask questions, and communicate about research. It is also influenced by the profitability of concepts like open-access-a system designed to improve equity, but which enacts gatekeeping in unintended but foreseeable ways. Creating truly integrative biology programs will require more than intentionally developing departments or institutes that allow overlapping expertise in two or more subfields of biology. Interdisciplinary work requires the expertise of large and diverse teams of scientists working together-this is impossible without an authentic commitment to addressing, not denying, racism when practiced by individuals, institutions, and cultural aspects of academic science. We have identified starting points for remedying how our field has discouraged and caused harm, but we acknowledge there is a long path forward. This path must be paved with field-wide solutions and institutional buy-in: our solutions must match the scale of the problem.

These side effects are the object of much scrutiny in the medical community. We report the case of a 29-year-old male who was diagnosed with myopericarditis after his second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This patient is the second recognized case of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine induced myopericarditis in Korea and the first to have recovered from it. He originally presented with chest discomfort and exertional chest pain. Lab tests revealed elevated cardiac marker levels and echocardiographic findings displayed minimal pericardial effusion, prompting diagnosis as myopericarditis. We decided on two weeks of outpatient treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to the patient's mild symptoms and his occupation in the military. When this proved insufficient, we shifted to combination therapy with low dose corticosteroids and NSAIDs. After two weeks of treatment, the patient's symptoms and pericardial effusion had improved, and he was recovered completely 37 days after the onset.","Kim, Dongwon; Choi, Jun Hyung; Jang, Jun Young; So, Ouiyeon; Cho, EunJeong; Choi, Hyunhee; Hong, Kyung Soon; Park, Kyu Tae",Journal of Korean medical science,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636504/,238

However, it is unknown what types of exercises are most effective in activation of both the global and local stabilizers in these regions. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to establish the reliability of a novel clinical screening tool (sling screen) to assess the muscles of the abdomen and trunk. The second aim was to use the clinical screening tool and musculoskeletal ultrasound to compare the effects of a rotary-based exercise program that targets both the global and local muscles to the effects of a traditional exercise program on the activation of the abdominal and trunk muscles. DESIGN Double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING Sports medicine facility. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS Thirty-one healthy participants were randomly allocated to receive a single-session rotary-based or traditional ""core"" exercise program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The participants were assessed at the baseline and immediately postintervention. The primary outcome measures were muscle thickness examined by musculoskeletal ultrasound and clinical examination of muscle activation using a screening tool. The data were collected by blind assessors. Reliability and validity of a clinical screening tool (sling screen) were also assessed. RESULTS The analysis of the covariance tests showed a significant increase in oblique thickness for the rotary exercise group. All participants displayed a significant increase in multifidus thickness. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant increase in clinical assessment scores in the rotary exercise group but not the traditional exercise group. Reliability of the sling screen ranged from moderate to good. CONCLUSION This clinical trial provides evidence that a rotary-based exercise program may be more effective in producing increases in oblique muscle thickness than traditional ""core"" exercises in young, healthy adults. The sling screen tool was able to identify these muscle thickness changes. Future studies should investigate how these results correlate to injury risk, other populations, and also how to implement the sling screen into clinical practice.","Catania, Brian; Ross, Travis; Sandella, Bradley; Bley, Bradley; DiTrani Lobacz, Andrea",Journal of sport rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1123/jsr.2019-0156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723925/,238

To learn more about pathogenic PV autoantibodies, we isolated 15 IgG antibodies specific for DSG3 from 2 PV patients. Three antibodies disrupted keratinocyte monolayers in vitro, and 2 were pathogenic in a passive transfer model in neonatal mice. The epitopes recognized by the pathogenic antibodies were mapped to the DSG3 extracellular 1 (EC1) and EC2 subdomains, regions involved in cis-adhesive interactions. Using a site-specific serological assay, we found that the cis-adhesive interface on EC1 recognized by the pathogenic antibody PVA224 is the primary target of the autoantibodies present in the serum of PV patients. The autoantibodies isolated used different heavy- and light-chain variable region genes and carried high levels of somatic mutations in complementary-determining regions, consistent with antigenic selection. Remarkably, binding to DSG3 was lost when somatic mutations were reverted to the germline sequence. These findings identify the cis-adhesive interface of DSG3 as the immunodominant region targeted by pathogenic antibodies in PV and indicate that autoreactivity relies on somatic mutations generated in the response to an antigen unrelated to DSG3.","Di Zenzo, Giovanni; Di Lullo, Giulia; Corti, Davide; Calabresi, Valentina; Sinistro, Anna; Vanzetta, Fabrizia; Didona, Biagio; Cianchini, Giuseppe; Hertl, Michael; Eming, Rudiger; Amagai, Masayuki; Ohyama, Bungo; Hashimoto, Takashi; Sloostra, Jerry; Sallusto, Federica; Zambruno, Giovanna; Lanzavecchia, Antonio",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci64413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22996451/,238

Background: The COVID-19-pandemic is an unprecedented, exceptional situation and necessitates numerous adaptations of structures and processes in the acute inpatient setting. AIM The aim of this study was to explore how acute inpatient care was influenced by the pandemic and which implications may result for the future from nursing managers' and hygiene specialists' point of view. METHODS Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews with five nursing managers and three hygiene specialists in four German acute care hospitals. Interviews were interpreted by using content analysis. RESULTS Interviewees described how everyday routines in their hospitals were adapted to the prioritized care for COVID-19 patients. Main challenges were uncertainty and anxiety among staff, relative scarcity of equipment and workforce resources and rapid implementation of new requirements for treatment capacities. This was addressed by targeted communication and information, large efforts to ensure resources and coordinated control of all processes by cross-department, interprofessional task forces. CONCLUSIONS Adaptations made to the structures and procedures of care delivery during the pandemic hold potential for future improvements of routine care, e. g. new workplace and skill mix models. To identify detailed practical implications, a renewed and deepened data analysis is needed at a later point of time, with a larger distance to the period of the pandemic.","Silies, Katharina; Schley, Angelika; Sill, Janna; Fleischer, Steffen; Müller, Martin; Balzer, Katrin",Pflege,https://doi.org/10.1024/1012-5302/a000756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996862/,238

141549,[The role of HLA genes: from autoimmune diseases to COVID-19].,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has become a popular bariatric procedure. The mechanisms responsible for weight loss and improvement of metabolic disturbances have still not been completely elucidated. We investigated the effect of SG on body weight, adipose tissue depots, glucose tolerance, and liver steatosis independent of reduced caloric intake in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. METHODS C57BI/6 J mice fed a high fat diet (45 %) for 33 weeks were divided into three groups: sleeve gastrectomy (SG, 13 mice), sham-operated ad libitum fed (SALF, 13 mice) and sham-operated pair fed (PFS, 13 mice). The animals were humanely killed 23 days after surgery. RESULTS In SG mice, food intake was reduced transiently, but weight loss was significant and persistent compared to controls (SG vs. PFS, P < 0.05; PFS vs. SALF, P < 0.05). SG mice showed improved glucose tolerance and lower levels of liver steatosis compared with controls (area under the curve, SG vs. PFS, P < 0.01; PFS vs. SALF, P < 0.05) (liver steatosis, SG vs. PFS, P < 0.05; PFS vs. SALF, P < 0.01). This was associated with a decrease in the ratios of the weight of pancreas, epididymal and inguinal adipose tissues to body weight, and an increase in the ratio of brown adipose tissue weight to body weight. Epididymal adipose tissue was also infiltrated by fewer activated T cells and by more anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells. Serum levels of fasting acyl ghrelin were still significantly decreased 3 weeks after surgery in SG mice compared to PFS mice (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Reduced white adipose tissue inflammation, modification of adipose tissue development (brown vs. white adipose tissue), and ectopic fat are potential mechanisms that may account for the reduced caloric intake independent effects of SG.","Schneck, Anne-Sophie; Iannelli, Antonio; Patouraux, Stéphanie; Rousseau, Déborah; Bonnafous, Stéphanie; Bailly-Maitre, Beatrice; Le Thuc, Ophélia; Rovere, Carole; Panaia-Ferrari, Patricia; Anty, Rodolphe; Tran, Albert; Gual, Philippe; Gugenheim, Jean",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3211-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24196540/,238

141780,European Resuscitation Council Guidelines 2021: Executive summary.,2021-04-01,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of two bariatric procedures versus intensive medical therapy (IMT) on β-cell function and body composition. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 60 subjects with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 9.7 ± 1%) and moderate obesity (BMI 36 ± 2 kg/m(2)) randomized to IMT alone, IMT plus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or IMT plus sleeve gastrectomy. Assessment of β-cell function (mixed-meal tolerance testing) and body composition was performed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. RESULTS Glycemic control improved in all three groups at 24 months (N = 54), with a mean HbA1c of 6.7 ± 1.2% for gastric bypass, 7.1 ± 0.8% for sleeve gastrectomy, and 8.4 ± 2.3% for IMT (P < 0.05 for each surgical group versus IMT). Reduction in body fat was similar for both surgery groups, with greater absolute reduction in truncal fat in gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy (-16 vs. -10%; P = 0.04). Insulin sensitivity increased significantly from baseline in gastric bypass (2.7-fold; P = 0.004) and did not change in sleeve gastrectomy or IMT. β-Cell function (oral disposition index) increased 5.8-fold in gastric bypass from baseline, was markedly greater than IMT (P = 0.001), and was not different between sleeve gastrectomy versus IMT (P = 0.30). At 24 months, β-cell function inversely correlated with truncal fat and prandial free fatty acid levels. CONCLUSIONS Bariatric surgery provides durable glycemic control compared with intensive medical therapy at 2 years. Despite similar weight loss as sleeve gastrectomy, gastric bypass uniquely restores pancreatic β-cell function and reduces truncal fat, thus reversing the core defects in diabetes.","Kashyap, Sangeeta R; Bhatt, Deepak L; Wolski, Kathy; Watanabe, Richard M; Abdul-Ghani, Muhammad; Abood, Beth; Pothier, Claire E; Brethauer, Stacy; Nissen, Steven; Gupta, Manjula; Kirwan, John P; Schauer, Philip R",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc12-1596; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439632/,238

Presented with a hypothetical pandemic influenza scenario occurring overseas, the participants predicted their anticipated protective behaviors while abroad and recorded their attitudes toward potential screening measures at US ports of entry (POE). The survey also qualitatively explored factors that would influence compliance with health entry screening at POE. RESULTS Those who perceived pandemic influenza to be serious were more likely to state that they would be comfortable with screening (p = 0.006), and if they had influenza-like illness (ILI) overseas, would be more willing to see a physician and delay return travel (p = 0.006 and 0.002, respectively). Other demographic variables, including age and race, were associated with protective behaviors in response to ILI. Travelers also identified diverse information requirements which would influence their behavior in response to entry screening, including characteristics of the pandemic, severity of illness, and screening operations. CONCLUSIONS Demographic characteristics and perceived severity of illness are important factors that may influence the protective behaviors of travelers overseas. Our results indicate that educational material and advice directed to international travelers could be differentially tailored to traveler subpopulations.","Sharangpani, Ruta; Boulton, Kathryn E; Wells, Eden; Kim, Curi",Journal of travel medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1708-8305.2011.00500.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21539661/,238
142493,Reply to A. Greenberg et al.,2020-08-11,"INTRODUCTION Complete Mesocolic Excision (CME) has been proposed as the preferred surgical technique for resection of colon cancer. This prospective cohort study evaluates the effect of CME surgery on colon cancer mortality after right-sided hemicolectomy on a population level. METHODS Data from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry and the Cause of Death Registry on all patients treated with elective right-sided hemicolectomy for colon cancer stage I to III in the Stockholm County 2008-2012 were analyzed. Adherence to principles of CME surgery was determined by structured analysis of anonymized surgical reports regarding presence of five essential features. The exposure to CME was graded as group 0 (not exposed to CME), group 1 (intermediate) and group 2 (exposed to CME). RESULTS In total 1171 patients were analysed with 234 (20.0%) patients in CME group 0, 453 (38.7%) patients in CME group 1 and 484 (41.3%) in CME group 2. The 5-year colon cancer mortality was 20.2% in CME group 0, 13.9% in CME group 1 and 13.1% in CME group 2 (p=0.026). The adjusted hazard ratio for colon cancer mortality was 0.61 (95% CI 0.42 - 0.91; p=0.014) for CME group 1 and 0.52 (95% 0.35 - 0.77; p=0.001) for CME group 2. DISCUSSION The presence of predefined CME features in surgical reports was related to a graded benefit on cancer specific mortality after right-sided hemicolectomy for colon cancer stage I to III.","Bernhoff, Richard; Sjövall, Annika; Granath, Fredrik; Holm, Torbjörn; Martling, Anna; Buchli, Christian",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33624416/,238

DESIGN Qualitative comparative case study design of nurse staffing systems in England and Wales. METHODS Data will be collected through a variety of sources: individual interviews, observations of relevant meetings and analysis of key documents. Ethical approval for the study was granted in August 2020 from The Healthcare Research Ethics Committee (SREC reference: REC741). Data generation will be informed by science and technology studies and practice theories. DISCUSSION Ensuring adequate numbers of nurses are available to care for patients in response to shifting demand is an international policy priority. Emerging evidence on the use of formal workforce planning methodologies across the developed world highlights both the centrality of nurses' professional judgement in nurse staffing methodologies and the urgent need for theoretically informed research to better understand and conceptualise its contribution to decision-making. This study is designed to address this gap in understanding. It takes advantage of nurses' experiences of managing the service and staffing impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and differences in strategic approaches to nurse staffing systems between England and Wales. IMPACT The research will: make visible the knowledge and skills that underpin professional judgement in nurse staffing decisions and provide a conceptual language with which to articulate this; lay the foundations for evidence-based programmes of nurse education and continuing professional development; furnish the evidence to inform the development of nurse-led decision support tools to augment professional judgement; and generate wider insights into the effectiveness of nurse staffing systems in practice.","Jacob, Nina; Burton, Chris; Hale, Rachel; Jones, Aled; Lloyd, Amy; Rafferty, Anne Marie; Allen, Davina",Journal of advanced nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138491/,238

We performed prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial investigating effects of perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion on pulmonary function following thoracic aortic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest. Fifty-two patients were randomized to two groups: the dexmedetomidine group received 1 µg/kg of dexmedetomidine over 20 min after induction of anesthesia, followed by 0.5 µg/kg/h infusion until 12 h after aortic cross clamp (ACC)-off, while the control group received the same volume of normal saline. The primary endpoints were oxygenation indices including arterial O2 partial pressure (PaO2) to alveolar O2 partial pressure ratio (a/A ratio), (A-a) O2 gradient, PaO2/FiO2 and lung mechanics including peak inspiratory and plateau pressures and compliances, which were assessed after anesthesia induction, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after ACC-off. The secondary endpoints were serum biomarkers including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, superoxide dismutase, and malondialdehyde (MDA). As a result, dexmedetomidine did not confer protective effects on the lungs, but inhibited elevation of serum MDA level, indicative of anti-oxidative stress property, and improved urine output and lower requirements of vasopressors.","Kim, Seongsu; Park, Soo Jung; Nam, Sang Beom; Song, Suk-Won; Han, Yeonseung; Ko, Sangmin; Song, Young",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90210-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34040043/,238

146099,Parenteral Versus Oral Iron for Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anaemia During Pregnancy and post-partum: A Systematic Review.,2019,"BACKGROUND The mostly widely studied biomaterials for the sphincter sparing treatment of anal fistulas are fibrin glue and the anal fistula plug (AFP). However their overall mean clinical success is only 50-60%. As the understanding of the pathology of anal fistula, wound healing and the host response to materials has improved, so new biological sphincter-sparing strategies have been developed. The aim of this review is to assess the safety and efficacy of these novel techniques. METHOD PubMed, the Cochrane database and EMBASE were independently searched. All studies that investigated the potential of a biomaterial (defined as any synthetic or biologically derived substance in contact with host tissue) to augment the healing of anal fistula without sphincter division were included. Studies solely describing the role of fibrin glue or an AFP were excluded. Data extraction included type of material, fistula aetiology, treatment of the primary tract, fistula healing, incontinence, duration of follow-up and any specific complications. Systematic quality assessment of the included articles was performed. RESULTS Twenty-three articles were finally selected for review. These included a variety of biological and synthetic systems that were employed to deliver selected components of the extracellular matrix, growth factors, cytokines, stem cells or drugs to the fistula tract. CONCLUSION To date no study matches fistulotomy with regard to long-term fistula eradication rate. This is probably due to implant extrusion, inadequate track preparation or an unsuitable material. Future techniques need to address all these issues to ensure success. Success should be validated by MRI or long-term follow-up.","Lewis, R; Lunniss, P J; Hammond, T M",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2012.03192.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22882376/,238

146510,An Uncertain Public - Encouraging Acceptance of Covid-19 Vaccines.,2021-03-03,"Soleus (SOL) corticospinal excitability has been reported to increase during Achilles tendon vibration. The aim of the present study was to further investigate SOL corticospinal excitability and elucidate the changes to intracortical mechanisms during Achilles tendon vibration. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were elicited in the SOL by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the corresponding motor cortical area of the leg with and without 50-Hz Achilles tendon vibration. SOL input-output curves were determined. Paired-pulse protocols were also performed to investigate short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) by conditioning test TMS pulses with sub-threshold TMS pulses at inter-stimulus intervals of 3 and 13 ms, respectively. During Achilles tendon vibration, motor threshold was lower than in the control condition (43 ± 13 vs. 49 ± 11 % of maximal stimulator output; p = 0.008). Input-output curves were also influenced by vibration, i.e. there was increased maximal MEP amplitude (0.694 ± 0.347 vs. 0.268 ± 0.167 mV; p < 0.001), decreased TMS intensity to elicit a MEP of half the maximal MEP amplitude (100 ± 13 vs. 109 ± 9 % motor threshold; p = 0.009) and a strong tendency for decreased slope constant (0.076 ± 0.04 vs. 0.117 ± 0.04; p = 0.068). Vibration reduced ICF (98 ± 61 vs. 170 ± 105 % of test MEP amplitude; p = 0.05), but had no effect on SICI (53 ± 26 vs. 48 ± 22 % of test MEP amplitude; p = 0.68). The present results further document the increased vibration-induced corticospinal excitability in the soleus muscle and suggest that this increase is not mediated by changes in SICI or ICF.","Lapole, Thomas; Temesi, John; Arnal, Pierrick J; Gimenez, Philippe; Petitjean, Michel; Millet, Guillaume Y",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-015-4336-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26048160/,238
146518,Why do chronic illness patients decide to use complementary and alternative medicine? A qualitative study.,2021-03-11,"Introduction Bladder outflow obstruction (BOO) surgery is amongst the most commonly-performed urological procedures. Post-operative assessment consists of physical measurement of uroflowmetry and post void residual volume, but health systems worldwide have experienced pressures in demand, leading to exploration of greater efficiency in organising clinic protocols. International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire measurement has been identified as a tool to predict change in post-operative management. Our institution established a nurse-led follow-up virtual clinic (VC) for patients undergoing BOO surgery based on IPSS measurement. We present the clinical and economic outcomes of this new service. Materials and Methods Patients with a successful post-operative trial without catheter (TWOC) were contacted by telephone via VC, and discharged by a Urology Clinical Nurse Specialist (UCNS) if IPSS was <8. Data was analysed for IPSS; arrangement of subsequent clinic visits; and numbers discharged. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients discharged after VC consultation. Secondary outcomes were overall discharge rate following subsequent face-to-face (FTF) appointment; and the proportion of patients re-referred from Primary Care within three months of discharge from VC. Cost savings were calculated based on tariffs of £135 for first attendance with UCNS; £199 for uroflowmetry; and £47.84 for VC appointment. Results The first 50 patients to be recipients of the new VC were included. Median IPSS and Quality of Life score were 13 (interquartile range 5) and 3 (interquartile range 1) respectively. 39 (78%) patients were discharged from VC; 36 (72%) had IPSS <8. Overall discharge rate following subsequent FTF appointment was 88%. Two patients discharged from VC (5.1%) were subsequently re-referred, neither of whom required additional treatment. Total cost savings with VC amounted to £10,634. Conclusion Telephone follow-up for BOO surgery based on IPSS is clinically safe and cost-effective, providing greater efficiency for clinic protocols.","Sarmah, Piyush Bhargav; Broadley, Graham Alexander; Khwaja, Sikandar; Delves, George Henry",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.0319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668986/,238

However, these principles are frequently easier to state than to achieve. Evidence from recent literature suggests that avoidance of fluid excess is important, with excessive crystalloid use leading to perioperative weight gain and an increase in complications. A zero-balance approach aimed at avoiding fluid excess is recommended for all patients. For major surgery, there is a sizeable body of evidence that an individualized goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) improves outcomes. However, within an Enhanced Recovery program only a few studies have been published, yet so far GDFT has not achieved the same benefit. Balanced crystalloids are recommended for most patients.

A critical appraisal.,2020-09-08,"Purpose Obstruction of the tear drainage causes a range of ocular surface disorders. Hitherto, the genetics of tear duct development and obstruction has been scarcely explored, and related animal models are lacking. This study aims to study the potential role of the Wnt/PCP pathway mediated by Prickle 1 in tear duct development and diseases. Methods A severe hypomorphic Prickle 1 mutant was generated. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to compare wild type, Prickle 1 hypomorphic, and null mutant tear ducts. In situ hybridization was conducted to identify the signaling components in the developing tear ducts. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was used to detect the human embryonic tear duct. Results Here, we report that a severe Prickle 1 hypomorph mouse line exhibited epiphora. This phenotype was due to the blockage of the tear drainage by incompletely formed nasolacrimal duct (NLD) and lacrimal canaliculi (LC), which also causes precocious eyelid opening. We observed a dose-dependent requirement of Prickle 1 for tear duct outgrowth. An investigation of the expression of Wnt/PCP core genes demonstrated a subset of PCP signaling components expressed in the developing tear duct. Furthermore, Prickle 1 is not required for the expression of Fgfr2/Fgf10 and p63 genes, which are associated with the NLD and LC hypoplasia in humans. Last, we showed that Prickle 1 expression in the developing tear drainage system is conserved between mice and humans. Conclusions The study suggests that malformed tear ducts caused by disruption of Prickle 1 underlies the epiphora and precocious eyelid opening.","Ru, Jiali; Guo, Dianlei; Fan, Jiaying; Zhang, Jiao; Ju, Rong; Ouyang, Hong; Wei, Lai; Liu, Yizhi; Liu, Chunqiao",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.61.13.6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141892/,238

147322,Coronavirus in the elderly: a late lockdown UK cohort.,2020-09-10,"The proliferation and possible adverse effects of emerging contaminants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in waters and the environment is a cause for increasing concern. We investigated the dissipation of three PPCPs: ibuprofen (IBP), diclofenac (DCF) and triclosan (TCS), separately and in mixtures, in the ppm range in biopurification system (BPS) microcosms, paying special attention to their effect on bacterial ecotoxicity, as well as bacterial community structure and composition. The results reveal that BPS microcosms efficiently dissipate IBP and DCF with 90% removed after 45 and 84 days of incubation, respectively. However, removal of TCS required a longer incubation period of 127 days for 90% removal. Furthermore, dissipation of the PPCPs was slower when a mixture of all three was applied to BPS microcosms. TCS had an initial negative effect on bacterial viability by a decrease of 34-43% as measured by live bacterial cell counts using LIVE/DEAD® microscopy; however, this effect was mitigated when the three PPCPs were present simultaneously. The bacterial communities in BPS microcosms were more affected by incubation time than by the PPCPs used. Nonetheless, the PPCPs differentially affected the composition and relative abundance of bacterial taxa. IBP and DCF initially increased bacterial diversity and richness, while exposure to TCS generally provoked an opposite effect without full recovery at the end of the incubation period. TCS, which negatively affected the relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Methylophilales, and Legionellales, had the largest impact on bacterial groups. Biomarker OTUs were identified in the BPS microcosms which were constrained to higher concentrations of the PPCPs and thus are likely to harbour degradation and/or detoxification mechanisms. This study reveals for the first time the effect of PPCPs on bacterial ecotoxicity and diversity in biopurification system microcosms and also facilitates the design of further applications of biomixtures to eliminate PPCPs.","Aguilar-Romero, Inés; Romero, Esperanza; Wittich, Regina-Michaela; van Dillewijn, Pieter",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886990/,238

However, the effects of diabetes control including insulin use remain uncertain in terms of clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective observational study, all adult patients admitted to Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, from March 1 through April 24, 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and diabetes were included. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, insulin dose at home and at the hospital, other anti-hyperglycemic agents use, and outcomes were obtained. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the factors associated with diabetes control and mortality. Results: Patients who used insulin at home had higher mortality compared to those who did not (35% vs 18% p = .015), this was true even after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities and a1c OR 2.65 95% CI (1.23-5.71) p = .013. However, the mean a1c and the median home requirements of insulin did not significantly differ among patients who died compared to the ones that survived. Patients who died had significantly higher inpatient insulin requirements (highest day insulin requirement recorded in units during hospitalization) 36 (11-86) vs 21 (8-52) p = .043 despite similar baseline a1c and steroid doses received. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities and a1c, peak insulin requirements remained significantly associated with inpatient mortality OR 1.022 95% CI (1.00-1.04) p = .044. Conclusion: Among diabetic patients infected with COVID-19, insulin therapy at home was significantly independently associated with increased mortality. Peak daily inpatient insulin requirements was also independently associated with increased inpatient mortality.","Riahi, Shayan; Sombra, Lorenna Rodrigues Silva; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Chacko, Shireen R; Neto, Alvaro Goncalves Mendes; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel; Rangaswami, Janani; Anastasopoulou, Catherine",Endocrine research,https://doi.org/10.1080/07435800.2020.1856865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275067/,238

Over a one-yr period, 10 consecutive patients underwent left HARP-LDN with a mean body mass index of 29 and three with prior left abdomen surgery. The surgical technique utilizes a 7 cm, muscle-sparing incision for the hand-port with two endoscopic ports. Operative time was an average of 155 min., with no open conversions. Mean blood loss was 68 mL, and warm ischemia time was 2.5 min. Hospital stay averaged 2.7 d with postoperative complications limited to one urinary retention.

148327,A systematic review of interventions to improve adherence to endocrine therapy.,2019,"Highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has developed strategies to inhibit host immune recognition. We identify cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) as an interacting partner of the viral SARS-unique domain (SUD) and papain-like protease (PL(pro)), and, as a consequence, the involvement of cellular p53 as antagonist of coronaviral replication. Residues 95-144 of RCHY1 and 389-652 of SUD (SUD-NM) subdomains are crucial for interaction. Association with SUD increases the stability of RCHY1 and augments RCHY1-mediated ubiquitination as well as degradation of p53. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D), which normally influences RCHY1 stability by phosphorylation, also binds to SUD. In vivo phosphorylation shows that SUD does not regulate phosphorylation of RCHY1 via CAMK2D. Similarly to SUD, the PL(pro)s from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-NL63 physically interact with and stabilize RCHY1, and thus trigger degradation of endogenous p53. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease is encoded next to SUD within nonstructural protein 3. A SUD-PL(pro) fusion interacts with RCHY1 more intensively and causes stronger p53 degradation than SARS-CoV PL(pro) alone. We show that p53 inhibits replication of infectious SARS-CoV as well as of replicons and human coronavirus NL63. Hence, human coronaviruses antagonize the viral inhibitor p53 via stabilizing RCHY1 and promoting RCHY1-mediated p53 degradation.

Yet methodological scrutiny of the technique is scarce. The aim of the present study was to examine face validity and reliability of VATMS and its two main determinants (superimposed twitch during a maximal voluntary contraction [SIT100%] and estimated resting twitch [ERT]). METHODS SIT100%, ERT, and VATMS were measured on ten healthy males (age 24 ± 5 years) before and following intermittent isometric fatiguing exercise on two separate occasions. RESULTS The findings indicated issues regarding the accuracy of ERT and suggested a three-point relationship should not be used to determine ERT. Reliabilities for VATMS, SIT100%, and ERT were acceptable pre- but much weaker post-exercise (especially for SIT100%). Despite statistically significant changes in main neuromuscular variables following the intermittent isometric fatiguing exercise (P < 0.05), when post-exercise reliability was considered, the exercise effect on VATMS was smaller than the smallest detectable change in 18 of the 20 individual tests performed, and for the whole sample for one of two visits. Finally, maximal voluntary contraction was reduced significantly following the neuromuscular assessment (NMA) pre-exercise but recovered during the NMA post-exercise. CONCLUSION This is the first study to demonstrate a lack of sensitivity of key neuromuscular measurements to exercise and to evidence both presence of neuromuscular fatigue following the NMA in itself, and recovery of the neuromuscular function during the NMA post-exercise. These results challenge the face validity of this routinely used protocol.","Dekerle, Jeanne; Ansdell, P; Schäfer, L; Greenhouse-Tucknott, A; Wrightson, J",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-019-04089-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30746563/,238

As this change is accompanied by a spike in demand of laptops, an excessive amount of obsolete devices will be witnessed in the near future. Laptops are the most valuable e-waste category containing a high content of numerous critical raw materials, thus their waste management is crucial. Considering the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the laptop lifespan, the future quantities and pieces of obsolete laptops in Greece are estimated (2016-2040), as well as the critical raw materials (CRMs) and precious metals (PMs) embedded in them, to illustrate the potential of recovering useful resources, thus contributing to a circular economy. To this end, dynamic material flow analysis is adopted, lifespan distribution is evaluated and future sales are predicted by the logistic model utilizing a bounding analysis. Then the future End-of-Life (EoL) laptop quantities are estimated taking time-varying parameters into consideration such as penetration rate, population, laptop weight and lifespan. This study is a dynamic estimation that avoids using average values adopted from literature that are not country specific. The provided information is useful for implementing national plans, improving the management of the most valuable category, EoL laptops, enhancing resources efficiency and contributing to a circular economy. The coronavirus pandemic has a similar impact on laptop sales in other countries, affecting their future laptop waste as well.","Kastanaki, Eleni; Giannis, Apostolos",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2021.07.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34325330/,238

This study aims to describe a stringently selected community-based case-control cohort of non-dysplastic BE (NDBE) patients who progressed to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and BE patients who never progressed to be used for future biomarker studies. We identified all patients referred for endoscopic work-up of BE neoplasia at three tertiary referral centers for treatment of BE neoplasia between 2000 and 2013. We performed a detailed registration of any endoscopic surveillance history before neoplastic progression. Controls were selected from a retrospective BE surveillance registration in 10 community hospitals. A total of 887 patients were referred for endoscopic work-up of BE neoplasia. Based on predefined selection criteria, we identified 165 progressor patients (82% men; mean age 55 years ± 10.4) with a baseline endoscopy demonstrating NDBE > 2 years before neoplastic progression. Using the same predefined selection criteria, 723 nonprogressor patients (67% men; mean age 57 years ± 11.3) with >2 years of endoscopic surveillance were identified. Median length of the BE segment was 5 cm (IQR 4-7) in progressors and 4 cm (IQR 2-6) in controls. Median duration of surveillance was 89 months (IQR 54-139) in progressors and 76 months (IQR 47-116) in nonprogressors. Paraffin embedded biopsies are available for biomarker research in all patients. Ethical approval was obtained and material transfer agreements were signed with all 58 contributing pathology labs. This is the largest community-based case-control cohort of BE patients with and without progression to early neoplasia.

150645,"""Reversed halo sign"" on 3D CT in COVID-19.",2020-04-30,"BACKGROUND Blood eosinophil count has been proposed as a predictor of response to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) in the prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD. An optimal threshold of blood eosinophil count for prescribing ICS has not been agreed. Doubt has been cast on the role by observational studies. The role of inhaled corticosteroids in this relationship, independent of long-acting bronchodilators, has not been examined. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of post-hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies examining three blood eosinophil thresholds and the independent role of ICS. Included studies were categorised by the form (relative or absolute count) and cut point of eosinophil threshold used. Thresholds assessed were relative eosinophil count of 2%, and absolute counts of 150 cells/μL and 300 cells/μL. Three meta-analyses of the effect of ICS use in post-hoc analyses of RCTs based on these counts were carried out. Initial analysis included all studies of ICS vs. any non-ICS regimen. Further analysis examined the effect of ICS, independent of the effect of long-acting bronchodilators. RESULTS Sixteen studies examined the association between blood eosinophil count and response of exacerbation risk to ICS, in COPD patients. Eleven studies (25,881 patients) were post-hoc analyses of RCTs. Five studies (109,704 patients) were retrospective observational studies. The independent effect of ICS on the reduction of exacerbation risk was 20% at ≥2% blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85), 35% at ≥150 cells/μL blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.65; 0.52-0.79), and 39% at ≥300 cells/μL blood eosinophil threshold (RR, 0.61; 0.44-0.78). No association was found in four out of five observational studies. CONCLUSION This is the first systematic review to assess, in post-hoc analyses of RCTs, the independent effect of ICS in reducing the risk of COPD exacerbation across a range of blood eosinophil thresholds. Association between ICS prescription and reduced exacerbation risk at these thresholds was confirmed. The lack of association found in the observational studies questions the relevance of these observations to a ""real world"" COPD population. To clarify the clinical utility of this biomarker, the association should be tested in prospective effectiveness studies.","Harries, Timothy H; Rowland, Victoria; Corrigan, Christopher J; Marshall, Iain J; McDonnell, Lucy; Prasad, Vibhore; Schofield, Peter; Armstrong, David; White, Patrick",Respiratory research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12931-019-1268-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31900184/,238

The variability in which potential predictors of these outcomes are tested is also unclear. This paper is a protocol describing the methods of a planned scoping review. The scoping review will examine and summarise how change in depressive symptoms have been described in RCT treatment studies to date. This review will report the measures used to describe change in depressive symptoms and whether the measure was used as a continuous or binary outcome or both. This review will describe how dichotomous outcome terms are defined to describe change in depression severity. This review will also examine predictors, moderators and mediators of change in depressive symptoms within RCTs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS In this paper, we describe the protocol for our scoping review. Following the format outlined by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews, a research librarian will develop an operationalised search strategy, which we will apply to the MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases. We will search for papers from inception to 6 February 2020. A hand search for key citations will also be conducted. Investigator-raters will screen articles, first via the titles and abstracts and then through full-text reviews. We will include articles with randomised control design which assess the treatment of adolescents with major depressive disorder. We will systematically extract and synthesise prespecified data which includes: definition of depression used for participant inclusion, measures used to evaluate changes in depression, type of outcome used (continuous, binary or both), definitions of dichotomous terms to denote change in depression (eg, response, remission, recovery, etc) and reported predictors/moderators/mediators of change. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required.

151496,Racial and Ethnic Diversity in Studies Funded Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.,2021-04-12,"BACKGROUND Thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication for diaphragmatic paralysis with consecutive eventration and respiratory compromise is a desirable alternative to standard thoracotomy. Since minimally invasive techniques usually involve suturing of the diaphragm, most surgeons use a video-assisted approach with a minithoracotomy. Herein we describe our completely thoracoscopic technique for diaphragmatic plication including outcome. METHODS We present our technique and experience for completely thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication for the treatment of symptomatic diaphragmatic paralysis in six consecutive patients. The surgical technique basically consisted of stapling of the abundant diaphragm and reinforcement of the staple line using a self-locking thread. Primary outcome measure was the postoperative result (flattened diaphragm) and resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcome was improvement of lung function values 3 months after surgery. RESULTS Between June 2015 and March 2016, six patients have been operated for symptomatic diaphragmatic paralysis, with one of them suffering from additional transdiaphragmatic hernia. Flattening of the diaphragm was achieved in all 6 patients with resolution of their pre-existing symptoms within days after surgery and without any surgical complications. Lung function volumes measured 3 months postoperative improved markedly with an increase in FEV1 as well as FVC of 540 ml (SD ± 193 ml) and 776 ml (SD ± 121 ml), respectively. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the presented technique is a safe and simple minimally invasive way to perform a completely thoracoscopic diaphragmatic plication with excellent results so far.","Kocher, Gregor J; Zehnder, Adrian; Schmid, Ralph A",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-016-3789-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27822722/,238
152059,Association of rare predicted loss-of-function variants of influenza-related type I IFN genes with critical COVID-19 pneumonia.,2021-06-24,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) devotes a significant portion of its genome to producing nonstructural proteins required for viral replication. SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) was identified as an essential protein with RNA/DNA-binding activity, and yet its biological function within the replication complex remains unknown. Nsp9 forms a dimer through the interaction of parallel alpha-helices containing the protein-protein interaction motif GXXXG. In order to study the role of the nsp9 dimer in viral reproduction, residues G100 and G104 at the helix interface were targeted for mutation. Multi-angle light scattering measurements indicated that G100E, G104E, and G104V mutants are monomeric in solution, thereby disrupting the dimer. However, electrophoretic mobility assays revealed that the mutants bound RNA with similar affinity. Further experiments using fluorescence anisotropy showed a 10-fold reduction in RNA binding in the G100E and G104E mutants, whereas the G104V mutant had only a 4-fold reduction. The structure of G104E nsp9 was determined to 2.6-A resolution, revealing significant changes at the dimer interface. The nsp9 mutations were introduced into SARS-CoV using a reverse genetics approach, and the G100E and G104E mutations were found to be lethal to the virus. The G104V mutant produced highly debilitated virus and eventually reverted back to the wild-type protein sequence through a codon transversion. Together, these data indicate that dimerization of SARS-CoV nsp9 at the GXXXG motif is not critical for RNA binding but is necessary for viral replication.","Miknis, Zachary J; Donaldson, Eric F; Umland, Timothy C; Rimmer, Ryan A; Baric, Ralph S; Schultz, L Wayne",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01505-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19153232/,238

Patients with altered immunologic function are at higher risk of acquiring COVID-19. In patients with psoriasis, inhibition of select pro-inflammatory cytokines through the use of biologic agents has been shown to be an effective treatment option. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have key immunomodulatory effects and are known to be involved in the hosts' immune response to a variety of viral infections. Though little is currently known about the role of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19, early reports have shown patients with severe disease to have elevated serum levels of select inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha. This review will summarize key information that is currently known about COVID-19, the role of select cytokines in viral defense, and important considerations for patients with psoriasis using biologic agents during this pandemic. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to discontinue biologic therapy in patients with psoriasis who have not tested positive for COVID-19. The decision to pause biologic therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients in higher risk populations, and should take into account individual risk and benefit. Until more is known about the impact of biologic therapy on COVID-19 outcomes, we recommend patients with psoriasis who test positive for COVID-19 be instructed to discontinue or postpone biologic treatment until they have recovered from infection.","Ladda, Matthew; Lynde, Charles; Fleming, Patrick",Journal of cutaneous medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1203475420945234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32757760/,238

155331,Advances in peripheral arterial disease endovascular revascularization.,2015,"COVID-19 is associated with neuropsychiatric complications, the most frequent one being anxiety. Multiple biological and psychosocial factors contribute to anxiety in COVID-19. Among the biological factors, stress, genetics, gender, immune system, resilience, anosmia, hypogeusia, and central nervous system infection with SARS-CoV-2 are key. Anxiety is a complication of COVID-19 that may exacerbate the infection course, and the infection may exacerbate anxiety. We present the mechanisms of anxiety in symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19. We discuss the presentation of anxiety in patients without or with prior psychiatric illness, and with co-morbidities. Timely diagnosis and management of anxiety in COVID-19 patients is important. Given the frequent complication of COVID-19 with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Intensive Care Unit stay, anxiety may be a long-term complication. We review the diagnostic tools for anxiety in COVID-19, and summarise pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments. We provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and follow up of anxiety in COVID-19.Key pointsPatients with COVID-19 (symptomatic or asymptomatic) exhibit a high frequency of neuropsychiatric complications with highest percentage attributed to anxiety.Multiple biological and psychosocial risk factors for anxiety exist in COVID-19-ill individuals. Biological risk factors include stress, resilience, genetics, gender, age, immune system, direct infection of the central nervous system (CNS) with SARS-CoV-2, comorbid psychiatric and general medical illnesses, ARDS and ICU stay. Anosmia and hypogeusia are COVID-19-specific anxiety risk factors. Knowledge of the anxiety risk factors is essential to focus on timely interventions, because anxiety may be a complication of and exacerbate the COVID-19 course.An inverse correlation exists between resilience and anxiety because of COVID-19, and therefore efforts should be made to increase resilience in COVID-19 patients.In COVID-19, important anxiety mechanism is neuroinflammation resulting from activation of the immune system and an ensuing cytokine storm.The general approach to management of anxiety in COVID-19 should be compassionate, similar to that during trauma or disaster, with efforts focussed on instilling a sense of hope and resilience.In selecting pharmacological treatment of anxiety, the stress response and immune system effects should be key. Medications with cardio-respiratory adverse effects should be avoided in patients with respiratory problems.Anxiety is a disorder that will require for long-term follow up at least one month after COVID-19.","Uzunova, Genoveva; Pallanti, Stefano; Hollander, Eric",International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2021.1887264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33635172/,238

It has seriously affected people above the age of 60 years. The International Health Regulations (IHR) revised in 2005 bind governments to disclose vital information regarding the identification and detection of new disease outbreaks regardless of its causative agent. In contrast to the previous SARS epidemic, China timely informed the world about the onset of a new outbreak. It also soon disclosed the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Unfortunately, despite the fast recognition of the Chinese epidemic, the application of the 2005 IHR was not followed by an effective response in every country and most health authorities failed to rapidly perceive the threat posed by COVID-19. To further complicate matters, IHR implementation, which relies primarily on self-reporting data rather than on an external review mechanism, was limited in speed and further hindered by high costs. The response in Italy suffered from several limitations within the health system and services. The action against this threat must instead be quick, firm and at the highest trans-national level. The solution lies in further strengthening countries' preparedness through a clear political commitment, mobilization of proper resources and implementation of a strict surveillance and monitoring process.","Villa, Simone; Lombardi, Andrea; Mangioni, Davide; Bozzi, Giorgio; Bandera, Alessandra; Gori, Andrea; Raviglione, Mario C",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330781/,238

155917,'Food for thought': The importance of nutrition to patient care and the role of the junior doctor.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Transanal endoscopic microsurgery is a safe and efficacious surgical approach for local excision of benign adenomas and early-stage rectal cancer. However, utilization of the technique has been limited due to the unavailability of high-priced specialized instrumentation at many institutions and the technically demanding training required. To avoid these obstacles, we have explored an alternative approach called Transanal Endoscopic Video-Assisted excision, which combines the merits of singleport access and local transanal excision. METHODS A disposable single-incision port is inserted into the anal canal for transanal access. The port contains 3 cannulae for introducing instrumentation into the rectal lumen, and a supplementary cannula for carbon dioxide insufflation. Pneumorectum results in rectal distention and optimizes the visual field during the procedure. Standard laparoscopic instrumentation is utilized for visualization and transanal excision of rectal pathologies. CONCLUSIONS Transanal endoscopic video-assisted excision is an innovative approach to local excision of benign and malignant rectal lesions. The approach averts several of the pitfalls commonly experienced with transanal endoscopic microsurgery. Continued investigation and development of this novel modality will be important in establishing its role in minimally invasive surgery.","Ragupathi, Madhu; Haas, Eric M",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680810x12924466009005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21902943/,238

The gaps and strategies developed by India to meet the WHO guidelines on the effective control of epidemic-prone diseases and outbreaks are also presented in the review. Methods: Epidemiologic information of EIDs, namely Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola and Marburg viruses (EboV and MarV), Zika virus (ZIKAV), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah and Hendra virus (NiV and HeV), and Lassa fever virus (LASV), was drawn from international and national electronic databases to assess the situation. A brief view on the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India is also included. Results: There are no reports for human infection of EboV, MarV, RVF, and LASV in India. CCHF, SARS, ZIKAV, and NiV have been involved in outbreaks in eight states of India, while COVID-19 is currently reported from majority of states. India has deeply strengthened its surveillance and response system of outbreaks and epidemic-prone diseases. Conclusions: Despite its enormous improvements made in the anticipation of such threats, still more efforts are needed in sensitization of populations as well as hospital management in the context to EIDs, as addressed in the review. Furthermore, there is still a need for more research and development activities to efficiently control EIDs.","Kojom, Loick Pradel; Singh, Vineeta",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2020.2661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33316200/,238
157114,Modeling Strategies to Optimize Cancer Screening in USPTSF Guideline-Noncompliant Women.,2021-04-29,"Importance The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required the rapid transition to telehealth with the aim of providing patients with medical access and supporting clinicians while abiding by the stay-at-home orders. Objective To assess demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with patient participation in telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included all pediatric and adult patient encounters at the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery in a tertiary care, academic, multisubspecialty, multisite practice located in an early hot spot for the COVID-19 pandemic from March 17 to May 1, 2020. Encounters included completed synchronous virtual, telephone, and in-person visits as well as visit no-shows. Main Outcomes and Measures Patient demographic characteristics, insurance status, and 2010 Census block level data as a proxy for socioeconomic status were extracted. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were created for patient-level comparisons. Results Of the 1162 patients (604 females [52.0%]; median age, 55 [range, 0-97] years) included, 990 completed visits; of these, 437 (44.1%) completed a virtual visit. After multivariate adjustment, females (odds ratio [OR], 1.71; 95% CI, 1.11-2.63) and patients with preferred provider organization insurance (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.40-5.20) were more likely to complete a virtual visit compared with a telephone visit. Increasing age (OR per year, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99) and being in the lowest median household income quartile (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86) were associated with lower odds of completing a virtual visit overall. Those patients within the second (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.99) and lowest (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.62) quartiles of median household income by census block and those with Medicaid, no insurance, or other public insurance (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.94) were more likely to complete a telephone visit. Finally, being within the lower 2 quartiles of proportion being married (OR for third quartile, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.29-0.86]; OR for lowest quartile, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.23-0.67]) was associated with higher likelihood of a no-show visit. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that age, sex, median household income, insurance status, and marital status are associated with patient participation in telehealth. These findings identify vulnerable patient populations who may not engage with telehealth, yet still require medical care in a changing health care delivery landscape.","Darrat, Ilaaf; Tam, Samantha; Boulis, Marwan; Williams, Amy M",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.5161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443539/,238

157714,"Radiation Delay Is Okay, But Where Is the Evidence?-Reply.",2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND Uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Simultaneous comparison of the multiple treatment options using traditional study designs is problematic; multiarm clinical trials often are logistically constrained to small sample sizes, and traditional meta-analyses are limited to comparisons of only two treatments that have been compared in head-to-head trials. Network meta-analyses allow for simultaneous comparison of all existing treatments utilizing both direct (head-to-head comparison) and indirect (not previously compared head-to-head) evidence. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer the following questions: Considering open repair, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) repair, functional rehabilitation, or primary immobilization for acute Achilles tendon ruptures, (1) which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of rerupture? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications resulting in surgery? METHODS This study was conducted with methods guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is reported in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for incorporating network meta-analysis. Five databases and grey literature sources (such as major orthopaedic meeting presentation lists) were searched from inception to September 30, 2019. Included studies were RCTs comparing treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures using two or more of the following interventions: primary immobilization, functional rehabilitation, open surgical repair, or MIS repair. We excluded studies enrolling patients with chronic ruptures, reruptures, and preexisting Achilles tendinopathy as well as studies with more than 20% loss to follow-up or less than 6 months of follow-up. Nineteen RCTs (1316 patients) were included in the final analysis. The mean number of patients per study treatment arm was 35 ± 16, mean age was 41 ± 5 years, mean sex composition was 80% ± 10% males, and mean follow-up was 22 ± 12 months. The four treatment groups were compared for the main outcomes of rerupture and complications resulting in operation. The analysis was conducted using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis with vague priors. Evidence quality was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We found risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias to be low across treatments, and we found the risk of performance and detection bias to be high. Overall risk of bias between treatments appeared similar. RESULTS We found that treatment with primary immobilization had a greater risk of rerupture than open surgery (odds ratio 4.06 [95% credible interval {CrI} 1.47 to 11.88]; p < 0.05). There were no other differences between treatments for risk of rerupture. Minimally invasive surgery was ranked first for fewest complications resulting in surgery and was associated with a lower risk of complications resulting in surgery than functional rehabilitation (OR 0.16 [95% CrI 0.02 to 0.90]; p < 0.05), open surgery (OR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.04 to 0.93]; p < 0.05), and primary immobilization (OR < 0.01 [95% CrI < 0.01 to 0.01]; p < 0.05). Risk of complications resulting in surgery was no different between primary immobilization and open surgery (OR 1.46 [95% CrI 0.35 to 5.36]). Data for patient-reported outcome scores and return to activity were inappropriate for pooling secondary to considerable clinical heterogeneity and imprecision associated with small sample sizes. CONCLUSION Faced with acute Achilles tendon rupture, patients should be counseled that, based on the best-available evidence, the risk of rerupture likely is no different across contemporary treatments. Considering the possibly lower risk of complications resulting in surgery associated with MIS repair, patients and surgeons must balance any benefit with the potential risks of MIS techniques. As treatments continue to evolve, consistent reporting of validated patient-reported outcome measures is critically important to facilitate analysis with existing RCT evidence. Infrequent but serious complications such as rerupture and deep infection should be further explored to determine whether meaningful differences exist in specific patient populations.

158956,Cancer Labs Pivot to Battle COVID-19.,2020-03-31,"Radiolabeled cholecystokinin-8 (CCK8) peptide analogues can be used for peptide receptor radionuclide imaging and therapy for tumors expressing CCK2/gastrin receptors. Earlier findings indicated that sulfated CCK8 (sCCK8, Asp-Tyr(OSO(3)H)-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH(2)) may have better characteristics for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) than gastrin analogues. However, sCCK8 contains an easily hydrolyzable sulfated tyrosine residue and two methionine residues which are prone to oxidation. Here, we describe the synthesis of stabilized sCCK8 analogues, resistant to hydrolysis and oxidation. Hydrolytic stability was achieved by replacement of the Tyr(OSO(3)H) moiety by a robust isosteric sulfonate, Phe(p-CH(2)SO(3)H). Replacement of methionine by norleucine (Nle) or homopropargylglycine (HPG) avoided undesired oxidation side-reactions. The phenylalanine analogue Phe(p-CH(2)SO(3)H) of l-tyrosine, synthesized by a modification of known synthetic routes, was incorporated in three peptides: sCCK8[Phe(2)(p-CH(2)SO(3)H),Met(3,6)], sCCK8[Phe(2)(p-CH(2)SO(3)H),Nle(3,6)], and sCCK8[Phe(2)(p-CH(2)SO(3)H),HPG(3,6)]. All peptides were N-terminally conjugated with the macrocyclic chelator DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid) and radiolabeled with In-111. In vitro binding assays on CCK2R-expressing HEK293 cells revealed that all three peptides showed specific binding and receptor-mediated internalization, with binding affinity values (IC(50)) in the nanomolar range. In vitro oxidation studies demonstrated that peptides with Nle or HPG indeed were resistant to oxidation. In vivo targeting studies in mice with AR42J tumors showed that tumor uptake was highest for (111)In-DOTA-sCCK8 and (111)In-DOTA-sCCK8[Phe(2)(p-CH(2)SO(3)H),Nle(3,6)] (4.78 +/- 0.64 and 4.54 +/- 1.15%ID/g, respectively, 2 h p.i.). The peptide with the methionine residues replaced by norleucine ((111)In-DOTA-sCCK8[Phe(2)(p-CH(2)SO(3)H), Nle(3,6)]) showed promising in vivo characteristics and will be further investigated for radionuclide imaging and therapy of CCK2R-expressing tumors.","Roosenburg, Susan; Laverman, Peter; Joosten, Lieke; Eek, Annemarie; Oyen, Wim J G; de Jong, Marion; Rutjes, Floris P J T; van Delft, Floris L; Boerman, Otto C",Bioconjugate chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bc900465y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20302291/,238
159111,COVID-19 Presenting With Confusion: An Unusual but Suggestive Electroencephalography Pattern of Encephalitis.,2020-11-02,"OBJECTIVE To report our experience with isobaric transumbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for the management of large adnexal tumors exceeding 500g of excised tissue weight including cystic contents. STUDY DESIGN In each case, a wound retractor was used to make a working port through a 2.5-cm vertical umbilical incision. The surgical view was secured by the abdominal wall-lift method with an intra-abdominal fan retractor system. After the tumor was punctured by a SAND balloon catheter and the cystic contents were aspirated, surgical procedures were performed with conventional laparoscopic instruments under vision with a rigid 30°, 5-mm EndoEYE laparoscope. Clinical data regarding patient demographics and surgical outcomes was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Between October 2010 and April 2012, 35 patients with large adnexal tumors were treated. The median age of the patients was 31.5 years. Previous abdominal surgery was noted in nine cases. The median tumor diameter was 17.7cm. Emergency surgery was performed in two cases of adnexal torsion and one case of tumor rupture. Three cases with intrauterine pregnancy were treated in the late first trimester. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 24 cases. Unilateral cystectomy was performed in five cases. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and contralateral cystectomy, and bilateral cystectomy were performed in two cases each. Unilateral salpingectomy, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and contralateral salpingectomy were performed in one case each. The median excised tissue weight was 1100g. The median surgical duration was 72min, with median blood loss of 10mL Extended hospitalization was required in two cases due to elevated inflammatory parameters, one case with pregnancy due to hyperemesis gravidarum and one case with pregnancy due to subchorionic hematoma. Readmission due to postoperative pelvic abscess was noted in one case and was conservatively managed. Major surgical complications were not experienced. The present technique yielded a minimal postoperative scar concealed within the umbilicus. CONCLUSION The transumbilical wound retraction system combined with an intra-abdominal fan retractor appears to contribute favorably to laparoendoscopic single-site surgery for the management of large adnexal tumors, because the device permits flexible and wide circumferential access by efficient wound retraction during instrumentation without the need for closed condition associated with pneumoperitoneum.","Takeda, Akihiro; Imoto, Sanae; Mori, Masahiko; Yamada, Junko; Nakamura, Hiromi","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2012.10.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23122034/,238

Conservation management programmes for the chimpanzee have been established outside their natural range (ex situ), and chimpanzees from these programmes could potentially be used to supplement future conservation initiatives in the wild (in situ). However, these programmes have often suffered from inadequate information about the geographical origin and subspecies ancestry of the founders. Here, we present a newly designed capture array with ~60,000 ancestry informative markers used to infer ancestry of individual chimpanzees in ex situ populations and determine geographical origin of confiscated sanctuary individuals. From a test panel of 167 chimpanzees with unknown origins or subspecies labels, we identify 90 suitable non-admixed individuals in the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Ex situ Programme (EEP). Equally important, another 46 individuals have been identified with admixed subspecies ancestries, which therefore over time, should be naturally phased out of the breeding populations. With potential for future re-introduction to the wild, we determine the geographical origin of 31 individuals that were confiscated from the illegal trade and demonstrate the promises of using non-invasive sampling in future conservation action plans. Collectively, our genomic approach provides an exemplar for ex situ management of endangered species and offers an efficient tool in future in situ efforts to combat the illegal wildlife trade.","Frandsen, Peter; Fontsere, Claudia; Nielsen, Svend Vendelbo; Hanghøj, Kristian; Castejon-Fernandez, Natalia; Lizano, Esther; Hughes, David; Hernandez-Rodriguez, Jessica; Korneliussen, Thorfinn Sand; Carlsen, Frands; Siegismund, Hans Redlef; Mailund, Thomas; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Hvilsom, Christina",Heredity,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-020-0313-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346130/,238

There is a strong association between coronary artery disease and NAFLD due to common risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Subclinical atherosclerosis, defined as coronary artery calcification in asymptomatic patients, has been shown to have a higher incidence in patients with NAFLD. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the association of NAFLD with subclinical atherosclerosis measured by coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. Data were extracted from 12 studies selected using a predefined search strategy. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography scans. The rate of coronary artery calcification was analyzed using random effects models, and publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression test. A total of 42,410 subjects were assessed, including 16,883 patients with NAFLD. Mean CAC score was significantly higher in subjects with NAFLD compared to those without NAFLD (odds ratio with random effects model, 1.64; 95% confidence inteval, 1.42-1.89). This association remained significant through subgroup analyses for studies with >1,000 subjects and a higher CAC score cutoff of >100. Higher aspartate aminotransferase levels were also associated with increased subclinical atherosclerosis (mean difference 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.34). Conclusion: There is an increased prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with NAFLD, where subclinical atherosclerosis is defined using a ""real world"" clinical biomarker, namely the CAC score.

In this study, unembalmed (fresh) cadavers were uniquely prepared to simulate pleural effusion to teach chest percussion and review thoracic anatomy. Thirty first-year medical students were assigned to either an intervention (Group A) or control group (Group B). Group A received hands-on training with the cadaveric simulations. They were instructed on how to palpate bony landmarks for identifying the diaphragm and lobes of the lungs, as well as on how to properly perform chest percussion to detect abnormal fluid in the pleural space. Students in Group B practiced on each other. Students in Group A benefited from the training in several ways. They had more confidence in their percussive technique (A = mean 4.3/5.0, B = 2.9/5.0), ability to count the ribs on an intact body (A = mean 4.0/5.0, B = 3.0/5.0), and ability to identify the lobes of the lungs on an intact body (A = mean 3.8/5.0, B = 2.3/5.0). They also demonstrated a greater ability to locate the diaphragm on an intact body (A = 100%, B = 60%) and detect abnormal pleural fluid (A = 93%, B = 53%) with greater confidence (A = mean 3.7/5.0, B = 2.5/5.0). Finally, the hands-on training with the unembalmed cadavers created more excitement around learning in Group A compared with Group B. This study shows that simulating pleural effusion in an unembalmed cadaver is a useful way to enhance anatomy education.

161001,"Vaccines, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies for covid-19.",2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular therapy has become the standard of care for patients with disabling anterior circulation ischemic stroke due to proximal intracranial thrombi. Our aim was to determine whether the beneficial effect of endovascular treatment on functional outcome could be explained by a reduction in posttreatment infarct volume in the Endovascular Revascularization With Solitaire Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in Anterior Circulation Stroke Within 8 Hours (REVASCAT) trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS The REVASCAT trial was a multicenter randomized open-label trial with blinded outcome evaluation. Among 206 enrolled subjects (endovascular treatment, n = 103; control, n = 103), posttreatment infarct volume was measured in 204 subjects. Posttreatment infarct volumes were compared with treatment assignment and recanalization status. Appropriate statistical models were used to assess the relationship among baseline clinical and imaging variables, posttreatment infarct volume, the 24-hour NIHSS score, and functional status with the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score. RESULTS The median posttreatment infarct volume in all subjects was 23.7 mL (interquartile range = 68.9 mL) and 16.3 mL (interquartile range = 50.2 mL) in the endovascular treatment arm and 38.6 mL (interquartile range = 74.9 mL) in the control arm (P = .02 for endovascular treatment versus control subjects). Baseline NIHSS (P < .01), site of occlusion (P < .03), baseline NCCT ASPECTS (P < .01), and recanalization status (P = .02) were independently associated with posttreatment infarct volume. Baseline NIHSS (P < .01), time from symptom onset to randomization (P = .02), treatment type (P = .04), and recanalization status (P < .01) were independently associated with the 24-hour NIHSS scores. The 24-hour NIHSS score strongly mediated the relationship between treatment type and 90-day mRS (P < .01 for indirect effect when adjusted for age), while posttreatment infarct volume did not (P = .26). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment saves brain and improves 90-day clinical outcomes primarily through a beneficial effect on the 24-hour stroke severity.","Al-Ajlan, F S; Al Sultan, A S; Minhas, P; Assis, Z; de Miquel, M A; Millán, M; San Román, L; Tomassello, A; Demchuk, A M; Jovin, T G; Cuadras, P; Dávalos, A; Goyal, M; Menon, B K",AJNR.

Among them, hydrogels are one of the candidates with most potential to mimic the native skin microenvironment, due to their porous and hydrated molecular structure. They can be applied as a permanent or temporary dressing for different wounds to support the regeneration and healing of the injured epidermis, dermis, or both. Based on the material used for their fabrication, hydrogels can be subdivided into two main groups-natural and synthetic. Moreover, hydrogels can be reinforced by incorporating nanoparticles to obtain ""in situ"" hybrid hydrogels, showing superior properties and tailored functionality. In addition, different sensors can be embedded in hydrogel wound dressings to provide real-time information about the wound environment. This review focuses on the most recent developments in the field of hydrogel-based skin substitutes for skin replacement. In particular, we discuss the synthesis, fabrication, and biomedical application of novel ""smart"" hydrogels.","Tavakoli, Shima; Klar, Agnes S",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10081169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796593/,238

The purpose of this task is to detect the spans that make a text toxic, which is a complex labour for several reasons. Firstly, because of the intrinsic subjectivity of toxicity, and secondly, due to toxicity not always coming from single words like insults or offends, but sometimes from whole expressions formed by words that may not be toxic individually. Following this idea of focusing on both single words and multi-word expressions, we study the impact of using a multi-depth DistilBERT model, which uses embeddings from different layers to estimate the final per-token toxicity. Our quantitative results show that using information from multiple depths boosts the performance of the model. Finally, we also analyze our best model qualitatively.","Palliser-Sans, Rafel; Rial-Farras, Albert",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00639v3.pdf,238
164502,Stroke as Presenting Feature of COVID-19 in a Pediatric Patient,2021,"In order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries enforced extended social distancing measures for several weeks, effectively pausing the majority of economic activities. In an effort to resume economic activity safely, several Digital Contact Tracing applications and protocols have been introduced with success. However, DCT is a reactive method, as it aims to break existing chains of disease transmission in a population. Therefore DCT is not suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a Health Passport as a means of verifying that individuals are disease risk-free and how it could be used to resume the international tourism sector. Following, we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of Authority for issuing Digital Health Passports. The framework provides a distributed infrastructure supporting the issuance of DHPs by foreign health systems and their verification by relevant stakeholders, such as airline companies and border control authorities. We discuss the attributes of the system in terms of its usability and performance, security and privacy. Finally, we conclude by identifying future extensions of our work on formal security and privacy properties that need to be rigorously guaranteed via appropriate security protocols.","Angelopoulos, Constantinos Marios; Damianou, Amalia; Katos, Vasilios",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08922v2.pdf,238

For the prediction of the number of confirmed cases and deaths, a dynamic time-lagged kinetic model (DSEIR) is developed and an Immune Differential Evolution Algorithm is used to estimate the unstatistical parameters of the model, and finally the model parameters are adjusted to analyze the effects of health measures. We first improve the traditional SEIR model to find the predicted number of cases based on the time-lag characteristics of the epidemic, and estimate the uncounted model parameters by fitting the predicted results to the actual statistics using an Immune Differential Evolution Algorithm. The model parameters were adjusted according to the behavior of implementing the home order in the United States and the strict quarantine measures adopted in Hubei Province, China in advance and delay to analyze the change pattern of the prediction results. It can be concluded that: early adoption of strict quarantine will significantly reduce the epidemic losses in Hubei Province, and vice versa will significantly increase the losses;if the home order is implemented immediately will significantly reduce the epidemic losses in the United States. The advantages of this paper are: the traditional SEIR model is improved by combining the actual characteristics of COVID-19, and the parameters are estimated using the Immune Differential Evolution Algorithm, which makes the prediction model closer to the actual situation of this epidemic. © 2021 IEEE.","Li, Z.; Feng, F.","3rd IEEE International Conference on Communications, Information System and Computer Engineering, CISCE 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/cisce52179.2021.9445997,238
165109,Stroke Therapy in the Time of Covid-19,2021,"Objectives: In France, chest physiotherapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is partly performed by liberal physiotherapists at home or at the professional's office. The first lockdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, impaired the possibility to practice liberal physiotherapy. We aimed to describe, in our paediatric CF centre, the changes in physiotherapy and sport practice induced by this lockdown, and to correlate it with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function evolution. Methods: During the lockdown, 68 CF patients >6 years old and their parents answered a questionnaire on time spent in physiotherapy, with or without a liberal professional, and sport practice before and during lockdown. Respiratory symptoms and FEV1 were collected at the venues before and after the lockdown. Results: This study showed a clear reduction of time spent with a liberal physiotherapist from 73 min/week before lockdown to 30 min/week during lockdown. Time of physiotherapy practised alone or with parents increased from 2 min/week to 26 min/week. Thus, the overall physiotherapy time per week was only slightly reduced from 90 min/week before lockdown to 80 min/week during lockdown. Time spent in sport practice was not significantly decreased on average (233 min/week before lockdown vs 225 min/week during lockdown). The standard deviation of sport practice evolution was large (–8 min ± 225 min), reflecting a wide variation of sport practice changes from one patient to another. No deterioration in respiratory symptoms nor FEV1 was observed. Conclusions: During the lockdown in France, we noted that our patients drastically decreased their time spent with a liberal physiotherapist, without enough counterbalance with auto-drainage or sport pratice increase. Nevertheless, their respiratory status was not impaired, suggesting some other confounding factors, such as prevention from viral infection, time to rest or improvement of other treatment observance.","Mittaine, M.; Aversenq, E.; Milhorat, P.; Lannibois, C.; Maumus, P.; Arrouy, A.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1569-1993(21)00999-1,238

Mixed reviews have presupposed rationales ranging from bold aesthetic choice to deadline-induced haste. This article considers Dawn within Adès's continuing exploration of the different formal, aesthetic and semantic roles that musical simplicity can play. Here, his previous utilisation of simplicity at points of formal crux allows a reframing of the work as a compositional response to real-world crisis that, beneath its surface, presents an intriguing affinity with – and recontextualisation of – fundamental aspects of his compositional character.","Powell, Richard",Tempo,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0040298221000395,238

Given the limited preparation of EI providers in the telehealth service delivery model, it is unclear how providers implemented adaptations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factor structure of the Service Delivery Adaptations Questionnaire and examine the influence of provider type, years of EI experience, and willingness to return to in-person services on the questionnaire's subscales. Method: We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the structure of the Service Delivery Adaptations Questionnaire among n = 704 EI providers. We used multivariate linear regression (subsample of n = 595 EI providers) to understand the influence of person factors on the subscales of the measure. Results: EFA results showed a four-factor solution that accounted for 57.33% of the variance. Willingness to return to in-person services had a significant influence on scores;provider type showed significant differences on the intervention adaptations subscale, and the effects were moderated by years of experience in EI. Conclusion: The ways that occupational therapists rated practice changes, particularly intervention adaptations as a result of using telehealth during COVID-19, was highly influenced by their willingness to return to in-person services and years in practice.","Little, Lauren Stoffel Ashley",Open Journal of Occupational Therapy (OJOT),https://doi.org/10.15453/2168-6408.1845,238

Using a bank-level COVID-19 exposure measure, we show that higher exposure to COVID-19 led to a relative increase in worse-capitalized banks’ loans whereas their better-capitalized peers decreased their lending more. At the same time, only better-capitalized banks experienced a significantly larger increase in their delinquent and restructured loans. These findings are in line with the zombie lending literature that banks with low capital have an incentive to issue more loans during contraction times to help their weaker borrowers so that they can avoid loan loss recognition and write-offs on their capital.","Özlem Dursun-de Neef, H.; Schandlbauer, Alexander",Journal of Banking &amp; Finance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2021.106236,238

EndoU targeted viral RNA, cleaving the 3′ side of pyrimidines with a strong preference for U⬇A and C⬇A sequences (endoY⬇A). EndoU-dependent cleavage was detected in every region of MHV RNA, from the 5′ NTR to the 3′ NTR, including transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). Cleavage at two CA dinucleotides immediately adjacent to the MHV poly(A) tail suggest a mechanism to suppress negative-strand RNA synthesis and the accumulation of viral dsRNA. MHV with EndoU (EndoUmut) or 2′-5′ phosphodiesterase (PDEmut) mutations provoked the activation of RNase L in BMM, with corresponding cleavage of RNAs by RNase L. The physiologic targets of EndoU are viral RNA templates required for negative-strand RNA synthesis and dsRNA accumulation.

Nonetheless, prone position may hinder proper acquisition and interpretation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as there is a sparsity of data regarding standardization of lead position and interpretation. Objective: We aimed to analyze and compare ECGs in the supine and prone positions to provide guidance for adequate interpretation and clinical utility of the ECG in prone position. Methods: This was a multicenter prospective cohort study in which ECGs in the prone and supine position were compared, including patients with COVID-19 infection and healthy controls. The precordial leads for the prone ECGs were placed in the following fashion: V1 in the right paraspinal region at the level of the T7 vertebra, V2 in the left paraspinal region at the level of the T7 vertebra, V4 in the mid-scapular region at the level of the T8 vertebra (approximately bellow the tip of the scapula), V3 halfway between V3 and V4, V5 at the posterior axillary line at the level of the T8 vertebra, and V6 at the mid-axillary line at the level of T8 vertebra - same position as the V6 in the supine position. Results: A total of 45 patients with COVID-19 infection were compared with 40 healthy volunteers (48% of the patients were female, the mean age in the entire cohort was 48.8 years, and the mean BMI was 27.9). The mean heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT and QTc interval, and QRS axis in the frontal plane were found to positively correlate in supine and prone ECGs. The main difference found was no correlation of the QRS amplitude between supine and prone ECGs in leads V1, V2, V3, and V4;but there was positive correlation in leads V5 and V6. Prominent Q waves were present in the anteroseptal leads (V1-V3) in the prone posterior position. In addition, T-wave inversions or flattening were observed in leads V1 and V2 were present in a majority of patients in the prone posterior position. Conclusion: ECGs performed in the prone position are an acceptable alternative to supine ECGs. Special attention and review of prior supine ECGs may be necessary for precise interpretation of the anteroseptal precordial leads which may be misleading (i.e, septal infarct).","Romero, J.; Lakkireddy, D.

This brought to mind the phenotype of mice with VHL-deficient B cells, in which Hypoxia-Inducible Factors are constitutively active, suggesting hypoxia might drive B cell abnormalities in COVID-19. We demonstrated the breadth of early and persistent defects in B cell subsets in moderate/severe COVID-19, including reduced marginal zone-like, memory and transitional B cells, changes we also observed in B cell VHL-deficient mice. This was corroborated by hypoxia-related transcriptional changes in COVID-19 patients, and by similar B cell abnormalities in mice kept in hypoxic conditions, including reduced marginal zone and germinal center B cells. Thus hypoxia might contribute to B cell pathology in COVID-19, and in other hypoxic states.

To identify and characterize molecular viral determinants influencing the host spectrum of IDV, a reverse genetic system is required. For this, we first performed 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) of all seven genomic segments, followed by assessment of the 5′ and 3′ NCR activity prior to constructing the viral genomic segments of a contemporary Swiss bovine IDV isolate (D/CN286) into the bidirectional pHW-2000 vector. The bidirectional plasmids were transfected in HRT-18G cells followed by viral rescue on the same cell type. Analysis of the segment specific 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions (NCR) highlighted that the terminal 3′ end of all segments harbours an Uracil instead of a Cytosine nucleotide, similar to other Influenza viruses. Subsequent analysis on the functionality of the 5′ and 3′ NCR in a minireplicon assay revealed that these sequences were functional and that the variable sequence length of the 5′ and 3′ NCR influences reporter gene expression. Thereafter, we evaluated the replication efficiency of the reverse genetic clone on conventional cell lines of human, swine and bovine origin by use of an in vitro model recapitulating the natural replicate site of IDV in bovine and swine. This revealed that the reverse genetic clone D/CN286 replicates efficiently in all cell culture models.

The authors relying on the basics of postmodern theory within interdisciplinary discourse trace the means of forming misinformation and its influence on changing worldview landmarks of humanity. The authors underline that information in the postmodern conception of Jean Baudrillard is also capable to destroy its own content, communication and social ground. Misinformation about Covid-19 is «a stage setting of communication» since it only creates insight into sense and is outspreaded with different channels (traditional and new media) with usage of photographic and video materials, emotional headlines and messages. Fake materials which have been outspreaded in online media and social networks are analyzed in the article. The authors found out that fake messages outspreaded in Ukrainian media refer to the following topic (the origin of Covid-19;frauds under the guise of doctors try to get the money of nationals;fictional money penalties for breaking the rules of quarantine;pseudomedical recommendations for taking some medicines and means of diagnosis Covid-19;statements of public authorities about strengthening the regime of quarantine;the speed of spreading Covid-19 in other countries;insufficient readiness of the Ukrainian society to Covid-19, etc.).

Techniques from the fields of temporal processing and pattern mining are employed to investigate this topic. First, a corpus annotated with temporal information is created by the author. Then, sequences of temporal information tags mixed with part-of-speech tags are extracted from the corpus. The TKS algorithm is used to mine skip-gram patterns from the sequences. With these patterns, the signatures of the four newspapers are obtained. In order to make the signatures uniquely characterize the newspapers, we revise the signatures by removing reference patterns. Through examining the number of patterns in the signatures and revised signatures, the proportion of patterns containing temporal information tags and the specific patterns containing temporal information tags, it is found that newspapers differ in ways of expressing temporal information.","Fu, Yingxue; Dhonnchadha, Elaine Ui",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12265v1.pdf,238

The state demonstrates its care and capability by implementing highly visible high-tech measures to contain the virus. Bringing care into the literature on crisis management in China sheds light on the Chinese state?s reaction to COVID-19 in eliciting nationalist sentiments and positive feelings of cooperation while stigmatizing critical voices as uncooperative and unpatriotic. It shows that care is central not only to the functioning of liberal democracies: the Chinese state also relies on narratives about care to showcase the superiority of its political system and to distinguish between desirable and unwanted forms of citizens? political engagement after the COVID-19 outbreak.","Sier, Willy",China Information,https://doi.org/10.1177/0920203x211032370,238

In this paper, we propose a new task: predicting the predominant sentiment among (first-order) replies to a given tweet. Therefore, we created RETWEET, a large dataset of tweets and replies manually annotated with sentiment labels. As a strong baseline, we propose a two-stage DL-based method: first, we create automatically labeled training data by applying a standard sentiment classifier to tweet replies and aggregating its predictions for each original tweet; our rationale is that individual errors made by the classifier are likely to cancel out in the aggregation step. Second, we use the automatically labeled data for supervised training of a neural network to predict reply sentiment from the original tweets. The resulting classifier is evaluated on the new RETWEET dataset, showing promising results, especially considering that it has been trained without any manually labeled data. Both the dataset and the baseline implementation are publicly available.","Arasteh, Soroosh Tayebi; Monajem, Mehrpad; Christlein, Vincent; Heinrich, Philipp; Nicolaou, Anguelos; Boldaji, Hamidreza Naderi; Lotfinia, Mahshad; Evert, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10513v1.pdf,238

To quantify this phenomenon requires the analysis of the effect of the variance and higher moments of the infection distribution. Working in the framework of stochastic branching processes, we derive an approximate analytical formula for the probability of an outbreak in the high variance regime of the infection distribution, verify it numerically and analyze its regime of validity in various examples. We show that it is possible for an outbreak not to occur in the high variance regime even when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is larger than one and discuss the implications of our results for COVID-19 and other pandemics.","Oz, Yaron; Rubinstein, Ittai; Safra, Muli",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07352v2.pdf,238
176203,Alcohol: A Double-Edged Sword in the Fight Against COVID-19,2021,"When comparing the risk of a post-infection binary outcome, e.g. hospitalisation, for two variants of an infectious pathogen, it is important to adjust for calendar time of infection to avoid the confounding that would occur if the relative incidence of the two variants and the variant-specific risks of the outcome both change over time. Infection time is typically unknown and time of positive test used instead. Likewise, time of positive test may be used instead of infection time when assessing how the risk of the binary outcome changes over calendar time. Here we show that if mean time from infection to positive test is correlated with the outcome, the risk conditional on positive test time depends on whether incidence of infection is increasing or decreasing over calendar time. This complicates interpretation of risk ratios adjusted for positive test time. We also propose a simple sensitivity analysis that indicates how these risk ratios may differ from the risk ratios adjusted for infection time.","Seaman, S. R.; Nyberg, T.; Overton, C.

The study is based on 21 in-depth interviews with women working in the Croatian PR industry. Thematic analysis has been used to analyse data.FindingsAlthough female employees (76.84%) dominate the PR industry in Croatia, the so-called masculine patterns still prevail in the PR sector. Results show that women are often exposed to gender discrimination but at the same time, they also perpetuate gender-based prejudices.Practical implicationsEmployees in the PR industry should consider working on their own gender stereotypes that impact their patterns of behaviour. Relinquishment of the ideas of patriarchal essentialism would consequently change career progression opportunities, and it would particularly improve networking among women, which could lead to career advancement opportunities.Social implicationsStructural changes are needed in society to avoid women perpetuating inequality through masculine behaviour and unrealistic expectations that many women cannot meet.OriginalityTo the best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first paper that explores gender-biased office culture in the Croatian PR industry. In doing so, the paper also applies Bourdieu's habitus theory, thus contributing to studying cultural masculinities from a Croatian perspective. The paper also introduces the concept of gender-biased behaviour.","Polić, Mirela Holy Mirela",Corporate Communications,https://doi.org/10.1108/ccij-04-2021-0042,238
177129,COVID-19: Consequences for Children With Cancer in Turkey and Globally,2021,"Today’s world is seriously affected and medical infrastructure is challenged due to the novel COVID-19 epidemics. On 15th May 2020, Naturemedicine published a detailed survey report which concluded that drugs like aminoquinolines, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine targeted the virus replication cycle by keeping the virus out of host cells and helping people to overcome the disease. But, the exponential incidence rate cannot be stopped and some limitations also detected to treat the patients using these drugs. In these circumstances, suitable medicines are immediately needed that can also help in vaccine production. In this chapter, a novel AI based architecture has been proposed to obtain influencial drugs for the COVID-19 treatment. Here, The COVID-19 (MT050943 and MT012098) data are taken from the NCBI database, submitted by the Government of India to build tests and find drugs. A detailed analysis of these sequences has been performed to find the noncoding percentage, gene density, and abundances in functional gene categories using Virus Amplicon Sequencing Assembly Pipeline (V-ASAP). This analysis finds the unique regions in the virus genome as a target region. This knowledge is feed into the AI model. Firstly, the informative genes are selected from the target region. Then the Advanced Matched Molecular Pair (AMMP) analysis is performed to study the possible local region of a drug and its impact. At last, a Generative Adversarial Convolution Neural Network (GACNN) is trained with the information gain and performs a gradient-based optimization to predict the drug to target for the validate genome. The result of the proposed methodology obtains higher accuracy than the other existing methods and identified effective drugs (like, Dexamethasone, Remdesivir etc.) for the study of the COVID-19 vaccine. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Banerjee, A.; Pati, S.

177737,Geography Not a Factor in 2020 Stroke Consults;A Telestroke Experience During the Covid19 Pandemic,2021,"Tilapia tilapinevirus (also known as tilapia lake virus, TiLV) is an important virus responsible for die-off of farmed tilapia globally. Detection and quantification of the virus from environmental DNA/RNA (eDNA/eRNA) using pond water represents a potential, noninvasive routine approach for pathogen monitoring and early disease forecasting in aquaculture systems. Here, we report a simple iron flocculation method for viral concentration from water combined with a newly developed hydrolysis probe quantitative RT-qPCR method for detection and quantification of TiLV. The RT-qPCR method targeting a conserved region of TiLV genome segment 9 has a detection limit of 10 viral copies per µL of template. The method had a 100% analytical specificity and sensitivity for TiLV. The optimized iron flocculation method was able to recover 16.11 ± 3.3% of virus from water samples spiked with viral cultures. During disease outbreak cases from an open-caged system and a closed hatchery system, both tilapia and water samples were collected for detection and quantification of TiLV. The results revealed that TiLV was detected from both clinically sick fish and asymptomatic fish. Most importantly, the virus was successfully detected from water samples collected from different locations in the affected farms e.g. river water samples from affected cages (8.50 × 102 to 2.79 × 104 copies/L) and fish-rearing water samples, sewage, and reservoir (4.29 × 102 to 3.53 × 103 copies/L) from affected and unaffected ponds of the hatchery. In summary, this study suggests that the eRNA detection system using iron flocculation coupled with probe based-RT-qPCR is feasible for concentration and quantification of TiLV from water. This approach might be useful for noninvasive monitoring of TiLV in tilapia aquaculture systems and facilitating appropriate decisions on biosecurity interventions needed.","Taengphu, Suwimon; Kayansamruaj, Pattanapon; Kawato, Yasuhiko; Delamare-Deboutteville, Jerome; Mohan, Chadag Vishnumurthy; Dong, Ha Thanh; Senapin, Saengchan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.455809,238

177968,"Evaluating Specimen Quality and Results from a Community-Wide, Home-Based Respiratory Surveillance Study",2020-12-08,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being used in healthcare, thanks to the high level of performance that these systems have proven to deliver. So far, clinical applications have focused on diagnosis and on prediction of outcomes. It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decision-making around cardio-pulmonary resuscitation leading to the determination of a patient's Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate (DNAR) status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that 1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and 2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support. We suggest a model for how AI can contribute to improve decision-making around resuscitation and propose a set of ethically relevant preconditions - conceptual, methodological and procedural - that need to be considered in further development and implementation efforts.","Biller-Andorno, N.; Ferrario, A.; Joebges, S.; Krones, T.; Massini, F.; Barth, P.; Arampatzis, G.; Krauthammer, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.17.20171769v1?rss=1,238

179413,Oral Vitamin D supplementation induces transcriptomic changes in rectal mucosa that are consistent with anti-tumour effects.,2021-05-10,"Background: Novel variants of concern (VOCs) have been associated with both increased infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. The virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to age. Whether relative increases in virulence of novel VOCs is similar across the age spectrum, or is limited to some age groups, is unknown. Methods: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario, Canada testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between February 7 and August 30, 2021 (n=233,799). Cases were classified as N501Y-positive VOC, probable Delta VOC, or VOC undetected. We constructed age-specific logistic regression models to evaluate the effects of N501Y-postive or Delta VOC infections on infection severity, using hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for sex, time, health unit, vaccination status, comorbidities, immune compromise, long-term care residence, healthcare worker status, and pregnancy. Results: Infection with either N501Y-positive or Delta VOCs was associated with significant elevations in risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death in younger and older adults, compared to infections where a VOC was not detected. Delta VOC increased hospitalization risk in children under 10 by a factor of 2.5 (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 5.1) compared to non-VOC. For most VOC-outcome combinations there was no heterogeneity in adverse outcomes by age. However, there was an inverse relationship between age and relative increase in risk of death with delta VOC, with younger age groups showing a greater relative increase in risk of death than older individuals. Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 VOCs appear to be associated with increased relative virulence of infection in all age groups, though low absolute numbers of outcomes in younger individuals make estimates in these groups imprecise.","Fisman, D.; Tuite, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.25.21264097v1?rss=1,238
180657,Assessment of differences in demographic characteristics and clinical diagnoses among black and white oncology patients with COVID,2021,"Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) raised concern for the outcomes in people with different rheumatic diseases and management of these patients. There was an anxiety that biologic therapies, especially anti-B-cell depletion strategies, could lead to more severe disease course and lack of protective antibodies formation. Information about the course of COVID-19 in patients with certain rheumatic diseases is still lacking. Objectives: To examine clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with Sjogren's syndrome treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab). Methods: Single center observational study. Diagnosis of SjS was based on ECR/EULAR 2016 criteria. COVID-19 diagnosis was based on positive PCR test even without clinical symptoms and/or typical clinical features (CT signs, fever and anosmia). Rituximab was administrated in two 1000 mg infusions 14 days apart for the 1st course, then 500 mg every 6 months. Results: 19 patients were included, 18 women and 1 man. Median age was 55 years (29-70 years), and median rituximab treatment duration was 24 months (1-48 months). Five patients had concomitant RA (2 patients), SLAE (1 pt), Systemic sclerosis (2 patients). Patients with RA took baricitinib and methotrexate as well. 3 patients had MALT-lymphoma anamnesis (24, 38 and 24 months before the diagnosis of COVID-19). Only 3 patients had chronic ischemic heart disease and/or arterial hypertension. 12 patients were PCR positive, 6 negative and in 1 the test was not done. 11 patients had full and 4 partial B-cell depletion in peripheral blood. Five patients had <20% lung involvement on CT, 2 patients -20-40% and 4 patients -40-60%. Three patients with 40-60% lung involvement required hospitalization due to marked shortness of breath and long febrile period, 2 of them received anti-IL6 treatment and neither of them required mechanical lung ventilation (either non-invasive or invasive). Seventeen patients were treated at home and recovered in 10-24 days. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were measured in 9 patients, 6 (66.7%) of them were positive. Conclusion: It seems that neither SjS itself nor anti-CD20 therapy predisposes patients to severe course of COVID-19. Presumably risk factors such as age, diabetes or anamnesis of cardiovascular diseases have far more significant impact on COVID-19 severity. Data hints that anti-CD20 therapy might negatively affect the formation of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity, but further investigation is required to determine that with any degree of certainty.","Sokol, E.; Torgashina, A.; Chalcev, B.; Khvan, J.; Golovina, O.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2933,238

A number of patients who are COVID positive have reported oral lesions. However, there is still a lingering question, whether these lesions are because of coronavirus infection or they are secondary to the patient's systemic condition. This article aims to report the oral findings of an observational study of 713 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A singlssswe-institution, short-term observational study was conducted on patients admitted to Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Centre, Lavale, Pune who were positive to coronavirus, who presented varied oral findings such as herpes simplex, candidiasis, geographic tongue, and aphthous ulcer. Results: A total of 713 patients, 416 males and 297 females, who were positive to coronavirus, were screened from April 2020 to June 30, 2020, for oral ulcers. In this group, nine patients reported oral discomfort due to varied forms of oral lesions ranging from herpes simplex ulcers to angular cheilitis (1.26%). Conclusion: This study supports the hypothesis that oral manifestations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 could be secondary lesions resulting from local irritants or from the deterioration of systemic health or could be just coexisting conditions. No specific pattern or characteristic oral lesions were noted in a study of 713 COVID-positive patients in our study to qualify these lesions as oral manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

190153,Non-Specific Laboratory Tests in Patients with COVID-19.,2020-07-01,"Disaster preparedness typically includes plans that address the need for surge capacity to manage mass-casualty events. A major concern of disaster preparedness in respiratory therapy focuses on responding to a sudden increase in the volume of patients who require mechanical ventilation. Plans for such disasters must include contingencies to address surge capacity in ventilator inventories and the respiratory therapy staff who will manage the ventilators. Tactics to address these situations include efforts to lower demand by transferring patients to other institutions as well as efforts to augment staffing levels. Staff can be augmented by mobilization of deployable teams of volunteers from outside the region and through exploitation of local resources. The latter includes strategies to recruit local respiratory therapists who are currently in either non-clinical or non-hospital-based positions and policies that optimize existing respiratory therapy resources within an institution by canceling elective surgeries, altering shift structure, and postponing vacations. An alternative approach would employ non-respiratory-therapy staff to assist in the management of patients with respiratory failure. Project XTREME (Cross-Training Respiratory Extenders for Medical Emergencies) is a cross-training program developed to facilitate training of non-respiratory-therapy health professionals to assist in the management of patients who require mechanical ventilation. It includes an interactive digital video disc as well as a competency validation laboratory and is designed to be performed at the time of an emergency. Pilot testing of the program suggests it is effective.","Hanley, Michael E; Bogdan, Gregory M",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18218149/,238
190756,The differential response to anti IL-6 treatment in COVID-19: the genetic counterpart.,2020-05-10,"BACKGROUND A simple and self-administered 'scratch & sniff' test kit like the TIBSIT smell kit based on the Taiwan Smell Identification Test (TWSIT), provides a safe and quick assessment of olfaction. The original TIBSIT has been validated for use in Taiwan with age specific scores for different age groups and diagnosis. The main aim of this study is to examine if TIBSIT can be applicable for the Malaysian population and perform cultural adaptation as necessary to allow a more accurate assessment using this tool. METHOD AND MATERIAL A preliminary study of the original TIBSIT (Phase 1) followed by cultural adaption (Phase 2) were carried out on volunteers from various neighbourhoods in Klang Valley, Malaysia comprising of age group 16-80 years. A total of 150 test subjects and 50 test subjects were recruited for Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively. Cultural adaptation was done with changes to the distractors that were found to be confusing. In addition, modifications included added language translation and visual reinforcement with images of the odour's substance of origin. RESULTS 109 out of the 150 responses were accepted for Phase 1. A detection rate of less than 75% was found in three of the odours with the remaining showing an average rate of 87.2% to 97.7%. These three odours were culturally adapted for Phase 2. All 50 responses for Phase 2 were accepted; two of the odours' detection rates improved to 98% but the plum odour was only detected 53% of the time. CONCLUSION TIBSIT provides a quick office-based olfaction testing. The culturally adapted test kit is a potentially useful screening test for the Malaysian population. It is also safe and excludes the need of the clinician to carry out the test. This becomes especially useful in testing any dysosmia (hyposmia/anosmia) cases suspected of SARS-COV-2 virus infection (COVID-19).","Kevin, S D; Govindaraju, R; Danaee, M; Shahrizal, T A; Prepageran, N",The Medical journal of Malaysia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34558549/,238

191657,Measures to Predict The Individual Variability of Corticospinal Responses Following Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation.,2016,"In the hunt for the aetiology of the SARS outbreak in 2003, a newly developed virus DNA micro-array was successfully used to hybridise PCR products obtained by random amplification of nucleic acids extracted from a cell culture infected with material from a SARS patient. The SARS agent was found to hybridise with micro-array probes from both coronaviruses and astroviruses, but one of the coronavirus probes and the four astrovirus probes contained redundant sequences, spanning a highly conserved motif, named s2m, found at the 3' end of the genomes of almost all astroviruses, one picornavirus, and the poultry coronaviruses. The three other coronavirus probes, that hybridised with the SARS agent, were located in the replicase gene, and it could be concluded that the SARS agent was a novel coronavirus, harbouring s2m. The presence of this motif in different virus families is probably the result of recombinations between unrelated viruses, but its presence in both poultry and SARS coronaviruses could suggest a bird involvement in the history of the SARS coronavirus. A recent screening of wild birds for the presence of coronaviruses, using a pan-coronavirus RT-PCR, led to the identification of novel coronaviruses in the three species studied. Phylogenetic analyses performed on both replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein could not add support to a close relationship between avian and SARS coronaviruses, but all the novel avian coronaviruses were found to harbour s2m. The motif is inserted at a homologous place in avian and SARS coronavirus genomes, but in a somewhat different context for the SARS coronavirus. If the presence of s2m in these viruses is a result of two separate recombination events, this suggests that its particular position in these genomes is the only one that would not be deleterious for coronaviral replication, or that it is the result of a copy-choice recombination between coronaviruses, following an ancestral introduction in the coronavirus family by an unrelated virus. In conclusion, the relative high frequencies of recombination observed both experimentally and in the natural evolution of RNA viruses, indicate that horizontal gene transfer does occur, even between unrelated viruses. This might represent a challenge in the rapid identification of novel pathogens with DNA micro-array techniques.","Monceyron Jonassen, C",Developments in biologicals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17058491/,238

We have performed a site-directed mutational analysis of the role of these residues in the functional activity of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) HN protein. Substitutions for several of these residues result in a protein lacking both detectable NA and receptor recognition activity. Contribution of NA activity, either exogenously or by coexpression with another HN protein, partially rescues the receptor recognition activity of these proteins, indicating that the receptor recognition deficiencies of the mutated HN proteins result from their lack of detectable NA activity. In addition to providing support for the homology-based predictions for the structure of HN, these findings argue that (i) the HN residues that mediate its NA activity are not critical to its attachment function and (ii) NA activity is required for the protein to mediate binding to receptors.","Iorio, R M; Field, G M; Sauvron, J M; Mirza, A M; Deng, R; Mahon, P J; Langedijk, J P",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11160691/,238
192016,Predicting the Severity of Disease Progression in COVID-19 at the Individual and Population Level: A Mathematical Model.,2021,"RNA replication enhancers are cis-acting elements that can stimulate replication or transcription of RNA viruses. Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) and satC, a parasitic RNA associated with TCV infections, contain stem-loop structures that are RNA replication enhancers (P. Nagy, J. Pogany, and A. E. Simon, EMBO J. 1999, 18, 5653-5665). We have found that replacement of 28 nt of the satC enhancer, termed the motif1-hairpin, with 28 randomized bases reduced satC accumulation 8- to 13-fold in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. Deletion of single-stranded flanking sequences at either side of the hairpin also affected RNA accumulation with combined alterations at both sides of the hairpin showing the most detrimental effect in protoplasts. In vitro analysis with a partially purified TCV RdRp preparation demonstrated that the motif1-hairpin in its minus-sense orientation was able to stimulate RNA synthesis from the satC hairpin promoter (located at the 3' end of plus strands) by almost twofold. This level of RNA synthesis stimulation is approximately fivefold lower than that observed with a linear promoter, suggesting that a highly stable hairpin promoter is less responsive to the presence of the motif1-hairpin enhancer than a linear promoter. The motif1-hairpin in its plus-sense orientation was only 60% as active in enhancing transcription from the hairpin promoter. Since the motif1-hairpin is a hotspot for RNA recombination during plus-strand synthesis and since satC promoters located on the minus-strand are all short linear sequences, these findings support the hypothesis that the motif1-hairpin is primarily involved in enhancing plus-strand synthesis.","Nagy, P D; Pogany, J; Simon, A E",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11601903/,238

The risk for Japanese encephalitis (JE) for most travelers is low, but varies by travel destination, duration, season, and activities. As part of routine surveillance and diagnostic testing, state health officials or clinicians send specimens from patients with unexplained encephalitis to CDC. To characterize the epidemiologic and clinical features of JE cases, CDC reviewed all laboratory-confirmed cases that occurred during 1992 (when a JE vaccine was first licensed in the United States) to 2008. Four cases were identified, including one previously reported. This report describes the three previously unpublished cases. All were Asian immigrants or family members who traveled to Asia to live or to visit friends or relatives and had not been vaccinated for JE. The three patients experienced fever with mental status changes, but JE was recognized early in the clinical course of only one patient. All recovered, but two patients had residual neurologic deficits. Travelers to Asia might be at increased risk for JE because of rural itineraries and lack of perceived risk. To protect against JE, travelers should seek medical advice on protective measures, including possible JE vaccination, well in advance of departure for Asia. While in Asia, travelers should use personal protective measures to reduce the risk for mosquito bites. Health-care providers should assess the risk for JE in travelers to Asia and provide appropriate preventive or supportive treatment measures.",,MMWR.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training on inspiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, and functional capacity in patients with chronic kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis. METHOD Non-controlled clinical trial, comprising 15 individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney failure and undergoing hemodialysis. Maximum inspiratory (PImax) and expiratory (PEmax) pressures were assessed by use of pressure vacuum meter reading. Pulmonary function was assessed by use of spirometry. Functional capacity was assessed by use of walked distance and oxygen consumption obtained in the six-minute walk test (6MWT). For eight weeks, the inspiratory muscle training (IMT) protocol was applied during hemodialysis sessions, with load set to 40% of PImax and weekly frequency of three alternate days. RESULTS A significant increase in the walked distance was observed after training (455.5 ± 98 versus 557.8 ± 121.0; p = 0.003). No statistically significant difference was observed in the other variables when comparing their pre- and posttraining values. CONCLUSION The study showed no statistically significant difference in respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, and oxygen consumption. An increase in the walked distance was observed in the 6MWT.","Silva, Vanessa Giendruczak da; Amaral, Carolina; Monteiro, Mariane Borba; Nascimento, Daniela Meirelles do; Boschetti, Jaqueline Regina",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia : 'orgao oficial de Sociedades Brasileira e Latino-Americana de Nefrologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541465/,238

Antiviral drugs and vaccination may not be adequate to prevent catastrophe in such an event. OBJECTIVES To systematically review the evidence of effectiveness of interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses (excluding vaccines and antiviral drugs, which have been previously reviewed). SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1966 to November 2006); OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); EMBASE (1990 to November 2006); and CINAHL (1982 to November 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA We scanned 2300 titles, excluded 2162 and retrieved the full papers of 138 trials, including 49 papers of 51 studies. The quality of three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was poor; as were most cluster RCTs. The observational studies were of mixed quality. We were only able to meta-analyse case-control data. We searched for any interventions to prevent viral transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection and hygiene). Study design included RCTs, cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-over studies, before-after, and time series studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We scanned the titles, abstracts and full text articles using a standardised form to assess eligibility. RCTs were assessed according to randomisation method, allocation generation, concealment, blinding, and follow up. Non-RCTs were assessed for the presence of potential confounders and classified as low, medium, and high risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS The highest quality cluster RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures around younger children. Additional benefit from reduced transmission from children to other household members is broadly supported in results of other study designs, where the potential for confounding is greater. The six case-control studies suggested that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. We found limited evidence that the more uncomfortable and expensive N95 masks were superior to simple surgical masks. The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease remains uncertain. The lack of proper evaluation of global measures such as screening at entry ports and social distancing prevent firm conclusions about these measures. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Many simple and probably low-cost interventions would be useful for reducing the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. Routine long-term implementation of some of the measures assessed might be difficult without the threat of a looming epidemic.","Jefferson, T; Foxlee, R; Del Mar, C; Dooley, L; Ferroni, E; Hewak, B; Prabhala, A; Nair, S; Rivetti, A",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17943895/,238

199593,Novel Pulmonary Delivery of Antiviral Drugs for Treating COVID-19 in Patients with Parkinson's Disease,2021,"The presence of NAD-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART)2) on the surface of immune cells suggests a potential immunomodulatory activity for ecto-NAD or its metabolites at sites of inflammation and cell lysis where extracellular levels of NAD may be high. In vitro, NAD inhibits mitogen-stimulated rat T cell proliferation. To investigate the mechanism of inhibition, the effects of NAD and its metabolites on T cell proliferation were studied using ART2a+ and ART2b+ rat T cells. NAD and ADP-ribose, but not nicotinamide, inhibited proliferation of mitogen-activated T cells independent of ART2 allele-specific expression. Inhibition by P2 purinergic receptor agonists was comparable to that induced by NAD and ADP-ribose; these compounds were more potent than P1 agonists. Analysis of the NAD-metabolizing activity of intact rat T cells demonstrated that ADP-ribose was the predominant metabolite, consistent with the presence of cell surface NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) activities. Treatment of T cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C removed much of the NADase activity, consistent with at least one NADase having a GPI anchor; ART2- T cell subsets contained NADase activity that was not releasable by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment. Formation of AMP from NAD and ADP-ribose also occurred, a result of cell surface pyrophosphatase activity. Because AMP and its metabolite, adenosine, were less inhibitory to rat T cell proliferation than was NAD or ADP-ribose, pyrophosphatases may serve a regulatory role in modifying the inhibitory effect of ecto-NAD on T cell activation. These data suggest that T cells express multiple NAD and adenine nucleotide-metabolizing activities that together modulate immune function.","Bortell, R; Moss, J; McKenna, R C; Rigby, M R; Niedzwiecki, D; Stevens, L A; Patton, W A; Mordes, J P; Greiner, D L; Rossini, A A",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11489987/,238

Intestinal contents were collected from turkeys prior to placement, with each flock resampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 wk of age. The samples were screened for astrovirus, rotavirus, reovirus, and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) by a reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and for groups 1 and 2 adenovirus by PCR. Rotavirus was the only virus detected prior to placement (7 of 16 samples examined). All of the commercial flocks were positive for rotavirus and astrovirus from 2 until 6 wk of age, and most were intermittently positive until 12 wk of age, when the birds were processed. Of the 96 samples collected from birds on the farms, 89.5% were positive for astrovirus, and 67.7% were positive for rotavirus. All flocks were negative for TCoV, reovirus, and group 1 adenovirus at all time points, and positive for group 2 adenovirus (hemorrhagic enteritis virus) at 6 wk of age. All the flocks monitored were considered healthy or normal by field personnel. Turkeys placed on research facilities that had been empty for months and thoroughly cleaned had higher body weights and lower feed conversion rates at 5 wk of age when compared to turkeys placed on commercial farms. Intestinal samples collected at 1, 2, and 3 wk of age from these turkeys were free of enteric viruses. This report demonstrates that astroviruses and rotaviruses may be present within a turkey flock through the life of the flock. Comparison of infected birds with one group of turkeys that were negative for enteric viruses by the methods used here suggests that astrovirus and/or rotavirus may affect production. The full impact on flock performance needs to be further determined.","Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J; Spackman, Erica; Day, J Michael; Rives, David",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17992925/,238

203580,The Impact of Lockdown on Couples’ Sex Lives,2021,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out that urban taxi drivers and their passengers are at higher risk of transmitting coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to frequent contact among many people. Facemask wearing is one of the preventive measures recommended to control the transmission of the virus. A lack of evidence of the proportion of facemask wearing among taxi drivers and associated factors in Ethiopia, including Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, hinders the design of targeted interventions to advocate for facemask use. This study was designed to address this gap. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town from July to August, 2020. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique after proportionally allocating the sample size from the total number of taxi drivers working in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. The data were collected by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot observational checklist. The collected data were checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Bivariate (Crude Odds Ratio [COR]) and multivariable (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]) logistic regression analyses were employed using 95% CI (confidence interval). From bivariate logistic regression analysis, variables with p-value < 0.250 were retained into multivariable logistic regression analysis. Then, from the multivariable analysis, variables with p-value < 0.050 were declared as factors significantly associated with facemask wearing among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. MAIN FINDINGS: The proportion of taxi drivers who wore a facemask was 54.68% [95%CI: 50.10-59.7%]. The majority (58.3%) of drivers were using cloth facemasks, followed by N95 facemasks (24.5%) and surgical facemasks (17.3%). Out of the total 417 taxi drivers, more than two-thirds (69.8%) of them had a good knowledge about COVID-19 and 67.6% of taxi drivers had a positive attitude towards taking precautions against transmission of COVID-19. Three-fourths (74.1%) of the taxi drivers believed that wearing a facemask could prevent COVID-19. More than half (52.5%) felt discomfort when wearing a facemask. Almost three-fourths (72.2%) of taxi drivers felt that the presence of local government pressure helped them to wear a facemask. We found that marital status [AOR = 3.14, 95%CI: 1.97-5.01], fear of the disease [AOR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.28-3.47], belief in the effectiveness of a facemask [AOR = 5.6, 95%CI: 3.1-10.16] and feeling government pressure [AOR = 3.6, 95%CI: 2.16-6.13] were factors significantly associated with wearing a facemask. CONCLUSION: We found that the proportion of facemask wearers among taxi drivers was relatively low in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. In order to increase that number, government bodies should work aggressively to encourage more taxi drivers to wear a facemask. We also recommend that government and non-government organizations work very closely together to implement strategies that promote facemask use, including increasing the availability of inexpensive facemasks, and monitoring and controlling facemask use.","Natnael, Tarikuwa; Alemnew, Yeshiwork; Berihun, Gete; Abebe, Masresha; Andualem, Atsedemariam; Ademe, Sewunet; Tegegne, Belachew; Adane, Metadel",PLoS One,,238

Moreover, the control function can only be applied over a finite time interval, and the duration of the most strict quarantine (smallest possible reproduction number) is also bounded. We consider a maximization problem where the cost functional has two terms: one is the number of susceptible individuals in the long-term and the other depends on the cost of interventions. When the intervention term is linear with respect to the control, we obtain that the optimal solution is bang-bang, and we characterize the times to begin and end the strict quarantine. In the general case, when the cost functional includes the term that measures the intervention cost, we analyze the optimality of controls through numerical computations.","Balderrama, Roc'io; Peressutti, Javier; Pinasco, Juan Pablo; Vega, Constanza S'anchez de la; V'azquez, Federico",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11690v1.pdf,238

The COVID-19 pandemic requires a global response for this most vulnerable population. This study purpose was to explore whether fear of COVID-19 and fear of cancer recurrence are related to the likelihood of remaining at work following treatment in male cancer survivors. Survivors and methods: A cross-sectional survey was used. Data were collected in China in May to June 2020. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Fear of Cancer Recurrence (FCR) Inventory-Short Form and work sustainability subscale of the Readiness for Return to Work Scale were completed by male cancer survivors. Results: A total of 121 employed male cancer survivors participated in this study. Fear of COVID-19 and fear of cancer recurrence were both negatively correlated with work sustainability (β = −0.11, and β = −0.19, respectively). Significant interaction effects between fear of COVID-19 and fear of cancer recurrence were observed (β = 0.46, P &lt;0.01). Advanced disease stage, undergoing radiation therapy and having recently completed cancer treatment were all factors related to lower work sustainability scores (β = −0.28, β = −0.15, and β = −0.17, respectively). The overall path model yielded a good fit: χ2/df = 1.12 (P = 0.24), RMSEA = 0.07, TLI = 0.98, CFI = 0.99, IFI = 0.92, and NFI = 0.96. Conclusion: Fear of COVID-19 is a mediator between fear of cancer recurrence and work sustainability among Chinese male cancer survivors. The findings also indicated that male cancer survivors with higher FCR levels reported less confidence in their ability to remain at work. This information can assist in the development of new interventions and educational programs for cancer survivors, healthcare providers and employers, to improve employees’ ability to remain at work. © 2021.

212486,COVID-19 in a child with severe propionic acidemia,2021,"BACKGROUND: The role of portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters for supplemental aerosol mitigation during exercise testing is unknown and might be relevant during COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of portable HEPA filtering on aerosol concentration during exercise testing and its efficiency in reducing room clearance time in a clinical exercise testing laboratory? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were six healthy volunteers aged 20 to 56 years. In the first experiment, exercise was performed in a small tent with controlled airflow with the use of a stationary cycle, portable HEPA filter with fume hood, and particle counter to document aerosol concentration. Subjects performed a four-stage maximal exercise test that lasted 12 minutes plus 5 minutes of pretest quiet breathing and 3 minutes of active recovery. First, they exercised without mitigation then with portable HEPA filter running. In a separate experiment, room aerosol clearance time was measured in a clinical exercise testing laboratory by filling it with artificially generated aerosols and measuring time to 99.9% aerosol clearance with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) only or HVAC plus portable HEPA filter running. RESULTS: In the exercise experiment, particle concentrations reached 1,722 ± 1,484/L vs 96 ± 124/L (P < .04) for all particles (>0.3 µm), 1,339 ± 1,281/L vs 76 ± 104/L (P < .05) for smaller particles (0.3 to 1.0 µm), and 333 ± 209/L vs 17 ± 19/L (P < .01) for larger particles (1.0 to 5.0 µm) at the end of the protocol in a comparison of mitigation vs portable HEPA filter. Use of a portable HEPA filter in a clinical exercise laboratory clearance experiment reduced aerosol clearance time 47% vs HVAC alone. INTERPRETATION: The portable HEPA filter reduced the concentration of aerosols generated during exercise testing by 96% ± 2% for all particle sizes and reduced aerosol room clearance time in clinical exercise testing laboratories. Portable HEPA filters therefore might be useful in clinical exercise testing laboratories to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Garzona-Navas, Andres; Sajgalik, Pavol; Csecs, Ibolya; Askew, J Wells; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Niven, Alexander S; Johnson, Bruce D; Allison, Thomas G",Chest,,238
212715,Patients with cancer hit hard by deadly explosions in Beirut,2020,"The objective of the study was to develop and validate a prediction model that identifies COVID-19 patients at risk of requiring oxygen support based on five parameters: C-reactive protein (CRP), hypertension, age, and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts (CHANeL). This retrospective cohort study included 221 consecutive COVID-19 patients and the patients were randomly assigned randomly to a training set and a test set in a ratio of 1:1. Logistic regression, logistic LASSO regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost analyses were performed based on age, hypertension status, serial CRP, and neutrophil and lymphocyte counts during the first 3 days of hospitalization. The ability of the model to predict oxygen requirement during hospitalization was tested. During hospitalization, 45 (41.8%) patients in the training set (n = 110) and 41 (36.9%) in the test set (n = 111) required supplementary oxygen support. The logistic LASSO regression model exhibited the highest AUC for the test set, with a sensitivity of 0.927 and a specificity of 0.814. An online risk calculator for oxygen requirement using CHANeL predictors was developed. ""CHANeL"" prediction models based on serial CRP, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts during the first 3 days of hospitalization, along with age and hypertension status, provide a reliable estimate of the risk of supplement oxygen requirement among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Lee, Eunyoung Emily; Hwang, Woochang; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Jung, Jongtak; Kang, Chang Kyung; Kim, Jeong-Han; Oh, Hong Sang; Kang, Yu Min; Lee, Eun Bong; Chin, Bum Sik; Song, Woojeung; Kim, Nam Joong; Park, Jin Kyun",Sci Rep,,238

An increase in social media usage has also been observed, leading to the suspicion that this has also raised cyberbullying. In this initial work, we explore the possibility of an increase in cyberbullying incidents due to the pandemic and high social media usage. To evaluate this trend, we collected 454,046 cyberbullying-related public tweets posted between January 1st, 2020 -- June 7th, 2020. We summarize the tweets containing multiple keywords into their daily counts. Our analysis showed the existence of at most one statistically significant changepoint for most of these keywords, which were primarily located around the end of March. Almost all these changepoint time-locations can be attributed to COVID-19, which substantiates our initial hypothesis of an increase in cyberbullying through analysis of discussions over Twitter.","Das, Sanchari; Kim, Andrew; Karmakar, Sayar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.13613v1.pdf,238

However, toxic effects of exposure to MPs and NPs on organisms at developmental stages have not been elucidated yet. In this study, zebrafish embryos at early stage were used to evaluate potential toxic effects of exposure to MPs with diameter of 1 µm and NPs with diameter of 0.4 µm. Solution containing NPs was optically more transparent than solution containing MPs at the same mass concentration. However, exposure to NPs induced significantly higher mortality rate of zebrafish embryos than exposure to MPs. Exposure to MPs or NPs caused pathological changes of caudal vein plexus. In addition, caudal tissues were impaired with inhibition of intact growth of zebrafish embryos. Peripheral microcirculation at caudal region was significantly deteriorated by exposure to MPs or NPs. However, systematic perfusion was still maintained with preservation of RBC velocity profiles regardless of exposure to MPs or NPs. This study provides a new insight to the use of plastics, demonstrating that exposure to MPs or NPs can lead to developmental disorder with significant impairment of growth and peripheral microcirculation dysfunction.","Park, Sung Ho; Kim, Kiwoong",Chemosphere,,238
213308,Priority COVID-19 Vaccination for Patients with Cancer while Vaccine Supply Is Limited,2021,"The current pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 originated from Wuhan, China. It is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with significant mortality and morbidity rate. The severe risk factors are commonly detected in patients of older age and with medical comorbidities like cancer and diabetes. Scientists and doctors have scrambled to gain knowledge about the novel virus and its pathophysiology in order to discover possible therapeutic regimens and vaccines for COVID-19. The therapeutic strategies like targeting the viral genome emphasize the promising approach to target COVID-19. Additionally, blocking the receptor, ACE2 via the neutralizing antibodies for viral escape that prevents it from entering into the cells provides another therapeutic regimen. In this review article, we have presented the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in comorbid patients and discussed organ failure caused by this virus. Based on the data available from the scientific literature and ongoing clinical trials, we have focused on therapeutic strategies. We hope that we would fill the gaps that puzzled the researchers and clinicians with the best of our knowledge collected for the betterment of the patients for the coming future.","Dariya, Begum; Nagaraju, Ganji Purnachandra",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,238

214181,Linking chronic periodontitis and oral cancer: A review,2021,"COVID-19 is a biphasic infectious disease with no approved vaccine or pharmacotherapy. The first drug that has shown promise in reducing COVID-19 mortality in severely-ill patients is dexamethasone, a cheap, well-known anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, approved for the treatment of inflammatory conditions including respiratory diseases such as asthma and tuberculosis. However, about 80% of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygenation, and about 67% of patients on ventilators, are not responsive to dexamethasone therapy mainly. Additionally, using higher doses of dexamethasone for prolonged periods of time can lead to severe side effects and some patients may develop corticosteroid resistance leading to treatment failure. In order to increase the therapeutic efficacy of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients, while minimizing dexamethasone-related complications that could result from using higher doses of the drug, we applied a chemocentric informatics approach to identify combination therapies. Our results indicated that combining dexamethasone with fast long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol and salmeterol, can ease respiratory symptoms hastily, until dexamethasone's anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects kick in. Our studies demonstrated that LABAs and dexamethasone (or other glucocorticoids) exert synergistic effects that will augment both anti-inflammatory and fibronectin-mediated anticoagulant effects. We also propose other alternatives to LABAs that are supported by sound systems biology evidence, such as nitric oxide. Other drugs such as sevoflurane and treprostinil interact with the SARS-CoV-2 interactome and deserve further exploration. Moreover, our chemocentric informatics approach provides systems biology evidence that combination therapies for COVID-19 will have higher chances of perturbing the SARS-CoV-2 human interactome, which may negatively impact COVID-19 disease pathways.","Hajjo, Rima; Sabbah, Dima A; Bardaweel, Sanaa K",ACS Omega,,238

216023,Euglycemic DKA Associated With SGLT2 Inhibitors,2021,"Child labour is a global phenomenon occurring predominantly in countries with lower socioeconomic status and resources. Societal and familial poverty, loss or incapacitation/illness of parents, lack of social security and protection, and ignorance about the value of, or limited access to, education are among the myriad reasons for the involvement of children in the workforce. Child labour is a barrier to the development of individual children and their society and economy. Global estimates indicate that 152 million children (64 million girls and 88 million boys) are working, accounting for almost one in 10 of all children worldwide. Currently the COVID-19 health pandemic and the resulting economic and labour market consequences are having a major impact on people's lives and livelihoods. Unfortunately, impoverished families and their children are often the first to suffer, which may push many more vulnerable children into child labour situations. Child labour in India is more prevalent than in many other countries, with approximately 10 million children actively engaged in, or seeking, work. This paper focuses on the issue of child labour, its causes and its ill effects. Further, it also reviews the international legal framework relating to child labour and legislative issues in India. There is clearly an urgent need for this issue to be effectively addressed and resolved.","Kaur, Navpreet; Byard, Roger W",Med Sci Law,,238

As part of a multi-institutional COVID-19 pandemic response, over 500 million small molecules were computationally screened against four protein structures from the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Three enhancements to Deep Fusion were made in order to evaluate more than 5 billion docked poses on SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. First, the Deep Fusion concept was refined by formulating the architecture as one, coherently backpropagated model (Coherent Fusion) to improve binding-affinity prediction accuracy. Secondly, the model was trained using a distributed, genetic hyper-parameter optimization. Finally, a scalable, high-throughput screening capability was developed to maximize the number of ligands evaluated and expedite the path to experimental evaluation. In this work, we present both the methods developed for machine learning-based high-throughput screening and results from using our computational pipeline to find SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","Stevenson, Garrett A.; Jones, Derek; Kim, Hyojin; Bennett, W.

Third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-TKI, osimertinib use can be associated with a benign radiological finding called transient asymptomatic pulmonary opacities that can be confused with an infectious pulmonary process resulting in overtreatment with antibiotics or premature treatment withdrawal or severe DI-ILD. In this case, our patient with newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer on treatment with osimertinib developed very early onset severe DI-ILD (grade-IV) with a unique pattern of pulmonary involvement and was treated with high-dose corticosteroids with a response. She was later successfully rechallenged with osimertinib and responded well to the treatment. Our case highlights the importance of being cognizant of the possibility that DI-ILD can rarely occur within a week of treatment initiation with osimertinib and safe reintroduction of the drug is possible in select patients following complete resolution of pulmonary radiographic findings and clinical symptoms even with high-grade adverse events.","Turab, Mohammed Mangeshkar Shaunak Rathmann Joerg",Case Reports in Oncology,,238

The timed inspiratory effort (TIE) index is a recently proposed weaning index that has been reported to be effective in predicting successful weaning. We sought to analyze the respiratory muscle groups involved with the TIE index measurement utilizing the surface electromyography (sEMG). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study including 46 mechanically ventilated subjects. The variable analyzed with sEMG was the root mean square (RMS) for correlation with the degree of recruitment of motor units and strength. The data were obtained along the 60 s of the TIE index measurement and analyzed in each one of the 3 20-s intervals. Pooled and individual muscle RMS values were analyzed comparing success and failure groups. P < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) age of the participants was 80 (71-87) y. The pooled sEMG data showed that muscle strength increased over time, following the profile observed for maximum inspiratory pressure, irrespective of the analyzed group. However, in line with the findings regarding maximum inspiratory pressure, the RMS medians were statistically higher at every 20-s interval in the success group. Diaphragm strength increased over time, with values reaching statistically significant differences at the end of the observation period, but only in the success group. In addition, diaphragm strength was statistically higher during the whole test in the success group. Finally, there was a substantial increase in sternocleidomastoid strength over time after 40 s of observation, which was not observed in the scalene muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects succeeding in a weaning trial had higher muscle strength, confirmed in the pooled and the individual sEMG analysis. A vigorous diaphragm with low fatigue potential seems essential for successful weaning; the sternocleidomastoid may also be of importance in this regard.","de Souza Costa, Helson Lino Leite; de Souza, Leonardo Cordeiro; da Silva Neto, Arthur Evangelista; da Silva Guimarães, Bruno Leonardo; de Azeredo, Leandro Miranda; Godoy, Marcos David Parada; Lugon, Jocemir Ronaldo",Respir. care,,238

This systematic review investigated the prognostic value of myocardial fibrosis as assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on c-MRI in patients with ICM for ventricular tachyarrhythmia, sudden cardiac death (SCD), or all-cause mortality. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the electronic databases Pubmed and Embase for relevant prospective English-language studies published between January 1990 and February 2019. All included articles were prospective studies that comprised of human participants older than 18â¯years with ICM and a primary or secondary prevention implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD); had a sample size >30 participants; had at least 6â¯months of follow-up; and reported on ventricular tachyarrhythmia, SCD, and all-cause mortality. A total of 90 articles related to ICM were identified and were subsequently screened independently by 2 authors. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of LGE were calculated using random-effects model. RESULTS: Eight studies with 1,085 participants were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients varied from 43 to 83â¯years, with most patients being men. The most common comorbidities reported included history of diabetes mellitus (22%-62%), hyperlipidemia (40%-86%), and hypertension (35%-88%). The ejection fraction of each study was reported as mean or median and varied from 22% to 35%. During a follow-up that ranged from 8.5 to 65â¯months, there were 110 ventricular arrhythmic events reported. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of LGE for ICD therapy delivered for ventricular arrhythmias were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66-0.87) and 0.28 (95% CI: 0.14-0.46), respectively. For all-cause mortality, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of LGE were 0.76 (95% CI: 0.40-0.93) and 0.41 (95% CI: 0.14-0.75), respectively. Although SCD was of significant interest to our review, only 1 of the studies reported on the association between LGE and SCD, leading to the subsequent exclusion of SCD from the end point analysis. CONCLUSIONS: LGE has high prognostic value in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with ICM and may provide helpful information for clinical decision making related to SCD prevention. Our findings illustrate how LGE may improve current risk stratification, prognostication, and selection of patients with ICM for ICD therapy.","Chery, Godefroy; Kamp, Nicholas; Kosinski, Andrzej S; Schmidler, Gillian Sanders; Lopes, Renato D; Patel, Manesh; Al-Khatib, Sana M",Am Heart J,,238

220923,Impact of the First Wave of COVID-19 on Pediatric Oncology and Hematology: A Report from the French Society of Pediatric Oncology,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Sars-CoV-2 infection has rapidly spread worldwide following the first cases reported in China. Piacenza is one of the most affected cities in Italy. Many infections occurred in the hospital due to the high frequency of patients and healthcare professionals interaction. The aim of the work is to evaluate advantages of universal screening for Sars-Cov-2 in pregnant women admitted to a hospital setting and calculate frequency of infection in an obstetrical population. Methods: all pregnant women attending Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Piacenza from 22nd April to 18th June 2020 were screened for Sars-Cov-2 using a nasopharyngeal swab. Results: 240 pregnant women were tested upon admission: all twelve (5%) testing positive were asymptomatic. None of the positive asymptomatic women developed COVID-19 symptoms or adverse perinatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: the diagnosis of asymptomatic pregnant women through universal screening provides the opportunity to protect mothers, babies and heath care workers. In accordance with other studies, our findings add to the growing body of evidence showing high rates of asymptomatic infection in the healthcare setting and highlight a critical need for universal screening of pregnant women.","Grossi, Elena; Agnoli, Benedetta; Baldini, Monica; Illari, Simona; Bonini, Renza; Scagnelli, Giuseppe",Acta Biomed,,238

MethodsSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values produced from April 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021, were compared with national COVID-19 confirmed cases notifications according to their geographical and time distribution. These Ct values were evaluated against both a phase diagram predicting the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and an age-structured model estimating COVID-19 prevalence in Belgium. ResultsOver 155,811 RT-PCR performed, 12,799 were positive and 7,910 Ct values were available for analysis. The 14-day median Ct values were negatively correlated with the 14-day mean daily positive tests with a lag of 17 days. In addition, the 14-day mean daily positive tests in LHUB-ULB were strongly correlated with the 14-day mean confirmed cases in the Brussels-Capital and in Belgium with coinciding start, peak and end of the different waves of the epidemic. Ct values decreased concurrently with the forecasted phase-shifts of the diagram. Similarly, the evolution of 14-day median Ct values was negatively correlated with daily estimated prevalence for all age-classes. ConclusionWe provide preliminary evidence that trends of Ct values can help to both follow and predict the epidemics trajectory at local and national levels, underlining that consolidated microbiology laboratories can act as epidemic sensors as they gather data that are representative of the geographical area they serve.","Yin, Nicolas; Dellicour, Simon; Daubie, Valery; Franco, Nicolas; Wautier, Magali; Faes, Christel; Cauteren, Dieter Van; Nymark, Liv; Hens, Niel; Gilbert, Marius; Hallin, Marie; Vandenberg, Olivier",,,238
222167,Importance of the Lipid-Bound Character of Vitamin D Binding Protein in the Evaluation of Vitamin D Status in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Computer Tomography (CT) is currently being adapted for visualization of COVID-19 lung damage. Manual classification and characterization of COVID-19 may be biased depending on the expert's opinion. Artificial Intelligence has recently penetrated COVID-19, especially deep learning paradigms. There are nine kinds of classification systems in this study, namely one deep learning-based CNN, five kinds of transfer learning (TL) systems namely VGG16, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201 and MobileNet, three kinds of machine-learning (ML) systems, namely artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) that have been designed for classification of COVID-19 segmented CT lung against Controls. Three kinds of characterization systems were developed namely (a) Block imaging for COVID-19 severity index (CSI); (b) Bispectrum analysis; and (c) Block Entropy. A cohort of Italian patients with 30 controls (990 slices) and 30 COVID-19 patients (705 slices) was used to test the performance of three types of classifiers. Using K10 protocol (90% training and 10% testing), the best accuracy and AUC was for DCNN and RF pairs were 99.41 ± 5.12%, 0.991 (p < 0.0001), and 99.41 ± 0.62%, 0.988 (p < 0.0001), respectively, followed by other ML and TL classifiers. We show that diagnostics odds ratio (DOR) was higher for DL compared to ML, and both, Bispecturm and Block Entropy shows higher values for COVID-19 patients. CSI shows an association with Ground Glass Opacities (0.9146, p < 0.0001). Our hypothesis holds true that deep learning shows superior performance compared to machine learning models. Block imaging is a powerful novel approach for pinpointing COVID-19 severity and is clinically validated.","Agarwal, Mohit; Saba, Luca; Gupta, Suneet K; Carriero, Alessandro; Falaschi, Zeno; Paschè, Alessio; Danna, Pietro; El-Baz, Ayman; Naidu, Subbaram; Suri, Jasjit S",J Med Syst,,238

Thus, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The patient recruitment phase finished at the end of August 2020, and the follow-up continues by the end of August 2021. The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered main secondary outcomes. Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, 490 patients with complete information (39% female; the average age of 57±15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The Cox Proportional-Hazards Model for PCEP indicated the following significant risk factors: Oxygen saturation < 80% (HR = 6.3; [CI 95%: 2.5,15.5]), lymphopenia (HR = 3.5; [CI 95%: 2.2,5.5]), Oxygen saturation 80%-90% (HR = 2.5; [CI 95%: 1.1,5.8]), and thrombocytopenia (HR = 1.6; [CI 95%: 1.1,2.5]).

We performed whole genome sequencing of 27 SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated between January, 2020 and April 2020. A total of 54 mutations in different genomic regions was found. The D614G mutation, first detected in March 2020, was identified in 18 strains and was more likely associated with a lower cycle threshold (<25) in real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tests than the original D614 (prevalence ratio = 2.75, 95% confidence interval: 1.19-6.38). The integration of sequencing and epidemiological data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 transmission in both quarantine areas and in the community in Vietnam occur at the beginning of the epidemic although the country implemented strict quarantine quite early, strict contact tracing and testing.

Herein, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature and analyzed clinical characteristics and mortality of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through searching PubMed until June 03, 2020, we identified 16 relevant case studies (33 cases) from a total of 45 studies that have reported on patients with COVID-19 and hematologic malignancies. We investigated the clinical and laboratory characteristics including type of hematologic malignancies, initial symptoms, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Then, we compared those characteristics and outcomes of patients with hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 to the general population infected with COVID-19. RESULTS: The median age was 66-year-old. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was the most common type of hematologic malignancy (39.4%). Fever was the most common symptom (75.9%). Most patients had normal leukocyte counts (55.6%), lymphocytosis (45.4%), and normal platelet counts (68.8%). In comparison to patients with COVID-19 without underlying hematologic malignancies, dyspnea was more prevalent (45.0 vs. 24.9%, p=0.025). Leukocytosis (38.9 vs. 9.8%, p=0.001), lymphocytosis (45.4 vs. 8.2%, p=0.001), and thrombocytopenia (31.3 vs. 11.4%, p=0.036) were significantly more prevalent and lymphopenia (18.2 vs. 57.4%, p=0.012) less prevalent in patients with hematologic malignancies. There were no clinical and laboratory characteristics predicting mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. Mortality was much higher in patients with hematologic malignancies compared to those without this condition (40.0 vs. 3.6%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Co-occurrence of hematologic malignancies and COVID-19 is rare. However, due to the high mortality rate from COVID-19 in this vulnerable population, further investigation on tailored treatment and management is required.","Kim, J S; Lee, K H; Kim, G E; Kim, S; Yang, J W; Li, H; Hong, S H; Ghayda, R A; Kronbichler, A; Koyanagi, A; Jacob, L; Shin, J I; Smith, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,238

226510,Psoriasis-COVID 19 Infection: Treatment Options,2020,"BACKGROUND: Among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), up to 12% may require intensive care unit (ICU) management. The aim of this prospective cohort study is to assess nutrition status and outcome in patients with COVID-19 following ICU discharge. METHODS: Patients requiring a minimum of 14 days' stay in the ICU with mechanical ventilation were included. Nutrition status was assessed at inclusion (ICU discharge) and follow-up (after 15, 30, and 60 days). All patients had standardized medical nutrition therapy with defined targets regarding energy (30 kcal/kg/d) and protein intake (1.5 g/kg/d). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included (67% males); the median age was 60 (33-75) years old. Body mass index at ICU admission was 25.7 (IQR, 24-31) kg/m². After a median ICU stay of 33 (IQR, 26-39) days, malnutrition was present in all patients (11.3% median weight loss and/or low muscle mass based on handgrip strength measurement). Because of postintubation dysphagia in 60% of patients, enteral nutrition was administered (57% nasogastric tube; 43% percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy). After 2 months, a significant improvement in muscle strength was observed (median handgrip strength, 64.7% [IQR, 51%-73%] of the predicted values for age vs 19% [IQR, 4.8%-28.4%] at ICU discharge [P < 0.0005]), as well as weight gain of 4.3 kg (IQR, 2.7-6.7 kg) (P < 0.0002).

The actual prevalence (ie, the proportion of confirmed patients among those tested) in eight countries was obtained from web sources, and the predictive values were calculated. Meta-regression was performed to reveal the effect of potential explanatory factors on the diagnostic performance measures. Results The pooled sensitivity was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 91%, 96%; I2 = 95%) for chest CT and 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%; I2 = 90%) for RT-PCR. The pooled specificity was 37% (95% CI: 26%, 50%; I2 = 83%) for chest CT. The prevalence of COVID-19 outside China ranged from 1.0% to 22.9%. For chest CT scans, the positive predictive value (PPV) ranged from 1.5% to 30.7%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) ranged from 95.4% to 99.8%. For RT-PCR, the PPV ranged from 47.3% to 96.4%, whereas the NPV ranged from 96.8% to 99.9%. The sensitivity of CT was affected by the distribution of disease severity, the proportion of patients with comorbidities, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients (all P < .05). The sensitivity of RT-PCR was negatively associated with the proportion of elderly patients (P = .01). Conclusion Outside of China where there is a low prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (range, 1%-22.9%), chest CT screening of patients with suspected disease had low positive predictive value (range, 1.5%-30.7%). © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Kim, Hyungjin; Hong, Hyunsook; Yoon, Soon Ho",Radiology,,238
226909,Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 Variants,2021,"The important role of human gut microbiota in liver diseases has long been recognized as dysbiosis and the translocation of certain microbes from the gut to liver. With the development of high-throughput DNA sequencing, the complexity and integrity of the gut microbiome in the whole spectrum of liver diseases is emerging. Specific patterns of gut microbiota have been identified in liver diseases with different causes, including alcoholic, non-alcoholic, and virus induced liver diseases, or even at different stages, ranging from steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, to hepatocellular carcinoma. At the same time, the mechanism of how microbiota contributes to liver diseases goes beyond the traditional function of the gut–liver axis which could lead to liver injury and inflammation. With the application of proteomics, metabolomics, and modern molecular technologies, more microbial metabolites and the complicated interaction of microbiota with host immunity come into our understanding in the liver pathogenesis. Germ-free animal models serve as a workhorse to test the function of microbiota and their derivatives in liver disease models. Here, we review the current evidence on the relationship between gut microbiota and liver diseases, and the mechanisms underlying this phenotype. In addition to original liver diseases, gut microbiota might also affect liver injury in systemic disorders involving multiple organs, as in the case of COVID-19 at a severe state. A better understanding of the gut microbial contribution to liver diseases might help us better benefit from this guest–host relationship and pave the way for novel therapies.","Li, Rui Mao Zhengsheng Ye Xujun Zuo Tao",Microorganisms,,238

227652,Immunoregulatory therapy strategies that target cytokine storms in patients with COVID-19 (Review),2021,"OBJECTIVES: Decisions with an ethical component have been controversial during the COVID-19 pandemic, whether leaked intensive care unit (ICU)-rationing documents, transfer of people to care-homes to 'protect the National Health Service' or the duty to treat patients despite inadequate personal protective equipment. To counter criticism of ethics per se, and to help those planning ethics support we describe the practical work of a children's hospital bioethics team in supporting children, families and clinicians during this unprecedented period. DESIGN/SETTING: Three phases of activity: (i) preparation: we composed several documents to support/guide hospital teams and, together with colleagues, provided them to regional inpatient, community and hospice settings. We adapted existing mechanisms to combat workforce moral injury; (ii) activity (March-June 2020): was highest in our rapid response service where children/families consider difficult treatment decisions with medical teams. Education provided 'pandemic webcasts' on decision-making and broader child-health concerns. Staff support was essential, especially for those deployed to overwhelmed local adult ICUs. Research ascertained young people's views on the pandemic; (iii) reflection: focussed on (a) research about future re-deployment to adult services and minimisation of moral distress/injury, (b) remote video-conferencing-parents'/participants' experience/ability to consider complex ethical issues and (c) role of faith/non-faith in society's recovery and children's views. MAIN OUTCOME/CONCLUSIONS: Our bioethics team's role during the pandemic included: case reviews via video-conferencing, many involving innovative therapy for severely unwell children with COVID-19/Paediatric-Inflammatory-Multisystem Syndrome-Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 together with their parents; processes to protect healthcare staff from moral harm and research/educational activity focused on paediatric-specific ethical arising during the pandemic.","Brierley, Joe; Aylett, Sarah; MacNiven, Anne; Dittborn, Mariana",Arch. dis. child,,238

228674,[The Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgery of Cancer Patients],2020,"PURPOSE: Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients may experience fears regarding cancer recurrence (FoR) and of catching COVID-19. There could be unease for attending hospital clinics for face to face (F2F) examination. F2F benefit in cancer surveillance has to be balanced against the risk of virus transmission. This study aimed to report perceptions of fear of cancer and fear of COVID-19 and to report patient preference for follow-up consultation in HNC survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study ran from lockdown in England on 24th March to 29th July 2020. Patients were offered preference to postpone their consultation, to have it by telephone, or F2F. A postal survey was undertaken in the 2 weeks post-consultation (actual or postponed). RESULTS: There were 103 patients. Initial action by consultant and patient resulted in 51 postponed consultations, 35 telephone consultations and 17 F2F meetings, with 10 F2F triggered by the patient. There were 58 responders to the survey and most (39) had a clear preference for one mode of follow-up consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with half (19) preferring F2F. A similar response was seen regarding their consultations in general to address unmet needs and concerns, with 38 having a preferred mode, 29 preferring F2F. Serious fears about recurrence and COVID-19 were at relatively low levels with a tendency to be more concerned about recurrence. CONCLUSION: Any redesign of mode and frequency of out-patient follow-up in light of COVID-19 should be undertaken in discussion with patient groups and with individual patients.","Dimelow, Joanna; Lowe, Derek; Rogers, Simon N",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,238

The purpose of the survey was to measure symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatization by using a standard 18-item battery and assess how the results were related to an individual's socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and social capital under an ongoing pandemic. The survey reveals that the pandemic has had a significant impact, as the respondents had more serious mental symptoms when their residential communities exhibited a greater exposure to the spread of the virus. The socioeconomic status of the respondents was negatively associated with the mental symptoms. It modified the impact of COVID-19, and its effect was substantially mediated by measures of lifestyle and social capital.","Xiao, Yang; Bian, Yanjie; Zhang, Lei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,238
229882,"Pediatrician, watch out for corona-phobia",2020,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine use in chronic disease management has markedly increased during health emergencies due to COVID-19. Diabetes and technologies supporting diabetes care, including glucose monitoring devices, software analyzing glucose data, and insulin delivering systems, would facilitate remote and structured disease management. Indeed, most of the currently available technologies to store and transfer web-based data to be shared with health care providers. OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided our patients the opportunity to manage their diabetes remotely by implementing technology. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 virtual visits on glycemic control parameters among patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) during the lockdown period. METHODS: This prospective observational study included T1D patients who completed 2 virtual visits during the lockdown period. The glucose outcomes that reflected the benefits of the virtual consultation were time in range (TIR), time above range, time below range, mean daily glucose, glucose management indicator (GMI), and glycemic variability. This metric was generated using specific computer programs that automatically upload data from the devices used to monitor blood or interstitial glucose levels. If needed, we changed the ongoing treatment at the first virtual visit. RESULTS: Among 209 eligible patients with T1D, 166 completed 2 virtual visits, 35 failed to download glucose data, and 8 declined the visit. Among the patients not included in the study, we observed a significantly lower proportion of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) users (n=7/43, 16% vs n=155/166, 93.4% and n=9/43, 21% vs n=128/166, 77.1%, respectively; P<.001) compared to patients who completed the study. TIR significantly increased from the first (62%, SD 18%) to the second (65%, SD 16%) virtual visit (P=.02); this increase was more marked among patients using the traditional meter (n=11; baseline TIR=55%, SD 17% and follow-up TIR=66%, SD 13%; P=.01) than among those using CGM, and in those with a baseline GMI of &#8805;7.5% (n=46; baseline TIR=45%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=53%, SD 18%; P<.001) than in those with a GMI of <7.5% (n=120; baseline TIR=68%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=69%, SD 15%; P=.98). The only variable independently associated with TIR was the change of ongoing therapy. The unstandardized beta coefficient (B) and 95% CI were 5 (95% CI 0.7-8.0) (P=.02). The type of glucose monitoring device and insulin delivery systems did not influence glucometric parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the structured virtual visits help maintain and improve glycemic control in situations where in-person visits are not feasible.","Parise, Martina; Tartaglione, Linda; Cutruzzolà, Antonio; Maiorino, Maria Ida; Esposito, Katherine; Pitocco, Dario; Gnasso, Agostino; Irace, Concetta",J Med Internet Res,,238

Our model is an extension of the SIQR (susceptible-infected-quarantine-recovered) and SIRP (susceptible-infected-recovered-pathogen) models used earlier to describe various scenarios of epidemic spread. As compared to the basic SIR model, our model takes into account two possible routes of virus transmission: direct from the infected compartment to the susceptible compartment and indirect via some intermediate medium or fomites. The transmission rates are estimated in terms of the average distances between the individuals in selected social environments and characteristic relaxation times. We also introduce a resource activation function that reflects the load of the epidemics on economics and the limited capacity of the medical infrastructure. Our model brings an advantage of building various control strategies to minimize the effect of the epidemic and can be applied to modeling the recent COVID-19 outbreak.","Lukyanets, S.

236379,Compassionate Use of Remdesivir in Covid-19,2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collapse of the public transit ridership led to significant budget deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues. Additionally, public transit agencies are facing challenges of reduced vehicle capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional costs of cleaning and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted essential service plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or frequencies. This paper studies the resiliency during a pandemic of On-Demand Multimodal Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit systems that combine a network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to serve the first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It presents a case study for the city of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple scenarios of depressed demand and social distancing representing various stages of the pandemic. The case study relies on an optimization pipeline that provides an end-to-end ODMTS solution by bringing together methods for demand estimation, network design, fleet sizing, and real-time dispatching. These methods are adapted to work in a multimodal setting and to satisfy practical constraints. In particular, a limit is imposed on the number of passenger transfers, and a new network design model is introduced to avoid the computational burden stemming from this constraint. Real data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is used to conduct the case study, and the results are evaluated with a high-fidelity simulation. The case study demonstrates how ODMTS provide a resilient solution in terms of cost, convenience, and accessibility for this wide range of scenarios.","Auad, Ramon; Dalmeijer, Kevin; Riley, Connor; Santanam, Tejas; Trasatti, Anthony; Hentenryck, Pascal Van; Zhang, Hanyu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05395v2.pdf,238
236472,Dynamics of coagulopathy in patients with different COVID-19 severity,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Children born moderate to late preterm (MLP, 32-36 weeks' gestation) account for approximately 85% of all preterm births globally. Compared with children born at term, children born MLP are at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Despite making up the largest group of preterm children, developmental outcomes of children born MLP are less well studied than in other preterm groups. This study aimed to (1) compare neurodevelopmental, respiratory health and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes between children born MLP and term at 9 years of age; (2) examine the differences in brain growth trajectory from infancy to 9 years between children born MLP and term; and in children born MLP; (3) examine the relationship between brain development and neurodevelopment at 9 years; and (4) identify risk factors for poorer outcomes at 9 years. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ""LaPrem"" (Late Preterm MRI Study) study is a longitudinal cohort study of children born MLP and term controls, born at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, between 2010 and 2013. Participants were recruited in the neonatal period and were previously followed up at 2 and 5 years. This 9-year school-age follow-up includes neuropsychology, motor and physical activities, and lung function assessments, as well as brain MRI. Outcomes at 9 years will be compared between birth groups using linear and logistic regressions. Trajectories of brain development will be compared between birth groups using mixed effects models. The relationships between MRI and neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as other early predictors of poor 9-year outcomes, will be explored using linear and logistic regression. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the human research ethics committee at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. Study outcomes will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and social media.","Cheong, Jeanie; Cameron, Kate Lillian Iona; Thompson, Deanne; Anderson, Peter J; Ranganathan, Sarath; Clark, Ross; Mentiplay, Benjamin; Burnett, Alice; Lee, Katherine; Doyle, Lex William; Spittle, Alicia J",BMJ Open,,238
236606,Pictorial review of ground glass opacification in the lungs,2020,"BACKGROUND: Virtual care has historically faced barriers to widespread adoption. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the rapid adoption and expansion of virtual care technologies. Although the intense and prolonged nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has renewed people's interest in health systems resilience, which includes how services adapt or transform in response to shocks, evidence regarding the role of virtual care technologies in health systems resilience is scarce. OBJECTIVE: At Toronto General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, the rapid virtualization of cardiac care began on March 9, 2020, as a response to the pandemic. The objective of this study was to understand people's experiences with and the barriers and facilitators of the rapid virtualization and expansion of cardiac care resulting from the pandemic. METHODS: A single-case study was conducted with 3 embedded units of analysis. Patients, clinicians, and staff were recruited purposively from an existing mobile, phone-based telemonitoring program at a heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada. Individual, semistructured phone interviews were conducted by two researchers and transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis at the semantic level was used to analyze transcripts and develop themes. RESULTS: A total of 29 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=16), clinicians (n=9), and staff (n=4). The following five themes were identified: (1) patient safety as a catalyst for virtual care adoption; (2) piecemeal virtual care solutions; (3) confronting new roles and workloads; (4) missing pieces in virtual care; and (5) the inequity paradox. The motivation to protect patient safety and a piecemeal approach to virtual care adoption facilitated the absorptive and adaptive resilience of cardiac care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, ad hoc changes to clinic roles and workflows, challenges in building relationships through remote methods, and widened inequities were barriers that threatened virtual care sustainment. CONCLUSIONS: We contend that sustaining virtual care hinges upon transformative actions (rather than adaptive actions) that strengthen health systems so that they can face the dynamic and emergent challenges associated with COVID-19 and other shocks. Based on the barriers and facilitators we identified, we present the lessons we learned and recommend transformations for sustaining virtual care during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shah, Amika; Guessi, Milena; Wali, Sahr; Ware, Patrick; McDonald, Michael; O039,; Sullivan, Mary; Posada, Juan Duero; Ross, Heather; Seto, Emily",JMIR Cardio,,238

Based on that, several anticoagulation (AC) guidelines have been proposed. We aimed to identify if AC therapy modifies the risk of developing severe COVID-19. Methods and Results COVID-19 patients initially admitted in medical wards of 24 French hospitals were included prospectively from February 26th to April 20th, 2020. We used Poisson regression model, Cox proportional hazard model and matched propensity score to assess the effect of AC on outcomes (intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or in-hospital mortality). Study enrolled 2878 COVID-19 patients, among whom 382 (13.2%) were treated with oral AC therapy prior to hospitalization. After adjustment, AC therapy prior to hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis with an adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR) 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.88). Analyses performed using propensity score matching confirmed that AC therapy prior to hospitalization was associated with a better prognosis with an aHR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.29-0.63) for ICU admission and aHR of 0.76 (95% CI 0.61-0.98) for composite criteria ICU admission and/or death. In contrast, therapeutic or prophylactic low or high dose AC started during hospitalization were not associated with any of the outcomes. Conclusions AC therapy used prior to hospitalization in medical wards was associated with a better prognosis in contrast to AC initiated during hospitalization. AC therapy introduced in early step of disease could better prevent COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, endotheliopathy and prognosis.","Chocron, Richard; Galand, Vincent; Cellier, Joffrey; Gendron, Nicolas; Pommier, Thibaut; Bory, Olivier; Khider, Lina; Trimaille, Antonin; Goudot, Guillaume; Weizman, Orianne; Alsac, Jean Marc; Geneste, Laura; Schmeltz, Armand; Panagides, Vassili; Philippe, Aurélien; Marsou, Wassima; Ben Abdallah, Iannis; Deney, Antoine; El Batti, Salma; Attou, Sabir; Juvin, Philippe; Delmotte, Thomas; Messas, Emmanuel; Pezel, Théo; Planquette, Benjamin; Duceau, Baptiste; Gaussem, Pascale; Sutter, Willy; Sanchez, Olivier; Waldman, Victor; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Bonnet, Guillaume; Cohen, Ariel; Smadja, David M",J Am Heart Assoc,,238

A return to normal surgery workflow depends prevalence and transmission of coronavirus in elective surgical patients. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of active SARS-CoV-2 infection during a second wave among patients admitted to hospital for elective surgery in Victoria. METHODS: Prospective cohort study across 8 hospitals in Victoria during July-August 2020, enrolling adults and children admitted to hospital for elective surgery or interventional procedure requiring general anaesthesia. Study outcomes included a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in the preoperative period (primary outcome); and for those with a negative test preoperatively, the incidence of a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in the postoperative period. RESULTS: We enrolled 4,965 elective adult and paediatric surgical patients from 15 July to 31 August, 2020. Four patients screened negative on questionnaire but had a positive PCR test for coronavirus, resulting in a Bayesian estimated prevalence of 0.12% (95% probability interval: 0 to 0.26%). There were no reports of healthcare worker infections linked to elective surgery during and up to 2 weeks after the study period. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic elective surgical patients during a second wave was approximately 1 in 833. Given the very low likelihood of coronavirus transmission, and with existing current hospital capacity, recommencement of elective surgery should be considered. A coronavirus screening checklist should be mandated for surgical patients.","Myles, Paul S; Wallace, Sophie; Story, David A; Brown, Wendy; Cheng, Allen C; Forbes, Andrew; Sidiropoulos, Sofia; Davidson, Andrew; Tan, Niki; Jeffreys, Andrew; Hodgson, Russell; Scott, David A; Radnor, Jade",ANZ j.

We report cardiac surgeons' concerns, perceptions, and responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A detailed survey was sent to recruit participating adult cardiac surgery centers in North America. Data regarding cardiac surgeons' perceptions and changes in practice were analyzed. RESULTS: Our study comprises 67 institutions with diverse geographic distribution across North America. Nurses were most likely to be redeployed (88%), followed by advanced care practitioners (69%), trainees (28%), and surgeons (25%). Examining surgeon concerns in regard to COVID-19, they were most worried with exposing their family to COVID-19 (81%), followed by contracting COVID-19 (68%), running out of personal protective equipment (PPE) (28%), and hospital resources (28%). In terms of PPE conservation strategies among users of N95 respirators, nearly half were recycling via decontamination with ultraviolet light (49%), followed by sterilization with heat (13%) and at home or with other modalities (13%). Reuse of N95 respirators for 1 day (22%), 1 week (21%) or 1 month (6%) was reported. There were differences in adoption of methods to conserve N95 respirators based on institutional pandemic phase and COVID-19 burden, with higher COVID-19 burden institutions more likely to resort to PPE conservation strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the impact of COVID-19 on North American cardiac surgeons. Our study should stimulate further discussions to identify optimal solutions to improve workforce preparedness for subsequent surges, as well as facilitate the navigation of future healthcare crises.","Luc, Jessica G Y; Ad, Niv; Nguyen, Tom C; Arora, Rakesh C; Balkhy, Husam H; Bender, Edward M; Bethencourt, Daniel M; Bisleri, Gianluigi; Boyd, Douglas; Chu, Michael W A; de la Cruz, Kim I; DeAnda, Abe; Engelman, Daniel T; Farkas, Emily A; Fedoruk, Lynn M; Fiocco, Michael; Forcillo, Jessica; Fradet, Guy; Fremes, Stephen E; Gammie, James S; Geirsson, Arnar; Gerdisch, Marc W; Girard, Leonard N; Kaiser, Clayton A; Kaneko, Tsuyoshi; Kent, William D T; Khabbaz, Kamal R; Khoynezhad, Ali; Kiaii, Bob; Lee, Richard; Legare, Jean-Francois; Lehr, Eric J; MacArthur, Roderick G G; McCarthy, Patrick M; Mehall, John R; Merrill, Walter H; Moon, Marc R; Ouzounian, Maral; Peltz, Matthias; Perrault, Louis P; Preventza, Ourania; Ramchandani, Mahesh; Ramlawi, Basel; Salenger, Rawn; Sekela, Michael E; Sellke, Frank W; Stulak, John M; Sutter, Francis P; Timek, Tomasz A; Whitman, Glenn",J. card. surg,,238

As of 12 March 2020, 125 048 confirmed COVID-19 cases in 118 countries had been reported. On 12 March 2020, the first case in the Pacific islands was reported in French Polynesia; no other Pacific island country or territory has reported cases. The purpose of our analysis is to show how travellers may introduce COVID-19 into the Pacific islands and discuss the role robust health systems play in protecting health and reducing transmission risk. We analyse travel and Global Health Security Index data using a scoring tool to produce quantitative estimates of COVID-19 importation risk, by departing and arriving country. Our analysis indicates that, as of 12 March 2020, the highest risk air routes by which COVID-19 may be imported into the Pacific islands are from east Asian countries (specifically, China, Korea and Japan) to north Pacific airports (likely Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or, to a less extent, Palau); or from China, Japan, Singapore, the United States of America or France to south Pacific ports (likely, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, French Polynesia or New Caledonia). Other importation routes include from other east Asian countries to Guam, and from Australia, New Zealand and other European countries to the south Pacific. The tool provides a useful method for assessing COVID-19 importation risk and may be useful in other settings.","Craig, A T; Heywood, A E; Hall, J",Epidemiol Infect,,238

Further still, what role might the U S 's history of ethnic strife and race-based health disparities play in either reinforcing or undermining state-level relations between collectivism and COVID-19 rates? To answer these questions, we examined archival data from 98 countries (Study 1) and the 48 contiguous United States (Study 2) on country/state-level collectivism, COVID-19 case/death rates, relevant covariates (per-capita GDP, population density, spatial dependence), and in the U S , percent of non-Whites In Study 1, country-level collectivism negatively related to both cases (r = −0 28) and deaths (r = −0 40) in simple regressions;however, after controlling for covariates, the former became non-significant (rp = −0 07), but the latter remained significant (rp = −0 20) In Study 2, state-level collectivism positively related to both cases (r = 0 56) and deaths (r = 0 41) in simple regressions, and these relationships persisted after controlling for all covariates except race, where a state's non-White population dominated all other predictors of COVID-19 cases (rp = 0 35) and deaths (rp = 0 31) We discuss the strong link between race and collectivism in U S culture, and its implications for understanding COVID-19 responses","Webster, Gregory D.; Howell, Jennifer L.; Losee, Joy E.; Mahar, Elizabeth A.; Wongsomboon, Val",Personality and Individual Differences,,238

Ultraschall in Med. 2020 Apr 15""",2020,"To quantify the fate of respiratory droplets under different ambient relative humidities, direct numerical simulations of a typical respiratory event are performed. We found that, because small droplets (with initial diameter of 10 µm) are swept by turbulent eddies in the expelled humid puff, their lifetime gets extended by a factor of more than 30 times as compared to what is suggested by the classical picture by Wells, for 50% relative humidity. With increasing ambient relative humidity the extension of the lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to around 150 times for 90% relative humidity, implying more than 2 m advection range of the respiratory droplets within 1 sec. Employing Lagrangian statistics, we demonstrate that the turbulent humid respiratory puff engulfs the small droplets, leading to many orders of magnitude increase in their lifetimes, implying that they can be transported much further during the respiratory events than the large ones. Our findings provide the starting points for larger parameter studies and may be instructive for developing strategies on optimizing ventilation and indoor humidity control. Such strategies are key in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the present autumn and upcoming winter.","Chong, Kai Leong; Ng, Chong Shen; Hori, Naoki; Yang, Rui; Verzicco, Roberto; Lohse, Detlef",Phys Rev Lett,,238

Furthermore, vulnerable populations, such as those served by the Boston Medical Center (BMC), the largest safety net hospital in New England, represent a high-risk group across multiple dimensions, including a higher prevalence of pre-existing conditions and substance use disorders, lower health maintenance, unstable housing, and a propensity for rapid community spread, highlighting the urgent need for expedient and reliable in-house testing. Methods: We developed a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic medium-throughput qRT-PCR assay with rapid turnaround time and utilized this Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified assay for testing nasopharyngeal swab samples from BMC patients, with emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Findings: The in-house testing platform displayed robust accuracy and reliability in validation studies and reduced institutional sample turnaround time from 5-7 days to less than 24 h. Of over 1,000 unique patient samples tested, 44.1% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A survey of prostate-specific antigen test requests during a local outbreak,2021,"PURPOSE: Tracking changes in care utilization of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) services before, during, and after COVID-19-associated changes in policy and service delivery in a mixed rural and micropolitan setting. METHODS: Using a retrospective, open-cohort design, we examined visit data of MOUD patients at a family medicine clinic across three identified periods: pre-COVID, COVID transition, and COVID. Outcome measures include the number and type of visits (in-person or telehealth), the number of new patients entering treatment, and the number of urine drug screens performed. Distance from patient residence to clinic was calculated to assess access to care in rural areas. Goodness-of-Fit Chi-Square tests and ANOVAs were used to identify differences between time periods. FINDINGS: Total MOUD visits increased during COVID (436 pre vs. 581 post, p < 0.001), while overall new patient visits remained constant (33 pre vs. 29 post, p = 0.755). The clinic's overall catchment area increased in size, with new patients coming primarily from rural areas. Length of time between urine drug screens increased (21.1 days pre vs. 43.5 days post, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The patterns of MOUD care utilization during this period demonstrate the effectiveness of telehealth in this area. Policy changes allowing for MOUD to be delivered via telehealth, waiving the need for in-person initiation of MOUD, and increased Medicaid compensation for MOUD may play a valuable role in improving access to MOUD during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Hughes, Phillip M; Verrastro, Genevieve; Fusco, Carriedelle Wilson; Wilson, Courtenay Gilmore; Ostrach, Bayla",J. rural health,,238
247636,Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score Grouping Should Not Be the Primary Determinant of Allocation of Ventilators During a Pandemic,2021,"Because of the uninterrupted spread of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19) with substantial illness and mortality rates, there is an urgent requirement of suitable antiviral agent/therapy to control this pandemic, but not yet established. The primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and host surface receptor protein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), prior to cellular entry. Hence, blocking at the initial stage of virus entry could be a promising strategy/therapy to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many drugs as SARS-CoV-2 blocker have been proposed. Among them, peptide-based antivirals are one. This Viewpoint discusses the potential antiviral role and feasibility of two classes of peptides for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, where (1) a designed peptide (replication of virus binding domain of hACE2), and (2) antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; natural and first line host defense peptide), both may reduce virus load into the host cell by blocking cellular surface receptors and/or disruption of virus cell membrane at the stage of virus entry. These finding may provide a novel antiviral therapy against COVID-19, which might control the current global health crisis.","Maiti, Biplab K",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,,238

This study examined the role of the five factor model of personality traits on leisure time physical activity during the pandemic in a sample (n=168) of 61 year-old Finnish men and women, participating in a larger longitudinal study, between April 2020 and April 2021. Frequency of participation and changes in leisure time physical activity were self-reported. Personality traits and facets were assessed with the 181-item NEO-PI. Openness was the only factor positively associated with leisure time physical activity frequency. Participants scoring higher in extraversion (particularly the activity-facet) and lower in openness to values were more likely to report change in their physical activity. In conclusion, individual differences in traits appear to have played a role in physical activity behavior during the pandemic.","Kekäläinen, Tiia Sipilä Sarianna Saajanaho Milla Kokko Katja",Personality and Individual Differences,,238

These programs have been piloted in city-wide screening in the city of Liverpool and are now being rolled out to support care home visits and the return home of University students for the Christmas break. Here, we present data on the performance of LFDs to test almost 8,000 students at the University of Birmingham between December 2 and December 9, 2020. The performance is validated against almost 800 samples using PCR performed in the University Pillar 2 testing lab and theoretically validated on thousands of Pillar 2 PCR testing results performed on low-prevalence care home testing samples. Our data show that LFDs do not detect infections presenting with PCR Ct values over 29 to 30 as determined using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath asssay. This may be of particular importance in detecting individuals that are either at the early, or late stages of infection, and reinforces the need for frequent, recurrent testing.","Ferguson, Jack; Dunn, Steven; Best, Angus; Mirza, Jeremy; Percival, Benita; Mayhew, Megan; Megram, Oliver; Ashford, Fiona; White, Thomas; Moles-Garcia, Emma; Crawford, Liam; Plant, Tim; Bosworth, Andrew; Kidd, Michael; Richter, Alex; Deeks, Jonathan; McNally, Alan",PLoS Biol,,238
252078,"COVID-19 Infection during Pregnancy: Risk of Vertical Transmission, Fetal, and Neonatal Outcomes",2021,"(1) Background: The impact of the health crisis caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has provoked collateral effects in the attention to pathologies with time-dependent treatments such as strokes. We compare the healthcare activity of two stroke units in the same periods of 2019 and 2020, with an emphasis on what happened during the state of alarm (SA). (2) Materials and methods. Hospitals in the region implemented contingency plans to contain the pandemic; in this planning, the stroke units were not limited in their operational capacity. The SA was declared on 15 March and remained in place for 10 weeks. For the analysis, the data were grouped by consecutive calendar weeks. (3) Results. When the SA was declared the number of calls to the emergency telephone went from 1225 to 3908 calls per week (318% increase). However, the activation of the stroke code went from 6.6 to 5.0 (p = 0.04) and the activity in both stroke units decreased. The largest drop in hospitalizations was for transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) with 35.7% less, 28 vs. 18, (p = 0.05). Reperfusion therapies fell by 37.5%; Poisson regression model 0.64; (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43-0.95). The overall activity of the telestroke suffered a reduction of 28.9%. We also observed an increase in hospital mortality. (4) Conclusion. The excessive duration of the pandemic precludes any hope of resolving this public health crisis in the short or medium term. Further studies should be conducted to better understand the multifactorial nature of this dramatic decline in stroke admissions and its negative impact.","Ramírez-Moreno, José M; Portilla-Cuenca, Juan Carlos; Hariramani-Ramchandani, Roshan; Rebollo, Belen; Bermejo Casado, Inés; Macías-Sedas, Pablo; Ceberino, David; Roa-Montero, Ana M; González-Plata, Alberto; Casado, Ignacio; Fernández de Alarcón, Luis",,,238
252156,Does cystic fibrosis constitute an advantage in COVID-19 infection?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To assess efficacy and safety of favipiravir in adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, multicenter, Phase 3 trial, adults (18-75 years) with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and mild-to-moderate symptoms (including asymptomatic) were randomized 1:1 to oral favipiravir (Day 1: 1800 mg BID; Days 2-14: 800 mg BID) plus standard supportive care versus supportive care alone. The primary endpoint was time to cessation of viral shedding; time to clinical cure also was measured. RESULTS: From May 14-July 3, 2020, 150 patients were randomized to favipiravir (n = 75) or control (n = 75). Median time to cessation of viral shedding was 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 7 days) versus 7 days (95% CI: 5 days, 8 days),P = 0.129, and median time to clinical cure was 3 days (95% CI: 3 days, 4 days) versus 5 days (95% CI: 4 days, 6 days), P = 0.030, for favipiravir and control, respectively. Adverse events were observed in 36% of favipiravir and 8% of control patients. One control patient died due to worsening disease. CONCLUSION: Lack of statistical significance on the primary endpoint was confounded by limitations of the RT-PCR assay. Significant improvement in time to clinical cure suggests favipiravir may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate COVID-19.","Udwadia, Zarir F; Singh, Pawan; Barkate, Hanmant; Patil, Saiprasad; Rangwala, Shabbir; Pendse, Amol; Kadam, Jatin; Wu, Wen; Caracta, Cynthia F; Tandon, Monika",Int. j. infect. dis,,238
252895,Bronchial Artery Embolization Performed in COVID-19 Patients: Tolerance and Outcomes,2020,"PURPOSE: The morbidity and mortality of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia is considerable. We studied the use of whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT) in this patient cohort. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit and requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia were included in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were randomized to 1 Gy whole-lung LDRT or sham irradiation (sham-RT). Treatment group allocation was concealed from patients and intensive care unit clinicians, who treated patients according to the current standard of care. Patients were followed for the primary endpoint of ventilator-free days at day 15 postintervention. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, as well as changes in oxygenation and inflammatory markers. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were randomized to either whole-lung LDRT or sham-RT between November and December 2020. Patients were generally elderly and comorbid, with a median age of 75 years in both arms. No difference in 15-day ventilator-free days was observed between groups (P = 1.00), with a median of 0 days (range, 0-9) in the LDRT arm and 0 days (range, 0-13) in the sham-RT arm. Overall survival at 28 days was identical at 63.6% (95% confidence interval, 40.7%-99.5%) in both arms (P = .69). Apart from a more pronounced reduction in lymphocyte counts after LDRT (P < .01), analyses of secondary endpoints revealed no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-lung LDRT failed to improve clinical outcomes in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia.","Papachristofilou, Alexandros; Finazzi, Tobias; Blum, Andrea; Zehnder, Tatjana; Zellweger, Núria; Lustenberger, Jens; Bauer, Tristan; Dott, Christian; Avcu, Yasar; Kohler, Götz; Zimmermann, Frank; Pargger, Hans; Siegemund, Martin",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,238

255673,Bringing proportional recovery into proportion: Bayesian modelling of post-stroke motor impairment,2020,"Whale-watching is a global tourism industry whose annual revenue exceeds two billion dollars. Australia is a key player in this industry, especially on the east and west coast where humpback whales migrate each year between their breeding and feeding grounds. However, the global whale-watching industry faces uncertainty from changing whale migration patterns, with whales progressively 'arriving' at the traditional whale-watching areas earlier than in previous years/decades. If the whale-watching industry cannot evolve with these changing dynamics then the arrival of the whales might be missed resulting in a potential loss of revenue. This social-ecological issue has suddenly been exacerbated by the disruption to tourism caused by the global pandemic COVID-19. In this study, we use a systems modelling framework, which combines qualitative and quantitative processes, to evaluate the social-ecological system behaviour of the whale-watching industry. We apply this systems approach to the Gold Coast, one of Australia's premier tourist destinations and home to a vibrant whale-watching industry. The outcome of this systems assessment is that the efficacy of the whale-watching industry is affected through determinants of both supply (ability to respond to changes in whale behaviour) and demand (attractiveness of whale-watching). Furthermore, the recovery time of all tourism after COVID-19 will take years if not decades.","Richards, Russell; Meynecke, Jan-Olaf; Sahin, Oz",Sci Total Environ,,238

METHODS: A descriptive study of the implementation of the Via Castellana Medicalised Hotel (VCMH) was conducted. The average monthly household income, educational level and occupational social class of the subjects admitted were obtained through a survey conducted during their stay. RESULTS: There was no guidance for launching; however the hotel was coordinated by a tertiary referral hospital and attended the preventive medicine regulations and the decrees of legal regimes and authorization of health services in Madrid. Between 19 March and the 9 May 2020, 399 patients were admitted; 59% (235) were migrant; the main reason for referral (58%) was a lack of house conditions for quarantining, including overcrowding, which when compared with the migrant status a positive correlation was found. Some other reasons for referral were homelessness and eviction. Most of the survey participants had low monthly household income, educational level and social class.

Numerous cases of COVID-19 have been reported. The confirmed cases of COVID-19 have increased unexpectedly and continuously to 1,051,635 and the confirmed deaths have reached up to 56,985 on April 4, 2020. COVID-19 is a novel disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and there are currently no vaccines or drugs available for its prevent or treatment. The whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in January, 2020 during the spread of COVID-19. A number of researchers are determining the characteristics of this virus in order to develop vaccines, drugs and proper prevention steps with which to attenuate the spread of COVID-19. The present review aimed to discuss the characteristics and prevention strategies of COVID-19. The response from the public health perspective is important to prevent the further escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic through communities. This is based on the characteristics of COVID-19, not only of the virus itself, but also of the infected host, such as the level of illness, symptoms, vulnerable groups (age, sex and health status) and fatality rates. There are several public health interventions which may be used to combat COVID-19, namely, i) social and physical distancing, travel restrictions, self-quarantine and lockdown;ii) personal hygiene and good sanitation, such as the washing of hands, covering of the mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing and spraying disinfectants on surroundings;iii) boosting immunity by the consumption of nutritious food, getting sufficient rest and taking supplements or vitamins;iv) case detection, contact tracing and mass testing;and v) vaccine development. The understanding of COVID-19 characteristics and appropriate prevention strategies may suppress the rapid and extensive spread of COVID-19. © 2020 World Academy of Sciences Journal.

This report summarizes conclusions of an international multidisciplinary consensus group assembled to address evaluation and treatment of patients with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), a group of conditions characterized by extrinsic compression of the neurovascular structures serving the upper extremity. The following recommendations were developed in relation to the three defined types of TOS (neurogenic, venous, and arterial) and three phases of pandemic response (preparatory, urgent with limited resources, and emergency with complete diversion of resources). â¢ In-person evaluation and treatment for neurogenic TOS (interventional or surgical) are generally postponed during all pandemic phases, with telephone/telemedicine visits and at-home physical therapy exercises recommended when feasible. â¢ Venous TOS presenting with acute upper extremity deep venous thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome) is managed primarily with anticoagulation, with percutaneous interventions for venous TOS (thrombolysis) considered in early phases (I and II) and surgical treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve. Catheter-based interventions may also be considered for selected patients with central subclavian vein obstruction and threatened hemodialysis access in all pandemic phases, with definitive surgical treatment postponed. â¢ Evaluation and surgical treatment for arterial TOS should be reserved for limb-threatening situations, such as acute upper extremity ischemia or acute digital embolization, in all phases of pandemic response. In late pandemic phases, surgery should be restricted to thrombolysis or brachial artery thromboembolectomy, with more definitive treatment delayed until pandemic conditions resolve.","Ohman, J Westley; Annest, Stephen J; Azizzadeh, Ali; Burt, Bryan M; Caputo, Francis J; Chan, Colin; Donahue, Dean M; Freischlag, Julie A; Gelabert, Hugh A; Humphries, Misty D; Illig, Karl A; Lee, Jason T; Lum, Ying Wei; Meyer, Richard D; Pearl, Gregory J; Ransom, Erin F; Sanders, Richard J; Teijink, Joep A W; Vaccaro, Patrick S; van Sambeek, Marc R H M; Vemuri, Chandu; Thompson, Robert W",J Vasc Surg,,238

The liver in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To report the results of a survey exploring the experience of patients with SLE facing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) shortage that occurred during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A survey was designed by Lupus Europe's patient advisory network and distributed through its social media, newsflash and members' network. People with lupus were asked about their last HCQ purchases and their level of anxiety (on a 0-10 scale) with regard to not being able to have access to HCQ, once in April 2020 (first wave) and after 11 August (second wave). The results were compared. RESULTS: 2075 patients responded during the first wave; 1001 (48.2%) could get HCQ from the first place they asked, 230 (11.1%) could get the drug by going to more than one pharmacy, 498 (24.0%) obtained HCQ later from their usual pharmacy and 126 (6.1%) from other sources. 188 (9.1%) could not get any; 32 (1.5%) did not respond to this question. All countries showed significant improvement in HCQ availability during the second wave. 562 (27.4%) patients reported an extremely high level of anxiety in wave 1 and 162 (10.3%) patients in wave 2; 589 (28.7%) and 268 (17.1%) patients reported a high level of anxiety in wave 1 and wave 2, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The HCQ shortage had a significant impact on patients with SLE and has been responsible for psychological consequences including anxiety. Indeed, despite an objective improvement in drug availability, the event is leaving significant traces in patients' mind and behaviours.","Cornet, Alain; Andersen, Jeanette; Tani, Chiara; Mosca, Marta",,,238

This impact has been particularly difficult in New York State, which experienced the largest number of COVID-19 cases and led to a state- mandated pause on all elective surgeries. As a result, physical and occupational therapists became the principal providers of care and had to adjust their workflow to ensure quality care. Understanding the perspectives and needs of therapists relative to the circumstances created by COVID-19 is critical to safe and effective care. The goal of this study was to define the perspectives of therapists in New York State regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their work. An email-based 20-question survey was distributed to 250 therapists from all 10 regions of New York State who treated outpatient orthopedic patients during the peak of the pandemic in early April 2020. The survey collected demographic and practice information as well as responses regarding several clinical practice issues. The results provide insight into the concerns of therapists regarding the delivery of care, and responses clarify indications for therapy and for the use of telemedicine to achieve goals during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly impacting the work of therapists worldwide. Therapists responded to this survey expressing concerns about the safe delivery of care, access to personal protective equipment, use of telemedicine, and their role within health care during the pandemic.

The genetic-biasing hypothesis of language evolution postulates that genes and language features coevolve, such that a population that is genetically predisposed to perceiving a particular linguistic feature would tend to adopt that feature in their language. Statistical studies that correlated a large number of genetic variants and linguistic features not only generated this hypothesis but also specifically pinpointed a linkage between ASPM and lexical tone. However, there is currently no direct evidence for this association and, therefore, the hypothesis. In an experimental study, we provide evidence to link ASPM with lexical tone perception in a sample of over 400 speakers of a tone language. In addition to providing the first direct evidence for the genetic-biasing hypothesis, our results have implications for further studies of linguistic anthropology and language disorders.","Wong, Patrick C M; Kang, Xin; Wong, Kay H Y; So, Hon-Cheong; Choy, Kwong Wai; Geng, Xiujuan",Sci.

From the responders, 92.90% and 34.81% were scaled pass and good and above scores for the knowledge about the novel coronavirus epidemic. 38.44% were scaled poor scores and only 5.40% were scaled good and above scores for appropriate behavior coping with the pandemic. Among the responders, 52.14% reported having active physical exercise in various places during the previous 1 week. For all the responders, appropriate behavior coping correlated positively with physical exercise (p < 0.05); the daily consumed time for getting the epidemic-related information correlated positively with the score for cognition on the epidemic's prevention measures (r = 0.111, p < 0.01) and on general knowledge about the epidemic (r = 0.087, p < 0.01). Targeted and multiple measures for guidance on the control of COVID-19 among the public should be promoted to improve the cognition on basic knowledge, behaviors and treatment.","Ma, Caihua; Ma, Lingxin; Helwan, Abdulkader; Ma039,; aitah, Mohammad Khaleel Sallam; Jami, Sayed Abdulla; Mobarak, Siam Al; Das, Niranta Kumar; Haque, Md Ariful",Sci Prog,,238

263618,Concurrent cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis and COVID-19 pneumonia with in vitro immune cell anergy,2021,"PURPOSE: Many institutionalized older people have died during the first wave of COVID-19. Other related consequences have not yet been described objectively. The aim of this study was to compare functional, cognitive, and nutritional status before and after the first wave among nursing home residents, in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Older adults institutionalized in four nursing homes were assessed from May to June 2020, by a geriatric multidisciplinary team in collaboration with the nursing homes staff. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed including functional, cognitive, and nutritional variables before and after the first wave of the pandemic. Data from residents with positive results for microbiological testing for SARS-CoV-2 were compared with those who did not. RESULTS: 435 nursing home residents were included. The median age was 86.77 ± 8.5 years, 78.4% were women. 190 (43.9%) tested positive for coronavirus. Functional decline after the first wave was detected in 20.2% according to the Barthel Index and in 18.5% according to functional ambulation categories, p < 0.001. Cognitive status worsened by 22 and 25.9% according to the global deterioration scale (p < 0.001) and Lobo's Mini-Examen Cognoscitivo (p 0.01), respectively. Onset of depressive symptoms was found in 48% (p < 0.001). The prevalence of malnutrition increased by 36.8 and 38.4% lost weight. When comparing the functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients no clinical or statistically significant differences were found except for the presence of prior malnutrition, higher in the COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: We observed a significative functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in institutionalized elderly after the first wave of COVID-19. These results may be caused by the lockdown itself, since no differences have been found between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. According to these results, interventions are necessary during social isolation or confinement to prevent systemic decline in the elderly.","Pérez-Rodríguez, Patricia; Díaz de Bustamante, Macarena; Aparicio Mollá, Salvador; Arenas, María Caridad; Jiménez-Armero, Susana; Lacosta Esclapez, Pilar; González-Espinoza, Liliana; Bermejo Boixareu, Cristina",,,238

Functionalized bacterial cell surfaces and exopolymers are thought to initiate mineral formation, however, direct evidences are hampered by technical challenges. Here, we present a breakthrough in the use of liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy to observe mineral growth on bacteria and the exopolymers they secrete. Two Escherichia coli mutants producing distinct exopolymers are investigated. We use the incident electron beam to provoke and observe the precipitation of Mn-bearing minerals. Differences in the morphology and distribution of Mn precipitates on the two strains reflect differences in nucleation site density and accessibility. Direct observation under liquid conditions highlights the critical role of bacterial cell surface charges and exopolymer types in metal mineralization. This has strong environmental implications because biofilms structured by exopolymers are widespread in nature and constitute the main form of microbial life on Earth.","Couasnon, Thaïs; Alloyeau, Damien; Ménez, Bénédicte; Guyot, François; Ghigo, Jean-Marc; Gélabert, Alexandre",Sci.

264883,Immunotherapy use outside clinical trial populations: never say never?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease with significant impact on quality of life and presents many challenges to those diagnosed with the condition, due to a seemingly complex daily regimen of self-care which includes medications, monitoring of weight and symptoms, identification of signs of deterioration and follow-up and interaction with multiple healthcare services. Education is vital for understanding the importance of this regimen, and adhering to it. Traditionally, education has been provided to people with heart failure in a face-to-face manner, either in a community or a hospital setting, using paper-based materials or video/DVD presentations. In an age of rapidly-evolving technology and uptake of smartphones and tablet devices, mHealth-based technology (defined by the World Health Organization as mobile and wireless technologies to achieve health objectives) is an innovative way to provide health education which has the benefit of being able to reach people who are unable or unwilling to access traditional heart failure education programmes and services. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and quantify the potential benefits and harms of mHealth-delivered education for people with heart failure. SEARCH METHODS: We performed an extensive search of bibliographic databases and registries (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal), using terms to identify HF, education and mHealth. We searched all databases from their inception to October 2019 and imposed no restriction on language of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies if they were conducted as a randomised controlled trial (RCT), involving adults (&#8805; 18 years) with a diagnosis of HF. We included trials comparing mHealth-delivered education such as internet and web-based education programmes for use on smartphones and tablets (including apps) and other mobile devices, SMS messages and social media-delivered education programmes, versus usual HF care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risks of bias, and extracted data from all included studies. We calculated the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous data and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We include five RCTs (971 participants) of mHealth-delivered education interventions for people with HF in this review. The number of trial participants ranged from 28 to 512 participants. Mean age of participants ranged from 60 years to 75 years, and 63% of participants across the studies were men. Studies originated from Australia, China, Iran, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Most studies included participants with symptomatic HF, NYHA Class II - III. Three studies addressed HF knowledge, revealing that the use of mHealth-delivered education programmes showed no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge compared to usual care (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.40, P = 0.51, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 411 participants; low-quality evidence). One study assessing self-efficacy reported that both study groups had high levels of self-efficacy at baseline and uncertainty in the evidence for the intervention (MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.57 to 1.77; P = 0.31; 1 study, 29 participants; very low-quality evidence).Three studies evaluated HF self-care using different scales. We did not pool the studies due to the heterogenous nature of the outcome measures, and the evidence is uncertain. None of the studies reported adverse events. Four studies examined health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There was uncertainty in the evidence for the use of mHealth-delivered education on HRQoL (MD -0.10, 95% CI -2.35 to 2.15; P = 0.93, I2 = 61%; 4 studies, 942 participants; very low-quality evidence). Three studies reported on HF-related hospitalisation. The use of mHealth-delivered education may result in little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisation (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.06; P = 0.10, I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 894 participants; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the studies due to limitations in study design and execution, heterogeneity, wide confidence intervals and fewer than 500 participants in the analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found that the use of mHealth-delivered educational interventions for people with HF shows no evidence of a difference in HF knowledge; uncertainty in the evidence for self-efficacy, self-care and health-related quality of life; and may result in little to no difference in HF-related hospitalisations. The identification of studies currently underway and those awaiting classification indicate that this is an area of research from which further evidence will emerge in the short and longer term.","Allida, Sabine; Du, Huiyun; Xu, Xiaoyue; Prichard, Roslyn; Chang, Sungwon; Hickman, Louise D; Davidson, Patricia M; Inglis, Sally C",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,238

The gastrointestinal tract is now an appreciated portal of infection. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are inflammatory conditions caused by chronic type 2 (T2) inflammation. However, the effects of the T2 atopic inflammatory milieu on SARS-COV-2 viral entry gene expression in the GI tract is poorly understood. We analyzed tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG) and in normal adult esophagi using publicly available RNA sequencing datasets. Similar to findings evaluating the airway, there was no difference in tissue ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in EoE or EG when compared to control non-EoE/EG esophagus/stomach. ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower in esophagi from children with or without EoE and from adults with EoE as compared to normal adult esophagi. Type 2 immunity and pediatric age could be protective for infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract due to decreased expression of ACE2.","Chiang, Austin W T; Duong, Loan D; Shoda, Tetsuo; Nhu, Quan M; Ruffner, Melanie; Hara, Takeo; Aaron, Bailey; Joplin, Erik; Manresa, Mario; Abonia, J Pablo; Dellon, Evan; Hirano, Ikuo; Gonsalves, Nirmala; Gupta, Sandeep; Furuta, Glenn; Rothenberg, Marc E; Lewis, Nathan E; Muir, Amanda B; Aceves, Seema S",J. pediatr. gastroenterol. nutr,,238

266699,"Recommendations for triage, prioritization and treatment of breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"The appropriate arrangement of myonuclei within skeletal muscle myofibers is of critical importance for normal muscle function, and improper myonuclear localization has been linked to a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, such as centronuclear myopathy and muscular dystrophies. However, the molecules that govern myonuclear positioning remain elusive. Here, we report that skeletal muscle-specific CIP (sk-CIP) is a regulator of nuclear positioning. Genetic deletion of sk-CIP in mice results in misalignment of myonuclei along the myofibers and at specialized structures such as neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions (MTJs) in vivo, impairing myonuclear positioning after muscle regeneration, leading to severe muscle dystrophy in mdx mice, a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. sk-CIP is localized to the centrosome in myoblasts and relocates to the outer nuclear envelope in myotubes upon differentiation. Mechanistically, we found that sk-CIP interacts with the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex and the centriole Microtubule Organizing Center (MTOC) proteins to coordinately modulate myonuclear positioning and alignment. These findings indicate that sk-CIP may function as a muscle-specific anchoring protein to regulate nuclear position in multinucleated muscle cells.","Liu, Jianming; Huang, Zhan-Peng; Nie, Mao; Wang, Gang; Silva, William J; Yang, Qiumei; Freire, Paula P; Hu, Xiaoyun; Chen, Huaqun; Deng, Zhongliang; Pu, William T; Wang, Da-Zhi",Proc.

During July 14-November 30, 2020, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 382 persons incarcerated in Idaho correctional facilities with work-release programs. Work-release programs (which place incarcerated persons in community businesses) have social and economic benefits, but might put participants at increased risk for bidirectional transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC) operates 13 state-run correctional facilities, including six low-security facilities dedicated to work-release programs. This report describes COVID-19 outbreaks in five IDOC facilities with work-release programs,* provides the mitigation strategies that IDOC implemented, and describes the collaborative public health response. As of November 30, 2020, 382 outbreak-related COVID-19 cases were identified among incarcerated persons in five Idaho correctional facilities with work-release programs; two outbreaks were linked to food processing plants. Mitigation strategies that helped to control outbreaks in IDOC facilities with work-release programs included isolation of persons with COVID-19, identification and quarantine of close contacts, mass testing of incarcerated persons and staff members, and temporary suspension of work-release programs. Implementation of public health recommendations for correctional and detention facilities with work-release programs, including mass testing and identification of high-risk work sites, can help mitigate SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.

Family transmission is the most common route of transmission; however, family transmission patterns and outcomes are not well understood. Methods: We enrolled confirmed cases discharged from Wuhan Zhuankou Fangcang Shelter Hospital from February 17, 2020 to March 8, 2020 along with the family members they had contact with, to evaluate baseline characteristics, family transmission patterns and outcomes. The follow-up period lasted until May 8, 2020. Results: This study evaluated 369 participants, which included 100 patients admitted to the shelter hospital and the family members they had contact with. Family transmission occurred in 62% of household, with 190 cases confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. There were eight patterns of family transmission, and spousal transmission (44/83, 53.0%) was the most common pattern, especially in the middle-age generation group (35/83, 42.2%). The homes of the families in which all members were infected had a smaller per capita area than those of other families (29.1 ± 11.89 cm2 vs 41.0 ± 19.70 cm2, respectively, P = 0.037), and the per capita area was negatively associated with the number of infected family members (R = -0.097, P = 0.048). Of the 190 confirmed cases, the 113 mild or moderate cases were monitored in fangcang (including Wuhan Zhuankou Fangcang and other fangcang), and the 59 severe cases were treated at designated hospitals. By the end of follow-up, 185 patients recovered and returned home after completing at least 14 days of isolation at the community quarantine center, four died in hospitals, and one died at home before hospitalization. Interestingly, four patients had positive nucleic acid test results after previous negative results, though none of these patients were re-hospitalized, and none of their close contacts reported an infection. Conclusions: Our data found eight family transmission patterns, of which spousal transmission was the most common. Some patients were also found to have positive test results during follow-up.","Horchinbilig, Urianhkai; Gao, Yanan; Chang, Hong; Xi, Pengfei; Wu, Jinlong; Wang, Jun; Liu, Wei",J Glob Health,,238

The quality of body evidence was evaluated using the modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. RESULTS: Eleven studies involving a total of 2826 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included in the systematic review. We discovered a moderate-to-high quality of evidence that ICI was not associated with a higher mortality risk, while the other outcomes yielded a very low-to-low-evidence quality. Although our findings indicated that ICI did not result in a higher risk of severity and hospitalization, further evidence is required to confirm our findings. In addition, we discovered that prior exposure to chemoimmunotherapy may be linked with a higher risk of COVID-19 severity (OR 8.19 [95% CI: 2.67-25.08]; I2 = 0%), albeit with small sample size. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that ICI treatment should not be adjourned nor terminated during the current pandemic. Rather, COVID-19 vigilance should be increased in such patients. Further studies with larger cohorts and higher quality of evidence are required to substantiate our findings.

270939,Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis During Severe COVID-19 Hospitalizations,2020,"The rapid development and application of different SARS-Cov2 vaccines world-wide has resulted in impressive efficacy and protection from this deadly pandemic. However, the existence of different and continuously developing vaccine candidates coupled with the likelihood of continued application due to both waning immune responses and emergence of viral mutants, means that more basic research regarding their efficacy and continued application are needed. This is particularly true with use of preclinical models involving effects when given during pregnancy. The substantial body of data on the impact of maternal immune activation (MIA) on neurologic development and behavior in the progeny necessitates the need to have all vaccine candidates, particularly when inducing strong toll receptor (TLR) responses, involving these models. Use of other preclinical models involving autoimmunity and allergy coupled with incorporation of human modifying variables of aging and obesity should also be applied to better reflect the heterogeneity of the general population and potential off-target effects that may arise. Additionally, the use of human ACE2 receptor transgenic mouse models can shed insights given the differential tissues expression at different stages in development. However, to foster these types of basic research studies involving different vaccine products, initiatives must first be implemented and supported at the governmental level even while clinical data still accumulates.","Murphy, William J",Brain behav. immun,,238

Since there are limited research available on this issue from India, we have decided to conduct an online survey to evaluate mental health outcome and professional quality of life among healthcare worker during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: - From 25th May to 10th June 2020, a web-based (FRONT-LINE COVID) survey was conducted. Impact of event revised (IES-R), Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Professional Quality of life (ProQOL) and Feeling related questions were administered among Healthcare workers from different departments of hospital. RESULTS: - Among the respondents,218 (52.1%) belongs from the low-risk unit and 200 (47.9%) from the 'high-risk unit' including a higher proportion of nurses 191 (45.7%), female 282(67.5%), aged 31-40 years (48.3%), and married 220 (52.6%). Overall female nurses (P=>0.001), doctors (P=0.02) those were working in an emergency unit (P= <0.001) were at greater risk of psychological distress. Middle-aged (31- 40 years) had a higher level of resilience (p=0.02) contrast to this; working in COVID-19 unit was associated with a lower scale of resilience (p=0.009). Resilience and QoL were an important predictor for psychological distress. CONCLUSION: - Results implicate interventions for stress management and social support among medical staff working in the pandemic.","Nathiya, Deepak; Suman, Supriya; Singh, Pratima; Raj, Preeti; Tomar, Balvir Singh",Ann. med.-psychol,,238

We aimed to evaluate antihypertensive medications and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality, accounting for healthcare-seeking behaviour. METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted including 16 866 COVID-19 cases and 70 137 matched controls from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We evaluated all-cause mortality among COVID-19 cases. Exposures were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (B), calcium-channel blockers (C), thiazide diuretics (D) and other antihypertensive drugs (O). Analyses were adjusted for covariates and consultation frequency. RESULTS: ACEIs were associated with lower odds of COVID-19 diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.88) as were ARBs (AOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80-0.95) with little attenuation from adjustment for consultation frequency. C and D were also associated with lower odds of COVID-19 diagnosis. Increased odds of COVID-19 for B (AOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.26) were attenuated after adjustment for consultation frequency (AOR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95-1.08). Patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs had similar odds of mortality (AOR 1.00, 95% CI 0.83-1.20) to patients treated with classes B, C, D or O or patients receiving no antihypertensive therapy (AOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83-1.18). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that antihypertensive therapy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality; most classes of antihypertensive therapy showed negative associations with COVID-19 diagnosis.","Rezel-Potts, Emma; Douiri, Abdel; Chowienczyk, Phil J; Gulliford, Martin C",,,238

Considering the five environmental vectors of carrier vulnerability, environmental instability of pregnancy and disaster, intensity of disaster-causing factors, disaster prevention and mitigation capacity and emergency prevention and control capacity and its 38 indicators, the correlation coefficient matrix and principal component expressions of each vector are established by principal component analysis, respectively, and the index model of each vector is established on the basis. Then, considering the index models of these five vectors, we established the disaster loss composite index model, which was used to conduct environmental risk assessment and disaster loss composite index analysis of the transmission of COVID-19 in Hubei Province during the period of January 21, 2020 to March 18, 2020. The empirical study showed that: (1) the risk index peaked from January 21 to January 23; (2) the risk index was at a low but volatile level from January 24 to March 14; (3) the risk index rose again slightly from March 15 and rose to another peak on March 16. These fluctuating, smooth and fluctuating processes of the comprehensive index of disaster losses of COVID-19 in Hubei Province are basically stable and consistent with the actual situation of the virus outbreak in the early stage, isolation and prevention and control in the middle stage, and resumption of work and production in the late stage.

275584,CP01.03 COVID 19’s Pandemic’s Effect on a Community Lung Cancer Screening Program,2021,"Noninvasive continuous positive airway pressure (NIV-CPAP) is effective in patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Building evidence during the COVID-19 emergency reported that around 50% of patients in Italy treated with NIV-CPAP avoided the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Standard NIV-CPAP systems operate at high gas flow rates responsible for noise generation and inadequate humidification. Furthermore, open-configuration systems require a high concentration of oxygen to deliver the desired FiO2 . Concerns outlined the risk for aerosolization in the ambient air and the possible pressure drop in hospital supply pipes. A new NIV-CPAP system is proposed that includes automatic control of patient respiratory parameters. The system operates as a closed-loop breathing circuit that can be assembled, combining a sleep apnea machine with existing commercially available components. Analytical simulation of a breathing patient and simulation with a healthy volunteer at different FiO2 were performed. Inspired and expired oxygen fraction and inspired and expired carbon dioxide pressure were recorded at different CPAP levels with different oxygen delivery. Among the main findings, we report (a) a significant (up to 30-fold) reduction in oxygen feeding compared to standard open high flow NIV-CPAP systems, to assure the same FiO2 levels, and (b) a negligible production of the noise generated in ventilatory systems, and consequent minimization of patients' discomfort. The proposed NIV-CPAP circuit, reshaped in closed-loop configuration with the blower outside of the circuit, has the advantages of minimizing aerosol generation, environmental contamination, oxygen consumption, and noise to the patient. The system is easily adaptable and can be implemented using standard CPAP components.","Cavaglià, Marco; Olivieri, Carlo; Morbiducci, Umberto; Raparelli, Terenziano; Jacazio, Giovanni; Ivanov, Alexandre; Chiesa, Alessandro; Savino, Dario; Chiarenza, Sebastiano M; Romiti, Armando; Romiti, Andrea; Ferrara, Marino; Musso, Giuseppe; Audenino, Alberto",Artif. organs,,238

Our objective was to describe the anatomical characteristics of the acromial and coracoid process using computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Descriptive, observational, transversal and retrospective study. A total of 155 CT of patients without shoulder pathology, of both genders, and indistinct age were evaluated and grouped by age: Group 1 < 25 years; group 2 25-40 years; group 3 > 40 years. The following parameters were evaluated: Acromial type (AcT), vertical coracoid distance (VCD), acromial tilt (AT), acromial projection (AP), critical shoulder angle (CSA), type of the subcoracoid outlet (TSO), and the area of the subcoracoid outlet (ASO). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between men and women for VCD (14.44 ± 4.79 vs. 11.76 ± 4.00 mm; p < 0.001) and AP (3.66 ± 4.71 vs. 1.62 ± 4.99 mm; p < 0.05) as well as between age groups 1 and 3 for AT (35.08 ± 11.53 vs. 28.41 ± 6.60; p < 0.05) and ASO (398.99 ± 153.91 vs. 255.56 ± 124.58 mm2; p < 0.001).

Studies evaluating patients with COVID-19 presenting cardiac injury markers show that it is associated with poorer outcomes, and arrhythmic events are not uncommon. Besides, drugs currently used to treat the COVID-19 are known to prolong the QT interval and can have a proarrhythmic propensity.

Methods: The clinical data of one hundred and sixty patients with CRS treated by endoscopic sinus surgery in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from April 2018 to August 2019 were collected prospectively. The visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) scores, self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores, Lund-Kennedy scores of nasal endoscopy and the Lund-Mackay scores of CT before and 6 months after surgery were used to analyse the correlation between the scores of anxiety or depression and the subjective and objective scores of patients before and after operation by grouping and layering. One hundred and one males (63.1%) and 59 females (36.9%) with an average age of 47.3 years (18-75 years) were included. Single-sample, independent or paired t-test, one-way ANOVA and rank-sum test were used for comparison and Pearson correlation analysis was used for the correlation between groups. Results: There was no statistical difference of anxiety or depression between different groups in terms of age, gender and course in the 160 effective patients (t values were -0.151, -0.487, -0.846, all P values>0.05; t values were -0.473, -1.302, -1.069, all P values>0.05). And the degree of preoperative anxiety or depression was positively correlated with the subjective scores, including overall discomfort, nasal obstruction, runny nose and olfactory decline (r values were 0.515, 0.606, 0.424, 0.306, all P values<0.01; r values were: 0.518, 0.584, 0.448, 0.308, all P values<0.01), but not significantly correlated with objective scores of Lund-Mackay and Lund-Kennedy (all P value>0.05). Moreover, as far as the symptoms of overall discomfort, nasal obstruction, headache and runny nose, the results of one-way ANOVA showed that the improvement of symptoms in patients with serious anxiety or depression was worse than that of the normal, mild and moderate patients (all P values<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the scores of Lund-Kennedy 6 months after surgery between them (both P values>0.05). Conclusion: The state of anxiety or depression affects the improvement of symptoms after endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS patients. Compared with the patients with normal and mild to moderate anxiety or depression, the improvement of symptoms in patients with severe anxiety and depression is worse. It is necessary to evaluate the anxiety or depression of the patients with CRS who are going to undergo endoscopic sinus surgery.","Feng, D D; Huang, J J; Ke, X; Liu, J; Shen, Y; Yang, Y C",Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi,,238
279331,A rational approach to manage surgical procedures in COVID Era - A perspective based on experience in a private referral hospital,2020,"Abnormal peripheral and coronary endothelial function has been associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in cross-sectional retrospective and observational studies. However, prognostic value of routine clinical evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of endothelial dysfunction on incident MACE in patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD) remains unknown. Endothelial Function Guided Management in Patients with NOCAD (ENDOFIND) is a multicenter, randomized, patients-blinded, parallel-controlled, two-stage clinical trial evaluating the impact of routine clinical peripheral endothelial function testing on initiation and/or intensification of cardiovascular preventive therapies in Stage I, and on the risk of MACE in Stage II in patients with NOCAD. One thousand participants with NOCAD on clinically indicated coronary computed tomography or invasive angiography will be enrolled and randomized 1:1, after baseline peripheral endothelial function evaluation, to either endothelial function guided treatment group or standard of care control group. In Stage I, patients will be followed for 12â¯months and primary outcome will be the proportion of patients receiving prescriptions for cardiovascular evidence-based lipid, blood pressure and glucose lowering medications at the clinic visit immediately after endothelial function evaluation. Secondary outcomes are change in endothelial function measured as reactive hyperemia index and patients' adherence to evidence-based medications in 12â¯months. Study will be extended into Stage II where sample size and follow up duration will be reevaluated to ensure statistical power, and primary outcome will be incident MACE. ENDOFIND is proof-of-concept clinical trial of a disruptive endothelial function guided clinical intervention with potential benefits to NOCAD patients. CONDENSED ABSTRACT: ENDOFIND is a proof-of-concept clinical trial of a disruptive endothelial function guided clinical intervention with potential benefits to patients with no obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD). It is a multicenter, randomized, patients-blinded, parallel controlled two-stage clinical trial to evaluate the impact of routine clinical peripheral endothelial function testing on initiation and/or intensification of cardiovascular disease preventive therapies in Stage I, and on the risk of MACE in Stage II.","Liu, Huan; Xie, Gaoqiang; Huang, Wei; Liu, Jinbo; Zhao, Na; Corban, Michel T; Lerman, Amir; Wu, Yangfeng; Wang, Hongyu",Int. j. cardiol,,238

Bats are natural reservoirs for a variety of important pathogens that impact human and animal health. Recent reports have highlighted the role of bats and bat flies in the maintenance of Bartonella. Here, we showed that none of the 29 bat DNA blood samples obtained from five bat species in São Luís Island, state of Maranhão, northeastern Brazil, were positive for Bartonella in qPCR assays targeting nuoG. On the other hand, three out of 15 DNA samples (20%) from flies in the family Streblidae were positive for Bartonella. The BLASTn results showed that the gltA and rpoB sequences shared identities ranging from 97.2% to 100%, with Bartonella sequences amplified from bats or bat flies from Costa Rica and Brazil. These findings were supported by phylogenetic analyses based on Bayesian inferences. The present study showed that Bartonella genotypes are present in bat flies, thus shedding some light on the distribution of bat fly-related Bartonella genotypes in South America.","Braga, Maria do Socorro Costa Oliveira; Gonçalves, Luiz Ricardo; Silva, Thiago Merighi Vieira da; Costa, Francisco Borges; Pereira, José Gomes; Santos, Larissa Sarmento Dos; Carvalho Neta, Alcina Vieira de; Arruda, Roberto Carlos Negreiros de; Mesquita, Eric Takashi Kamakura de Carvalho; Chaves, Daniel Prazeres; Melo, Ferdinan Almeida; Lopes, Jady Lima; Martins, Rayra Tayla Barbosa; Lima, Mauricio Souza; Amaral, Renan Bressianini do; Machado, Rosangela Zacarias; André, Marcos Rogério",Rev Bras Parasitol Vet,,238

We performed a cross-sectional bibliometric analysis between 23rd March and 14th April 2020. Three sources of data were used: (1) deaths per number of population for COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from John Hopkins University and Worldometer, (2) publications related to COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 retrieved from World Health Organisation COVID-19 database, and (3) tweets of these publications retrieved from Altmetric.com and Twitter. In the analysis, the number of publications used was 1761, and number of tweets used was 751,068. Mapping of worldwide data illustrated that high Twitter activity was related to high numbers of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 deaths, with tweets inversely weighted with number of publications. Regression models of worldwide data showed a positive correlation between the national deaths per number of population and tweets when holding number of publications constant (coefficient 0.0285, S.E. 0.0003, p < 0.001). Twitter can play a crucial role in the rapid research response during the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially to spread research with prompt public scrutiny.

These infections are associated with the development of a disease known as COVID-19, which is characterized by several symptoms, including persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste or smell, and gastrointestinal distress. COVID-19 has been characterized by elevated mortality (over 100 thousand people have already died in the US alone), mostly due to thromboinflammatory complications that impair lung perfusion and systemic oxygenation in the most severe cases. While the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with the severity of the disease, little is known about the impact of IL-6 levels on the proteome of COVID-19 patients. The present study provides the first proteomics analysis of sera from COVID-19 patients, stratified by circulating levels of IL-6, and correlated to markers of inflammation and renal function. As a function of IL-6 levels, we identified significant dysregulation in serum levels of various coagulation factors, accompanied by increased levels of antifibrinolytic components, including several serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). These were accompanied by up-regulation of the complement cascade and antimicrobial enzymes, especially in subjects with the highest levels of IL-6, which is consistent with an exacerbation of the acute phase response in these subjects. Although our results are observational, they highlight a clear increase in the levels of inhibitory components of the fibrinolytic cascade in severe COVID-19 disease, providing potential clues related to the etiology of coagulopathic complications in COVID-19 and paving the way for potential therapeutic interventions, such as the use of pro-fibrinolytic agents. Raw data for this study are available through ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020601.","D039,; Alessandro, Angelo; Thomas, Tiffany; Dzieciatkowska, Monika; Hill, Ryan C; Francis, Richard O; Hudson, Krystalyn E; Zimring, James C; Hod, Eldad A; Spitalnik, Steven L; Hansen, Kirk C",J Proteome Res,,238

Purpose To investigate patients with primary nonrespiratory symptoms who underwent CT of the abdomen or pelvis or CT of the cervical spine or neck with unsuspected findings highly suspicious for pulmonary COVID-19. Materials and Methods This retrospective study from March 10, 2020, to April 6, 2020, involved three institutions, two in a region considered a hot spot (area of high prevalence) for COVID-19. Patients without known COVID-19 were included who presented to the emergency department (ED) with primary nonrespiratory (gastrointestinal or neurologic) symptoms, had lung parenchymal findings suspicious for COVID-19 at non-chest CT but not concurrent chest CT, and underwent COVID-19 testing in the ED. Group 1 patients had reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results obtained before CT scan reading (COVID-19 suspected on presentation); group 2 had RT-PCR results obtained after CT scans were read (COVID-19 not suspected). Presentation and imaging findings were compared, and outcomes were evaluated. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used for analysis. Results Group 1 comprised 62 patients (31 men, 31 women; mean age, 67 years ±17 [standard deviation]), and group 2 comprised 57 patients (28 men, 29 women; mean age, 63 years ± 16). Cough and fever were more common in group 1 (37 of 62 [60%] and 29 of 62 [47%], respectively) than in group 2 (nine of 57 [16%] and 12 of 57 [21%], respectively), with no significant difference in the remaining symptoms. There were 101 CT scans of the abdomen or pelvis and 18 CT scans of the cervical spine or neck. In group 1, non-chest CT findings provided the initial evidence of COVID-19-related pneumonia in 32 of 62 (52%) patients. In group 2, the evidence was found in 44 of 57 (77%) patients. Overall, the most common CT findings were ground-glass opacity (114 of 119, 96%) and consolidation (47 of 119, 40%). Major interventions (vasopressor medication or intubation) were required for 29 of 119 (24%) patients, and 27 of 119 (23%) died. Patients who underwent CT of the cervical spine or neck had worse outcomes than those who underwent abdominal or pelvic CT (P = .01).

284070,Measuring latency distribution of transcallosal fibers using transcranial magnetic stimulation,2020,"Routine screening CT for the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia is currently not recommended by most radiology societies. However, the number of CTs performed in persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 has increased. We also anticipate that some patients will have incidentally detected findings that could be attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring radiologists to decide whether or not to mention COVID-19 specifically as a differential diagnostic possibility. We aim to provide guidance to radiologists in reporting CT findings potentially attributable to COVID-19 pneumonia, including standardized language to reduce reporting variability when addressing the possibility of COVID-19. When typical or indeterminate features of COVID-19 pneumonia are present in endemic areas as an incidental finding, we recommend contacting the referring providers to discuss the likelihood of viral infection. These incidental findings do not necessarily need to be reported as COVID-19 pneumonia. In this setting, using the term ""viral pneumonia"" can be a reasonable and inclusive alternative. However, if one opts to use the term ""COVID-19"" in the incidental setting, consider the provided standardized reporting language. In addition, practice patterns may vary, and this document is meant to serve as a guide. Consultation with clinical colleagues at each institution is suggested to establish a consensus reporting approach. The goal of this expert consensus is to help radiologists recognize findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and aid their communication with other healthcare providers, assisting management of patients during this pandemic.","Simpson, Scott; Kay, Fernando U; Abbara, Suhny; Bhalla, Sanjeev; Chung, Jonathan H; Chung, Michael; Henry, Travis S; Kanne, Jeffrey P; Kligerman, Seth; Ko, Jane P; Litt, Harold",J Thorac Imaging,,238

DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Embase from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to October 20, 2020, for studies that discussed the chest CT findings in infants younger than 1 year with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 70 COVID-19 (58.5% boys) confirmed infants were included. The mean age of the included patients was 4.1 months with a range of 1 day to 12 months. Chest CT scans showed bilateral abnormalities in 34 patients, and unilateral lung involvement in 25 patients. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (71.43%) were found to be the most prevalent chest CT manifestation, followed by peribronchial thickening (60%), linear or band-shaped opacities (32.8%), consolidation (28.57%), nodule (18.57%), effusion (7.14%) and focal lucency (7.14%). CONCLUSIONS: GGO and peribronchial thickening were the most prevalent findings in the infants' chest CT scans. Linear or band-shaped opacities, consolidation, and pulmonary nodules are more common in infants than in adults. These findings suggest that the disease is more likely to be presented as an atypical pneumonia (peribronchial thickening and linear or band-shaped opacities) in this age group. Other chest CT scan manifestations can be classified as typical COVID-19 infection (peripheral GGO), lobar pneumonia (consolidation) and opportunistic infections (pulmonary nodules).","Ghodsi, Alireza; Bijari, Moniba; Alamdaran, Seyed Ali; Saberi, Amin; Mahmoudabadi, Elnaz; Balali, Mohammad Reza; Ghahremani, Sara",World j. pediatr,,238

However, limited information is available about HMs genes in grapes (Vitis vinifera L.). RESULTS: Here, we described detailed genome-wide identification of HMs gene families in grapevine. We identified 117 HMs genes in grapevine and classified these genes into 11 subfamilies based on conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis. We described the genes in terms of their chromosomal locations and exon-intron distribution. Further, we investigated the evolutionary history, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and syntenic relationships between grapes and Arabidopsis. According to results 21% HMs genes are the result of duplication (tandem and segmental) events and all the duplicated genes have negative mode of selection. GO analysis predicted the presence of HMs proteins in cytoplasm, nucleus, and intracellular organelles. According to seed development expression profiling, many HMs grapevine genes were differentially expressed in seeded and seedless cultivars, suggesting their roles in seed development. Moreover, we checked the response of HMs genes against powdery mildew infection at different time points. Results have suggested the involvement of some genes in disease resistance regulation mechanism. Furthermore, the expression profiles of HMs genes were analyzed in response to different plant hormones (Abscisic acid, Jasmonic acid, Salicylic acid, and Ethylene) at different time points. All of the genes showed differential expression against one or more hormones. CONCLUSION: VvHMs genes might have potential roles in grapevine including seed development, disease resistance, and hormonal signaling pathways. Our study provides first detailed genome-wide identification and expression profiling of HMs genes in grapevine.","Wang, Li; Ahmad, Bilal; Liang, Chen; Shi, Xiaoxin; Sun, Ruyi; Zhang, Songlin; Du, Guoqiang",BMC Plant Biol,,238

We apply this model to investigate the effects of various transportation networks on the heterogeneous propagation of COVID-19 in China. We further apply it to predict the development of COVID-19 in China in two scenarios, i.e., i) assuming that different types of traffic restriction policies are conducted and ii) assuming that the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak is in Beijing, so as to illustrate the potential usage of the model in generating various policy insights to help the containment of the further spread of COVID-19. We find that the most effective way to prevent the coronavirus from spreading quickly and extensively is to control the routes linked to the epicenter at the beginning of the pandemic. But if the virus has been widely spread, setting restrictions on hub cities would be much more efficient than imposing the same travel ban across the whole country.

Here, we introduce ""weighted-nearest neighbor"" analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of cellular identity.","Hao, Yuhan; Hao, Stephanie; Andersen-Nissen, Erica; Mauck, William M; Zheng, Shiwei; Butler, Andrew; Lee, Maddie J; Wilk, Aaron J; Darby, Charlotte; Zager, Michael; Hoffman, Paul; Stoeckius, Marlon; Papalexi, Efthymia; Mimitou, Eleni P; Jain, Jaison; Srivastava, Avi; Stuart, Tim; Fleming, Lamar M; Yeung, Bertrand; Rogers, Angela J; McElrath, Juliana M; Blish, Catherine A; Gottardo, Raphael; Smibert, Peter; Satija, Rahul",Cell,,238

290315,The Impact of COVID-19 on Cancer Care in the Post Pandemic World: Five Major Lessons Learnt from Challenges and Countermeasures of Major Asian Cancer Centres,2021,"Social distancing was planned as a preventive measure to control the extensive spread of COVID-19. COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil were analyzed during the period of social distancing measures. Mortality data for COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Deaths were estimated up to the 31st day after the occurrence of the 5th COVID-19-related death in Brazil. Social distance was measured using Google's community mobility reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). The Brazilian epidemic curves were interconnected, and mathematical models were evaluated to fit the mortality estimation curves. The optimistic model was defined in the opening period of social distancing and, therefore, in the lower mobility (40-60%). The realistic model was calculated according to relaxed social distance measures (<40%) and the pessimistic model was calculated based on the transmission rate between 2-3. Thus, the equations of the mathematical models provided the outcomes for the date of June 9, 2020, as follows: realistic model with 40,623 deaths, pessimistic model with 64,310 deaths and the optimistic model with a projection of 31,384 deaths. As a result of these analyzes, on May 24, 2020, there were a total of 22,965 deaths related to COVID-19, and those deaths included within the proposed mathematical models were 17,452 for the optimistic model, 22,623 for the realistic model and 32,825 for the pessimistic model. Thus, it is concluded that social distancing measures promoted by the Brazilian public managers contributes to the reduction in approximately ten thousand deaths related to COVID-19 in the current pandemic scenario.","Valenti, Vitor E; Menezes, Pedro de Lemos; Abreu, Ana Carolina Gonçalves de; Vieira, Gustavo Nakamura Alves; Garner, David M",J.

As we write, infection rates are at their highest point globally and are rising extremely rapidly in some areas due to more infectious variants. The primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Recent sequence analyses of the ACE2 gene predict that many nonhuman primates are also likely to be highly susceptible to infection. However, the anticipated risk is not equal across the Order. Furthermore, some taxonomic groups show high ACE2 amino acid conservation, while others exhibit high variability at this locus. As an example of the latter, analyses of strepsirrhine primate ACE2 sequences to date indicate large variation among lemurs and lorises compared to other primate clades despite low sampling effort. Here, we report ACE2 gene and protein sequences for 71 individual strepsirrhines, spanning 51 species and 19 genera. Our study reinforces previous results while finding additional variability in other strepsirrhine species, and suggests several clades of lemurs have high potential susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Troublingly, some species, including the rare and endangered aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), as well as those in the genera Avahi and Propithecus, may be at high risk. Given that lemurs are endemic to Madagascar and among the primates at highest risk of extinction globally, further understanding of the potential threat of COVID-19 to their health should be a conservation priority. All feasible actions should be taken to limit their exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Melin, Amanda D; Orkin, Joseph D; Janiak, Mareike C; Valenzuela, Alejandro; Kuderna, Lukas; Marrone, Frank; Ramangason, Hasinala; Horvath, Julie E; Roos, Christian; Kitchener, Andrew C; Khor, Chiea Chuen; Lim, Weng Khong; Lee, Jessica G H; Tan, Patrick; Umapathy, Govindhaswamy; Raveendran, Muthuswamy; Alan Harris, R; Gut, Ivo; Gut, Marta; Lizano, Esther; Nadler, Tilo; Zinner, Dietmar; Le, Minh D; Manu, Sivakumara; Rabarivola, Clément J; Zaramody, Alphonse; Andriaholinirina, Nicole; Johnson, Steig E; Jarvis, Erich D; Fedrigo, Olivier; Wu, Dongdong; Zhang, Guojie; Farh, Kyle Kai-How; Rogers, Jeffrey; Marques-Bonet, Tomas; Navarro, Arcadi; Juan, David; Arora, Paramjit S; Higham, James P",Am J Primatol,,238

Such a vaccine would need to rapidly confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using components suitable for scale up. Here, we developed an Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine candidate, repRNA-CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The RNA replicons were formulated with lipid inorganic nanoparticles (LIONs) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery, and immunogenicity. We show that a single intramuscular injection of the LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 T helper cell response. A prime/boost regimen induced potent T cell responses in mice including antigen-specific responses in the lung and spleen. Prime-only immunization of aged (17 months old) mice induced smaller immune responses compared to young mice, but this difference was abrogated by booster immunization. In nonhuman primates, prime-only immunization in one intramuscular injection site or prime/boost immunizations in five intramuscular injection sites elicited modest T cell responses and robust antibody responses. The antibody responses persisted for at least 70 days and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those in human serum samples collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Erasmus, Jesse H; Khandhar, Amit P; O039,; Connor, Megan A; Walls, Alexandra C; Hemann, Emily A; Murapa, Patience; Archer, Jacob; Leventhal, Shanna; Fuller, James T; Lewis, Thomas B; Draves, Kevin E; Randall, Samantha; Guerriero, Kathryn A; Duthie, Malcolm S; Carter, Darrick; Reed, Steven G; Hawman, David W; Feldmann, Heinz; Gale, Michael; Veesler, David; Berglund, Peter; Fuller, Deborah Heydenburg",Sci. transl. med,,238

Design/methodology/approach: Derived from a sample of 607 unemployed and furloughed hospitality workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, the data for this research are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: This study reveals that unemployed and furloughed hospitality workers are financially strained, depressed, socially isolated and panic-stricken due to the pandemic’s effects. These effects lead to impaired well-being and an increased intention to leave the hospitality industry. Female and younger employees are impacted to a greater extent, while furloughed workers received fewer impacts compared to their laid-off compatriots. Research limitations/implications: This study suggests that lockdown restrictions need to be implemented more deliberately, and the psychological well-being of the hospitality workforce deserves more immediate and continuing attention. It advises that hospitality businesses consider furloughs over layoffs when workforce reduction measures are necessary to combat the financial crisis. Originality/value: This study adds to the current literature by examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from the employee perspective.

Although the impact of COVID-19 on African populations has been relatively light, it is feared that redirecting focus and prioritization of health systems to fight COVID-19 may have an impact on access to non-COVID-19 diseases. We applied age-based COVID-19 mortality data from China to the population structures of Uganda and non-African countries with previously established outbreaks, comparing theoretical mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. We then predicted the impact of possible scenarios of the COVID-19 public health response on morbidity and mortality for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and maternal health in Uganda. Based on population age structure alone, Uganda is predicted to have a relatively low COVID-19 burden compared with an equivalent transmission in comparison countries, with 12% of the mortality and 19% of the lost DALYs predicted for an equivalent transmission in Italy. By contrast, scenarios of the impact of the public health response on malaria and HIV/AIDS predict additional disease burdens outweighing that predicted from extensive SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Emerging disease data from Uganda suggest that such deterioration may already be occurring. The results predict a relatively low COVID-19 impact on Uganda associated with its young population, with a high risk of negative impact on non-COVID-19 disease burden from a prolonged lockdown response. This may reverse hard-won gains in addressing fundamental vulnerabilities in women and children's health, and underlines the importance of tailoring COVID-19 responses according to population structure and local disease vulnerabilities.","Bell, David; Hansen, Kristian Schultz; Kiragga, Agnes N; Kambugu, Andrew; Kissa, John; Mbonye, Anthony K",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,238

With the fast-response experimental efforts, the crystal structures of Mpro of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have just become available recently. Herein, we theoretically investigated the mechanism of binding between the Mpro's pocket and various marketed drug molecules being tested in clinics to fight COVID-19 that show promising outcomes. By combining the existing experimental results with our computational ones, we revealed an important ligand binding mechanism of the Mpro, demonstrating that the binding stability of a ligand inside the Mpro pocket can be significantly improved if part of the ligand occupies its so-called ""anchor"" site. Along with the highly potent drugs and/or molecules (such as nelfinavir) revealed in this study, the newly discovered binding mechanism paves the way for further optimizations and designs of Mpro's inhibitors with a high binding affinity.","Huynh, Tien; Wang, Haoran; Luan, Binquan",J Phys Chem Lett,,238

294295,Lithium chloride combination with rapamycin for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Bushen Huoxue prescription is a traditional Chinese medicine formula treating diabetic retinopathy, which was developed by our research group. Catalpol, puerarin, salvianolic acid B, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rb1 and ginsenoside Rd are six of main effective components, which could be partly representative of this prescription. The corona charged aerosol detector (corona CAD) is one kind of universal detectors equipped with the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The CAD has many advantages for the analysis of complex mixtures, but too few applications in traditional Chinese medicine compounds. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to establish a method for the determination of six components in Bushen Huoxue prescription, and to increase the use of the CAD in traditional Chinese medicine compounds. METHODS: HPLC-CAD analysis was performed on an Inertsil ODS-SP (4.6â¯mmâ¯×â¯250â¯mm, 5â¯µm) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.5 % formic acid solution(A)-acetonitrile(B) at a flow rate of 1â¯mL/min (0-7â¯min, 1 % B; 7-12â¯min, 1 %-12 % B; 12-22â¯min, 12 %-19 % B; 22-40â¯min, 19 %-28 % B; 40-43â¯min, 28 %-33 % B; 43-50â¯min, 33 % B; 50-65â¯min, 33 %-42 % B). The column temperature maintained at 30 â, the injection volume was 20â¯µL, the atomization temperature mode was LOW, the filtration constant (filter) was 3.6 and data collection rate was 10â¯Hz. The methodology was examined and the linearity of regression of different functions was compared. Sixteen batches of samples were prepared and their contents were determined. RESULTS: The six compounds showed a better linearity (R2 > 0.9990) in their concentration ranges when using the linear function. The average recoveries were 99.18 %-101.30 %. Although the RSD value of puerarin and ginsenoside Rg1 was slightly out of 3 % during the average recovery investigation, all the other methodological investigations of the six components were within 3 %. The precision, stability and repeatability of the method were good. In sixteen batches of Bushen Huoxue prescription samples, the contents of six components were 0.3138 %-0.6042 % for catalpol, 0.8095 %-1.2917 % for puerarin, 0.7416 %-1.1189 % for salvianolic acid B, 0.0231 %-0.0418 % for ginsenoside Rg1, 0.0702 %-0.1724 % for ginsenoside Rb1, 0.0384 %-0.1196 % for ginsenoside Rd. CONCLUSION: In this experiment, a method for the determination of six components in Bushen Huoxue prescription based on HPLC-CAD was established with high accuracy, good repeatability and simple operation, and it can provide references for the improvement of quality standard of the Bushen Huoxue prescription. It is reasonable and accessible for the CAD application in the determination of traditional Chinese medicine compound prescriptions.","Xie, Mengjun; Yu, Yueting; Zhu, Ziyu; Deng, Liping; Ren, Bo; Zhang, Mei",J Pharm Biomed Anal,,238

However, options for chronic vascular access for haemodialysis - an essential part of kidney replacement therapy - have remained unchanged for decades. The high morbidity and mortality associated with current vascular access complications highlights an unmet clinical need for novel techniques in vascular access and is driving innovation in vascular access care. The development of devices, biological approaches and novel access techniques has led to new approaches to controlling fistula geometry and manipulating the underlying cellular and molecular pathways of the vascular endothelium, and influencing fistula maturation and formation through the use of external mechanical methods. Innovations in arteriovenous graft materials range from small modifications to the graft lumen to the creation of completely novel bioengineered grafts. Steps have even been taken to create new devices for the treatment of patients with central vein stenosis. However, these emerging therapies face difficult hurdles, and truly creative approaches to vascular access need resources that include well-designed clinical trials, frequent interaction with regulators, interventionalist education and sufficient funding. In addition, the heterogeneity of patients with kidney failure suggests it is unlikely that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach for effective vascular access will be feasible in the current environment.","Lawson, Jeffrey H; Niklason, Laura E; Roy-Chaudhury, Prabir",Nature reviews.

297781,Pharmacological Predictors of Morbidity and Mortality in COVID-19,2021,"We aimed to evaluate the LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay (DiaSorin), comparing its performance to real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 182 (110 PCR-positive and 72 PCR-negative) nasopharyngeal swab samples were taken for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. RT-PCR and antigen assay were performed using the same material. The sensitivity and specificity of the antigen assay were calculated for different cut-offs, with RT-PCR serving as the reference method. Stored clinical samples that were positive for other respiratory viruses were tested to evaluate cross-reactivity. One third (33/110, 30%) were falsely classified as negative, while no false positives were found using the 200 TCID₅₀/mL cut-off for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen as proposed by the manufacturer. This corresponded to a sensitivity of 70% (60–78%) and a specificity of 100% (94–100%). Lowering the cut-off for positivity of the antigen assay to 22.79 or 57.68 TCID₅₀/mL increased the sensitivity of the method, reaching a sensitivity of 92% (85–96%) vs. 79% (70–86%) and a specificity of 81% (69–89%) vs. 99% (91–100%), respectively. The antigen assay reliably detected samples with high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads (≥106 copies SARS-CoV-2/mL), while it cannot differentiate between negative and low positive samples. Cross-reactivity toward other respiratory viruses was not detected.","Fiedler, Melanie Holtkamp Caroline Dittmer Ulf Anastasiou Olympia E.",Pathogens,,238

297870,Baricitinib: From Rheumatoid Arthritis to COVID-19,2021,"The economic crisis spurred by the Corona virus (COVID-19) confronts central banks worldwide with new kinds of challenges, as in many countries a stop in production and sales due to lock downs meets enormous fiscal and monetary impulses to overcome the crisis. In Europe the situation is more than ever complicated, as a multitude of monetary policy emergency measures implemented during the financial and European debt crisis of 2007 to 2012 are still in place, such as negative interest rates and central bank bond buying programs. Especially the bond buying programs have been intensified once more during the current Corona crisis. This article contributes to the existing knowledge by proposing a new theoretic trilemma model for the case of a monetary union. Accordingly, there exists a trade-off between stabilizing a monetary union, maintaining free capital mobility and reducing expansionary monetary policy. The results underscore the importance of resolving the trilemma without jeopardizing the currency and financial stability. © 2021","Lang, S.; Schadner, W.",Finance Research Letters,,238

298202,Is myopathy part of long-Covid?,2021,"In March 2020, WHO declared a pandemic state due to SARS-CoV-2 having spread. TaqMan-based real-time RT-qPCR is currently the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, it is a high-cost assay, inaccessible for the majority of laboratories around the world, making it difficult to diagnose on a large scale. The objective of this study was to standardize lower cost molecular methods for SARS-CoV-2 identification. E gene primers previously determined for TaqMan assays by Colman et al. (2020) were adapted in SYBR Green assay and RT-PCR conventional. The cross-reactivity test was performed with 17 positive samples for other respiratory viruses, and the sensibility test was performed with 8 dilutions (10 based) of SARS-CoV-2 isolated and 63 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. The SYBR Green assays and conventional RT-PCR have not shown amplification of the 17 respiratory samples positives for other viruses. The SYBR Green-based assay was able to detect all 8 dilutions of the isolate. The conventional PCR detected until 107 dilution, both assays detected the majority of the 63 samples, 98.42% of positivity in SYBR Green, and 93% in conventional PCR. The average Ct variation between SYBR Green and TaqMan was 1.92 and the highest Ct detected by conventional PCR was 35.98. Both of the proposed assays are less sensitive than the current gold standard; however, our data shows a low sensibility variation, suggesting that these methods could be used by laboratories as a lower cost molecular method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.","Dorlass, Erick Gustavo; Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira; Viana, Amanda Oliveira; Soares, Camila Pereira; Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna; Thomazelli, Luciano Matsumiya; Araujo, Danielle Bastos; Leal, Fabyano Bruno; Candido, Erika Donizette; Telezynski, Bruna Larotonda; Valério, Camila Araujo; Chalup, Vanessa Nascimento; Mello, Ralyria; Almeida, Flavia Jaqueline; Aguiar, Andressa Simões; Barrientos, Anna Carlotta Mott; Sucupira, Carolina; De Paulis, Milena; Sáfadi, Marco Aurélio Palazzi; Silva, Daniella Gregorio Bonfim Prado; Sodré, Janaina Joice Martins; Soledade, Mariana Pereira; Matos, Samantha Faria; Ferreira, Sabrina Rodrigues; Pinez, Célia Miranda Nunez; Buonafine, Carolina Palamin; Pieroni, Leticia Nery Ferreira; Malta, Fernanda Mello; Santana, Rubia Anita Ferraz; Souza, Eloisa Corrêa; Fock, Ricardo Ambrosio; Pinho, João Renato Rebelo; Ferreira, Luís Carlos Souza; Botosso, Viviane Fongaro; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal",Braz J Microbiol,,238

A case study was carried out in Savar Upazila, a sub-district of the capital city Dhaka in Bangladesh, which is traversed by a prominent national highway (Dhaka- Aricha-N5) that also passes the concentric industrial export processing zone surrounding Dhaka. This municipality is thus part of a high-density transport network with extensive economic activities. COVID-19 data were collected from local records at the Upazila Health Complex, while spatial data of the Savar Upazila, including the pertinent road network, were identified and digitized using geographical information systems software. The presence of COVID-19 in in Savar Upazila was found to be strongly associated with the reach and mechanism of transport networks (Pearson correlation = 0.76 with 99% confidence interval).","Mahmud, Khandakar Hasan; Hafsa, Bibi; Ahmed, Raju",Geospatial Health (Testo stamp.),,238

Malnutrition has long been associated with poor outcomes among patients with pneumonia. This may be due to the increased risk of malnourished patients to develop impaired muscle and respiratory function. We aimed to determine the outcomes of adult COVID 19 patients admitted in a tertiary government hospital accordingly to nutrition status and risk. METHODS: Retrospective study on the adult COVID 19 patients admitted from July 15 to September 15, 2020 who were screened using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade tool. Chi-square or Fisher exact test, as well as Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn test, as appropriate were done. Survival analysis for mortality was done with right-censored data length of initial admission in days. Cox proportional hazard regression was done to determine the association of the main variables of interest with mortality with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Malnourished patients were 30% less likely to be discharged [HR 0.70 95% CI (0.50, 0.97)]; malnutrition was also associated with length of hospital stay as those who were malnourished had longer lengths of hospital stay of about 4 days on the average [HR 3.55 95% CI (0.83, 6.27)]. High nutrition risk was significantly associated with length of hospital stay [HR 4.36 95% CI (0.89, 7.83)]. CONCLUSION: The only risk factor for mortality shown in this study is ICU transfer. Malnutrition, moderate nutrition risk, and high nutrition risk were risk factors of having longer lengths of hospital stays. While only malnutrition was the risk factor for being less likely to be discharged. We reiterate that nutrition assessment and support are important in mitigating the effects of COVID 19.","Larrazabal, Ramon B; Chiu, Harold Henrison C; Palileo-Villanueva, Lia Aileen M",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,238

We sought to characterize the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on this group to understand how the pandemic has affected this group, this group's public health response to COVID-19, and whether there were differences by race/ethnicity. METHODS: This study recruited its sample from a drug treatment setting in the northeast region of the United States. We surveyed 110 individuals on methadone as treatment for OUD and assessed COVID-19-related impacts on their health behaviors and other indices of social, physical, and mental well-being, including sexual health behaviors, substance use, mental health status, health care access, income, and employment. RESULTS: Our findings highlight overall increases in depression, anxiety, loneliness, and frustration among the sample of people with OUD; the study also observed decreases in financial stability. Significant differences between groups indicated a greater financial burden among racial-ethnic minorities; this subgroup also reported greater direct adverse effects of COVID-19, including being more concerned about contracting COVID-19, not being able to get a COVID-19 test, and knowing someone who had died from COVID-19. A greater proportion of Whites indicated increases in alcohol consumption and non-prescription drug use than did racial-ethnic minorities. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment providers must be vigilant in managing direct and indirect outcomes of COVID-19 among people with OUD. Findings highlight the need to develop culturally competent, differentiated interventions in partnership with community-based organizations to meet the unique challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic presents for people in treatment for OUD.","Mistler, Colleen B; Sullivan, Matthew C; Copenhaver, Michael M; Meyer, Jaimie P; Roth, Alexis M; Shenoi, Sheela V; Edelman, E Jennifer; Wickersham, Jeffrey A; Shrestha, Roman",J Subst Abuse Treat,,238

302454,Undocumented U.S. Immigrants and Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data on the health and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: We conducted a rapid telephone survey from April-June 2020 among participants of the community-based AIDS Linked to the IntraVenous Experience (ALIVE) cohort study in Baltimore, Maryland. This interviewer-administered survey collected information on COVID-19 knowledge, symptoms, testing, diagnosis, and prevention behaviors, recent substance use, housing conditions, interruptions to healthcare, access to harm reduction and drug treatment, mental health, and social support. RESULTS: Of 443 current and former PWID who participated in the survey, 36 % were female, 85 % were Black, 33 % were living with HIV and 50 % reported any substance use in the prior six months. COVID-19 awareness was high, but knowledge of symptoms and routes of transmission were lower. PWID reporting recent substance use were less likely to always socially distance (63 % vs. 74 % among those without recent use, p = 0.02), and Black PWID were more likely than non-Black to socially distance (73 % vs. 48 %, p < 0.0001) and use when alone (68 % vs.35 %, p < 0.01). Only 6% reported difficulty accessing healthcare, yet only 48 % of those on opioid-agonist treatment had a four-week supply available. While 34 % reported increased depressive symptoms, participants reported high levels of social support. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid assessment highlighted that PWID currently using drugs may be less able to practice social distancing and increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur. Ongoing monitoring of substance use and mental health, as well as overdose prevention is necessary as the pandemic and public health responses continue.","Genberg, Becky L; Astemborski, Jacquie; Piggott, Damani A; Woodson-Adu, Tanita; Kirk, Gregory D; Mehta, Shruti H",Drug Alcohol Depend,,238

303085,Advances in immunotherapy for COVID-19: A comprehensive review,2021,"Long tail theory, the notion that the future of retailing could involve shifting product assortments to offer more product variety to precisely serve the unique needs of individual customers, has largely been proven true in the context of online distribution. However, it has been implicitly assumed that this theory does not apply to brick-and-mortar selling situations due to higher supply side inventory costs and higher demand side consumer search costs. Academics and practitioners alike have thus advocated for the use of Pareto rules to make category assortment planning decisions about product inventory breadth and depth in the brick-and-mortar channel. This research directly challenges this received wisdom by noting that the widespread prevalence and use of mobile technology is causing information flows to speed up for consumers even while performing traditional shopping tasks. Such information flows should theoretically favor the strategic importance of niche products in the long tail of the sales distribution. A large-scale empirical analysis of consumer packaged goods brick-and-mortar retailing data indicates that this alternative prediction is indeed true. This research contributes to a larger body of research as well that has documented how major environmental forces are shifting the nature of retail strategy, particularly in the brick-and-mortar channel.","Hoskins, Jake D.",J.

304577,Clinical characteristics of the first known cases of death caused by COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"Inflammation response is a defense to infection induced by invading pathogen or tissue injury. However, exaggerated inflammation may cause autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-inflammatory agents and anti-cytokine therapy have been developed to inhibit inflammation pathways and neutralize cytokine storm, but the off-targeting delivery and damage in immune system cause systemic severe side-effect. Selective targeting, precise intracellular drug delivery and induced programed apoptosis of neutrophils may be a potential strategy to regulate the inflammatory responses for immune homeostasis. In this commentary, we summarized that the assembled engineering prodrug nanoparticles carrying doxorubicin via pH-responsive bonds that specifically target to and efficiently induce the apoptosis of activated neutrophils for anti-inflammation with high therapeutic efficacy and no systemically toxicity could be a promising strategy for neutrophil-mediated diseases.","Shi, Jinping; Li, Juan",FASEB j,,238

Every day there is criticism about lack of evidence on traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM). But is this narrative evidence-based? Are we really missing research about TCIM? Or are we just not looking correctly at the evidence? Evidence maps are a useful method with the dual function of synthesizing available evidence on a specific topic and identifying knowledge gaps. This article presents a six-step evidence map methodology along with recently published TCIM evidence maps, including one related to COVID-19. TCIM evidence maps are useful instruments to inform decision-making for policymakers, health practitioners, and patients.","Schveitzer, Mariana Cabral; Abdala, Carmen Verônica Mendes; Portella, Caio Fabio Schlechta; Ghelman, Ricardo",Rev. panam. salud pública,,238

306224,COVID-19 Testing,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound global effect. Its rapid transmissibility has forced whole countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. As part of necessary pandemic planning, most Canadian cardiac surgical programs have prioritized and delayed elective procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the health care system and to mobilize resources in the event of a pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, new cases have begun to decline in many jurisdictions. This ""flattening of the curve"" has inevitably prompted discussions around reopening of the economy, relaxing some public health restrictions, and resuming nonurgent health care delivery. This document provides a template for cardiac surgical programs to begin to ramp-up the delivery of cardiac surgery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease that is guided by 3 principles. First, all recommendations from public health authorities regarding COVID-19 containment must continue to be followed to minimize disease spread, ensure patient safety, and protect health care personnel. Second, patients awaiting elective cardiac surgery need to be proactively managed, reprioritizing those with high-risk anatomy or whose clinical status is deteriorating. Finally, case volumes should be steadily increased in a mutually agreed upon fashion and must balance the clinical needs of patients awaiting surgery against the overall requirements of the health care system.","Hassan, Ansar; Arora, Rakesh C; Lother, Sylvain A; Adams, Corey; Bouchard, Denis; Cook, Richard; Gunning, Derek; Lamarche, Yoan; Malas, Tarek; Moon, Michael; Ouzounian, Maral; Rao, Vivek; Rubens, Fraser; Tremblay, Philippe; Whitlock, Richard; Moss, Emmanuel; Légaré, Jean-François",Can J Cardiol,,238

Therefore, we developed the 2020 International Web-Based Neurosurgery Congress (2020 IWBNC), which became the first successful virtual neurosurgical congress. The aim of this article was to describe the experience designing and organizing a web congress by the 2020 IWBNC method. METHODS: The 2020 IWBNC was organized by the Center for Research and Training in Neurosurgery (Centro de Investigación y Entrenamiento en Neurocirugía [CIEN]) in a record time of 4 weeks. Eight committees were created and assigned a specific task. The event followed a strict protocol based on the double-room method, which consisted of 2 virtual rooms (A and B) hosted from 4 different physical locations to avoid lecture overlapping and connection drops. Quality and impact were measured by a videoconferencing platform and social media parameters as well as an audience perception survey. RESULTS: High quality was achieved in academic standards, worldwide assistance, schedule adherence, and security. The 2020 IWBNC hosted 25 internationally renowned speakers and offered 30 top-of-the-line multidisciplinary conferences. There were 3096 participants from 125 countries, and 22,266 live-stream views were registered. No technical or cybersecurity-related issues occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based academic meetings will continue to be a helpful educational tool for continuing medical education and continuing professional development. The 2020 IWBNC double-room method represents an alternative design that may be replicated by the academic community planning web congresses and similar events.","Ruiz-Barrera, Miguel A; Agudelo-Arrieta, Mariana; Aponte-Caballero, Rafael; Gutierrez-Gomez, Santiago; Ruiz-Cardozo, Miguel Angel; Madrinan-Navia, Humberto; Vergara-Garcia, David; Riveros-Castillo, William M; Saavedra, Javier M",World neurosurgery (Online),,238

METHODS: It was a comparative cross sectional study, conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Al- Imam University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 30, 2020. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect the data from students and staff about conventional teaching, online teaching, conventional examination and online examination. It was in the form of 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 5-strongly agree, to 1-strongly disagree, in addition to age and gender. The results of conventional and online examination were recorded. RESULTS: The total sample reached 230 students and 20 staff. Mean scores for conventional teaching and examination were significantly higher than online. The mean values for grades of online final examination was significantly higher than those of midterm conventional examination. Most of the statements related to conventional teaching and examination attained a good response where students and their staff conveyed a negative perception pertinent to online examination. Students and staff showed a higher percentage of agreement in favor of online examination allowing immediate feedback. CONCLUSION: Conventional teaching was perceived as more effective, accessible, less technical difficulties and less fraud and cheating. Online learning, should be allowed in undergraduate medical education, by combining it with conventional learning, and students should be prepared to it.","Hanafy, Safaa M; Jumaa, Mohammad I; Arafa, Mostafa A",Saudi Med J,,238

309963,Renal Involvement in COVID-19: A Review of the Literature,2021,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained health care resources around the world, causing many institutions to curtail or stop elective procedures. This has resulted in an inability to care for patients with valvular and structural heart disease in a timely fashion, potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications, including CHF and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment, as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic against the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, the authors suggest guidelines for how to triage patients in need of structural heart disease interventions and provide a framework for how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, the authors address the triage of patients in need of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair. The authors also address procedural issues and considerations for the function of structural heart disease teams during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shah, Pinak B; Welt, Frederick G P; Mahmud, Ehtisham; Phillips, Alistair; Kleiman, Neal S; Young, Michael N; Sherwood, Matthew; Batchelor, Wayne; Wang, Dee Dee; Davidson, Laura; Wyman, Janet; Kadavath, Sabeeda; Szerlip, Molly; Hermiller, James; Fullerton, David; Anwaruddin, Saif",Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,,238

311694,Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to assess pleural pulmonal changes in severe COVID-19 infection: First results,2020,"BACKGROUND: Biological considerations suggest that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: The REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor before admission. Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin-angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04338009. FINDINGS: Between March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77). Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes. Compared with discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40-110] for continuation vs 81 [38-117] for discontinuation; ß-coefficient 8 [95% CI -13 to 29]). There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died. 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (&#967;2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77). There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with international society recommendations, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

Using this approach, we detected up to 98% of COVID-19 positive patient samples analyzed in our various cohorts including a significant percentage of weak positives. Importantly, this extractionless approach will allow for >2-fold increase in testing capacity with existing instruments, circumvent the additional need for expensive extraction devices, provide the sensitivity needed for COVID-19 detection and significantly reduce the turn-around time of reporting COVID-19 test results.","Baksh, Shairaz; Volodko, Natalia; Soucie, Merle; Geier, Sheena Brandon; Diep, Anthony; Rozak, Kallie; Chan, Tak Yin; Mustapha, Jelili; Lai, Raymond; Estey, Mathew; Verity, Bob; Lee, Mao-Cheng",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,238
316154,Putting the spotlight on paediatric dermatology,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article provides a summary of the evaluation and treatment of patients presenting with episodic positional dizziness. RECENT FINDINGS: Positional components are nearly ubiquitous among diagnoses of dizziness, so it can be challenging to classify patients with episodic positional dizziness simply based on the history of present illness. Overreliance on the presence of a report of positional components has likely resulted in misapplication or misinterpretation of positional testing and negative experiences with maneuvers to treat positional dizziness. The prototypical episodic positional dizziness disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by free-floating particles in a semicircular canal that move in response to gravity. The diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic patterns of nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Particle repositioning for BPPV is supported by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. Other disorders that can present with episodic positional dizziness are migraine dizziness, central lesions, and light cupula syndrome. SUMMARY: Episodic positional dizziness is a common presentation of dizziness. Neurologists should prioritize identifying and treating BPPV; doing so provides an important opportunity to deliver effective and efficient care. Providers should also recognize that positional components are common in most causes of dizziness and, therefore, should not over-rely on this part of the history of presentation when considering the diagnosis and management plan.","Kerber, Kevin A",Continuum (Minneap Minn),,238

316232,Reply to Chowdhary et al,2020,"INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on testing for common sexually transmitted infections. Specifically, changes are measured in chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and case detection among patients aged 14-49 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: U.S. chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and positivity were analyzed on the basis of >18.6 million tests (13.6 million tests for female patients and 4.7 million tests for male patients) performed by a national reference clinical laboratory from January 2019 through June 2020. RESULTS: Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing reached a nadir in early April 2020, with decreases (relative to the baseline level) of 59% for female patients and 63% for male patients. Declines in testing were strongly associated with increases in weekly positivity rates for chlamydia (R2=0.96) and gonorrhea (R2=0.85). From March 2020 through June 2020, an expected 27,659 (26.4%) chlamydia and 5,577 (16.5%) gonorrhea cases were potentially missed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted routine sexually transmitted infection services, suggesting an increase in syndromic sexually transmitted infection testing and missed asymptomatic cases. Follow-up analyses will be needed to assess the long-term implications of missed screening opportunities. These findings should serve as a warning for the potential sexual and reproductive health implications that can be expected from the overall decline in testing and potential missed cases.","Pinto, Casey N; Niles, Justin K; Kaufman, Harvey W; Marlowe, Elizabeth M; Alagia, Damian P; Chi, Guangqing; Van Der Pol, Barbara",Am. j. prev. med,,238

The outbreak further exploded in Europe and America in mid-March 2020 to become a global health emergency. We reviewed recent published articles and on-line open messages on SARS-CoV-2-positive infants and children younger than 20 years of age. Symptoms are usually less severe in children than in adults. Twelve critically or mortally ill children were found in the published or news reports before April 6, 2020. Vertical transmission from the mother to her fetus or neonate has not been proven definitively. However, six early-onset (&lt;7 days) and 3 late-onset neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections were found in the literature. We also summarized the presentations and contact information of 24 SARS-CoV-2-positive children announced by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. Early identification and isolation, adequate management, prevention, and vaccine development are the keys to controlling the disease spread. Clinical physicians should be alert to asymptomatic children with COVID-19. Multi-directional investigations are crucial in the global fight against COVID-19.","Jeng, Mei-Jy",J Chin Med Assoc,,238

We provide modular investigation into their theoretical properties and show that the combined methodology, named WEM.gSC, achieves consistency in estimating both the total number and the locations of the change points. The good performance of WEM.gSC is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies, and we further illustrate its usefulness by applying the methodology to London air quality data.","Cho, Haeran; Fryzlewicz, Piotr",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13884v1.pdf,238

METHODS: Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample = 3,540). RESULTS: About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio's [aOR] &#8804; .070). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.45-0.67). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR = 2.75, 95% CI = 2.11-3.57), heart problems (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.34-2.92) and diabetes (aOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.02-4.82) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, males and those with lower education levels.","van der Velden, Peter G; Marchand, Miquelle; Cuelenaere, Boukje; Das, Marcel",PLoS One,,238

DESIGN: A descriptive observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: District hospitals (4 in metro and 4 in rural health services) in the Western Cape, South Africa. District hospitals were small (<150 beds) and led by family physicians. PARTICIPANTS: All patients who presented to the hospitals' emergency centre and who tested positive for COVID-19 between March and June 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Source of referral, presenting symptoms, demographics, comorbidities, clinical assessment and management, laboratory turnaround time, clinical outcomes, factors related to mortality, length of stay and location. RESULTS: 1376 patients (73.9% metro, 26.1% rural). Mean age 46.3 years (SD 16.3), 58.5% females. The majority were self-referred (71%) and had comorbidities (67%): hypertension (41%), type 2 diabetes (25%), HIV (14%) and overweight/obesity (19%). Assessment of COVID-19 was mild (49%), moderate (18%) and severe (24%). Test turnaround time (median 3.0 days (IQR 2.0-5.0 days)) was longer than length of stay (median 2.0 day (IQR 2.0-3.0)). The most common treatment was oxygen (41%) and only 0.8% were intubated and ventilated. Overall mortality was 11%. Most were discharged home (60%) and only 9% transferred to higher levels of care. Increasing age (OR 1.06 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.07)), male (OR 2.02 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.98)), overweight/obesity (OR 1.58 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.46)), type 2 diabetes (OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.73)), HIV (OR 3.41 (95% CI 2.06 to 5.65)), chronic kidney disease (OR 5.16 (95% CI 2.82 to 9.43)) were significantly linked with mortality (p<0.05). Pulmonary diseases (tuberculosis (TB), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, post-TB structural lung disease) were not associated with increased mortality.

323785,Genetic predisposition models to COVID-19 infection,2020,"The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upon human health, economic activity and social engagement have been swift and far reaching. Emerging evidence shows that the pandemic has had dramatic mental health impacts, bringing about increased anxiety and greater social isolation due to the physical distancing policies introduced to control the disease. In this context, it is possible to more deeply appreciate the health consequences of loneliness and social isolation, which researchers have argued are enduring experiences for many people and under-recognised contributors to public health. In this paper, we examine the social and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on what this has revealed about the need to better understand and respond to social isolation and loneliness as public health priorities. Social isolation and loneliness are understood to be distinct conditions, yet each has been found to predict premature mortality, depression, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Estimates of the prevalence and distribution of social isolation and loneliness vary, possibly ranging from one-in-six to one-in-four people, and the lack of knowledge about the extent of these conditions indicates the need for population monitoring using standardised methods and validated measures. Reviews of the evidence relating to social isolation and loneliness interventions have found that befriending schemes, individual and group therapies, various shared activity programs, social prescription by healthcare providers, and diverse strategies using information and communication technologies have been tried. There remains uncertainty about what is effective for different population groups, particularly for prevention and for addressing the more complex condition of loneliness. In Australia, a national coalition - Ending Loneliness Together - has been established to bring together researchers and service providers to facilitate evidence gathering and the mobilisation of knowledge into practice. Research-practice partnerships and cross-disciplinary collaborations of this sort are essential for overcoming the public health problems of loneliness and social isolation that have pre-existed and will endure beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Smith, Ben J; Lim, Michelle H",Public Health Res.

One limitation to the evaluation of potential therapies and vaccines to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and ameliorate disease is the lack of susceptible small animals in large numbers. Commercially available laboratory strains of mice are not readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of species-specific differences in their angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. Here, we transduced replication-defective adenoviruses encoding human ACE2 via intranasal administration into BALB/c mice and established receptor expression in lung tissues. hACE2-transduced mice were productively infected with SARS-CoV-2, and this resulted in high viral titers in the lung, lung pathology, and weight loss. Passive transfer of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody reduced viral burden in the lung and mitigated inflammation and weight loss.

Despite persistent public health concerns, EDCs remain important components of common consumer products, thus representing ubiquitous contaminants to humans. While scientific evidence confirmed their contribution to the severity of Influenza A virus (H1N1) in the animal model, their roles in susceptibility and clinical outcome of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cannot be underestimated. Since its emergence in late 2019, clinical reports on COVID-19 have confirmed that severe disease and death occur in persons aged &#8805;65 years and those with underlying comorbidities. Major comorbidities of COVID-19 include diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, and kidney and liver diseases. Meanwhile, long-term exposure to EDCs contributes significantly to the onset and progression of these comorbid diseases. Besides, EDCs play vital roles in the disruption of the body's immune system. Here, we review the recent literature on the roles of EDCs in comorbidities contributing to COVID-19 mortality, impacts of EDCs on the immune system, and recent articles linking EDCs to COVID-19 risks. We also recommend methodologies that could be adopted to comprehensively study the role of EDCs in COVID-19 risk.","Adegoke, Elikanah Olusayo; Rahman, Md Saidur; Park, Yoo-Jin; Kim, Young Ju; Pang, Myung-Geol",Int. j. mol. sci.

325798,Thromboembolic Disease in COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Social isolation has been associated with poor sleep quality and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most studies included a heterogeneous sample with variances in social disruption policies and did not focus on a local profile with homogeneous prevention policies. OBJECTIVES: Thus, the present study's purpose was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep quality in a specific region in South of Brazil with similar culture and social distance policies adopted by the local governments. METHODS: This study was conducted with 327 individuals aged 18-72 years, living in ""Vale do Taquari"", Brazil. We assessed sociodemographic variables and depression, anxiety, stress symptoms (DASS-21), sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. RESULTS: Our results showed that sleep dysfunction moderated the effects of age on psychological symptoms, indicating that younger participants who had a lower sleep quality presented worse mental health. Further, the participants with more perceived stress during the pandemic and more sleep dysfunction reported more anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSION: Psychological symptoms were not related to social isolation duration but to the subjective perception that the pandemic interfered with life and generated stressful situations. These results may help governments make important decisions about protection and isolation measures in the future waves of COVID-19 infection.","Bücker, Joana; Rosa, Adriane Ribeiro; Czepielewski, Letícia Sanguinetti",Trends psychiatry psychother.

326239,Compassionate Use of Remdesivir in Covid-19,2020,"Wearing face masks is highly recommended to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in health care workers and for the general public. The demand for high quality face masks has seen an upsurge in the recent times, leading to exploration of alternative economic and easily available options, without compromising on the quality. Particle removal from air in terms of capture efficiency of the filter media or the face mask is a crucial parameter for testing and quality assurance. Short-term reusability of the face masks is also an important aspect as the demand for masks will potentially outstrip the supply in future. Sterilization Wraps, which are used to wrap sterile surgical instruments, have shown a promising performance in terms of removal of particles from air. In this study, we evaluate the particle filtration characteristics of face masks made of 2 different metric weights [45 and 60 gram per square metre (GSM)] respectively, using locally available Sterilization Wraps. The aerosol filtration characteristics were also studied after sterilisation by different techniques such as heat with 50% humidity (thermal treatment), ethylene oxide (ETO), steam and radiation dose of 30kGy. We found that 60 GSM face mask had particle capture efficiency of 94% for total particles greater than 0.3 microns and this capture efficiency was maintained even after sterilisation with ETO and thermal treatment. The cost of producing these masks was 30 US cents/mask at our institute. Our study suggests that sterilization wrap material made of non-woven polypropylene spunbond-meltblown-spunbond (SMS) fibres could be an appropriate readily available inexpensive material for making face masks or N95 respirators.","Walawalkar, Sachin; Joshi, Manish; Khattry, Navin; Sapra, Balvinder Kaur; Khan, Arshad; Pujari, Pradeep Kumar; Mohan, Lalit; Srivastava, Sushil Prasad; Naresh, Chital; Badwe, Rajendra; Gupta, Sudeep",PLoS One,,238
326301,Traffic-related air pollution and the coronavirus pandemia: shadows and lights,2020,"In India, the government launched a US$22.6 billion financial support package for the poor and marginalized as a result of Covid-19. Approximately US$ 4.2 billion (INR 310 billion) came from a vast pile of unspent social special-purpose funds. How and why did such a large volume of funds accumulate in the first place, and why did it take a public health emergency to release them? What might be the consequences of their use under such emergency conditions - especially for our understanding of governance and accountability in social welfare provision? This paper presents a brief analysis of two preliminary case studies of specific social special-purpose funds in India. We rely on a handful of unstructured interviews and informal discussions with subnational government officials, civil society actors, trade union representatives, and local community leaders that began in January 2020, and which were pursued virtually following the lockdown. This is bolstered by analysis of primary documents, including Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) reports, relevant laws, and contemporary press coverage. We argue that non-disbursement should be understood as a institutional matter, and not only as technical or implementation failure. Moreover, as such funds are likely to mushroom following Covid-19, our findings suggest that policymakers should focus on the institutional design, decision-making and accountability structures for the flow and distribution of Covid funds, rather than merely emphasising their collection.","Desai, Deval; Randeria, Shalini",World Dev,,238

Due to the unique challenges presented by COVID-19 as well as the distinct timeframes that it will surge in different geographies, much can be learned from the experiences of orthopaedic professionals in many global settings. The goal of this project is to characterize the preparations, strategies, lessons, and personal experiences of orthopaedic trauma surgeons and departments across the world in combating COVID-19. In doing so, we will shed light on current practices and challenges, which may help us manage the current pandemic in addition to preparing for future global pandemics that may arise. METHODS: A 20-item questionnaire was sent out to 150 orthopaedic trauma surgeons representing 42 countries who were identified based on professional relationships and/or prior involvement in international meetings either led or participated by the senior author. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 63 orthopaedic trauma surgeons representing 28 countries and 14 US states. The results of this study show that orthopaedic trauma departments across the world have been greatly impacted by COVID-19 with 91% of participating hospitals currently having a reduced case load compared with pre-COVID-19 and only 17% of respondents currently performing elective orthopaedic surgery. Furthermore, 30% of orthopaedic departments have deployed orthopaedic personnel to non-orthopaedic floors in order to help mitigate the increased patient load and 86% of respondents noted at least some shortage of PPE. Lastly 73% of participating orthopedic departments including those in LMICs, have incorporated telemedicine into their practice with a majority stating that it would most likely become a permanent change to their practice post-COVID-19. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest data set characterizing global COVID-19 situations and responses of orthopaedic trauma practices around the world. There is much to be learned from each of the participants' responses in order to persevere during the current pandemic, as well as to prepare for future pandemics as it relates specifically to orthopaedic trauma practices.","Lezak, Bradley A; Cole, Peter A; Schroder, Lisa K",Int Orthop,,238

METHODS: Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. RESULTS: Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure. Future research should seek to further understand those who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 and determine ways to increase secure storage among firearm owners.","Anestis, Michael D; Bond, Allison E; Daruwala, Samantha E; Bandel, Shelby L; Bryan, Craig J",Am. j. prev. med,,238

We also discuss the changes needed to the model to incorporate situations where some proportion of the individuals who are infected remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease. Using a generic network model where every potential contact exists with the same common probability, we conduct a simulation study in which we vary four key model parameters (transmission rate, probability of remaining asymptomatic, and the mean lengths of time spent in the Exposed and Infectious disease states) and examine the resulting impacts on various metrics of epidemic severity, including the effective reproduction number. We find that the mean length of time spent in the Infectious state and the transmission rate are the most important model parameters, while the mean length of time spent in the Exposed state and the probability of remaining asymptomatic are less important.","Groendyke, Chris; Combs, Adam",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01202v1.pdf,238

331395,COVID-19 Viral Load of an Infected Family in China,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has called worldwide for strong governmental measures to contain its spread, associated with considerable psychological distress. This study aimed at screening a convenience sample in Germany during lockdown for perceived vulnerability to disease, knowledge about COVID-19, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and behavioral responses. In an online survey, 1358 participants completed the perceived vulnerability to disease scale (PVD), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4), and questionnaires on knowledge about COVID-19 and self-perceived change in behaviors in response to COVID-19. Lower and upper quartiles of the PVD were used to classify individuals into low and high PVD. A confirmatory factor analysis supported three factors representing risk, preventive and adaptive behavior as behavioral responses to COVID-19 lockdown. A structural equation model showed that the score of the knowledge scale significantly predicted the self-reported increase in adaptive and preventive behavior. The score in the PVD-subscale Perceived Infectability predicted a self-reported increase in preventive behavior, whereas the Germ Aversion score predicted a self-reported increase in preventive and a decrease in risk behavior. The score in PHQ-4 predicted a higher score in the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales, and a self-reported decrease in adaptive behavior. Low-, medium- and high-PVD groups reported distinct patterns of behavior, knowledge, and mental health symptoms. This study shows that perceived vulnerability to disease is closely linked to preventive behaviors and may enhance adaptation to COVID-19 pandemic.","Stangier, Ulrich; Kananian, Schahryar; Schüller, Johanna",Curr Psychol,,238

The aim of this paper is to review studies on the course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown, no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown, mental health problems decreased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: As mental health care utilisation indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis. Several methodological, pandemic-related, response-related and health policy-related factors need to be considered when trying to gain a broader perspective on the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first phase of lockdown on general populations' mental health.","Richter, Dirk; Riedel-Heller, Steffi; Zürcher, Simeon Joel",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,238
334327,Covid delays in diagnosis and treatment of early onset crc,2020,"Introduction: Diabetes is a disease of persistent hyperglycemia with a devastating complication and even death if left untreated. Morbidity and mortality often increased for any condition among patients with diabetes. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute and life-threatening complication of diabetes. It can occur to type 2 diabetes (T2DM) under severe stress. Since the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei China, in December 2019, more than 47 million infected cases reported leading to more than 1.2 million deaths reported worldwide. The presence of diabetes in COVID19 patients had a higher odd of severity and mortality of the COVID19 compared to patients without diabetes. Our study aims to identify the incidence rate of DKA in T2DM admitted with COVID19 in a tertiary care center. Evidence showed those populations at considerable risk for morbidity and mortality and no available data in Saudi Arabia. Method: A retrospective cohort of adult patients admitted for COVID19, with a diagnosis of T2DM or clinical evidence of DKA in a tertiary care center named King Fahad Medical City located in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. The study involved a chart review. Data collected from the beginning of March 2020 till the end of June 2020. Results: Of 244 patients with T2DM admitted for COVID19, 190 patients were male, and 55 patients were female. The mean age was 59-year-old. out of 244 patients collected, 20 had developed DKA. The incidence rate of DKA was 8%. Number and percentage of male was 15 (71.4%) and female 6 (28.6%). Out of 20 patients admitted with DKA and COVID-19, two patients were not known to have diabetes prior to the presentation. Mortality resulted in 5 out of 20 during admission stay, represent 25% of all patients with DKA. Discussion: Here we report the first study in S.A. about DKA incidence in T2DM with COVID19 pneumonia. In the present study, an alarming observation of a higher incidence of DKA in a patient with type 2 diabetes and COVID19 infection as incidence reaches 8% over a short period of time while incidence worldwide area range was less than 2 per 1000 person-year for DKA in type 2 diabetes without COVID19. A study reported 20 % of patients who have diabetes and COVID19 presented ketosis developed DKA. We report the incidence of DKA in selected group. The mortality rate was not far from different evidence in the world. The mortality rate was 25% in the present study. In the USA, it reaches 30% of inpatient with hyperglycemia at presentation. Conclusion: DKA is a life-threatening complication, and it became worse when it is related to COVID19. The incidence of DKA and mortality related to COVID19 increased when DKA occurs for T2DM subjects. A more prospective study is warranted and a longer duration of the study to establish the accurate incidence and mortality rate.","Almistehi, Wael Mohammad Alturki Abdulrahman Mohammed Bukhari Bashear Adnan",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,238
334383,"Symptomatic similarity, co-infection and cross-reactivity in dengue and COVID-19 disease",2021,"OBJECTIVES: A carefully chosen and suitably prepared kidney donor is essential in living-donor kidney transplantation. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an effective imaging method for evaluating the renovascular morphology of donor candidates. The aim of this study was to evaluate renal artery variations in kidney donors using CTA and compare the findings with the number of arteries detected during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 2,144 living donors who underwent pretransplant renovascular assessment using CTA and laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in our center between August 2012 and October 2018. The number of renal arteries to the donor kidney detected on CTA was compared with the number of arteries discovered intraoperatively. RESULTS: The mean age of the 2,144 living kidney donors included in the study was 47.19 ± 13.3 (18-87) years. According to CTA findings, 81.1% (n = 1,738) had a single renal artery, 17.2% (n = 369) had double renal arteries, 1.6% (n = 35) had triple renal arteries, and 0.1% (n = 2) had quadruple renal arteries. The same number of renal arteries were detected by CTA and in laparoscopic donor nephrectomy in 97.9% (n = 2,099) of the donors. In the other 2.1% (n = 45), fewer renal arteries were detected intraoperatively compared to their CTA findings. None of the donors included in the study had a greater number of renal arteries discovered during nephrectomy than by CTA. CONCLUSION: CTA is a highly accurate method for the evaluation of renovascular variations in donor candidates for living-donor kidney transplantation. However, it must be kept in mind that double or multiple renal artery variations may be detected on CTA in 18.9% of donor candidates.","Sarier, Mehmet; Callioglu, Mehmet; Yuksel, Yucel; Duman, Enes; Emek, Mestan; Usta, Sibel Surmen",Urol Int,,238

335887,Response to paper by Tsioufis et al,2020,"The pervasiveness of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems has become a major environmental issue in recent years. The gradual dumping of plastic wastes, inadequate standard detection methods with specific removal techniques, and slow disposal rate of microplastics make it ubiquitous in the environment. Evidence shows that microplastics act as a potential vector by adsorbing different heavy metals, pathogens, and other chemical additives widely used in different raw plastic production. Microplastics are ingested by aquatic creatures such as fish and different crustaceans, and finally, people ingest them at the tertiary level of the food chain. This phenomenon is responsible for blocking the digestion tracts, disturbing the digestive behavior, finally decreasing the reproductive growth of entire living organisms. Because of these consequences, microplastics have become an increasing concern as a newly emerging potential threat, and therefore, the control of microplastics in aquatic media is required. This paper provides a critical analysis of existing and newly developed methods for detecting and separating microplastics from discharged wastewater, which are the ultimate challenges in the microplastic treatment systems. A critical study on the effect of microplastics on aquatic organisms and human health is also discussed. Thus, this analysis provides a complete understanding of entire strategies for detecting and removing microplastics and their associated issues to ensure a waste discharge standard to minimize the ultimate potential impact in aquatic environments.","Dey, Thuhin K; Uddin, Md Elias; Jamal, Mamun",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,238

This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination. Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die. Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global population - and potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on.

Because of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, naloxone has limited utility under some conditions and would not be effective to counteract mass casualties involving large-scale deployment of weaponized synthetic opioids. To address shortcomings of current medical countermeasures for opioid toxicity, a trans-agency scientific meeting was convened by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health (NIAID/NIH) on August 6 and 7, 2019, to explore emerging alternative approaches for treating opioid overdose in the event of weaponization of synthetic opioids. The meeting was initiated by the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program (CCRP), was organized by NIAID, and was a collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse/NIH (NIDA/NIH), the FDA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This paper provides an overview of several presentations at that meeting that discussed emerging new approaches for treating opioid overdose, including the following: (1) intranasal nalmefene, a competitive, reversible opioid receptor antagonist with a longer duration of action than naloxone; (2) methocinnamox, a novel opioid receptor antagonist; (3) covalent naloxone nanoparticles; (4) serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonists; (5) fentanyl-binding cyclodextrin scaffolds; (6) detoxifying biomimetic ""nanosponge"" decoy receptors; and (7) antibody-based strategies. These approaches could also be applied to treat opioid use disorder.","France, Charles P; Ahern, Gerard P; Averick, Saadyah; Disney, Alex; Enright, Heather A; Esmaeli-Azad, Babak; Federico, Arianna; Gerak, Lisa R; Husbands, Stephen M; Kolber, Benedict; Lau, Edmond Y; Lao, Victoria; Maguire, David R; Malfatti, Michael A; Martinez, Girardo; Mayer, Brian P; Pravetoni, Marco; Sahibzada, Niaz; Skolnick, Phil; Snyder, Evan Y; Tomycz, Nestor; Valdez, Carlos A; Zapf, Jim",Clin. pharmacol. ther,,238

336694,A clinical calculator for predicting intraoperative blood loss and transfusion risk in spine tumor patients,2020,"Robotic nursing aid is one of the heavily researched areas in robotics nowadays. Several robotic assistants exist that only focus on a specific function related to nurses assistance or functions related to patient aid. There is a need for a unified system that not only performs tasks that would assist nurses and reduce their burden but also perform tasks that help a patient. In recent times, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an increase in the need for robotic assistants that have teleoperation capabilities to provide better protection against the virus spread. To address these requirements, we propose a novel Multi-purpose Intelligent Nurse Aid (MINA) robotic system that is capable of providing walking assistance to the patients and perform teleoperation tasks with an easy-to-use and intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This paper also presents preliminary results from the walking assistant task that improves upon the current state-of-the-art methods and shows the developed GUI for teleoperation.","Kodur, Krishna Chaitanya; Rajpathak, Kaustubh; Rajavenkatanarayanan, Akilesh; Kyrarini, Maria; Makedon, Fillia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03683v1.pdf,238

METHODS: Increase in domestic conflict (verbal or physical fights) since the beginning of the pandemic was assessed in 1196 partnered and cohabitating respondents, drawn from a nationally representative sample, in May 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations of demographic characteristics and financial worry with domestic conflict. RESULTS: An increase in domestic conflict was reported by 10.6% (95% CI: 7.7-13.4) of the sample. Domestic conflict increase was significantly associated with younger age, lower education, and financial worry. CONCLUSION: Increases in domestic conflict were seen in certain vulnerable groups and in those who report financial worry. Policies ensuring financial stability, particularly early in the disaster conditions, could reduce domestic conflict during continued COVID-19 conditions or other disasters.","Locker, Alicia R; Finucane, Melissa L; Roth, Elizabeth A; Carman, Katherine G; Breslau, Joshua",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,238

It draws the data from an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) student's writing documents, and marking documents of three experienced English teachers' using the ""Analytical Marking Scheme"". A qualitative approach was employed where the data was obtained during the online supervision of the student's final project (TA) by integrating visual images into her writing project. The participant is in her final year at English Department, Politeknik Negeri Padang who focuses on writing brochure as her TA. The findings of this study show that there are two major progresses found in the writing documents of the first draft to the final draft. First, the content of the writing has been improved as seen from the variation of vocabulary used within. The essay has been organized well where the ideas are developed, and the information shared is logical and complete. Second, even though there is still a few errors occured in grammar, punctuation, and spelling, they have no influence on the idea conveyed. The student is able to adjust into the online learning, and increase her writing performance by utilizing the visual images given. The findings suggest that there should be more innovative learning designs to accommodate the needs of online learning. Since this type of learning is challenging for both teachers and student, teachers need to be able to put their role as facilitator to establish more engagements with the student, and to trigger the student to be more autonomous in learning.","Sariani, El Khairat M.; Yaningsih,",Ijole-International Journal of Language Education,,238
337720,Surgical Management for Craniocervical Junction Arteriovenous Fistula Targeting the Intradural Feeder,2020,"Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, decreased volumes of stroke admissions and mechanical thrombectomy were reported. The objective was to examine whether subarachnoid hemorrhage(SAH) hospitalizations and ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions demonstrated similar declines. Methods: We conducted a global, retrospective, observational study across 6 continents, 37 countries, and 140 comprehensive stroke centers. Patients with diagnosis of SAH, ruptured aneurysm coiling interventions, COVID-19 were identified using ICD-10 codes or by prospectively maintained stroke databases. The 3-month cumulative volume, monthly volumes for SAH hospitalizations and ruptured aneurysm coiling procedures were compared for the period before (1- year and immediately before) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1 to May 31, 2020). Results: There was a significant decline in SAH hospitalizations with 2,044 admissions in the 3 months immediately before and 1,585 admissions during the pandemic, representing a decline of 22.5% (95%CI, -24.3 to -20.7, p&lt;0.0001). Embolization of ruptured aneurysms declined with 1,170 to 1,035 procedures, respectively, representing an 11.5%(95%CI, -13.5 to -9.8, p=0.002) drop. Hospitals with higher COVID-19 hospitalization burden demonstrated greater declines in SAH and ruptured aneurysm coiling compared to lower COVID-19 burden. A relative increase in coiling of ruptured aneurysms was noted in low coiling volume hospitals of 41.1% (95%CI, 32.3-50.6, p=0.008) despite a decrease in SAH admissions in this tertile. Conclusions: There was a global decrease in subarachnoid hemorrhage admissions and ruptured aneurysm embolizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among low-volume coiling SAH hospitals, there was an increase in the ruptured aneurysm coiling intervention. These findings in SAH are consistent with a global decrease in other emergencies such as stroke and myocardial infarction.","Nguyen, T. N.; Haussen, D. C.; Qureshi, M.

The findings indicate an increase in depression and anxiety but have been limited by the lack of specificity about which aspects of the pandemic (e.g. viral exposure or economic threats) have led to adverse mental health outcomes. METHODS: Network analyses were conducted on data from wave 1 (N = 2025, recruited 23 March-28 March 2020) and wave 2 (N = 1406, recontacts 22 April-1 May 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study, an online longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the UK adult population. Our models included depression (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and trauma symptoms (ITQ); and measures of COVID-specific anxiety, exposure to the virus in self and close others, as well as economic loss due to the pandemic. RESULTS: A mixed graphical model at wave 1 identified a potential pathway from economic adversity to anxiety symptoms via COVID-specific anxiety. There was no association between viral exposure and symptoms. Ising network models using clinical cut-offs for symptom scores at each wave yielded similar findings, with the exception of a modest effect of viral exposure on trauma symptoms at wave 1 only. Anxiety and depression symptoms formed separate clusters at wave 1 but not wave 2. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the pandemic evolved in the early phase of lockdown. COVID-related anxiety may represent the mechanism through which economic consequences of the pandemic are associated with psychiatric symptoms.","Zavlis, Orestis; Butter, Sarah; Bennett, Kate; Hartman, Todd K; Hyland, Philip; Mason, Liam; McBride, Orla; Murphy, Jamie; Gibson-Miller, Jilly; Levita, Liat; Martinez, Anton P; Shevlin, Mark; Stocks, Thomas V A; Vallières, Frédérique; Bentall, Richard P",Psychol Med,,238

344688,Universal COVID-19 vaccination cost saving unless anaphylaxis rate high,2021,"Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a key enzyme required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis and it is suggested as a target for COVID19 treatment due to high pyrimidine demand by the virus replication in the infected host cells as well as its proven effect of blocking of cytokine release by the immune cells to prevent inflammation leading to acute respiratory distress. There are a number of clinical trials underway for COVID19 treatment using DHODH inhibitors; however, there are only a small number of known DHODH antagonists available for testing. Here, we have applied a methodology to identify DHODH antagonist candidates, and compared them using in silico target prediction tools. A large set of 7900 FDA-approved and clinical stage drugs obtained from DrugBank were docked against 20 different structures DHODH available in PDB. Drugs were eliminated according to their predicted affinities by Autodock Vina. About 28 FDA-approved and 79 clinical trial ongoing drugs remained. The mode of interaction of these molecules was analyzed by repeating docking using Autodock 4 and DS Visualiser. Finally, the target region predictions of 28 FDA-approved drugs were determined through PASS and SwissTargetPrediction tools. Interestingly, the analysis of in silico target predictions revealed that serotonin-dopamine receptor antagonists could also be potential DHODH inhibitors. Our candidates shared a common attribute, a possible interaction with serotonin-dopamine receptors as well as other oxidoreductases, like DHODH. Moreover, the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase-inhibitor acalabrutunib and serotonin-dopamine receptor inhibitor drugs on our list have been found in the literature that have shown to be effective against Sars-CoV-2, while the path of activity is yet to be identified. Identifying an effective drug that can suppress both inflammation and virus proliferation will play a crucial role in the treatment of COVID. Therefore, we suggest experimental investigation of the 28 FDA-approved drugs on DHODH activity and Sars-CoV-2 virus proliferation. Those who are found experimentally effective can play an important role in COVID19 treatment. Moreover, we suggest investigating COVID19 case conditions in patients using schizophrenia and depression drugs.","Berber, Burak; Doluca, Osman",Brief. bioinform,,238

348171,Gastrointestinal surgery improved the absorption of levodopa in Parkinson's disease,2021,"Background: It is well-known that public health education plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, but how health providers should advise families and parents to obtain health education information is a challenging question. With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading around the world, this rapid review aims to answer that question and thus to promote evidence-based decision making in health education policy and practice. Methods: We systematically searched the literature on health education during COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics in Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data from their inception until March 31, 2020. The potential bias of the studies was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool. Results: Of 1,067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases. Health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites. Conclusions: For educating and cultivating children, parents should obtain information from the official websites of authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national Centers for Disease Control, or from other sources endorsed by these authorities, rather than from a general search of the internet or social media.","Li, Weiguo; Liao, Jing; Li, Qinyuan; Baskota, Muna; Wang, Xingmei; Tang, Yuyi; Zhou, Qi; Wang, Xiaoqing; Luo, Xufei; Ma, Yanfang; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Chen, Yaolong; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei",Ann.

349096,Modern Technologies in the Rehabilitation of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Their Potential Application in Times of COVID-19,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is an unprecedented event in modern history worldwide. To facilitate speedy and smooth recovery during this time period, an added responsibility is placed upon rehabilitation center counselors, staff and management. In this paper we expose the role that psychiatric rehabilitation plays during the COVID-19 crisis. Since COVID-19 pandemic has remarkably raised mental health concerns, one of the high risks and possibly neglected groups includes individuals undergoing mental health rehabilitation, the impact on which can be significant as compared to the rest of the population. In order to ensure that individuals on the road to recovery are not alone and forgotten during the times of coronavirus crisis they should be provided with adequate resources, such as online meetings and group therapy sessions, assessment, treatment and support by telephone and video consultation and getting the medications they need to recover. This article highlights how the coronavirus pandemic, that has hit hard the health care and all categories of patients affected by mental disorders, is likely to be particularly dramatic for mental health rehabilitation centers. Indeed, the COVID-19 crisis has severely tested the health systems worldwide, reducing sometimes the quality and quantity of care offered to psychiatric patients both hospitalized and not in rehabilitation centers. The main goal of this paper is to raise awareness of the importance, often underestimated, of mental health rehabilitation centers, on which one should invest for the both future of psychological and psychiatric rehabilitation and the current crisis as well.","Aamir, Alifiya; Awan, Sana; de Filippis, Renato; Diwan, Mufaddal Najmuddin; Ullah, Irfan",J Psychosoc Rehabil Ment Health,,238

Small islands are known to face a number of challenges but in the quest to curb the viral spread, with the absence of land boarders and small population size, these factors should have played to their advantage to minimize the spread. The aim of this article was to compare and contrast the COVID-19 situation, restrictions, preparedness, management and the healthcare systems between the small population island states of Cyprus, Iceland and Malta. METHOD: Data were obtained from Ministry of Health websites and COVID dashboards of the three respective Island states in Europe. Comparisons were made between the reported cases, deaths, swabbing rates, restrictions and mitigation measures and healthcare system structures. RESULTS: Malta contained the COVID-19 spread better than Cyprus and Iceland during the first wave. However, a significantly higher viral spread was observed in Malta during the second wave. Similar healthcare preparedness and services, restrictions and relaxation measures were implemented across the three islands with some exceptions such as the maximum number of people permitted in one gathering, free movement restrictions and airport regulations. CONCLUSION: The small population size and island status proved to be an asset during the first wave of COVID-19 but different governance approaches led to a different COVID-19 outcome during the transition phases and the onset of the second wave.","Cuschieri, Sarah; Pallari, Elena; Hatziyianni, Amalia; Sigurvinsdottir, Rannveig; Sigfusdottir, Inga Dora; Sigurðardóttir, Árún Kristín",Early Hum Dev,,238
349224,Mild course of COVID-19 and spontaneous virus clearance in a patient with depleted peripheral blood B cells due to rituximab treatment,2020,"Before developing medications for an epidemic, one solution is to go back to the physical and built environment to reduce its impact. Epidemics have transformed our built environment because of the fear of infection. Consequently, architecture and urbanism after the Covid-19 epidemic will never be the same. Although the current global epidemic poses a challenge at all levels in the built environment, it will take time to develop an antivirus-enabled paradigm to reduce the potential risks or stop the virus from spreading. This study imagines what the antivirus-built environment looks like based on the lessons learned and the importance of designing a healthy and sustainable built environment. Many unanswered questions require further multidisciplinary studies. We aim to search for answers and learn from this forced experiment to add additional security layers to overcome future virus-like attacks.","Megahed, Naglaa A.; Ghoneim, Ehab M.",Sustainable Cities Soc.,,238

To design geographically targeted and effective intervention mechanisms of malaria, an up-to-date map that shows the spatial distribution of malaria is needed. This study analyzed 2018 Mozambique Malaria Indicator Survey using geostatistical methods to: i) explore individual, household, and community-level determinants of malaria in under-five children, ii) prepare a malaria prevalence map in Mozambique, and iii) produce prediction prevalence maps and exceedence probability across the country. The results show the overall weighted prevalence of malaria was 38.9% (N = 4347, with 95% CI: 36.9%-40.8%). Across different provinces of Mozambique, the prevalence of malaria ranges from 1% in Maputo city to 57.3% in Cabo Delgado province. Malaria prevalence was found to be higher in rural areas, increased with child's age, and decreased with household wealth index and mother's level of education. Given the high prevalence of childhood malaria observed in Mozambique there is an urgent need for effective public health interventions in malaria hot spot areas. The household determinants of malaria infection that are identified in this study as well as the maps of parasitaemia risk could be used by malaria control program implementers to define priority intervention areas.","Ejigu, Bedilu Alamirie",PLoS One,,238

350176,Association of prior metabolic and bariatric surgery with severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with obesity,2020,"The rapid global spread of COVID-19 has caused disruptions in various supply chains and people's lives. At the same time, it has paved the way for drone technology (Aerial bots). With the countries gone into lockdown for an unspecified time, it is self-evident that people will run out of food, medicine, and other essentials because of the middleman's unavailability to move products from supply to demand point. Lack of medical infrastructure and distant testing laboratories is another challenge faced by the countries, which result in a delayed testing report leading to delay in medical treatment—such critical problems arising in the fight against COVID-19 highlight the need for improving the efficiency of supply chains. Recently used for commercial purposes, drone technology has already proved its utility in inventory and logistics management. Therefore, we argue that drones could be a viable option to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chains working for humanitarian aid to combat COVID-19. Specifically, the focus is on food, administrative, and healthcare supply chains that are the core to combat the pandemic. Moreover, in this article, we highlight various present and future application areas for drone technology, which could pave the way for future research and industry applications.","Koshta, Nitin Devi Yashoda Patra Sabyasachi",Technology in Society,,238
350183,Gut Microbiome Composition Is Associated with COVID-19 Disease Severity,2021,"BACKGROUND: Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. METHODS: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was ""access to technology and systems,"" which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was ""collecting and sharing of information,"" which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar ""barriers to uptake"": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required.","Hunter, Inga; Elers, Phoebe; Lockhart, Caroline; Guesgen, Hans; Singh, Amardeep; Whiddett, Dick",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,238

We describe the control measures used by the Government and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers, with the aim of identifying the measures associated with successful SARS-CoV-2 control. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of Government control measures, including numbers of tests and quarantined individuals, were analysed. Apple and Google mobility data provided proxies for population movement. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A national lockdown was implemented between April 1st and 22nd. Around 200 000 people were quarantined and 266 122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89/208) of resolved infections remained asymptomatic for the duration of infection. The serial interval was 3·24 days, and 27·5% (95% confidence interval, 15·7%-40·0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1·15 (95% confidence interval, 0·37-2·36). No community transmission has been detected since April 15th. CONCLUSIONS: Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of mass communication, meticulous contact-tracing with strict quarantine, and international travel restrictions. The value of these interventions is supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic and imported cases, and evidence for substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","Pham, Quang Thai; Rabaa, Maia A; Duong, Huy Luong; Dang, Quang Tan; Tran, Dai Quang; Quach, Ha-Linh; Hoang, Ngoc-Anh Thi; Phung, Cong Dinh; Ngu, Duy Nghia; Tran, Anh Tu; La, Ngoc Quang; Tran, My Phuc; Vinh, Chau; Nguyen, Cong Khanh; Dang, Duc Anh; Tran, Nhu Duong; Thwaites, Guy; van Doorn, H Rogier; Choisy, Marc",Clin. infect. dis,,238

The capacities for artificial ventilation in intensive care units were too scarce to care for patients with acute respiratory disorder connected to the disease. Several professional associations published COVID-19 triage recommendations in an extremely short time: in 21 days between March 6 and March 27. In this article, we compare recommendations from five European countries, which combine medical and ethical reflections on this situation in some detail. Our aim is to provide a detailed overview on the ethical elements of the recommendations, the differences between them and their coherence. In more general terms we want to identify shortcomings in regard to a common European response to the current situation.","Ehni, Hans-Jörg; Wiesing, Urban; Ranisch, Robert",Bioethics,,238

356474,Central Nervous System Manifestations of COVID-19: A Critical Review and Proposed Research Agenda,2021,"Finding chiral selector with high stereoselectivity to a variety of amino acid enantiomers remains a challenge and warrants further research. In this work, Taniaphos, a chiral ligand with rotatable spatial configuration, was employed as a chiral extractant to enantioseparate various amino acid enantiomers. Phenylalanine (Phe), homophenylalanine (Hphe), 4-nitrophenylalanine (Nphe), and 3-chloro-phenylglycine (Cpheg) were used as substrates to evaluate the extraction efficiency. The results revealed that Taniaphos-Cu exhibited good abilities to enantioseparate Phe, Hphe, Nphe, and Cpheg with the highest separation factors (&#945;) of 3.13, 2.10, 2.32, and 2.14, respectively. Taniaphos-Cu is more conducive to combine with D-amino acid in extraction. The influences of pH, Taniaphos-Cu, and concentration and extraction temperature on extraction were comprehensively evaluated. The highest performance factors (pf) for Phe, Hphe, Nphe, and Cpheg at optimal extraction conditions were 0.08892, 0.1250, 0.09621, and 0.08021, respectively. The recognition mechanism between Taniaphos-Cu and amino acid enantiomers was discussed. The coordination interaction between Taniaphos-Cu and ï£¿COO- , &#960;-&#960; interaction between Taniaphos-Cu and amino acid enantiomers are important acting forces in chiral extraction. The steric-hindrance between ï£¿NH2 and ï£¿OH lead to Taniaphos-Cu-D-Phe is more stable than Taniaphos-Cu-L-Phe. This work provided a chiral extractant that has good abilities to enantioseparate various amino acid enantiomers.","Xiao, Wenjie; Chen, Shuhuan; Liu, Xiong; Ma, Yu",Chirality,,238

However, little is known on the impact of undiagnosed diabetes in the COVID-19 population. We investigated whether diabetes, particularly undiagnosed diabetes, was associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study identified adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji Hospital (Wuhan) from January 28 to April 4, 2020. Diabetes was determined using patients' past history (diagnosed) or was newly defined if the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at admission was &#8805;6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (undiagnosed). The in-hospital mortality rate and survival probability were compared between the non-diabetes and diabetes (overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes) groups. Risk factors of mortality were explored using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 373 patients, 233 were included in the final analysis, among whom 80 (34.3%) had diabetes: 44 (55.0%) reported a diabetes history, and 36 (45.0%) were newly defined as having undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c testing at admission. Compared with the non-diabetes group, the overall diabetes group had a significantly increased mortality rate (22.5% vs. 5.9%, p < 0.001). Moreover, the overall, diagnosed, and undiagnosed diabetes groups displayed lower survival probability in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (all p < 0.01). Using multivariate Cox regression, diabetes, age, quick sequential organ failure assessment score, and D-dimer &#8805;1.0 µg/mL were identified as independent risk factors for in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of undiagnosed pre-existing diabetes among patients with COVID-19 is high in China. Diabetes, even newly defined by HbA1c testing at admission, is associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19. Screening for undiagnosed diabetes by HbA1c measurement should be considered in adult Chinese inpatients with COVID-19.","Liu, Ye; Lu, Ran; Wang, Junhong; Cheng, Qin; Zhang, Ruitao; Zhang, Shuisheng; Le, Yunyi; Wang, Haining; Xiao, Wenhua; Gao, Hongwei; Zeng, Lin; Hong, Tianpei",BMC Endocr Disord,,238

Allocating residents and fellows into skill-concordant clinical roles, however, is challenging. The most efficient method to accomplish graduate medical education (GME) assessment and deployment for horizontal care is not known. Objective: We designed a categorization schema that can efficiently facilitate clinical and educational horizontal care delivery for trainees within a given institution. Methods: In September 2019, as part of a general emergency response preparation, a 4-tiered system of trainee categorization was developed at one academic medical center. All residents and fellows were mapped to this system. This single institution model was disseminated to other institutions in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic began to affect hospitals nationally. In March 2020, a multi-institution collaborative launched the Trainee Pandemic Role Allocation Tool (TPRAT), which allows institutions to map institutional programs to COVID-19 roles within minutes. This was disseminated to other GME programs for use and refinement. Results: The emergency response preparation plan was disseminated and selectively implemented with a positive response from the emergency preparedness team, program directors, and trainees. The TPRAT website was visited more than 100 times in the 2 weeks after its launch. Institutions suggested rapid refinements via webinars and e-mails, and we developed an online user's manual. Conclusions: This tool to assess and deploy trainees horizontally during emergency situations appears feasible and scalable to other GME institutions.","Dennis, Bradley; Highet, Alexandra; Kendrick, Daniel; Mazer, Laura; Loiselle, Sean; Bandeh-Ahmadi, Hoda; Gupta, Tanvi; Abbott, Kenneth; Lea, Jarrett; Dang, Thu; Ramey, Mischon; George, Brian; Terhune, Kyla",J Grad Med Educ,,238

Early projections of international spread influenced travel restrictions and border closures. Model projections based on the virus's infectiousness demonstrated its pandemic potential, which guided the global response to and prepared countries for increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Tracking the impact of distancing and movement policies and behaviour changes has been critical in evaluating these decisions. Models have provided insights into the epidemiological differences between higher and lower income countries, as well as vulnerable population groups within countries to help design fit-for-purpose policies. Economic evaluation and policies have combined epidemic models and traditional economic models to address the economic consequences of COVID-19, which have informed policy calls for easing restrictions. Social contact and mobility models have allowed evaluation of the pathways to safely relax mobility restrictions and distancing measures. Finally, models can consider future end-game scenarios, including how suppression can be achieved and the impact of different vaccination strategies.","McBryde, Emma S; Meehan, Michael T; Adegboye, Oyelola A; Adekunle, Adeshina I; Caldwell, Jamie M; Pak, Anton; Rojas, Diana P; Williams, Bridget M; Trauer, James M",Paediatr Respir Rev,,238

Rapid detection of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is very important due to its high rate of infectivity. This study aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, China, and to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19 in attempts to contain spread of the virus. METHODS: This retrospective study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hunan Provincial People's Hospital (Changsha, China) between January 22 and February 15, 2020. All cases were detected using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The epidemiology and clinical characteristic of these cases were investigated according to outcome in attempts to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 24 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the fever outpatient department of Hunan Provincial People's Hospital. Three patients were asymptomatic, and 3 exhibited mild and 3 moderate disease. There was a family cluster phenomenon. CONCLUSION: Individuals with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or exhibit mild manifestations of disease. Close monitoring and an optimized screening strategy for COVID-19 could help deter spread of the virus.","Liu, Li; Hong, Xiuqin; Su, Xin; Chen, Haiou; Zhang, Dongcui; Tang, Shigang; Chen, Liang; Zhu, Baining; Li, Xiaosong; Shi, Yi",J Infect Public Health,,238

Materials and Methods: Vaginal swabs were taken from women diagnosed with mild to moderately acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, at Wolfson Medical Center, Israel, from March 2020 through October 2020. COVID-19 was diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on nasopharyngeal swabs. Vaginal swabs were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: In total, 51 women diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study. Of the 51 women with COVID-19 enrolled in this study, 16 (31.4%) were pregnant at enrollment and 35 (68.6%) were non-pregnant. Mean age was 43.5 ± 15.3 years (range 21–74 years). Compared to the non-pregnant group, the pregnant group was characterized by a higher white blood cell and absolute neutrophil count (p = 0.02 and p = 0.027, respectively). The non-pregnant patients were more likely to have chronic diseases (p = 0.035) and to be hospitalized (p &lt; 0.001). Only one patient (1.9%) aged 60 years tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal secretions. Mean gestational age at the diagnosis of COVID-19 of the pregnant group was 32.3 ± 7.8 weeks. Thirteen patients delivered during the study period;all delivered at term without obstetric complications and all neonates were healthy. Conclusions: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the vaginal secretions of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is rare. Vaginal colonization may occur during the viremia phase of the disease, although infectivity from vaginal colonization needs to be proven.","Barber, Elad Kovo Michal Leytes Sophia Sagiv Ron Weiner Eran Schwartz Orna Mashavi Margarita Holtzman Keren Bar Jacob Engel Anat Ginath Shimon",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,238
366058,A unique presentation of papulonodular secondary syphilis in an elderly patient,2021,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a devastating effect on the global public health. Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in the screening of COVID-19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately segment COVID-19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this paper, we propose a U-Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial and a channel attention, to a U-Net architecture to re-weight the feature representation spatially and channel-wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation on COVID-19 segmentation. The method takes only 0.29 second to segment a single CT slice. The obtained Dice Score, Sensitivity and Specificity are 83.1%, 86.7% and 99.3%, respectively.","Zhou, Tongxue; Canu, St'ephane; Ruan, Su",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06673v2.pdf,238

Limited published clinical data, scarcity and long turn over time of diagnostic testing put clinician in dilemma to make diagnosis. METHODOLOGY: This is an observational case series study from confirmed COVID-19 patient in our hospital from first case admission on 17 March 30 April, 2020. We collected patient's demography, symptoms, comorbidities, therapy, laboratory, chest x-ray and ECG consecutively. RESULTS: Between 17 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, there were 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 16 (53.3%) were male. Clinical symptoms were dyspnea in 22 (73.3%) and dry cough 16 (53.3%). Comorbidities were diabetes in 14 (46.6%), hypertension 10 (33.3%) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) in 10 (33.3%) patients respectively. Laboratory findings showed lymphopenia in 21 (70%) patients, increased inflammation marker in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) 21 (70%), 23 (76.6%) and 12 (40%) patients respectively. Twenty-seven (90%) cases had abnormal Chest X-Ray (CXR) and mostly severe 18 (60%). Descriptive finding for images included consolidation 16 (53.3%) and Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) in 10 (33.3%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, most cases of COVID-19 admitted in secondary referral hospital were already in moderate to severe stages. This is most likely due to late referral from primary care and unspecific clinical features resemblance of other infectious diseases. Inflammation marker and CXR are cost effective findings and can be used as marker to determine further referral.","Hafiz, Muhammad; Icksan, Aziza Ghanie; Harlivasari, Annisa Dian; Aulia, Rizky; Susanti, Febrina; Eldinia, Lourisa",J Infect Dev Ctries,,238

366652,"Smell, taste and trigeminal disorders in a 65-year-old population",2021,"BACKGROUND: Smell dysfunction has been recognized as an early symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection, often occurring before the onset of core symptoms of the respiratory tract, fever or muscle pain. In most cases, olfactory dysfunction is accompanied by reduced sense of taste, is partial (microsmia) and seems to normalize after several weeks, however, especially in cases of virus-induced complete smell loss (anosmia), there are indications of persisting deficits even 2 months after recovery from the acute disease, pointing towards the possibility of chronic or even permanent smell reduction for a significant part of the patient population. To date, we have no knowledge on the specificity of anosmia towards specific odorants or chemicals and about the longer-term timeline of its persistence or reversal. METHODS: In this longitudinal study, 70 participants from a community in Lower Austria that had been tested positive for either IgG or IgM SARS-CoV-2 titers in June 2020 and a healthy control cohort (N = 348) underwent smell testing with a 12-item Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT), based upon items from the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The test was performed in October 2020, i.e. 4 months after initial diagnosis via antibody testing. Results were analyzed using statistical tests for contingency for each smell individually in order to detect whether reacquisition of smell is dependent on specific odorant types. RESULTS: For all odorants tested, except the odor ""smoke"", even 4 months or more after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, participants with a positive antibody titer had a reduced sense of smell when compared to the control group. On average, while the control cohort detected a set of 12 different smells with 88.0% accuracy, the antibody-positive group detected 80.0% of tested odorants. A reduction of accuracy of detection by 9.1% in the antibody-positive cohort was detected. Recovery of the ability to smell was particularly delayed for three odorants: strawberry (encoded by the aldehyde ethylmethylphenylglycidate), lemon (encoded by citronellal, a monoterpenoid aldehyde), and soap (alkali metal salts of the fatty acids plus odorous additives) exhibit a sensitivity of detection of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 of 31.0%, 41.0% and 40.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Four months or more after acute infection, smell performance of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with mild or no symptoms is not fully recovered, whereby the ability to detect certain odors (strawberry, lemon and soap) is particularly affected, suggesting the possibility that these sensitivity to these smells may not only be lagging behind but may be more permanently affected.","Rebholz, H; Pfaffeneder-Mantai, F; Knoll, W; Hassel, A W; Frank, W; Kleber, C",Am J Otolaryngol,,238

CNT FETs were fabricated on a flexible Kapton substrate and the sensor was fabricated by immobilizing the reverse sequence of the 25-base portion of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of the SARS-CoV-2 onto the CNT channel. The biosensors were tested for the synthetic positive and control target sequences. The biosensor showed a selective sensing response to the positive target sequence with a limit of detection of 10 fM. The promising results from our study suggest that the CNT FET based biosensors can be used as a diagnostic tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Thanihaichelvan, M; Surendran, S N; Kumanan, T; Sutharsini, U; Ravirajan, P; Valluvan, R; Tharsika, T",,,238

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID present higher risk of worse outcomes when diagnosed with COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Rapid systematic review conducted in the medical school of the Federal University of São Paulo (SP), Brazil. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCOPUS, Web of Science, L·OVE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP for studies evaluating patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID. Two authors selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence, following the Cochrane recommendations. RESULTS: We identified 1,498 references, from which one cohort study was included. This compared patients with and without rheumatic diseases (RD) who all had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Those with RD seemed to have higher chances of hospitalization and mortality, but no statistical difference was detected between the groups: hospitalization: odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6 to 2.29; mortality rate: OR 1.53; 95% CI 0.33 to 7.11 (very low certainty of evidence). Patients with RD were three times more likely to require admission to intensive care units (ICUs), with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), than those without RD: OR 3.72; 95% CI 1.35 to 10.26 (for both outcomes; very low certainty of evidence). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing pharmacological treatment for IMID seem to present higher chances of requiring admission to ICUs, with IMV.

The vitreous body was considered in its age-related liquefaction condition. Fluid dynamics and large molecule distribution were described by the coupling of mass conservation's and Fick's laws with continuity and momentum equations for a Newtonian incompressible fluid in a 3D unsteady analysis. Two injection sites were analyzed, in both the mixing effect of a 50° periodic saccade leads to uniform drug distribution in 30 s of simulation, the initial bolus site being left after 3 s of simulation. In absence of saccadic movements, the dominant transport contribution is the diffusive one and large molecules hardly reach their uniform distribution inside the vitreous cavity. A model describing the intravitreal distribution of large molecules in presence of saccades was developed, improving the understanding of drug transport mechanism after an intravitreal injection and highlighting how advection contribution enhances its distribution in the vitreous chamber.","Ferroni, Marco; De Gaetano, Francesco; Cereda, Matteo Giuseppe; Boschetti, Federica",Med Eng Phys,,238

Numerous systematic reviews of varying qualities have tried to summarize the evidence on the available therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. This overview of reviews aims to provide a succinct summary of the findings of systematic reviews on different pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and WHO database of publications on COVID-19 from 1 December 2019 through to 11 June 2020 for peer-reviewed systematic review studies that reported on potential pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies for COVID-19. Quality assessment was completed using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) measure. RESULTS: Out of 816 non-duplicate studies, 45 were included in the overview. Antiviral and antibiotic agents, corticosteroids, and anti-malarial agents were the most common drug classes used to treat COVID-19; however, there was no direct or strong evidence to support their efficacy. Oxygen therapy and ventilatory support was the most common non-pharmacological supportive care. The quality of most of the included reviews was rated as low or critically low. CONCLUSION: This overview of reviews demonstrates that although some therapeutic interventions may be beneficial to specific subgroups of COVID-19 patients, the available data are insufficient to strongly recommend any particular treatment option to be used at a population level. Future systematic reviews on COVID-19 treatments should adhere to the recommended systematic review methodologies and ensure that promptness and comprehensiveness are balanced.The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Khalili, Malahat; Chegeni, Maryam; Javadi, Sara; Farokhnia, Mehrdad; Sharifi, Hamid; Karamouzian, Mohammad",Ther Adv Respir Dis,,238

In this work, predictive factors for survival in cancer patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 infection were investigated. METHODS: PRE-COVID-19 is a retrospective study of all 302 cancer patients presenting to this institute with a suspicion of COVID-19 from March 1st to April 25th 2020. Data were collected using a web-based tool within electronic patient record approved by the Institutional Review Board. Patient characteristics symptoms and survival were collected and compared in SARS-COV-2 real-time or reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)-positive and RT-PCR-negative patients. RESULTS: Fifty-five of the 302 (18.2%) patients with suspected COVID-19 had detectable SARS-COV-2 with RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples. RT-PCR-positive patients were older, had more frequently haematological malignancies, respiratory symptoms and suspected COVID-19 pneumonia of computed tomography (CT) scan. However, respectively, 38% and 20% of SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR-negative patients presented similar respiratory symptoms and CT scan images. Thirty of the 302 (9.9%) patients died during the observation period, including 24 (80%) with advanced disease. At the median follow-up of 25 days after the first symptoms, the death rate in RT-PCR-positive and RT-PCR-negative patients were 21% and 10%, respectively. In both groups, independent risk factors for death were male gender, Karnofsky performance status <60, cancer in relapse and respiratory symptoms. Detection of SARS-COV-2 on RT-PCR was not associated with an increased death rate (p = 0.10). None of the treatment given in the previous month (including cytotoxics, PD1 Ab, anti-CD20, VEGFR2 ) correlated with survival. The survival of RT-PCR-positive and -negative patients with respiratory symptoms and/or COVID-19 type pneumonia on CT scan was similar with a 18.4% and 19.7% death rate at day 25. Most (22/30, 73%) cancer patients dying during this period were RT-PCR negative. CONCLUSION: The 30-day death rate of cancer patients with or without documented SARS-COV-2 infection is poor, but the majority of deaths occur in RT-PCR-negative patients.","Assaad, Souad; Avrillon, Virginie; Fournier, Marie-Line; Mastroianni, Benedicte; Russias, Bruno; Swalduz, Aurélie; Cassier, Philippe; Eberst, Lauriane; Steineur, Marie-Pierre; Kazes, Marianne; Perol, Maurice; Michallet, Anne-Sophie; Rey, Philippe; Erena-Penet, Anne-Sophie; Morel, Astrid; Brahmi, Mehdi; Dufresne, Armelle; Tredan, Olivier; Chvetzoff, Gisèle; Fayette, Jérome; de la Fouchardiere, Christelle; Ray-Coquard, Isabelle; Bachelot, Thomas; Saintigny, Pierre; Tabutin, Mayeul; Dupré, Aurélien; Nicolas-Virelizier, Emmanuelle; Belhabri, Amine; Roux, Pierre-Eric; Fuhrmann, Christine; Pilleul, Franck; Basle, Alexandre; Bouhamama, Amine; Galvez, Christelle; Herr, Andrée-Laure; Gautier, Julien; Chabaud, Sylvie; Zrounba, Philippe; Perol, David; Blay, Jean-Yves",Eur J Cancer,,238
373187,The COVID-19 pandemic: Distance-delivered care for childhood cancer survivors,2020,"Transport planning and public health have been intertwined historically. The health impact of public transport services, such as social exclusion, is a widely discussed research topic. Social exclusion is a paramount concern for older adults' health in the wake of emerging global challenges. However, there remains a significant research gap on how psychosocial barriers faced by older adults in using public transport services influence the social exclusion behavior. The present research provides empirical evidence and shows the impact of certain psychosocial barriers of public transportation on older adults' social exclusion. A total of 243 Pakistani older adults (aged 60-89 years old) voluntarily participated in this cross-sectional study. The participants provided self-reports on their psychosocial barriers (including perceived norms, attitude, personal ability, habits, neighborhood social constraints, and intention) and the corresponding social exclusion. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized for the data analysis. The structural path model supported the significant associations between psychosocial barriers and social exclusion. Except for perceived descriptive norms, all other psychosocial barriers predicted older adults' social exclusion. The research portrays the significance of the psychosocial factors to examine social exclusion and offers practical implications for urban and transport planners. The concerned policymakers can use the research findings to develop age-sensitive, socially sustainable, and healthy cities.","Al-Rashid, Muhammad Ahmad; Goh, Hong Ching; Harumain, Yong Adilah Shamsul; Ali, Zulfiqar; Campisi, Tiziana; Mahmood, Tahir",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,238

Based on a self-selected sample of Greek citizens (N = 462), it is found that demographic characteristics and pro-environmental concern are unrelated to the single-use mask users' knowledge and concern regarding the environmental impacts of the mask they are using. This unanticipated finding suggests that the circumstances of the COVID pandemic may mute the theoretically taken-for-granted connection between environmental interest/concern and the awareness of environmental impacts, thus any future attempts to introduce more environmentally-friendly single-use mask alternatives and/or to curb the current ones' environmental impact should start by reenergizing this suppressed nexus.","Botetzagias, Iosif; Malesios, Chrysovaladis",Mar Pollut Bull,,238

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of the prevalence of depression and anxiety among medical students, residents, and fellows at a medical university hospital in New York using self-reported PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening tools administered via an anonymized survey. The study was conducted in April 2020. RESULTS: The authors received 438 responses (33.4% response rate). Nearly half (44.5%) were medical students and female (56.6%). The prevalence of positive screen for depression (45.3%) and anxiety (48.1%) was high. Many reported moderate to severe depression (17.2%) and anxiety (20.3%). Over half (57.3%) experienced significant mood changes and inability to concentrate, and 14.6% had reconsidered their choice of profession since the start of the pandemic. Those who had reconsidered their profession had higher PHQ-9 [8.1 (6.4) vs 4.4 (4.3), p < 0.0001] and GAD-7 scores [8.3 (6.1) vs 4.7 (4.6), p < 0.0001], indicating adverse mental health partly contributed to their reconsideration of choice of profession. Women were more likely to screen positive for anxiety (OR: 1.68) and medical students more likely to screen positive for anxiety (OR: 2.55) and depression (OR: 2.74). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed great strain on health-care resources, including the mental health of medical trainees.","Gupta, Pratishtha; B K, Anupama; Ramakrishna, Kartik",Acad. psychiatry,,238

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein has been considered critical for this interaction and acts as the target of numerous neutralizing antibodies and antiviral peptides. This study used the fragment molecular orbital method to analyze the interactions between the RBD and antibodies/peptides and extracted crucial residues that can be used as epitopes. The interactions evaluated as interfragment interaction energy values between the RBD and 12 antibodies/peptides showed a fairly good correlation with the experimental activity pIC50 (R2 = 0.540). Nine residues (T415, K417, Y421, F456, A475, F486, N487, N501, and Y505) were confirmed as being crucial. Pair interaction energy decomposition analyses showed that hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and &#960;-orbital interactions are important. Our results provide essential information for understanding SARS-CoV-2-antibody/peptide binding and may play roles in future antibody/antiviral drug design.","Watanabe, Kazuki; Watanabe, Chiduru; Honma, Teruki; Tian, Yu-Shi; Kawashima, Yusuke; Kawashita, Norihito; Takagi, Tatsuya; Fukuzawa, Kaori",J Phys Chem Lett,,238

377024,"Life with Parkinson's Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Pressure Is ""OFF""",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Statins may reduce a cytokine storm, which has been hypothesized as a possible mechanism of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to report on adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients by statin usage. METHODS: Literatures were searched from January 2019 to December 2020 to identify studies that reported the association between statin usage and adverse outcomes, including mortality, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation. Studies were meta-analyzed for mortality by the subgroups of ICU status and statin usage before and after COVID-19 hospitalization. Studies reporting an odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Thirteen cohorts, reporting on 110,078 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Individuals who used statins before their COVID-19 hospitalization showed a similar risk of mortality, compared to those who did not use statins (HR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.28; OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38, 1.03). Patients who were administered statins after their COVID-19 diagnosis were at a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.61; OR 0.57, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.75). The use of statins did not reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.26, 1.64). Among non-ICU patients, statin users were at a lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.62; OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.88). CONCLUSION: Patients administered statins after COVID-19 diagnosis or non-ICU admitted patients were at lower risk of mortality relative to non-statin users.","Chow, Ronald; Im, James; Chiu, Nicholas; Chiu, Leonard; Aggarwal, Rahul; Lee, Jihui; Choi, Young-Geun; Prsic, Elizabeth Horn; Shin, Hyun Joon",PLoS One,,238

377722,Micronutrients as immunomodulatory tools for COVID-19 management,2020,"Pediatric cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are generally mild or asymptomatic, and are usually detected by virological examination following close contact with COVID-19 patients, often the children's parents. The detailed clinical features and virological data of pediatric patients with COVID-19, particularly young infants, remain unclear. Here, the clinical and virological characteristics of four children with COVID-19 including two young infants were investigated. One- and 4-month-old boys with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic, and seroconversion was demonstrated. These findings suggest that even young infants can mount an immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite having weaker immune defenses than adolescents and adults. Three-year-old boy, who was SARS-CoV-2-negative, was admitted to the same room as his SARS-CoV-2-positive father due to the lack of caregivers. Although he was asymptomatic, he had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. Eleven-year-old boy, who was sibling of the 3-year-old boy, was also SARS-CoV-2-negative. He was isolated in his own room and did not seroconvert. If young children are SARS-CoV-2 negative, they should be isolated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive parents. This may be difficult in practice, if parents with COVID-19 are the only available caregivers. In such situations, the most appropriate measures should be taken for each patient.","Kawamura, Yoshiki; Higashimoto, Yuki; Miura, Hiroki; Ihira, Masaru; Inaba, Masato; Ito, Ryota; Kozawa, Kei; Yoshikawa, Tetsushi",J. med. virol,,238

The present study aimed to evaluate retrospectively the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 and to analyze CT findings and determine their relationships with clinical severity. METHODS: Chest CT and clinical features of 271 COVID-19 patients were assessed. The presence of CT findings and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities were evaluated, and CT patterns were classified as bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonia (OP), or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Total extents were assessed using a visual scoring system and artificial intelligence software. Patients were allocated to two groups based on clinical outcomes, that is, to a severe group (requiring O2 therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 55) or a mild group (not requiring O2 therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 216). Clinical and CT features of these two groups were compared and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: Age, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were significantly different in the two groups. Forty-five of the 271 patients had normal chest CT findings. The most common CT findings among the remaining 226 patients were ground-glass opacity (98%), followed by consolidation (53%). CT findings were classified as OP (93%), DAD (4%), or bronchopneumonia (3%) and all nine patients with DAD pattern were included in the severe group. Uivariate and multivariate analyses showed an elevated procalcitonin (odds ratio [OR], 2.521; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-6.303, P = 0.048), and higher visual CT scores (OR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.042-1.236; P = 0.003) or higher total extent by AI measurement (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 1.020-1.076; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a severe clinical course. CONCLUSION: CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia can be classified into OP, DAD, or bronchopneumonia patterns and all patients with DAD pattern were included in severe group. Elevated inflammatory markers and higher CT scores were found to be significant predictors of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Jeong, Yeon Joo; Nam, Bo Da; Yoo, Jin Young; Kim, Kun Il; Kang, Hee; Hwang, Jung Hwa; Kim, Yun Hyeon; Lee, Kyung Soo",J Korean Med Sci,,238
378811,Platelet hyperactivity in COVID-19: Can the tomato extract Fruitflow® be used as an antiplatelet regime?,2021,"Biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) are becoming increasingly common to aid data collection in clinical trials and practice. The state of BioMeTs, and associated digitally measured biomarkers, is highly reminiscent of the field of laboratory biomarkers 2 decades ago. In this review, we have summarized and leveraged historical perspectives, and lessons learned from laboratory biomarkers as they apply to BioMeTs. Both categories share common features, including goals and roles in biomedical research, definitions, and many elements of the biomarker qualification framework. They can also be classified based on the underlying technology, each with distinct features and performance characteristics, which require bench and human experimentation testing phases. In contrast to laboratory biomarkers, digitally measured biomarkers require prospective data collection for purposes of analytical validation in human subjects, lack well-established and widely accepted performance characteristics, require human factor testing, and, for many applications, access to raw (sample-level) data. Novel methods to handle large volumes of data, as well as security and data rights requirements add to the complexity of this emerging field. Our review highlights the need for a common framework with appropriate vocabulary and standardized approaches to evaluate digitally measured biomarkers, including defining performance characteristics and acceptance criteria. Additionally, the need for human factor testing drives early patient engagement during technology development. Finally, use of BioMeTs requires a relatively high degree of technology literacy among both study participants and healthcare professionals.

Studies of emerging diseases under outbreak conditions have focused on the complete spectrum of pathogens, transmissibility, shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity, epidemiological causes, and interventions to control emergence. During the initial stages of an outbreak, laboratory response capacity focuses on expansion of efficient diagnostic tools for rapid case detection, contact tracing, putting epidemiological findings into sources, mode of transmission, and identification of susceptible groups and reservoirs. It is important for public health diagnostic laboratories to have a fundamental knowledge of viral shedding, antibody response kinetics, assay validation, interpretation, and uncertainties of test results. This study reviewed currently published data from available literature on SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared this with data on viral shedding and antibody response kinetics of other human coronaviruses. Also described are current challenges and comments on some biases and significant data gaps that have limited laboratory preparedness to SARS-CoV-2. Consistent documentation of progress and data gaps from standardized reporting of methods utilized, sampling date, details of test results by specimen type, risk assessments, and symptoms can all be used strategically and provide incentives to governments and their partners to prioritize the development, detection, and response to outbreaks.","Biswas, Subrata; Ghosh, Piyali; Chakraborty, Debjit; Chatterjee, Ananya; Dutta, Shanta; Saha, Malay Kumar",Viral immunol,,238

A total N(%) of 89(59.7%) PT and 60(40.3%) OT students were included for analysis [48(32.2%) male;101(67.8%) female]. A cross-sectional and predictive correlational study design was utilized. Participants self-administered the LASSI and cpGPA was collected in Spring 2020. Standard multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Results: Neither the LASSI scales, R-2 = 0.05 [F(10, 138) = 0.71, p = 0.71], nor the LASSI components, R-2 = 0.01 [F(3, 145) = 0.56, p = 0.64], were able to accurately predict cpGPA. These findings contradict many prior studies in health professions education where anxiety, attitude, motivation, test strategies, and time management have been significant predictors. Conclusion: This study should be repeated due to a threat to internal validity, the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have influenced outcomes to an unknown degree. The predictive nature of this measure under more natural conditions remains unknown for this population of learners.","Pucillo, E. M.; Black, E.

379521,Oral manifestations of Covid-19-A literature review,2021,"COVID-19 has emerged as a pandemic of significance with potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Elderly with or without following comorbidities i.e Diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic respiratory illnesses, chronic liver disease, CKD, malignancy and immunocompromised hosts are at increased risk of developing complicated course. Hemodialysis population hence are at increased risk for contracting the infection due to patient characteristics, environmental characteristics and procedural lapses. The current study was aimed at describing prevalence and characteristics of COVID19 in hemodialysis population across different HD centers across Mumbai. We found a prevalence rate of COVID19 in 6.4%, with 9 patients (12%) died during the study period. A fair proportion of Non covid HD patients (1.5%) also died due to lack of access to dialysis. At baseline, mean age of presentation was 54.5 years. On routine test 80% were asymptomatic at presentation. Patients with COPD, requiring ICU care and those on ventilation faired poorly. Contrary to assumption patients with underlying cardiovascular disease didn't show poor outcome. Total of 4.1% health care workers turned positive during the study period with mean age of 31 years and median of 28years. Out of them 5 (45.4%) were symptomatic. All recovered from the illness without any sequelae. Seventy two percent of healthcare workers were on Hydroxy-chloroquine chemoprophylaxis didn't reach statistical significance in preventing the infection. In our study elderly age with comorbidities had poor prognosis. We proposed extra healthcare measures to be taken in the dialysis unit presuming all as COVID suspect in the resource limited settings.","Deshpande, Rushi; Dash, Sudhiranjan; Bahadur, M M; Thamba, Aseem; Pathan, Amjad K; Dave, Keyur; Chaudhari, Chandan; Shringare, Ashay; Patil, Ashwin",J Assoc Physicians India,,238

Studies demonstrate that upregulation of ACE2 has a protective effect on SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. Moreover, animal studies demonstrate that dietary intake can modulate ACE2 gene expression and function. A high intake of resveratrol may have a protective role, upregulating ACE2, whereas a high intake of dietary fat may have a detrimental role, downregulating ACE2. As such, we postulate on the biological plausibility of interactions between dietary fat and/or resveratrol and ACE2 gene variations in the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 illness severity. We call to action the research community to test this plausible interaction in a sample of human subjects.","Horne, Justine R; Vohl, Marie-Claude",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,,238

However, there is limited evidence regarding its efficacy to reduce viral transmission risks. We aim to provide an evidence-based approach to optimize the use of slit lamp shields during clinical examination. RECENT FINDINGS: Respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing can travel up to 50âm/s and over a distance of 2âm, with a potential area of spread of 616âcm. Slit lamp shields confer added protection against large droplets but are limited against smaller particles. A larger shield curved toward the ophthalmologist and positioned closer to the patient increases protection against large droplets. A potential improvement to the design of such shields is the use of hydrophilic materials with antiviral properties which may help to minimize splashing of infectious droplets, reducing transmission risks. These include gold or silver nanoparticles and graphene oxide. SUMMARY: Slit lamp shields serve as a barrier for large droplets, but its protection against smaller droplets is undetermined. It should be large, positioned close to the patient, and used in tandem with routine basic disinfection practices.","Ong, Sze C; Yap, Jun X; Tay, Terrence Y F; Mo, Yin; Loon, Seng C; Koh, Victor",Curr Opin Ophthalmol,,238
380803,Maintaining stroke care in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from an international survey of stroke professionals and practice recommendations from the European Stroke Organisation,2020,"The 2020 summer Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo were postponed to July-September 2021 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While COVID-19 has emerged as a monumental health threat for mass gathering events, heat illness must be acknowledged as a potentially large health threat for maintaining health services. We examined the number of COVID-19 admissions and the Tokyo rule for emergency medical care, in Tokyo, from March to September 2020, and investigated the weekly number of emergency transportations due to heat illness and weekly averages of the daily maximum Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) in Tokyo in the summer (2016-2020). The peak of emergency transportations due to heat illness overlapped the resurgence of COVID-19 in 2020, and an increase of heat illness patients and WBGT has been observed. Respect for robust science is critical for the decision-making process of mass gathering events during the pandemic, and science-based countermeasures and implementations for COVID-19 will be warranted. Without urgent reconsiderations and sufficient countermeasures, the double burden of COVID-19 and heat-related illnesses in Tokyo will overwhelm the healthcare provision system, and maintaining essential health services will be challenging during the 2021 summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.","Shimizu, Kazuki; Gilmour, Stuart; Mase, Hiromi; Le, Phuong Mai; Teshima, Ayaka; Sakamoto, Haruka; Nomura, Shuhei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,238
380928,Immunogenetic Association Underlying Severe COVID-19,2020,"Workers and their families bear much of the economic burden of COVID-19. Even though they have declined somewhat, unemployment rates are considerably higher than before the start of the pandemic. Many workers also face uncertainty about their future employment prospects and increasing financial strain. At the same time, the workplace is a common source of transmission of COVID-19 and many jobs previously seen as relatively safe are now viewed as potentially hazardous. Thus, many workers face dual threats of economic stress and COVID-19 exposure. This paper develops a model of workers' responses to these dual threats, including risk perception and resource depletion as mediating factors that influence the relationship of economic stress and occupational risk factors with COVID-19 compliance-related attitudes, safe behavior at work, and physical and mental health outcomes. The paper also describes contextual moderators of these relationships at the individual, unit, and regional level. Directions for future research are discussed.","Sinclair, Robert R; Probst, Tahira M; Watson, Gwendolyn Paige; Bazzoli, Andrea",Applied psychology,,238

The cause of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients is not yet known. Case reports of COVID-19 autopsy heart samples have demonstrated abnormal inflammatory infiltration of macrophages in heart tissues.Objective: Generate an immuno-cardiac co-culture platform to model macrophage-mediated hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 hearts and screen for drugs that can block the macrophage-mediated inflammation. Methods and Results: We systematically compared autopsy samples from non-COVID-19 donors and COVID-19 patients using RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry. We observed strikingly increased expression levels of CCL2 as well as macrophage infiltration in heart tissues of COVID-19 patients. We generated an immuno-cardiac co-culture platform containing human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) and macrophages. We found that macrophages induce increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in CMs by secreting IL-6 and TNF-&#945; after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Using this immuno-cardiac co-culture platform, we performed a high content screen and identified ranolazine and tofacitinib as compounds that protect CMs from macrophage-induced cardiotoxicity. Conclusions: We established an immuno-host co-culture system to study macrophage-induced host cell damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified FDA-approved drug candidates that alleviate the macrophage-mediated hyper-inflammation and cellular injury.","Yang, Liuliu; Han, Yuling; Jaffré, Fabrice; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; Bram, Yaron; Wang, Pengfei; Zhu, Jiajun; Zhang, Tuo; Redmond, David; Houghton, Sean; Uhl, Skyler; Borczuk, Alain; Huang, Yaoxing; Richardson, Chanel; Chandar, Vasuretha; Acklin, Joshua A; Lim, Jean K; Xiang, Jenny; Ho, David D; tenOever, Benjamin R; Schwartz, Robert E; Evans, Todd; Chen, Zhengming; Chen, Shuibing",Circ. res,,238
382386,Olanzapine versus Metoclopramide for Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting in Advanced Cancer Patients with Incomplete Malignant Bowel Obstruction,2020,"BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants are the fundamental unit of traditional medicine system in Nepal. Nepalese people are rich in traditional medicine especially in folk medicine (ethnomedicine), and this system is gaining much attention after 1995. The use of medicinal plants has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic as a private behavior (not under the control of government). A lot of misinterpretations of the use of medicinal plants to treat or prevent COVID-19 have been spreading throughout Nepal which need to be managed proactively. In this context, a research was needed to document medicinal plants used, their priority of use in society, their cultivation status, and the source of information people follow to use them. This study aimed to document the present status of medicinal plant use and make important suggestion to the concerned authorities. METHODS: This study used a web-based survey to collect primary data related to medicinal plants used during COVID-19. A total of 774 respondents took part in the survey. The study calculated the relative frequencies of citation (RFC) for the recorded medicinal plants. The relationship between plants recorded and different covariates (age, gender education, occupation, living place, and treatment methods) was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon test. The relationship between the information sources people follow and the respondent characteristics was assessed using chi-square test. RESULTS: The study found that the use of medicinal plants has increased during COVID-19 and most of the respondents recommended medicinal plants to prevent COVID-19. This study recorded a total of 60 plants belonging to 36 families. The leaves of the plants were the most frequently used. The Zingiber officinale was the most cited species with the frequency of citation 0.398. Most of the people (45.61%) were getting medicinal plants from their home garden. The medicinal plants recorded were significantly associated with the education level, location of home, primary treatment mode, gender, and age class. The information source of plants was significantly associated with the education, gender, method of treatment, occupation, living with family, and location of home during the lockdown caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: People were using more medicinal plants during COVID-19 claiming that they can prevent or cure COVID-19. This should be taken seriously by concerned authorities. The authorities should test the validity of these medicinal plants and control the flow of false information spread through research and awareness programs.","Khadka, Dipak; Dhamala, Man Kumar; Li, Feifei; Aryal, Prakash Chandra; Magar, Pappu Rana; Bhatta, Sijar; Thakur, Manju Shree; Basnet, Anup; Cui, Dafang; Shi, Shi",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,,238

Since no successful treatment and vaccine have been reported, efforts to improve the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices are critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the general public knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in three developing countries (China, India, and Pakistan). The reason for choosing only three countries is to identify the cross-border effect statistically and data collection constraints. The IBM SPSS version 23.0 was used for descriptive, univariate, and multivariate analysis of the study. One thousand one hundred and sixty participants completed the study, one-quarter of them were female, and three-quarters were male. The study's findings evidenced that the knowledge and attitude correlation was 58.4% and between knowledge and practices 18.2%. Furthermore, the knowledge was found lower in females, among India and Pakistan, and people aged less and equivalent to 30 years. The attitudes among respondents were found poorer among unmarried females and India and Pakistan residents. While the practices found lower among employed, unemployed and, respondents had a bachelor's degree, and females reside in India. And future studies should focus on factors that influence the government regarding the imposition of lockdown, boost the economy in the pandemic, and motivate the general public to follow the health institution's instructions.","Qalati, Sikandar Ali; Ostic, Dragana; Fan, Mingyue; Dakhan, Sarfaraz Ahmed; Vela, Esthela Galvan; Zufar, Zuhaib; Sohu, Jan Muhammmad; Mei, Jinlan; Thuy, Troung Thi Hong",Int Q Community Health Educ,,238

385114,A case of treatment-resistant depression with psychogenic movement disorder during repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28 days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.","Del Pozo, Brandon; Rich, Josiah D",J Subst Abuse Treat,,238

We examined whether time spent grooming with others in a highly social mammal species was associated with infection status for gastrointestinal parasites. Of six parasites detected, one (Trichuris sp.) was associated with social grooming behaviors, but more specifically with direct physical contact with others. Individuals infected with Trichuris sp. spent significantly less time grooming conspecifics than those not infected, and time in direct contact with others was the major predictor of infection status. One model correctly predicted infection status for Trichuris sp. with a reliability of 95.17% overall when the variables used were time spent in direct contact and time spent grooming others. This decrease in time spent grooming and interacting with others is likely a sickness behavior displayed by individuals with less energy or motivation for non-essential behaviors. This study emphasizes the possible links between host behavior and parasitic infections and highlights the need for an understanding of a study population's parasitic infections when attempting to interpret animal behavior.","Wren, Brandi; Ray, Ian S; Remis, Melissa; Gillespie, Thomas R; Camp, Joseph",PLoS One,,238

Items measured behaviors currently established as primary strategies to prevent and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 infection. METHODS: An item pool of 29 questions was generated with the aim of estimating the frequency of specific behaviors and were written to avoid confounding the description of behavioral actions with evaluative judgements. Responses were collected from 401 young adults using an anonymous online survey. RESULTS: An Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted with the purpose of item reduction and subscale development. A 14-item Social Distance Scale emerged, consisting of four subscales: Isolation from Community (IC), Work from Home (WH), Family Contact (FC), and Protective Behaviors (PB). The initial psychometric evaluation of the scales indicated adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. (4) Conclusions: The Social Distance Scale (v1) is a promising new instrument which may be applied at the population or individual level.

The study aimed to analyze the clinical trial characteristics and vaccine development progress of the new Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) registered with the World Health Organization International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP).A comprehensive search of COVID-19 clinical trials since the establishment of the ICTRP to June 11, 2020, was conducted to record and analyze relevant characteristics. Chi-Squared test was used to compare the statistical differences between different research types, interventions, and sources.A total of 3282 COVID-19 clinical trials in 17 clinical trial registration centers were registered with the WHO ICTRP. The main research sources for the present study were ClinicalTrials.gov and ChiCTR. There were significant differences in the parameters of study location (Pâ=â.000), number of participants (Pâ=â.000), study duration (Pâ=â.001), research stage (Pâ=â.000), randomization procedure (Pâ=â.000), and blinding method (Pâ=â.000) between the 2 registration sources. There were significant differences in all the parameters between different kinds of intervention methods. Hydroxychloroquine, plasma therapy, and Xiyanping injection were the high-frequency research drugs used. Ten different vaccine studies were registered under phases I-II.Amongst the studies researched, heterogeneity existed for various parameters. Differences in the type of study, interventions, and registration sources of the studies led to significant differences in certain parameters of the COVID-19 clinical trials. The statistics of high-frequency drugs and the progress of vaccine trials may provide an informative reference for the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Song, Gao; Cheng, Meng Qun; Wei, Xian Wen",Medicine (Baltimore),,238

389758,"An Update on COVID-19 Pandemic: The Epidemiology, Pathogenesis, Prevention and Treatment Strategies",2020,"Understanding the transmission phenomena of SARS-CoV-2 by virus-laden droplets and aerosols is of paramount importance for controlling the current COVID-19 pandemic. Detailed information about the lifetime and kinematics of airborne droplets of different size is relevant in order to evaluate hygiene measures like wearing masks but also social distancing and ventilation concepts for indoor environments. However, the evaporation process of expiratory droplets and aerosols is not fully understood. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to present evaporation characteristics of saliva droplets. An acoustic levitator is utilized in conjunction with microscopic imaging for recording the temporal evolution of the evaporation of saliva droplets under well-defined ambient conditions. Following the evaporation of the water content, a saliva droplet reaches a final size, which remains stable in the timescale of hours. By investigating numerous droplets of different size, it was found that the final droplet diameter correlates well to 20 % of the initial diameter. This correlation is independent of the ambient conditions for a temperature range from 20 °C to 29 °C and a relative humidity from 6 % to up to 65 %. The experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics are implemented into a numerical model, which is based on one-dimensional droplet kinematics and a rapid mixing evaporation model. By taking into account the evaporation-falling curve as presented by Wells, the significance of the experimental results for predicting the lifetime of saliva droplets and aerosols is demonstrated. The numerical predictions may be used to determine the impact of the droplet size and the ambient conditions on the transmission risks of infectious diseases like COVID-19.","Lieber, Christian; Melekidis, Stefanos; Koch, Rainer; Bauer, Hans-Jörg",J Aerosol Sci,,238

In healthcare settings, environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 has been found in patients' rooms and toilets. Here, we investigated environmental presence of SARS-CoV-2 in non-healthcare settings and assessed the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection in removing virus contamination. A total of 428 environmental swabs and six air samples was taken from accommodation rooms, toilets and elevators that have been used by COVID-19 cases. By using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay, we detected two SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive samples in a room where a COVID-19 patient stayed prior to diagnosis. The present study highlights the risk of fomite-mediated transmission in non-healthcare settings and the importance of surface disinfection in spaces occupied by cases.

Here we show that three major factors influenced the early macro-geographical dynamics of COVID-19 in Brazil. Mathematical modeling revealed that the ""super-spreading city"" of São Paulo initially accounted for more than 85% of the case spread in the entire country. By adding only 16 other spreading cities, we accounted for 98-99% of the cases reported during the first 3 months of the pandemic in Brazil. Moreover, 26 federal highways accounted for about 30% of SARS-CoV-2's case spread. As cases increased in the Brazilian interior, the distribution of COVID-19 deaths began to correlate with the allocation of the country's intensive care units (ICUs), which is heavily weighted towards state capitals. Thus, severely ill patients living in the countryside had to be transported to state capitals to access ICU beds, creating a ""boomerang effect"" that contributed to skew the distribution of COVID-19 deaths. Therefore, if (i) a lockdown had been imposed earlier on in spreader-capitals, (ii) mandatory road traffic restrictions had been enforced, and (iii) a more equitable geographic distribution of ICU beds existed, the impact of COVID-19 in Brazil would be significantly lower.","Nicolelis, Miguel A L; Raimundo, Rafael L G; Peixoto, Pedro S; Andreazzi, Cecilia S",Sci Rep,,238
391198,Automatic Pleural Line Extraction and COVID-19 Scoring From Lung Ultrasound Data,2020,"The proteins of coronavirus are classified to nonstructural, structural, and accessory. There are 16 nonstructural viral proteins beside their precursors (1a and 1ab polyproteins). The nonstructural proteins are named as nsp1 to nsp16 and they act as enzymes, coenzymes, and binding proteins to facilitate the replication, transcription, and translation of the virus. The structural proteins are bound to the RNA in the nucleocapsid (N- protein) or to the lipid bilayer membrane of the viral envelope. The lipid bilayer proteins include the membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and spike protein (S). Beside their role as structural proteins, they are essential for the host cells binding and invasion. The SARS-CoV-2 contains six accessory proteins which participates in the viral replication, assembly and virus- host interactions. The SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins are orf3a, orf6, orf7a, orf7b, orf8, and orf10. The functions of the SARS-CoV-2 are not well known, while the functions of their corresponding proteins in SARS-CoV are either well known or poorly studied. Recently, the Oxford University and Pfizer and BioNTech made SARS-CoV-2 vaccines through targeting the spike protein gene. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the health authorities of the United Kingdom approved and started vaccination using the Pfizer and BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Also, The FDA of USA approved the treatment of COVID-19 using two monoclonal antibodies produced by Regeneron pharmaceuticals to target the spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be used for the diagnosis, as drug targets and in vaccination trials for COVID-19. For future COVID-19 research, more efforts should be done to elaborate the functions and structure of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins so as to use them as targets for COVID-19 drug and vaccines. Special attention should be drawn to extensive research on the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3, orf8, and orf10.","Mohammed, Mohammed Elimam Ahamed",Current molecular medicine (Online),,238

However, these key attributes of sustainability science often conflict with university structures and established academic work practices, for instance with regard to frequent long-distance travel. Such contradictions between key principles of sustainability and everyday practices are experienced by many researchers not only at university level, but also in their individual behaviors. To help resolve this widespread divergence, we present ten principles to foster the sustainability of a research group working in sustainability science, based on our personal experiences and experiments as research group leaders. These principles comprise: (1) monitor the environmental footprint, (2) foster learning and innovation, (3) reduce the environmental footprint, (4) nurture campus sustainability, (5) embrace sustainability in private life, (6) constructively deal with environmental anxiety, (7) design research projects for sustainability impact, (8) engage with stakeholders, (9) capitalize on sustainability teaching, and (10) recognize biases and limits. Applying sustainability principles in everyday research practices can provide important social tipping points that may trigger the spreading of new social norms and behaviors.","Plieninger, Tobias; Fagerholm, Nora; Bieling, Claudia",Sustain Sci,,238

METHODS: The CIO (Club Italiano dell'Osteosintesi) is an Italian society devoted to the study of traumatology that counts members spread in public and private hospitals throughout the country. Fifteen members of the CIO, Chairmen of 15 Orthopaedic and Trauma Units of level 1 or 2 trauma centres in Italy, have been involved in the study. They were asked to record data about surgical, outpatients clinics and ER activity from the 23rd of February to the 4th of April 2020. The data collected were compared with the data of the same timeframe of the previous year (2019). RESULTS: Comparing with last year, overall outpatient activity reduced up to 75%, overall Emergency Room (ER) trauma consultations up to 71%, elective surgical activity reduced up to 100% within two weeks and trauma surgery excluding femoral neck fractures up to 50%. The surgical treatment of femoral neck fractures showed a stable reduction from 15 to 20% without a significant variation during the timeframe. CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 outbreak showed a tremendous impact on all orthopaedic trauma activities throughout the country except for the surgical treatment of femoral neck fractures, which, although reduced, did not change in percentage within the analysed timeframe.","Benazzo, Francesco; Rossi, Stefano Marco Paolo; Maniscalco, Pietro; Moretti, Biagio; Vaienti, Enrico; Ruggieri, Pietro; Massè, Alessandro; Medici, Antonio; Formica, Alessandro; Di Maggio, Bruno; Caiaffa, Vincenzo; Mosconi, Mario; Murena, Luigi; D039,; Angelo, Fabio; Belluati, Alberto; Mazza, Emilio Luigi; Rivera, Fabrizio; Castelli, Alberto; Ghiara, Matteo; Rosolani, Marco; Cioffi, Raffaele; Pezzella, Raffaele; Scaravilli, Gabriele; Bove, Giovanni; Stissi, Placido; Mazzacane, Michael; Quattrini, Fabrizio; Ciatti, Corrado; Trovarelli, Giulia; Pala, Elisa; Angelini, Andrea; Sanna, Francesco; Nonne, Daniela; Colombelli, Andrea; Raggini, Filippo; Puzzo, Agnese; Canton, Gianluca; Maritan, Guido; Iuliano, Angela; Randelli, Pietro; Solarino, Giuseppe; Moretti, Lorenzo; Vicenti, Giovanni; Garofalo, Nunzia; Nappi, Vittorio; Ripanti, Simone; Chinni, Carmela; Pogliacomi, Francesco; Visigalli, Alberto; Bini, Nathalie",Int Orthop,,238
392637,Dexamethasone to combat cytokine storm in COVID-19: Clinical trials and preliminary evidence,2020,"The COVID-19 became a pandemic in early 2020. It was found, at first, that the main manifestations of this new virus occur through respiratory and constitutional symptoms. Therefore, chest tomography was elected as the best imaging test to assess the extent of pulmonary involvement and as a good prognostic predictor for the disease. However, as new studies were produced, the gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 becomes more evident, with reports from patients who manifested mainly or only gastrointestinal symptoms in the course of the disease. Thus, in some cases, the initial investigation is carried out at the emergency department with an abdominal computed tomography. We report a case series of ten patients who came to the emergency department of our institution with a chief gastrointestinal complaint, and were initially submitted to an abdominal computed tomography as the first investigation. Although most of the patients did not have significant changes in the abdominal images, most reported patients had pulmonary findings visualized at the lung bases, which were later designated as typical COVID-19 pulmonary findings on chest computed tomography. Only one patient had atypical COVID-19 lung changes on chest computed tomography. All patients had a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19. It is imperative to alert radiologists, especially abdominal radiologists, with the possibility of COVID-19 isolated gastrointestinal symptoms. Besides, it must become a habit to radiologists to assess the pulmonary basis on abdominal scans, a site commonly affected by the new coronavirus.","Amaral, Lucas Tadashi Wada; Brito, Vanessa Mizubuti; Beraldo, Gabriel Laverdi; Fonseca, Eduardo Kaiser Ururahy Nunes; Yokoo, Patrícia; Talans, Aley; Oranges Filho, Marcelo; Chate, Rodrigo Caruso; Baroni, Ronaldo Hueb; Szarf, Gilberto",Einstein (Sao Paulo),,238

In addition, not much is known about the effects of clear masks (i.e., transparent face shields) versus opaque masks on language comprehension in children. In the current study, 2-year-old infants were tested on their ability to recognize familiar spoken words in three conditions: words presented with no mask, words presented through a clear mask, and words presented through an opaque mask. Infants were able to recognize familiar words presented without a mask and when hearing words through opaque masks, but not when hearing words through clear masks. Findings suggest that the ability of infants to recover spoken language input through masks varies depending on the surface properties of the mask.","Singh, Leher; Tan, Agnes; Quinn, Paul C",Dev. sci,,238

We provide a full account of how our models function, and how they can be used to explore many different aspects of contagion, including: experimenting with different lockdown measures, with connectivity between places, with the tracing of disease clusters and the use of improved contact tracing and isolation. We provide comprehensive results showing the use of these models in given scenarios, and conclude that explicitly regionalised models for mitigation provide significant advantages over a 'one size fits all' approach.

395422,Oxytocin as a potential defence against Covid-19?,2020,"MotivationWith the coronavirus pandemic still raging, prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays could help prevent infection and reduce viral load. Niclosamide has the potential to treat a broad range of viral infections if local bioavailability is optimized as mucin-penetrating solutions as opposed to more traditional microparticle-based sprays that cannot penetrate the mucin. ExperimentalpH-dependence of supernatant concentrations and dissolution rates of niclosamide were measured in buffered solutions by Nanodrop-UV/Vis-spectroscopy for niclosamide from different suppliers, as precipitated material, and as cosolvates. Data was compared to predictions from Henderson Hasselbalch and precipitation pH models. Optimal microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of precipitated and converted niclosamide. ResultsSupernatant-concentrations of niclosamide increased with increasing pH, from 1.77uM at pH 3.66 to 30uM at pH 8, and more rapidly from 90uM at pH8.5 to 300uM at pH 9.1, reaching 641uM at pH 9.5. Logarithmic rates for dissolution increased by [~]3x for pHs 8.62 to 9.44. However, when precipitated from supersaturated solution, niclosamide equilibrated to much lower final supernatant concentrations, reflective of more stable polymorphs at each pH that were also apparent for niclosamide from other suppliers and cosolvates. ConclusionsGiven niclosamides activity against COVID19, its more contagious variants, and other respiratory viral infections, these niclosamide solutions, that put the virus in lockdown, could represent universal prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays. As solutions they would be the simplest and potentially most effective formulations from both an efficacy standpoint as well as manufacturing and distribution, with no cold chain. They now just need testing.","Needham, David",,,238

OBJECTIVE: The present narrative review aims to compile and synthesize the literature related to social isolation produced during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. METHOD: This study is a narrative review of the literature on social isolation in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic. RESULTS: 73 publications were included for full-text reading and were classified into the following categories: levels of social isolation, economic effects, family relationships, health system, mental health of the population, and use of technology. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to plan an escalation of responses to the consequences of the pandemic, especially in view of the increased demand on the health sector and social services. The negative effects of social isolation can be prevented by public policies that offer a response to the economic recession, maintenance of social work, encouragement of quality care in mental health services, and community support for vulnerable families.","Both, Luciane Maria; Zoratto, Gustavo; Calegaro, Vitor Crestani; Ramos-Lima, Luis Francisco; Negretto, Bianca Lorenzi; Hauck, Simone; Freitas, Lucia Helena Machado",Trends psychiatry psychother.

METHODS: In May 2020, we conducted an online survey of 19 carceral systems that provided methadone and/or buprenorphine treatment for incarcerated populations before COVID-19. Eleven survey items examined challenges and changes to these programs as a result of the pandemic. Sixteen of 19 programs (84%) responded to the survey. RESULTS: Ten out of 16 systems reported downsizing their OAT programs. Seven of 16 systems made changes to medication dispensation processes. Half of systems report challenges implementing physical distancing (nâ=â8), and/or obtaining personal protective equipment (nâ=â8). In 13 out of 16 systems some OAT program participants were released early due to COVID-19 infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: Jails and prisons with existing OAT programs have curtailed their operations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the robust evidence base around OAT for treating opioid use disorder and averting overdose deaths, guidance is needed on maintaining and ramping up medication access as carceral facilities grapple with implementing COVID-19 mitigation.","Bandara, Sachini; Kennedy-Hendricks, Alene; Merritt, Sydney; Barry, Colleen L; Saloner, Brendan",J Addict Med,,238
400323,Clinical trials of inhaled beclomethasone and mometasone for COVID-19 should be conducted,2020,"On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Subsequent investigations identified a novel coronavirus, now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from the affected patients. Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics are important for controlling the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this study, we developed and compared the performance of three novel real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the reported RdRp-P2 assay, which is used in >30 European laboratories. Among the three novel assays, the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection in vitro (1.8 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]/ml with genomic RNA and 11.2 RNA copies/reaction with in vitro RNA transcripts). Among 273 specimens from 15 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 77 (28.2%) were positive by both the COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and RdRp-P2 assays. The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay was positive for an additional 42 RdRp-P2-negative specimens (119/273 [43.6%] versus 77/273 [28.2%]; P < 0.001), including 29/120 (24.2%) respiratory tract specimens and 13/153 (8.5%) non-respiratory tract specimens. The mean viral load of these specimens was 3.21 × 104 RNA copies/ml (range, 2.21 × 102 to 4.71 × 105 RNA copies/ml). The COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human-pathogenic coronaviruses and respiratory pathogens in cell culture and clinical specimens, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay cross-reacted with SARS-CoV in cell culture. The highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-RdRp/Hel assay may help to improve the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19.","Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Tang, Tommy Hing-Cheung; Wong, Sally Cheuk-Ying; Leung, Kit-Hang; Fung, Agnes Yim-Fong; Ng, Anthony Chin-Ki; Zou, Zijiao; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Choi, Garnet Kwan-Yue; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Tsang, Owen Tak-Yin; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",J. clin. microbiol,,238

A series of odds ratio comparisons and measures of association were carried out. Results show significant likelihood of online gambling among those classified as high-risk gamblers (according to the Problem Gambling Severity Index) and those with past experience of online gambling, though migration from land-based gambling was apparent. Among high-risk online gamblers, the most predictive risk factors included moderate and severe anxiety and depression, reduced work hours, being influenced to gamble due to COVID-19, gambling under the influence of cannabis or alcohol and risky gambling motives tied to mental health concerns, including gambling because it helps with nervousness and depression, chasing gambling losses and seeking to earn income. This study has confirmed many of the risk associations presented in emerging COVID-19-related studies and past research on global economic crisis relating to gambling risk, mental health concerns and substance use. However, unlike many past studies, the present paper takes note of all of these elements holistically and provides incremental clarity on online gambling risk factors during the pandemic, specifically.","Price, Alex",Int J Ment Health Addict,,238
401341,COVID-19 vaccination options for immunosuppressed cancer patients,2021,"Treatment options for COVID-19 remain limited, especially during the early or asymptomatic phase. Here, we report a novel SARS-CoV-2 viral replication mechanism mediated by interactions between ACE2 and the epigenetic eraser enzyme LSD1, and its interplay with the nuclear shuttling importin pathway. Recent studies have shown a critical role for the importin pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and many RNA viruses hijack this axis to re-direct host cell transcription. LSD1 colocalized with ACE2 at the cell surface to maintain demethylated SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain lysine 31 to promote virus-ACE2 interactions. Two newly developed peptide inhibitors competitively inhibited virus-ACE2 interactions, and demethylase access to significantly inhibit viral replication. Similar to some other predominantly plasma membrane proteins, ACE2 had a novel nuclear function: its cytoplasmic domain harbors a nuclear shuttling domain, which when demethylated by LSD1 promoted importin-α-dependent nuclear ACE2 entry following infection to regulate active transcription. A novel, cell permeable ACE2 peptide inhibitor prevented ACE2 nuclear entry, significantly inhibiting viral replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cell lines, outperforming other LSD1 inhibitors. These data raise the prospect of post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2, either through repurposed LSD1 inhibitors or new, nuclear-specific ACE2 inhibitors.","Tu, W. J.; McCuaig, R.

402014,Patient satisfaction scores with telemedicine in the neurosurgical population,2021,"BACKGROUND: The unprecedented rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has faced SARS-CoV- (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy, which is partially fueled by the misinformation and conspiracy theories propagated by anti-vaccine groups on social media. Research is needed to better understand the early COVID-19 anti-vaccine activities on social media. METHODS: This study chronicles the social media posts concerning COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines by leading anti-vaccine groups (Dr Tenpenny on Vaccines, the National Vaccine Information Center [NVIC] the Vaccination Information Network [VINE]) and Vaccine Machine in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (February-May 2020). RESULTS: Analysis of 2060 Facebook posts showed that anti-vaccine groups were discussing COVID-19 in the first week of February 2020 and were specifically discussing COVID-19 vaccines by mid-February 2020. COVID-19 posts by NVIC were more widely disseminated and showed greater influence than non-COVID-19 posts. Early COVID-19 posts concerned mistrust of vaccine safety and conspiracy theories. CONCLUSION: Major anti-vaccine groups were sowing seeds of doubt on Facebook weeks before the US government launched its vaccine development program 'Operation Warp Speed'. Early anti-vaccine misinformation campaigns outpaced public health messaging and hampered the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kalichman, Seth C; Eaton, Lisa A; Earnshaw, Valerie A; Brousseau, Natalie",J. public health (Oxf),,238

403316,Adherence to COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients: promote it and make it happen!,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a new era in the world while we still figure out the consequences in different aspects of our daily life. The food supply chain and the food industry do not comprise an exception. Scope and approach: This review summarizes the possible transmission ways of COVID-19 through the foods, food supply chain, surfaces, and environment before exploring the development of corresponding detection tools of SARS-CoV-2. For the time being, the possibility of transmission through the food sector is considered negligible, and tracing of SARS-CoV-2 in working environments is not considered as a priority by public authorities. However, the adverse effects on the environment, food systems, and people along the food supply chain are already evident. Key findings and conclusions: As long as we move from farm to fork, more safety measures are needed since more people (and subsequently more potential sources of infection) are involved in the process. The need for developing respective bioanalytical protocols for food and environmental safety applications to adapt in the post-lockdown period is also highlighted.","Rizou, Myrto; Galanakis, Ioannis M.; Aldawoud, Turki M.S.; Galanakis, Charis M.",Trends Food Sci.

403401,A collateral effect of the COVID-19 pandemic: Delayed diagnosis in pediatric solid tumors,2020,"The SARS CoV-2 pandemic has affected millions of people around the globe. Despite many efforts to find some effective medicines against SARS CoV-2, no established therapeutics are available yet. The use of phytochemicals as antiviral agents provides hope against the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. Several natural compounds were analyzed by virtual screening against six SARS CoV-2 protein targets using molecular docking simulations in the present study. More than a hundred plant-derived secondary metabolites have been docked, including alkaloids, flavonoids, coumarins, and steroids. SARS CoV-2 protein targets include Main protease (MPro), Papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Spike glycoprotein (S), Helicase (Nsp13), and E-Channel protein. Phytochemicals were evaluated by molecular docking, and MD simulations were performed using the YASARA structure using a modified genetic algorithm and AMBER03 force field. Binding energies and dissociation constants allowed the identification of potentially active compounds. Ligand-protein interactions provide an insight into the mechanism and potential of identified compounds. Glycyrrhizin and its metabolite 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid have shown a strong binding affinity for MPro, helicase, RdRp, spike, and E-channel proteins, while a flavonoid Baicalin also strongly binds against PLpro and RdRp.

There is a risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during endoscopic procedures. The International Organization for the study of IBD [IOIBD] has developed 11 position statements, based on an online survey, that focus on how to prioritise endoscopies in IBD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, alternative modes for disease monitoring, and ways to triage the high number of postponed endoscopies after the pandemic. We propose to pre-screen patients for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and test for SARS-CoV-2 before endoscopy if available. High priority endoscopies during pandemic include acute gastrointestinal bleed, acute severe ulcerative colitis, new IBD diagnosis, cholangitis in primary sclerosing cholangitis, and partial bowel obstruction. Alternative modes of monitoring using clinical symptoms, serum inflammatory markers, and faecal calprotectin should be considered during the pandemic. Prioritising access to endoscopy in the post-pandemic period should be guided by control of COVID-19 in the local community and availability of manpower and personal protective equipment. Endoscopy should be considered within 3 months after the pandemic for patients with a past history of dysplasia and endoscopic resection for dysplastic lesion. Endoscopy should be considered 3-6 months after the pandemic for assessment of postoperative recurrence or new biologic initiation. Endoscopy can be postponed until after 6 months of pandemic for routine IBD surveillance and assessment of mucosal healing.","Ng, Siew C; Mak, Joyce Wing Yan; Hitz, Lara; Chowers, Yehuda; Bernstein, Charles N; Silverberg, Mark S",J Crohns Colitis,,238
404769,Fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19: Could hypochlorhydria play a role?,2020,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 proteins binding human mRNAs (SPBRs) have been proven to regulate a variety of tumor-related functions in different types of cancer. However, their biological roles and potential mechanisms in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are still elusive. Herein, we investigate the expression and prognostic value of SPBRs in ccRCC through bioinformatics methods. Methods: Data downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to screen differentially expressed SPBRs (DE-SPBRs) between ccRCC samples and noncancerous samples. Metascape was utilized to perform function and pathway enrichment analyses of these DE-SPBRs. Kaplan-Meier method of overall survival (OS) was used to assess the prognostic value of DE-SPBRs in ccRCC patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to identify candidate SPBRs, which were independently associated with overall survival of ccRCC patients. Subsequently, several internationally renowned databases were employed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of candidate SPBRs to further investigate their roles and mechanisms in ccRCC. Results: A total of 33 DE-SPBRs, including 18 upregulated SPBRs and 17 downregulated SPBRs, were screened between ccRCC samples and noncancerous samples. Among them, two candidate SPBRs, KDELC1 and TRMT1, were identified. Additionally, we observed that upregulated KDELC1/TRMT1 expression in ccRCC at both gene and protein levels was significantly associated with clinicopathological features. Furthermore, we found that KDELC1/TRMT1 genetic mutation has an unfavorable influence on prognosis of patients with ccRCC. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that KDELC1/TRMT1 was closely enriched in several vital biological processes and pathways. Finally, we noticed that KDELC1/TRMT1 was remarkably associated with immune infiltrates. Conclusion: In summary, we screened DE-SPBRs of ccRCC, which were enriched mainly in various biological and signaling pathways with tumor progression. Furthermore, we identified two candidate DE-SPBRs (KDELC1 and TRMT1), which could serve as promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets of patients with ccRCC.","Li, C.; Yao, Y.; Long, D.; Lin, X.",International journal of general medicine,,238

409282,A sobering addition to the literature on COVID-19 and the brain,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the environmental factors essential for infection control in senior-living facilities. BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are more likely to be infected and develop serious outcomes than young people. Worldwide, senior-living facilities face a battle to protect their residents. Compared with age-related declines, the built environment is more modifiable and can be used for infection control. METHODS: This research conducted content analysis of the guidelines on COVID-19 control issued by the State Council of China in February 2020 for senior-living facilities. Six senior-living facility managers in China were interviewed and shared their experiences using these guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to identify the essential environmental factors for infection control. RESULTS: Environmental factors suggested in the guidelines were analyzed for three groups of infection-control strategies: keep COVID-19 from entering the facility, prevent COVID-19 spread in the facility, and manage infection and illness. Key topics of experience using the guidelines were identified, including residents' needs for social interaction and the difficulties of providing dedicated air-conditioning and circulation systems. Based on these analyses, from the perspective of environmental design, environmental factors essential for COVID-19 control in senior-living facilities were summarized at the site, building, and room levels. CONCLUSION: Proper planning and design of the built environment promote strategies for infection control in senior-living facilities. Findings can be used to guide the new design, renovation, and modification of senior-living facilities for COVID-19 control and future public health emergencies.","Wang, Zhe",HERD,,238

The internet technology and big data were used to grasp the trend and asthma control of children who had been at home for a long time due to the pandemic, so as to facilitate the management. Methods: By random cluster sampling survey method, according to the needs and medication adherence score, the electronic ""questionnaire star"" was designed to conduct a survey among children (0 to 14 years old) who diagnosed with asthma and joined the CCAAP on the basis of bronchial asthma medication adherence scale. Finally, the results of electronic questionnaire survey were analyzed. Results: A total of 423 questionnaires were sent out, 422 of which were valid, with an effective response rate of 99.7%. The results of questionnaire survey showed that 296 cases were male, accounting for 70.1%, and 126 cases were female, accounting for 29.9%, with an average age of (5.4±2.6) years old. The average age of males and females was (5.3±2.6) and (5.4±2.6) years old, respectively. There were more children aged &#8805;5 years than children who were younger than 5 years. Additionally, 13.95% of the parents thought that the pandemic had more than moderate impact on children with asthma, and 76.12% of the children were in the green zone and had no asthma attack. The proportion of green zone inhaled drugs (79.8%) was higher than yellow zone and red zone (49.8%). After using the CCAAP platform, the dissatisfaction rate was only 1.42%. Moreover, 71.87% of the children's medical expenses decreased, and the proportion of frequent use and intermittent use of antibiotics reduced, however, the proportion of occasional use and never use of antibiotics increased significantly (all P<0.05). The average score of drug compliance was 4.56, and the more frequently the platform was used, the higher the score of medication compliance was (P<0.05). Conclusions: After using CCAAP management with the aid of internet technology, children with asthma who had been isolated at home for a long time were less affected by COVID-19, with high medication compliance, generally lower medical expenses, significantly reduced use of antibiotics, and high satisfaction.

A set of indicators and mathematical models are introduced that aim to quantitatively describe changes in crime levels in comparison to what could otherwise be expected, and what might be expected by way of adaptation and subsequent resumption of those patterns. The validity of the proposed resilience assessment tool is demonstrated using commercial theft data from the COVID-19 pandemic period. A 64 per cent reduction in crime was found in the studied city (China) during an 83-day period, before daily crime levels bounced back to higher than expected values. The proposed resilience indicators are recommended as benchmarking instruments for evaluating and comparing the global impact of COVID-19 policies on crime and public safety.","Borrion, Hervé; Kurland, Justin; Tilley, Nick; Chen, Peng",PLoS One,,238

411614,Continuity of Cancer Care: The Surgical Experience of Two Large Cancer Hubs in London and Milan,2021,"Hurricane Harvey (Harvey), a slow-moving storm, struck the Texas coast as a category 4 hurricane. Over the course of 53 days, the floodwaters of Harvey delivered 14 × 109 m3 of freshwater to Galveston Bay. This resulted in record flooding of Houston bayous and waterways, all of which drained into the San Jacinto Estuary (SJE,) with its main tributaries being Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. The lower SJE and lower Buffalo Bayou has experienced up to 3 m of land subsidence in the past 100 years and, as a result, prior to Hurricane Harvey, up to 2 m of sediment within the upper seabed contained an archive of high concentrations of Total Hg (HgT) and other particle-bound and porewater contaminants. Within the SJE, Harvey eroded at least 48 cm of the sediment column, resulting in the transport of an estimated 16.4 × 106 tons of sediment and at least 2 tons of Hg into Galveston Bay. This eroded sediment was replaced by a Harvey storm deposit of 7.73 × 106 tons of sediment and 0.96 tons within the SJE, mostly sourced from Buffalo Bayou. Considering that the frequency of slow-moving tropical cyclones capable of delivering devastating rainfall may be increasing, then one can expect that delivery of Hg and other contaminants from the archived sediment within urbanized estuaries will increase and that what happened during Harvey is a harbinger of what is to come.","Dellapenna, Timothy M; Hoelscher, Christena; Hill, Lisa; Al Mukaimi, Mohammad E; Knap, Anthony",Sci Total Environ,,238

412093,Chest MRI of patients with COVID-19,2021,"IntroductionIn recent years Ethiopia has made enormous strides in enhancing access to health care, especially, maternal and child health care (MCH). With the onset and spread of Covid-19, the attention of the health care system has pivoted to handling the disease, potentially at the cost of other health care needs. This paper explores whether this shift has come at the cost of non-Covid related health care, especially the use of MCH services. MethodsGraphs, descriptive statistics and paired t-tests of significance are used to compare levels of inpatient and outpatient health care service utilization before and after the onset and spread of the virus. The analysis is based on a survey of 59 health centers and 29 public hospitals located in urban Ethiopia - the most acutely affected region of the country. Data on the use of health care services for a period of 24 months was gathered from the health management information systems (HMIS) of these facilities. ResultsThere is a sharp reduction in the use of both inpatient (20-27%) and outpatient (27-34%) care, particularly in Addis Ababa, which has been most acutely affected by the virus. However, the decline does not come at the cost of MCH services. The use of several MCH components (skilled birth attendant deliveries, immunization, post-natal care) remains unaffected throughout the period while others (family planning services, ante-natal care) experience a decline (8-17%) in the immediate aftermath but recover soon after. ConclusionConcerns about the crowding out of MCH services due to the focus on Covid 19 are unfounded. Pro-active measures taken by the government and health care facilities to ring-fence the use of essential health care services have mitigated service disruptions. The results underline the resilience and agility displayed by one of the worlds most resource-constrained health care systems.

412380,Systemic sclerosis-related digital calcinosis; a pilot study of cutaneous oxygenation and perfusion,2020,"Background: The emergence of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented an unprecedented global challenge for the healthcare community. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to get transmitted during the asymptomatic phase, and its high infectivity have led to the rapid transmission of COVID-19 beyond geographic regions facilitated by international travel, leading to a pandemic. To guide effective control and interventions, primary data is required urgently, globally, including from low- and middle-income countries where documentation of cardiovascular manifestations and risk factors in people hospitalized with COVID-19 is limited. Objectives: This study aims to describe the cardiovascular manifestations and cardiovascular risk factors in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Methods: We propose to conduct an observational cohort study involving 5000 patients recruited from hospitals in low-, middle- and high-income countries. Eligible adult COVID-19 patients will be recruited from the participating hospitals and followed-up until 30 days post admission. The outcomes will be reported at discharge and includes the need of ICU admission, need of ventilator, death (with cause), major adverse cardiovascular events, neurological outcomes, acute renal failure, and pulmonary outcomes. Conclusion: Given the enormous burden posed by COVID-19 and the associated severe prognostic implication of CVD involvement, this study will provide useful insights on the risk factors for severe disease, clinical presentation, and outcomes of various cardiovascular manifestations in COVID-19 patients particularly from low and middle income countries from where the data remain scant.","Sliwa, Karen; Singh, Kavita; Raspail, Lana; Ojji, Dike; Lam, Carolyn S P; Thienemann, Friedrich; Ge, Junbo; Banerjee, Amitava; Newby, L Kristin; Ribeiro, Antonio Luiz P; Gidding, Samuel; Pinto, Fausto; Perel, Pablo; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj",Glob Heart,,238
412607,Cancer Patients and Risk of Mortality for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Isolation gowns are one of the crucial pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the migration of microorganisms and body fluids from patients to health care personnel and vice versa. Underperforming isolation gowns in terms of fluid resistance, could potentially put lives in danger. Wearing multiple layers of isolation gowns could theoretically increase the fluid penetration resistance. This study investigates if 2-layer lower barrier level isolation gowns meet the barrier effectiveness requirements of a single higher barrier level isolation gown. METHODS: Three commonly used ANSI/AAMI Level 2 isolation gown models were selected and tested in single layer and double layer configurations in accordance with ANSI/AAMI PB70 requirements. RESULTS: Total of 240 experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of gown model, fabric region, and the number of gown layers on AATCC 127 and AATCC 42 test results. In regard to AATCC 42, there was a significant difference among the different gown models, and the number of gown layers. Similar to AATCC 42 results, there was a significant difference among the different gown models, and the number of gown layers for AATCC 127; additionally, the gown regions was also significantly different. CONCLUSION: Test results demonstrated that the double layer isolation gown configurations do not always provide equal fluid penetration resistance as required for a single Level 3 isolation gown using the standard test methods specified in ANSI/AAMI PB70.","Kahveci, Zafer; Kilinc-Balci, F Selcen; Yorio, Patrick L",Am. j. infect. control,,238

412825,The Role of Nutrition during the COVID-19 Pandemic: What We Know,2021,"Today, in the United States, we have a health care system that is designed to treat symptoms, not people-and to do so as cheaply as possible with the dual goals of minimizing costs and preventing hospital visits. We are failing on all fronts. We spend more money on health care per capita than our Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) peers, and our outcomes are mediocre at best. Medicine is not personal, health care professionals often have their hands tied by payers, and geography has too much influence on the quality of care available. This has to end, especially since we have the technology to create a truly patient-focused, whole-person approach-one that treats physical and mental health equally and meets people where they are in every sense. Telemedicine can level the playing field and enable higher quality, decentralized care that-when needed-brings specialty care to the masses. Other technologies have an important role, too. For patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1 diabetes), widespread uptake of continuous glucose monitors may be the game-changer we need right now that can facilitate telemedicine to remote places and remove health care disparities. Both health professionals and patients will win-and ultimately payers will, too.","Panzirer, David",Diabetes Technol Ther,,238

Examining patterns that emerged as the pandemic unfolded in Metropolitan Detroit, with disproportionate impacts on African American and low-income communities, we consider conditions that contributed to excess exposure, mortality, and reduced access to critical health protective resources. Using a life course framework, we consider enduring impacts of the pandemic for health equity. Finally, we suggest several strategic actions in three focal areas-environment, occupation, and housing-that can be taken by health educators working in partnership with community members, researchers, and decision makers, using, for example, a community-based participatory research approach, to reduce adverse impacts of COVID-19 and promote long-term equity in health.","Schulz, Amy J; Mehdipanah, Roshanak; Chatters, Linda M; Reyes, Angela G; Neblett, Enrique W; Israel, Barbara A",Health Educ Behav,,238
413531,COVID-19 mortality in cancer patients: a report from a tertiary cancer centre in India,2021,"BACKGROUND: In 2017, the Vietnam Ministry of Health conducted a demonstration project to introduce seasonal influenza vaccination to health care workers. A total of 11,000 doses of influenza vaccine, single-dose prefilled syringes, were provided free to HCWs at 29 selected hospitals, clinics, and research institutes in four provinces: Hanoi, Khanh Hoa, Dak Lak and Ho Chi Minh City. METHODS: Before the campaign, a workshop was organized to discuss an implementation plan including technical requirements, cold chain, uptake reporting, and surveillance for adverse events following immunization. All sites distributed communication materials and encouraged their staff to register for vaccination. Following immunization sessions, sites sent reports on uptake and adverse events following immunization. Left-over vaccine was transferred to other sites to maximize vaccine use. RESULTS: The average uptake was 57% for all health care workers, with 11 sites achieving 90% and above. These 11 sites were small with less than 500 staff, including 5 primary hospitals, 3 preventive medicine units, and 2 referral hospitals. Among the six biggest sites with over 1000 staff, four sites had the lowest uptake (14-47%). Most of the high-uptake sites were from the central to the south; only one site, a referral hospital, was from the north. After redistribution of left-over vaccine, only 130 vaccine doses (1.2%) were not used and destroyed. Based on factors that affected uptake, including registration levels, differing communication strategies, availability of vaccination, and commitment by health facility leaders, we recommended ways to increase health care worker coverage; recommendations to improve reporting adverse events following immunization were also made. CONCLUSIONS: The project demonstrated that it was feasible to conduct influenza vaccination campaigns among health care workers in Vietnam. Improvements in promotion of registration, more intense pre-planning, especially at larger facilities, and wider, more consistent availability of communication materials will result in increased efficiency and coverage in this program's future expansion.","Ha, Nga T; Nguyen, Thoa T M; Nguyen, Tung X; Tran, Phu D; Nguyen, Hang M; Ha, Van T; Lafond, Kathryn E; Seward, Jane F; McFarland, Jeffrey W; Chu, Susan Y",BMC Health Serv Res,,238

413952,The Impact of Changes in Service Delivery in Patients With Colorectal Cancer During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Backgrounds: With the rapid spread of COVID-19, strict home confinement has been implemented in most parts of Chinese regions. Millions of people were not allowed to leave their homes except for special reasons. Home confinement plays an essential role in curbing pandemic and promoting preventive behaviors, but it may affect individuals' mental health as well. Objects: The objective of this study was to explore the psychological impacts of home confinement. Materials and Methods: We collected more than 150,360 Weibo messages from 5,370 Chinese active users, and then extracted psycho-linguistic features from these messages. Psycho-linguistic analysis was carried out using the 2 (confinement vs. non-confinement) x 2 (before vs. after confinement) repeated measure analysis of variance (RM ANOVA). Results: The results showed that the frequency of positive emotion words was remarkably decreased during home confinement [F (1,5368) = 7.926, p = 0.005, eta2 = 0.001]. In high-endemic subgroup, home confinement also reduced the frequency of exclusion words [F (1,3445) = 4.518, p = 0.034, eta2 = 0.001] and inhibition words [F (1,3445) = 10.154, p = 0.001, eta2 = 0.003]. Conclusion: Home confinement caused a decline in the use of positive emotion words. This indicates that home confinement can increase the frequency of negative emotions. The changes of exclusion words and inhibition words in high-endemic areas may be related to the high epidemic threat and the urgent need for social distancing in these areas.","Wu, P.; Zhao, N.; Li, S.; Liu, Z.; Wang, Y.; Liu, T.; Liu, X.; Zhu, T.",Frontiers in Psychology,,238
414257,"Three novel prevention, diagnostic, and treatment options for COVID-19 urgently necessitating controlled randomized trials",2020,"Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic. A classifier combining chest X-ray (CXR) with clinical features may serve as a rapid screening approach. Methods: The study included 512 patients with COVID-19 and 106 with influenza A/B pneumonia. A deep neural network (DNN) was applied, and deep features derived from CXR and clinical findings formed fused features for diagnosis prediction. Results: The clinical features of COVID-19 and influenza showed different patterns. Patients with COVID-19 experienced less fever, more diarrhea, and more salient hypercoagulability. Classifiers constructed using the clinical features or CXR had an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.909 and 0.919, respectively. The diagnostic efficacy of the classifier combining the clinical features and CXR was dramatically improved and the AUC was 0.952 with 91.5% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity. Moreover, combined classifier was functional in both severe and non-serve COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.971 with 96.9% sensitivity in non-severe cases, which was on par with the computed tomography (CT)-based classifier, but had relatively inferior efficacy in severe cases compared to CT. In extension, we performed a reader study involving three experienced pulmonary physicians, artificial intelligence (AI) system demonstrated superiority in turn-around time and diagnostic accuracy compared with experienced pulmonary physicians. Conclusions: The classifier constructed using clinical and CXR features is efficient, economical, and radiation safe for distinguishing COVID-19 from influenza A/B pneumonia, serving as an ideal rapid screening tool during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xia, Yang; Chen, Weixiang; Ren, Hongyi; Zhao, Jianping; Wang, Lihua; Jin, Rui; Zhou, Jiesen; Wang, Qiyuan; Yan, Fugui; Zhang, Bin; Lou, Jian; Wang, Shaobin; Li, Xiaomeng; Zhou, Jie; Xia, Liming; Jin, Cheng; Feng, Jianjiang; Li, Wen; Shen, Huahao",Int J Biol Sci,,238
414443,Registry Study Describes COVID-19 Mortality and Hospitalization in Patients with Breast Cancer,2021,"Background: The aim of this study was to observe the preventive effect of flavonoids extracted from Malus asiatica Nakai leaves (FMANL) on esophageal cancer in mice, especially the ability of FMANL to regulate the interleukin 17 (IL-17) signaling pathway during this process. Materials and Methods: The C57BL/6J mice were treated with 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4NQO) to induce esophageal cancer, and the visceral tissue index and the serum and esophageal tissue indexes of mice were used to verify the effect of FMANL. Results: The experimental results showed that FMANL can effectively control the changes in visceral tissue caused by esophageal cancer. FMANL could increase the cytokine levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and decrease the cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 12p70 (IL-12p70) in serum of mice with esophageal cancer. FMANL could also reduce CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ and enhance CD19+ mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes. The results of qPCR and Western blot analysis showed that FMANL could down-regulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-17, interleukin 23 (IL-23), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1ß), chemokine (C-X-C) ligand 1 (CXCL1), chemokine (C-X-C) ligand 2 (CXCL2), S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8), S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP-9), and matrix metalloprotein 13 (MMP-1) in mice with esophageal cancer. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection showed that FMANL contained 10 chemicals, including rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, dihydroquercetin, quercitrin, hesperidin, myricetin, baicalin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, and quercetin. Conclusion: It could be concluded that FMANL can effectively prevent experimentally induced esophageal cancer in mice, and its effects might be obtained from 10 compounds present in FMANL.","Jia, Xiang-Bo; Zhang, Quan; Xu, Lei; Yao, Wen-Jian; Wei, Li",Onco Targets Ther,,238

The nanoparticles have developed by induced albumin self-assembly with glutathione as reducing agent. The chemical, physical and biocompatible properties of the T807/ETm-HSA nanoparticles have been characterised by hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering and confocal laser scanning microscopy techniques. The unique targeting properties of the nanoparticles after fabrication with the brain-targeted ligand T807 was demonstrated by their attaching to brain cells as well as their enhanced transport ability to cross the BBB. In a further demonstration of their ability to target brain cells, in vivo living imaging revealed that T807/ETm-HSA nanoparticles accumulated in the mice brain after intravenous injection. The surface modification of ETm/HSA nanoparticles with the brain-targeted T807 demonstrated in this work represents a highly novel and effective strategy to provide efficient brain targeting and shows promise for the future in using modified ETm-coated HSA nanoparticles to penetrate the brain.","Gao, Chunhong; Gong, Wei; Yang, Meiyan; Chu, Xiaoyang; Wang, Yuli; Li, Zhiping; Yang, Yang; Gao, Chunsheng",J Drug Target,,238

417425,Allergic Reactions Including Anaphylaxis After Receipt of the First Dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine: The Journal of the American Medical Association,2021,"The COVID-19 reported initially in December 2019 led to thousands and millions of people infections, deaths at a rapid scale, and a global scale. Metropolitans suffered serious pandemic problems as the built environments of metropolitans contain a large number of people in a relatively small area and allow frequent contacts to let virus spread through people's contacting with each other. The spread inside a metropolitan is heterogeneous, and we propose that the spatial variation of built environments has a measurable association with the spread of COVID-19. This paper is the pioneering work to investigate the missing link between the built environment and the spread of the COVID-19. In particular, we intend to examine two research questions: (1) What are the association of the built environment with the risk of being infected by the COVID-19? (2) What are the association of the built environment with the duration of suffering from COVID-19? Using the Hong Kong census data, confirmed cases of COVID-19 between January to August 2020 and large size of built environment sample data from the Hong Kong government, our analysis are carried out. The data is divided into two phases before (Phase 1) and during the social distancing measure was relaxed (Phase 2). Through survival analysis, ordinary least squares analysis, and count data analysis, we find that (1) In Phase 1, clinics and restaurants are more likely to influence the prevalence of COVID-19. In Phase 2, public transportation (i.e. MTR), public market, and the clinics influence the prevalence of COVID-19. (2) In Phase 1, the areas of tertiary planning units (i.e., TPU) with more restaurants are found to be positively associated with the period of the prevalence of COVID-19. In Phase 2, restaurants and public markets induce long time occurrence of the COVID-19. (3) In Phase 1, restaurant and public markets are the two built environments that influence the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases. In Phase 2, the number of restaurants is positively related to the number of COVID-19 reported cases. It is suggested that governments should not be too optimistic to relax the necessary measures. In other words, the social distancing measure should remain in force until the signals of the COVID-19 dies out.","Yip, Tsz Leung; Huang, Yaoxuan; Liang, Cong",Build Environ,,238

Although, the incidence of co-infections could be up to 94.2% in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the fate of co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts often depends on the balance between the host's protective immunity and immunopathology. Predominantly identified co-pathogens of SARS-CoV-2 are bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Legionella pneumophila and Clamydia pneumoniae followed by viruses including influenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, influenza B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. The cross-talk between co-pathogens (especially lung microbiomes), SARS-CoV-2 and host is an important factor that ultimately increases the difficulty of diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. Simultaneously, co-infecting microbiotas may use new strategies to escape host defense mechanisms by altering both innate and adaptive immune responses to further aggravate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Better understanding of co-infections in COVID-19 is critical for the effective patient management, treatment and containment of SARS-CoV-2. This review therefore necessitates the comprehensive investigation of commonly reported microbial co-pathogens amid COVID-19, their transmission pattern along with the possible mechanism of co-infections and outcomes. Thus, identifying the possible co-pathogens and their underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may shed light in developing diagnostics, appropriate curative and preventive interventions for suspected SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in the current pandemic.","Hoque, M Nazmul; Akter, Salma; Mishu, Israt Dilruba; Islam, M Rafiul; Rahman, M Shaminur; Akhter, Masuda; Islam, Israt; Hasan, Mehedi Mahmudul; Rahaman, Md Mizanur; Sultana, Munawar; Islam, Tofazzal; Hossain, M Anwar",Microb Pathog,,238

He visited Wuhan 8 days ago. At admission, nasopharyngeal swab samples were taken, and polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA positivity. On day 9, after admission, the chest computed tomography scan showed diffuse ground-glass shadows in the patient's bilateral lungs. On day 11, his respiratory symptoms worsened. Subsequently, type I respiratory failure was diagnosed, coinciding with kidney injury, and subsequently, type II respiratory failure occurred, coupled with multiorgan failure including the heart and liver. However, the patient's constitution worsened although SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative since day 13. He died on day 21. Lung biopsy showed areas of diffuse alveolar damage, characterized by extensive acute alveolitis with numerous intra-alveolar neutrophil, lymphocyte, and macrophage infiltrations. Microthrombi were seen in the dilated pulmonary capillaries. Immunohistochemistry staining for SARS-CoV-2 N protein was negative. Taken together, the patient died of multiorgan failure although the SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared already, implicating that for disease worsening, no active SARS-CoV-2 infection is required.","Shao, Chen; Liu, Hui; Meng, Lingjia; Sun, Lin; Wang, Yankun; Yue, Zhujun; Kong, Heli; Li, Hongjun; Weng, Honglei; Lv, Fudong; Jin, Ronghua",Hum Pathol,,238
419275,"Comparison and impact of COVID-19 for patients with cancer: a survival analysis of fatality rate controlling for age, sex and cancer type",2021,"The mechanistic resemblance of oil-based molecular gels (oleogels) to solid fats (trans and saturated) makes molecular gelation an ideal alternative in developing fat-based food and cosmetic products. The recent upsurge in the preference for oleogels (structured-oils) is due to being healthier than conventional solid fats. Present study reveals a simple means of modulating the mechanical and aesthetic properties of oleogels by physically mixing two isomeric low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs), mannitol dioctanoate (M8) and sorbitol dioctanoate (S8) which have contrasting oil-structuring behaviors; while M8 formed oleogels with higher gel strength, the S8 gels were more aesthetic, translucent, and appealing. The gelators were synthesized by enzyme catalysis (a GRAS or generally-regarded-as-safe protocol). The M8/S8 gels were systematically and thoroughly characterized using a suite of analytical techniques including minimum gelation concentration, gel melting point, rheological storage modulus, oil binding capacity, light transmittance and optical microscopy. The results showed % light transmittance, which is associated with aesthetics, increased from about 40% to 95% with increasing fraction of S8 from 0 to 1. Parameters associated with mechanical strength such rheology were also quite responsive to varying proportions of the gelators. Storage modulus (G', a rheological property) increased from about 3,300 Pa to about 12,500 Pa with increasing fraction of M8. As the fraction of M8 increased, solid-fat content (SFC) changed from about 3.51% to 2.08% while the oil binding capacity changed from about 70.2 to 100.0. This work enables the modulation of a gel's aesthetic and organoleptic properties via a simple formulation of stereoisomeric molecular gelators.","Samateh, Malick; Sagiri, Sateesh Sai; Sanni, Riliwan; Chee, Cindy; Satapathy, Sitakanta; John, George",,,238

420395,Reply to A. Lasagna et al,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic contributing to more than 105 million cases and more than 2.3 million deaths worldwide, was described to be frequently accompanied by extrapulmonary manifestations, including liver dysfunction. Liver dysfunction and elevated liver enzymes were observed in about 53% of COVID-19 patients. AIM: To gain insight into transcriptional abnormalities in liver tissue of severe COVID-19 patients that may result in liver dysfunction. METHODS: The transcriptome of liver autopsy samples from severe COVID-19 patients against those of non-COVID donors was analyzed. Differentially expressed genes were identified from normalized RNA-seq data and analyzed for the enrichment of functional clusters and pathways. The differentially expressed genes were then compared against the genetic signatures of liver diseases including cirrhosis, fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and hepatitis A/B/C. Gene expression of some differentially expressed genes was assessed in the blood samples of severe COVID-19 patients with liver dysfunction using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Analysis of the differential transcriptome of the liver tissue of severe COVID-19 patients revealed a significant upregulation of transcripts implicated in tissue remodeling including G-coupled protein receptors family genes, DNAJB1, IGF2, EGFR, and HDGF. Concordantly, the differential transcriptome of severe COVID-19 liver tissues substantially overlapped with the disease signature of liver diseases characterized with pathological tissue remodeling (liver cirrhosis, Fibrosis, NAFLD, and hepatitis A/B/C). Moreover, we observed a significant suppression of transcripts implicated in metabolic pathways as well as mitochondrial function, including cytochrome P450 family members, ACAD11, CIDEB, GNMT, and GPAM. Consequently, drug and xenobiotics metabolism pathways are significantly suppressed suggesting a decrease in liver detoxification capacity. In correspondence with the RNA-seq data analysis, we observed a significant upregulation of DNAJB1 and HSP90AB1 as well as significant downregulation of CYP39A1 in the blood plasma of severe COVID-19 patients with liver dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 patients appear to experience significant transcriptional shift that may ensue tissue remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction and lower hepatic detoxification resulting in the clinically observed liver dysfunction.","Hammoudeh, Sarah Musa; Hammoudeh, Arabella Musa; Bhamidimarri, Poorna Manasa; Mahboub, Bassam; Halwani, Rabih; Hamid, Qutayba; Rahmani, Mohamed; Hamoudi, Rifat",World J Gastroenterol,,238

420560,Kidney involvement in COVID-19 and its treatments,2020,"The interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and the ACE2 enzyme is believed to be the entry point of the virus into various cells in the body, including the lungs, heart, liver, and kidneys. The current focus of several therapeutic design efforts explores attempts at affecting the binding potential between the two proteins to limit the activity of the virus and disease progression. In this work, we analyze the stability of the spike protein under all possible single-point mutations in the RBD and computationally explore mutations that can affect the binding with the ACE2 enzyme. We unravel the mutation landscape of the receptor region and assess the toxicity potential of single and multi-point mutations, generating insights for future vaccine efforts on mutations that might further stabilize the spike protein and increase its infectivity. We developed a tool, called SpikeMutator, to construct full atomic protein structures of the mutant spike proteins and shared a database of 3800 single-point mutant structures. We analyzed the recent 65,000 reported spike sequences across the globe and observed the emergence of stable multi-point mutant structures. Using the landscape, we searched through 7.5 million possible 2-point mutation combinations and report that the (R355D K424E) mutation produces one of the strongest spike proteins that therapeutic efforts should investigate for the sake of developing effective vaccines.","Smaoui, Mohamed Raef; Yahyaoui, Hamdi",Sci Rep,,238

This study aimed to systematically investigate the consistency of recommendations from the available clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to those of the WHO on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We examined CPGs and UpToDate point-of-care resources on the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients that had been published as of 30 April 2020 and compared them against the CPG by the WHO. The main outcome was the rate of consistency among CPGs for the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by excluding recommendation statements that were described as insufficient evidence and by excluding single CPGs one at a time. RESULTS: Thirteen reference recommendations derived from the CPG of the WHO were generated using discrete and unambiguous specifications of the population, intervention, and comparison states. Across CPGs, the rate of consistency in direction with the WHO is 7.7%. When insufficient evidence codings were excluded, the rate of consistency increased substantially to 61.5%. The results of a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis suggested that the UpToDate recommendation source could explain the inconsistency. Consistency in direction rates changed by an absolute 23.1% (from 1/13 (7.7%) to 4/13 (30.8%)) if UpToDate was removed. CONCLUSIONS: We observed inconsistencies between some recommendations of the CPGs and those of the WHO. These inconsistencies should best be addressed by consensus among the relevant bodies to avoid confusion in clinical practice while awaiting clinical trials to inform us of the best practice.","Kow, Chia Siang; Capstick, Toby; Zaidi, Syed Tabish Razi; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",,,238

Serial interval (SI), time between the onset of symptoms of a primary case and a secondary case, is a key epidemiological parameter. We estimated SI of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China based on 27 records of transmission chains. We adopted three parametric models: Weibull, lognormal and gamma distributions, and an interval-censored likelihood framework. The three models were compared using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). We also fitted the epidemic curve of COVID-19 to the logistic growth model to estimate the reproduction number. Using a Weibull distribution, we estimated the mean SI to be 5.9 days (95% CI: 3.9-9.6) with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.8 days (95% CI: 3.1-10.1). Using a logistic growth model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Shenzhen to be 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8). The SI of COVID-19 is relatively shorter than that of SARS and MERS, the other two betacoronavirus diseases, which suggests the iteration of the transmission may be rapid. Thus, it is crucial to isolate close contacts promptly to effectively control the spread of COVID-19.","Wang, Kai; Zhao, Shi; Liao, Ying; Zhao, Tiantian; Wang, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Xueliang; Jiao, Haiyan; Li, Huling; Yin, Yi; Wang, Maggie H; Xiao, Li; Wang, Lei; He, Daihai",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Superinfections were detected in 11% (80/712) patients. Urinary (53) and RIs (39) constituted the majority of superinfections Acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant was the main agent of IR and bacteremia. An outbreak of A. baumannii contributed to this result. Three patients were considered to have probable pulmonary aspergillosis. Mortality was higher in UCI patients (50 vs. 29%; p = 0.028). The predictive factors of mortality included being a male with various comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, bacteremia and superinfections from A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of A. baumannii was a determining factor in the increases of the incidence of infection and the morbi-mortality of ICU patients.","Nebreda-Mayoral, Teresa; Miguel-Gómez, María Antonia; March-Rosselló, Gabriel Alberto; Puente-Fuertes, Lucía; Cantón-Benito, Elena; Martínez-García, Ana María; Muñoz-Martín, Ana Belén; Orduña-Domingo, Antonio",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

It is important to look for reasons for this upsurge of cases so that other countries may take proper steps to prevent it. A prospective clinico-demographic study was conducted in SMS Medical College, Jaipur, India from April to May 2021. All patients (235) with COVID associated mucormycosis (CAM) were studied in detail with reference to their diabetic status and steroid intake during treatment of COVID-19. Steroid usage was in 84.3% of patients with methylprednisolone being the most commonly used steroid (66.8%). Majority of the patients had taken steroids for 7–14 days. Diabetes was found in 204 patients and 42.1% of patients were newly diagnosed during/after COVID-19 treatment. The HbA1c levels of diabetic patients ranged from 6.0% to 16.3%. This is perhaps the biggest study in the world shows that the triad of COVID-19, diabetes and steroid usage is a major contributing factor towards mucormycosis.

431388,Letter: low population mortality from COVID-19 in countries south of latitude 35° North supports vitamin D as a factor determining severity. Authors' reply,2020,"An epidemic can be characterized by its strength (i.e., the reproductive number [Formula: see text]) and speed (i.e., the exponential growth rate r). Disease modellers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for the classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a dual speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like [Formula: see text] [ 1], and show that we can measure the strength and speed of an intervention on the same scale as the strength and speed of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, while the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of 'test-and-treat' interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We also discuss evaluating the effects of the importance of pre-symptomatic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We suggest that disease modellers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.","Dushoff, Jonathan; Park, Sang Woo",Proc Biol Sci,,238

431781,Staff testing for COVID-19 via an online pre-registration form,2021,"PURPOSE: High-dimensional image features that underlie COVID-19 pneumonia remain opaque. We aim to compare feature engineering and deep learning methods to gain insights into the image features that drive CT-based for COVID-19 pneumonia prediction, and uncover CT image features significant for COVID-19 pneumonia from deep learning and radiomics framework. METHODS: A total of 266 patients with COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia with clinical symptoms and CT signs similar to that of COVID-19 during the outbreak were retrospectively collected from three hospitals in China and the USA. All the pneumonia lesions on CT images were manually delineated by four radiologists. One hundred eighty-four patients (n = 93 COVID-19 positive; n = 91 COVID-19 negative; 24,216 pneumonia lesions from 12,001 CT image slices) from two hospitals from China served as discovery cohort for model development. Thirty-two patients (17 COVID-19 positive, 15 COVID-19 negative; 7883 pneumonia lesions from 3799 CT image slices) from a US hospital served as external validation cohort. A bi-directional adversarial network-based framework and PyRadiomics package were used to extract deep learning and radiomics features, respectively. Linear and Lasso classifiers were used to develop models predictive of COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia. RESULTS: 120-dimensional deep learning image features and 120-dimensional radiomics features were extracted. Linear and Lasso classifiers identified 32 high-dimensional deep learning image features and 4 radiomics features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis (P < 0.0001). Both models achieved sensitivity > 73% and specificity > 75% on external validation cohort with slight superior performance for radiomics Lasso classifier. Human expert diagnostic performance improved (increase by 16.5% and 11.6% in sensitivity and specificity, respectively) when using a combined deep learning-radiomics model. CONCLUSIONS: We uncover specific deep learning and radiomics features to add insight into interpretability of machine learning algorithms and compare deep learning and radiomics models for COVID-19 pneumonia that might serve to augment human diagnostic performance.","Wang, Hongmei; Wang, Lu; Lee, Edward H; Zheng, Jimmy; Zhang, Wei; Halabi, Safwan; Liu, Chunlei; Deng, Kexue; Song, Jiangdian; Yeom, Kristen W",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,238
431926,The comparison of the effectiveness of lincocin® and azitro® in the treatment of covid-19-associated pneumonia: A prospective study,2020,"BACKGROUND: The implementation of core capacities as stated in the International Health Regulations (IHR) is far from complete, and, as the COVID-19 pandemic shows, the spreading of infectious diseases through points of entry (POEs) is a serious problem. To guide training and exercises, we performed a training needs assessment on infectious disease management among professionals at European POE. METHODS: We disseminated a digital questionnaire to representatives of designated airports, ports, and ground-crossings in Europe. Topics were derived from the IHR core capacities for POEs. Based on the importance (4-point Likert scale) and training needs (4-point Likert scale), we identified the topics with the highest priority for training. These results were put in further perspective using prior experience (training < 3 year, exercise < 5 years, events < 5 years). Also, preferences for training methodologies were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty questionnaires were included in the analyses, representing 50 POEs from 19 European countries. Importance is high for 26/30 topics, although scores widely vary among respondents. Topics with a high training need (16/30) are amongst others the handling of ill travelers; using and composing the public health emergency contingency plan, and public health measures. Respondents from ports and airports attribute equal importance to most topics, but respondents from ports showed higher training needs on 75% of the topics. POEs are unevenly and generally little experienced. The most preferred training methods were presentations. Simulation is the preferred methodology for training the handling of ill or exposed travelers. CONCLUSIONS: The European workforce at designated ports, airports and ground-crossings has a different level of experience and perceives varying importance of the topics assessed in our study. We identified the topics on which training is required. We call for European collaboration between POEs to agree upon the importance of infectious disease management, and to jointly build a trained and prepared workforce that is ready to face the next crisis.","de Rooij, Doret; Belfroid, Evelien; Hadjichristodoulou, Christos; Mouchtouri, Varvara A; Raab, Jörg; Timen, Aura",BMC Public Health,,238

432321,Portable RT-PCR System: a Rapid and Scalable Diagnostic Tool for COVID-19 Testing,2021,"Across the United States, the number of staff scientists (master's- or doctoral-level professionals working in nonfaculty roles) has grown by 35% since 2010, and they play an increasingly important role in research efforts. However, few targeted resources are available, which potentially limits the effectiveness of this group. Launched in 2016, the staff scientist path at Emory has tripled in size over 4 y to 138 staff. The present case study evaluated the perceptions of staff scientists related to onboarding experiences and professional development needs, including those needs arising from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impacts in the workplace. A survey of Emory staff scientists was conducted from May to June 2019 as part of a program evaluation initiative to assess perceptions of onboarding and professional development opportunities. Interviews with a subset of scientists informed the survey development and identified COVID-19-related impacts on daily work. Results indicated the need for targeted orientation resources specific to staff scientists, accurate and timely information and resources to support scientists' supervisors, and professional development for scientists in leadership and management-related skills. Remote work associated with COVID-19 accentuated the need for managerial skills, including team development in digital work environments. Findings from this case study can inform policies and practices at Emory and other institutions that employ a similar staff scientist model.","Murphy, Melissa M; Johnston, H Richard; Zwick, Michael E",J Biomol Tech,,238

In this study, we aim to investigate a possible mechanism of autoimmune lung injury. METHODS: We extracted the peptide sequences of surface proteins of the SARS-COV-2 from the NCBI data protein. We used Blastp to assess the homologous sequences between the human proteins in the UNIPROT database that are associated with respiratory distress. Then, we filtered the homologous sequences to those selectively expressed in the lung and homologous to surface viral proteins. We then assessed the epitope sequences for MHC-I and MHC-II using recommended settings and reference MHC in the IEDB database. RESULTS: Homeobox protein 2.1 (NKX2-1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 3 (ABCA3) showed homologous sequence to both surface glycoproteins and envelope proteins. The HLA-DR and HLA-DQ had a similar binding pattern to ABCA3 as surface glycoproteins and envelope proteins, respectively. Other HLA molecules that had a similar binding pattern to SARS-COV-2 as human proteins were HLA-A and HLA-DP. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that there is a possible autoimmune mechanism underlying the acute respiratory distress syndrome in SARS-COV-2.","Morsy, Sara; Morsy, Ahmed",J Mol Graph Model,,238

434384,Association of vitamin D with the modulation of the disease severity in COVID-19,2020,"Targeted screening for sexual abuse is needed for social workers to accurately identify those at risk. Drawing on a cumulative disadvantage framework, this study investigates how parental addictions, parental mental illness, and exposure to domestic violence, both individually and cumulatively, are associated with childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Two waves of regionally representative data were analyzed. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted using the 2010 Brief Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) (n = 9,241 men, n = 13,627 women) and replicated using the 2012 BRFSS (n = 11,656 men, n = 18,145 women). The 2010 data indicated that 8.5 percent of men who had endured all three childhood adversities reported that they had experienced CSA, compared with 0.6 percent of men who did not experience any of these adversities. Levels of CSA for women in 2010 were 28.7 percent for those experiencing all three risk indicators, and 2.1 percent for women with no risk indicators. Results were similar in the BRFSS 2012. Those with two or more risk factors had between five- and eightfold higher odds of CSA. Social workers may be able to decrease false positives if they screen for CSA based on the presence of two or more risk factors.","Fuller-Thomson, Esme; Agbeyaka, Senyo",Soc. work,,238

435027,Evaluating the impact of the coronavirus(COVID-19) pandemic on treatment paradigms in headand neck cancer at a tertiary care hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a viral respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients with this disease may be more prone to venous or arterial thrombosis because of the activation of many factors involved in it, including inflammation, platelet activation and endothelial dysfunction. Interferon gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha (MIP1&#945;) are cytokines related to thrombosis. Therefore, this study focused on these three indicators in COVID-19, with the hope to find biomarkers that are associated with patients' outcome. METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center study involving 74 severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients recruited from the ICU department of the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into two groups: severe patients and critically ill patients. The serum IP-10, MCP-1 and MIP1&#945; level in both groups was detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, and the outcome of COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The serum IP-10 and MCP-1 level in critically ill patients was significantly higher than that in severe patients (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference in MIP1&#945; between the two groups was found. The analysis of dynamic changes showed that these indicators remarkably increased in patients with poor prognosis. Since the selected patients were severe or critically ill, no significant difference was observed between survival and death. CONCLUSIONS: IP-10 and MCP-1 are biomarkers associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease and can be related to the risk of death in COVID-19 patients.","Chen, Yu; Wang, Jinglan; Liu, Chenxi; Su, Longxiang; Zhang, Dong; Fan, Junping; Yang, Yanli; Xiao, Meng; Xie, Jing; Xu, Yingchun; Li, Yongzhe; Zhang, Shuyang",Mol Med,,238
435438,COVID-19 in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma in the Russian Federation,2020,"Introduction: Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) is a promising biomarker of pretreatment risk in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Different segmentation methods can be used which predict prognosis equally well but give different optimal cut-offs for risk stratification. Segmentation can be cumbersome meaning a fast, easy and robust method is needed. Aims were to i) evaluate the best automated MTV workflow in DLBCL ii) determine if uptake time, (non)compliance with standardized recommendations for FDG scanning and subsequent disease progression influenced the success of segmentation iii) assess differences in MTV values and discriminatory power of segmentation methods. Methods: 140 baseline FDG-PET/CT scans were selected from UK and Dutch studies in DLBCL to provide a balance between scans at 60- or 90-minutes uptake, parameters compliant or non-compliant with standardized recommendations for scanning and patients with or without progression. An automated tool was used for segmentation using i) standardized uptake value (SUV) 2.5 ii) SUV 4.0 iii) adaptive thresholding [A50P] iv) 41% of maximum SUV [41%] v) majority vote including voxels detected by &#8805;2 methods [MV2] and vi) detected by &#8805;3 methods [MV3]. Two independent observers rated the success of the tool to delineate MTV. Scans that required minimal interaction were rated ""success""; scans where > 50% of tumor was missed or required more than 2 editing steps were rated as ""failure"". Results: 138 scans were evaluable, with significant differences in success and failure ratings between methods. The best performing was SUV4.0, with higher success and lower failure rates than all other methods except MV2 which also performed well. SUV4.0 gave a good approximation of MTV in 105 (76%) scans, with simple editing for a satisfactory result in additionally 20% of cases. MTV was significantly different for all methods between patients with and without progression. SUV41% performed slightly worse with longer uptake times, otherwise scanning conditions and patient outcome did not influence the tool's performance. The discriminative power of methods was similar, but MTV values were significantly greater using SUV4.0 and MV2 than other thresholds except for SUV2.5. Conclusion: SUV4.0 and MV2 are recommended for further evaluation. Automated estimation of MTV is feasible.","Barrington, Sally F; Zwezerijnen, Ben Gjc; de Vet, Henrica Cw; Heymans, Martijn W; Mikhaeel, N George; Burggraaff, Coreline N; Eertink, Jakoba J; Pike, Lucy C; Hoekstra, Otto S; Zijlstra, Josee M; Boellaard, Ronald",J. nucl. med,,238

436610,Embracing virtual connection: An innovative systemwide approach to support groups,2021,"BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, New York State mandated that all hospitals double the capacity of their adult intensive care units In this facility, resources were mobilized to increase from 104 to 283 beds. OBJECTIVE: To create and implement a 3-hour curriculum to prepare several hundred non-critical care staff nurses to manage critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: Critical care nursing leaders and staff developed and implemented a flexible critical care nursing curriculum tailored to the diverse experience, expertise, and learning needs of non-critical care nursing staff who were being redeployed to critical care units during the surge response to the pandemic. Curricular elements included respiratory failure and ventilator management, shock and hemodynamics, pharmacotherapy for critical illnesses, and renal replacement therapy. A skills station allowed hands-on practice with common critical care equipment. RESULTS: A total of 413 nurses completed training within 10 days. As of June 2020, 151 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 still required mechanical ventilation at our institution, and 7 of 10 temporary intensive care units remained operational. Thus most of the nurses who received this training continued to practice critical care. A unique feature of this curriculum was the tailored instruction, adapted to learners' needs, which improved the efficiency of content delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Program evaluation is ongoing. As recovery and restoration proceed and normal operations resume, detailed feedback from program participants and patient care managers will help the institution maintain high operational readiness should a second wave of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 be admitted.","Brickman, Diana; Greenway, Andrew; Sobocinski, Kathryn; Thai, Hanh; Turick, Ashley; Xuereb, Kevin; Zambardino, Danielle; Barie, Philip S; Liu, Susan I",Am J Crit Care,,238

DESIGN: A telephone and video assessment of IPC measures in SNFs at high risk or experiencing COVID-19 activity. PARTICIPANTS: SNFs in 14 New York counties, including New York City. INTERVENTION: A 3-component remote IPC assessment: (1) screening tool; (2) telephone IPC checklist; and (3) COVID-19 video IPC assessment (ie, ""COVIDeo""). RESULTS: In total, 92 SNFs completed the IPC screening tool and checklist: 52 (57%) were conducted as part COVID-19 investigations, and 40 (43%) were proactive prevention-based assessments. Among the 40 proactive assessments, 14 (35%) identified suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. COVIDeo was performed in 26 (28%) of 92 assessments and provided observations that other tools would have missed: personal protective equipment (PPE) that was not easily accessible, redundant, or improperly donned, doffed, or stored and specific challenges implementing IPC in specialty populations. The IPC assessments took â¼1 hour each and reached an estimated 4 times as many SNFs as on-site visits in a similar time frame. CONCLUSIONS: Remote IPC assessments by telephone and video were timely and feasible methods of assessing the extent to which IPC interventions had been implemented in a vulnerable setting and to disseminate real-time recommendations.

METHODS: A total of 136 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Patients were grouped according to the presence of hypertension and BPV. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) measured at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. was analyzed, and BPV was calculated as the coefficient of variation of MAP (MAPCV). High BPV was defined as MAPCV values above the median. We compared the age, level of C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), creatinine and in-hospital mortality and investigated the relationship among the groups. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with hypertension were older (70 ± 12 vs. 53 ± 17 years; P < 0.001), had higher levels of CRP (9.4 ± 9.2 vs. 5.3 ± 8.2 mg/dL; P = 0.009), MAPCV (11.4 ± 4.8 vs. 8.9 ± 3.2; P = 0.002), and higher in-hospital mortality (19.6% vs. 5.9%; P = 0.013) than those without hypertension. There was a proportional relationship between BPV and age, levels of CRP, CK-MB, NT-proBNP, creatinine and in-hospital mortality (all, P < 0.05). In Cox regression analysis, advanced age [&#8805;80 years, hazard ratio (HR) 10.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.264-47.772, P = 0.003] and higher MAPCV (HR 1.617, 95% CI, 1.281-2.040, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: High BPV in COVID-19 patients with hypertension is significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. Advanced age and systemic inflammation are proportional to high BPV.

We aimed to fill the evidence gap regarding STEMI reperfusion strategy during the COVID-19 era. METHODS: Clinical characteristics and outcomes for 17 patients with STEMI who received fibrinolysis during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with 20 patients who received primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), and were further compared with another 41 patients who received PPCI in the pre-COVID-19 period. RESULTS: In patients with STEMI, fibrinolysis achieved a comparable in-hospital and 30-day primary composite end point, as compared with those who received PPCI during the COVID-19 pandemic. No major bleeding was detected in either group. Compared patients with STEMI who received PPCI in the pre-COVID-19 period, we found a remarkable extension of chest pain onset-to-first medical contact (FMC) and FMC-to-wire crossing times, significantly increased number and length of stents, and much worse thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow in patients with STEMI who received PPCI during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Owing to its considerable efficacy and safety and advantages in conserving medical resources, we recommend fibrinolysis as a reasonable alternative for STEMI care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Nan; Zhang, Min; Su, Huajun; Huang, Zhonglue; Lin, Yongbo",J Int Med Res,,238

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and the rate of seroconversion in an environment with high exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: 131 health-care workers at the Department of Infectious Diseases in Västerås, Sweden, were included in the study. Abbott's SARS-COV-2 IgG immunoassay was used with a signal cut-off ratio of &#8805;1.4. Every third week from the beginning of May, blood samples were drawn, and the participants completed a questionnaire regarding symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and the result of any SARS-CoV-2 PCR performed since the last sampling occasion. Participants with IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were re-sampled only on the sixth and last occasion. Results: At the start of the study, 18 (15%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. At the end, 25 (19%) of 131 participants were seropositive. One case of asymptomatic infection was detected, and two cases with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 did not develop IgG antibodies. Conclusion: The low rate of seroconversion during the study suggests that it is possible to prevent transmission of SARS-COV-2 in a high-exposure environment. Compliance with adequate infection control guidelines is the likely explanation of our findings.","Rashid-Abdi, Mulki; Krifors, Anders; Sälléber, Andreas; Eriksson, Jenny; Månsson, Emeli",Infect Dis (Lond),,238

SUMMARY: A 52-year-old malnourished male with a medical history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity developed acute myelogenous leukemia and underwent allogeneic HSCT approximately 17 months later. He was admitted 1 month after HSCT for failure to thrive and initiated on parenteral nutrition due to worsening diarrhea and suspected gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GI GVHD). During admission, the patient was continued on daily oral posaconazole for antifungal prophylaxis and was found to have subtherapeutic posaconazole and deficient vitamin levels, likely secondary to his gastrojejunostomy and increased gastric transit time. The oral posaconazole was altered to twice-daily dosing in an effort to increase serum drug levels and prevent IFIs. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of gastric bypass are at increased risk for malabsorption of oral posaconazole and nutrients, especially following HSCT with suspected GI GVHD.","Highsmith, Emily A; Doan, Vi P; Canada, Todd W",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,238

445339,Audiological Evaluation of Patients With Somatosensory Tinnitus Attributed to Temporomandibular Disorders,2020,"The innate immune response is critical for recognizing and controlling infections through the release of cytokines and chemokines. However, severe pathology during some infections, including SARS-CoV-2, is driven by hyperactive cytokine release, or a cytokine storm. The innate sensors that activate production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines during COVID-19 remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we show that both TLR2 and MYD88 expression were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Mechanistically, TLR2 and Myd88 were required for ß-coronavirus-induced inflammatory responses, and TLR2-dependent signaling induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines during coronavirus infection independent of viral entry. TLR2 sensed the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein as its ligand. In addition, blocking TLR2 signaling in vivo provided protection against the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our study provides a critical understanding of the molecular mechanism of ß-coronavirus sensing and inflammatory cytokine production, which opens new avenues for therapeutic strategies to counteract the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Min; Karki, Rajendra; Williams, Evan Peter; Yang, Dong; Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth; Vogel, Peter; Jonsson, Colleen Beth; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Nat Immunol,,238

Individual milk banks, national networks and regional associations submitted data regarding the number of HMBs, volume of DHM produced and number of recipients in each global region. Estimates were calculated in the context of missing or incomplete data. Through open-ended questioning, the experiences of milk banks from each country in the first 2 months of the pandemic were collected and major themes identified. According to data collected from 446 individual HMBs, more than 800,000 infants receive DHM worldwide each year. Seven pandemic-related specific vulnerabilities to service provision were identified, including sufficient donors, prescreening disruption, DHM availability, logistics, communication, safe handling and contingency planning, which were highly context-dependent. The VCN now plans a formal consensus approach to the optimal response of HMBs to new pathogens using crowdsourced data, enabling the benchmarking of future strategies to support DHM access and neonatal health in future emergencies.","Shenker, Natalie; Staff, Marta; Vickers, Amy; Aprigio, Joao; Tiwari, Satish; Nangia, Sushma; Sachdeva, Ruchika Chugh; Clifford, Vanessa; Coutsoudis, Anna; Reimers, Penny; Israel-Ballard, Kiersten; Mansen, Kimberly; Mileusnic-Milenovic, Radmila; Wesolowska, Aleksandra; Goudoever, Johannes B van; Hosseini, Mohammadbagher; Klotz, Daniel; Grøvslien, Anne Hagen; Weaver, Gillian",Matern Child Nutr,,238
445946,Quercetin as an Agent for Protecting the Bone: A Review of the Current Evidence,2020,"Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA requires sequential reactions facilitated by the replication and transcription complex (RTC). Here, we present a structural snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transitions toward cap structure synthesis. We determine the atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by nsp7-nsp82-nsp12-nsp132-RNA and a single RNA-binding protein, nsp9. Nsp9 binds tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N terminus inserting into the catalytic center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5' extension of template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results reason an intermediate state of RTC toward mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development.","Yan, Liming; Ge, Ji; Zheng, Litao; Zhang, Ying; Gao, Yan; Wang, Tao; Huang, Yucen; Yang, Yunxiang; Gao, Shan; Li, Mingyu; Liu, Zhenyu; Wang, Haofeng; Li, Yingjian; Chen, Yu; Guddat, Luke W; Wang, Quan; Rao, Zihe; Lou, Zhiyong",Cell,,238

The aim of this registry-based observational study was to explore characteristics and clinical outcomes of recipients of kidney transplants included in the French nationwide Registry of Solid Organ Transplant Recipients with Covid-19. Covid-19 was diagnosed in symptomatic patients who had a positive PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 or having typical lung lesions on imaging. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, management of immunosuppression, treatment for Covid-19, and clinical outcomes (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death) were recorded. Risk factors for severe disease or death were determined. Of the 279 patients, 243 were admitted to hospital and 36 were managed at home. The median age of hospitalized patients was 61.6 years; most had comorbidities (hypertension, 90.1%; overweight, 63.8%; diabetes, 41.3%; cardiovascular disease, 36.2%). Fever, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea were the most common symptoms on admission. Laboratory findings revealed mild inflammation frequently accompanied by lymphopenia. Immunosuppressive drugs were generally withdrawn (calcineurin inhibitors: 28.7%; antimetabolites: 70.8%). Treatment was mainly based on hydroxychloroquine (24.7%), antiviral drugs (7.8%), and tocilizumab (5.3%). Severe Covid-19 occurred in 106 patients (46%). Forty-three hospitalized patients died (30-day mortality 22.8%). Multivariable analysis identified overweight, fever, and dyspnea as independent risk factors for severe disease, whereas age over 60 years, cardiovascular disease, and dyspnea were independently associated with mortality. Thus, Covid-19 in recipients of kidney transplants portends a high mortality rate. Proper management of immunosuppression and tailored treatment of this population remain challenging.","Caillard, Sophie; Anglicheau, Dany; Matignon, Marie; Durrbach, Antoine; Greze, Clarisse; Frimat, Luc; Thaunat, Olivier; Legris, Tristan; Moal, Valerie; Westeel, Pierre Francois; Kamar, Nassim; Gatault, Philippe; Snanoudj, Renaud; Sicard, Antoine; Bertrand, Dominique; Colosio, Charlotte; Couzi, Lionel; Chemouny, Jonathan M; Masset, Christophe; Blancho, Gilles; Bamoulid, Jamal; Duveau, Agnes; Bouvier, Nicolas; Chavarot, Nathalie; Grimbert, Philippe; Moulin, Bruno; Le Meur, Yannick; Hazzan, Marc",Kidney Int,,238

To do so, we integrated South Korean residents' perceptions of country image (PCI), mass media, and concerns about travel into the framework of the original model of goal-directed behaviour (MGB). Structural equation modelling was used to identify the structural relationships among the latent variables. The results show that mass media had a positive influence on South Korean residents' perception of China's image, a negative influence on residents' concerns, and a positive influence on residents' behavioural intentions for travel overseas. Meanwhile, PCI had a positive influence on residents' attitude towards travel overseas.

447374,Quality of adverse event reporting in clinical trials of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Spain has been amongst the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has posed significant challenges to the donation and transplantation program. Despite a dramatic decrease of donation and transplantation activities during the critical early weeks of the outbreak, the program has recovered and is learning to cope with COVID-19. METHODS: We describe the 4 pillars upon which the Spanish donation and transplantation program has been rebuilt. RESULTS: (1) Standards have been developed and progressively updated for the evaluation and selection of potential donors and recipients with regards to SARS-CoV-2 infection. (2) Spain has been actively generating evidence to assess the validity of our standards and to understand the natural history of the infection in transplant recipients. No case of donor-derived COVID-19 has been reported to date. COVID-19 has been more frequent and has had a more aggressive course in recipients of solid organ transplants than in the general population, but this seems largely explained by the demographics and comorbidity of transplant patients. (3) As a result of this evidence and experience, recommendations have been issued for the management of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients and candidates on the waiting list. (4) Finally, concrete guidance has been issued for centers to manage the donation and transplantation programs in relation to a dynamic and heterogeneous epidemiologic scenario. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish experience confronting the impact of COVID-19 upon donation and transplantation may help serve the needs of a broader community in other countries.","Domínguez-Gil, Beatriz; Fernández-Ruiz, Mario; Hernández, Domingo; Crespo, Marta; Colmenero, Jordi; Coll, Elisabeth; Rubio, Juan José",Transplantation,,238
447850,COVID-19-associated myositis with severe proximal and bulbar weakness,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), employs host-cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. Genetic analyses of ACE2 have identified several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specific to different human populations. Molecular dynamics simulations have indicated that several of these SNPs could affect interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, thereby providing a partial explanation for the regional differences observed in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and severity. However, the significance of population-specific ACE2 SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is unknown, as no in vitro validation studies have been performed. Here, we analyzed the impact of eight SNPs found in specific populations on receptor binding and cell entry in vitro. Except for a SNP causing a nonsense mutation that reduced ACE2 expression, none of the selected SNPs markedly altered the interaction between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2-S), which is responsible for receptor recognition and cell entry, or the efficiency of viral cell entry mediated by SARS-2-S. Our findings indicate that ACE2 polymorphisms have limited impact on the ACE2-dependent cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the importance of future studies on the involvement of population-specific SNPs of other host genes in susceptibility toward SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Hashizume, Mei; Gonzalez, Gabriel; Ono, Chikako; Takashima, Ayako; Iwasaki, Masaharu",Viruses,,238
447919,Application of ASCO Value Framework to Treatment Advances in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The relationship between current cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) dual use, exclusive use and COVID-19-related measures are still unclear. This study aims to assess the association between different tobacco use patterns and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, testing, self-reported infection and social distancing behaviors in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Data come from the first wave of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) COVID-19 survey, comprising four birth cohorts (N = 13,077, aged 20-63 years) surveyed between 2 to 31 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics and COVID-19-related outcomes (symptoms, testing, diagnosis and social distancing behaviors) were compared across different product user groups (non-users, exclusive cigarette users, exclusive e-cigarettes users and dual use) using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel &#967;2 test. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore associations between COVID-19-related outcomes and different smoking patterns. RESULTS: Across all four cohorts, 12.6% and 4.9% of the respondents were current exclusive cigarette and e-cigarette users, respectively, with approximately 3% of the respondents being dual users. Significant differences in prevalence were observed between different tobacco use patterns and COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.02), self-reported infection (p = 0.04) and social distancing behaviors (p < 0.001). Current cigarette and e-cigarette dual use was associated with 2.15-fold higher odds for reporting COVID-19 infection (aOR = 2.15; CI [1.15-4.05]). Compliance of social distancing behaviors were the lowest for current dual users (aOR = 0.58; CI [0.41-0.83]) and exclusive cigarette users (aOR = 0.72; CI [0.63-0.92]). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight dual users' higher prevalence of having COVID-19 symptoms, infection and incompliance of social distancing behaviors. Self-reported infection was associated with dual product use; dual users and exclusive cigarette users were linked to poor adherence to social distancing behaviors. Smoking cessation support and further monitoring on multiple tobacco use among these populations should be reinforced as preventive measures to tackle the pandemic.","Chen, Daniel Tzu-Hsuan; Kyriakos, Christina N",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,238

Utilizaram-se 20 cadelas hígidas, alocadas ao acaso em 2 grupos de 10 animais: os animais do Grupo I foram submetidos ao banho 24 horas antes do procedimento cirúrgico, enquanto os do Grupo II não passaram por este procedimento. Foram isolados diversos gêneros bacterianos antes e após o uso dos antissépticos. Significância estatística foi verificada entre os grupos quanto ao efeito do banho prévio à cirurgia, apenas 2 horas após a aplicação de clorexidina. A tricotomia reduziu 26,48% da carga microbiana nos animais do Grupo I e elevou a carga microbiana em 41,19% nos animais do Grupo II, revelando diferença estatística. Após o uso dos antissépticos, não foi observada diferença estatística entre os grupos em nenhum momento. Do mesmo modo, a comparação da eficiência dos antissépticos com ou sem banho, não revelou significância estatística. A polivinilpirrolidona iodada causou reação alérgica em 15% dos animais e não foi observada irritação cutânea causada pela clorexidina. Conclui-se que o banho prévio tem efeito na redução da carga bacteriana apenas após 2 horas de antissepsia com clorexidina; a tricotomia é mais eficaz na redução microbiana quando o animal é submetido ao banho e os dois antissépticos são igualmente eficazes na antissepsia cirúrgica por até 2 horas quer o animal tome banho ou não previamente à cirurgia.(AU)","Medeiros, Lylian K.

450725,COVID-19 infection also occurs in patients taking hydroxychloroquine,2020,"Introduction: At the end of March, 2020, rapid tests detecting the presence of antiviral IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus were introduced in Hungary for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19 disease). Aim: We evaluated two rapid tests (Anhui and Clungene) in comparison with those of real-time PCR tests considered as the gold standard in the detection of infection. Method: Between 16, March and 14, April, 2020, we performed rapid IgM and IgG detecting tests without PCR; PCR without rapid tests; and PCR WITH rapid tests in 4140, 3210 and 1654 patients, respectively. (Out of these 1654 patients, Anhui and Clungene tests were used for testing in 625 and 1029 patients, respectively.) Patients were considered as positive in PCR and rapid tests when PCR positivity and IgM or IgG positivity occurred at any time, respectively. (Note: Clungene test is also marketed as 'Lungene'.) Results: The prevalence of PCR positivity in 4864 patients tested with PCR was 6.3%. The sensitivity and specificity of Anhui and Clungene tests were 33.3% and 72.85%, and 35.48% and 85.02%, respectively. At 6% PCR positivity, the positive and negative predictive values of Anhui and Clungene were 7.28%, 94.48%, 13.13%, and 95.38%, respectively. Conclusion: The low positive predictive values indicate that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting the presence of anti-IgM and anti-IgG against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are not suitable for screening SARS-CoV-2 vírus infection in the general population. These results strongly support that Anhui and Clungene rapid tests detecting IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus should not be used in the differential diagnosis of infection.

Objective: To assess whether racial/ethnic disparities in very preterm birth (VPTB) and preterm birth (PTB) increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 8026 Black, Latina, and White women who gave birth during the study period. A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of Black vs White disparities in VPTB or PTB in a pandemic cohort was compared with a prepandemic cohort by using electronic medical records obtained from 2 hospitals in New York City. Exposures: Women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2020, were considered the pandemic cohort, and women who delivered from March 28 to July 31, 2019, were considered the prepandemic cohort. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were performed using samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab at the time of admission. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical estimates of gestational age were used to calculate VPTB (<32 weeks) and PTB (<37 weeks). Log binomial regression was performed to estimate Black vs White risk differences, pandemic cohort vs prepandemic cohort risk difference, and an interaction term representing the DID estimator. Covariate-adjusted models included age, insurance, prepregnancy body mass index, and parity. Results: Of 3834 women in the pandemic cohort, 492 (12.8%) self-identified as Black, 678 (17.7%) as Latina, 2012 (52.5%) as White, 408 (10.6%) as Asian, and 244 (6.4%) as other or unspecified race/ethnicity, with approximately half the women 25 to 34 years of age. The prepandemic cohort comprised 4192 women with similar sociodemographic characteristics. In the prepandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.4% (20 of 451) and PTB risk was 14.4% (65 of 451) among Black infants compared with 0.8% (17 of 2188) VPTB risk and 7.1% (156 of 2188) PTB risk among White infants. In the pandemic cohort, VPTB risk was 4.3% (21 of 491) and PTB risk was 13.2% (65 of 491) among Black infants compared with 0.5% (10 of 1994) VPTB risk and 7.0% (240 of 1994) PTB risk among White infants. The DID estimators indicated that no increase in Black vs White disparities were found (DID estimator for VPTB, 0.1 additional cases per 100 [95% CI, -2.5 to 2.8]; DID estimator for PTB, 1.1 fewer case per 100 [95% CI, -5.8 to 3.6]). The results were comparable in covariate-adjusted models when limiting the population to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. No change was detected in Latina vs White PTB disparities during the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of women who gave birth in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic, no evidence was found for increased racial/ethnic disparities in PTB, among women who tested positive or tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.","Janevic, Teresa; Glazer, Kimberly B; Vieira, Luciana; Weber, Ellerie; Stone, Joanne; Stern, Toni; Bianco, Angela; Wagner, Brian; Dolan, Siobhan M; Howell, Elizabeth A",JAMA Netw Open,,238

Under the oxidative stress, Nrf2 is separated from Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is a key sensor of oxidative stress, translocated to the nucleus, interacts with the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the target gene, and then activates the transcriptional pathway to ameliorate the cellular redox condition. Curcumin is a yellow polyphenolic curcuminoid from Curcuma longa (turmeric) that has revealed a broad spectrum of bioactivities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-viral activities. Curcumin significantly increases the nuclear expression levels and promotes the biological effects of Nrf2 via the interaction with Cys151 in Keap1, which makes it a marvelous therapeutic candidate against a broad range of oxidative stress-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes (T2D), neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, viral infections, and more recently SARS-CoV-2. Currently, the multifactorial property of the diseases and lack of adequate medical treatment, especially in viral diseases, result in developing new strategies to finding potential drugs. Curcumin potentially opens up new views as possible Nrf2 activator. However, its low bioavailability that is due to low solubility and low stability in the physiological conditions is a significant challenge in the field of its efficient and effective utilization in medicinal purposes. In this review, we summarized recent studies on the potential effect of curcumin to activate Nrf2 as the design of potential drugs for a viral infection like SARS-Cov2 and acute and chronic inflammation diseases in order to improve the cells' protection.","Rahban, Mahdie; Habibi-Rezaei, Mehran; Mazaheri, Mansoureh; Saso, Luciano; Moosavi-Movahedi, Ali A",,,238

After decades of energy-efficiency programs and targeted policies, the average low-income household still spends a disproportionately large percentage of its income on energy bills. Issues of equity, race and justice are increasingly linked to the problem of persistent energy burdens. In the complex ecosystem of stakeholders that influence energy burden, key gaps still exist in the understanding of causes and solutions. In particular, limited research has examined the role of landlords and property managers in multifamily housing. Over the past decade, research has increasingly illuminated (1) the link between energy burden and health, (2) promising pathways to democratize energy efficiency and rooftop solar, and (3) issues of equity, justice, and African-American populations. Sustainable and affordable household energy is critical today as Covid-19 and climate change introduce new layers of stress that challenge the transition to a clean energy future.","Brown, Marilyn A.; Soni, Anmol; Doshi, Ameet D.; King, Charlotte",Energy Res.

From March 19 to May 15, more Detroiters died in 2 months than were killed in 2 years of city homicides. African Americans or Blacks (highest-risk phenotypes) developing COVID-19 infection are more likely to die disproportionately. The confluence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and the higher prevalence of obesity among Blacks have provided the needed environment for viruses like COVID-19 to thrive and cause serious infections. The purpose of this study is to connect mortality rates from COVID-19 infection to increasing obesity trends among African Americans within the city of Detroit. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS ver. 23. Results showed that the highest mortality rates among African Americans occurred more in the obese individuals infected with COVID-19 in the city of Detroit. Out of 1930 deaths from COVID-19 infections, 733 deaths were due to obesity alone in patients without reported comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Mortality rate for both male and female African Americans amounted to a total of 11.9%.

Exaggerated pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia may be related to endothelial dysfunction in hypoxia susceptible. We hypothesize that baseline BNP levels can predict hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals. MAIN METHODS: The pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia was compared in 35 male healthy individuals divided into two groups based on BNP levels (Group 1 &#8804; 15 and Group 2 > 15 pg/ml). Acute normobaric hypoxia was administered to both the groups, to confirm hypoxia susceptibility in Group 2. KEY FINDINGS: Unlike Group 1, Group 2 had elevated post hypoxia BNP levels (26 vs 33.5 pg/ml, p = 0.002) while pulmonary artery pressure was comparable. A negative correlation with tissue oxygen consumption (delta pO2) and compartmental fluid shift was seen in Group 1 only. Endothelial dysfunction in Group 2 resulted in reduced vascular compliance leading to elevation of mean blood pressure on acute hypoxia exposure. BNP showed a positive correlation with endothelial dysfunction in Group 2 and has been linked to pre-diabetic disorder (HbA1c 6 ± 0.44%) and may additionally represent a lower cross-sectional area of vascular bed related to vascular remodeling mediated by chronic hypoxia. SIGNIFICANCE: Hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals may be related to endothelial dysfunction that limits vascular compliance during hypoxic stress. BNP level showed positive correlation with HbA1c (r = 0.49, p = 0.04) and negative correlation with delta pO2 (r = -0.52, p = 0.04) can predict reduced microvascular compliance due to endothelial dysfunction contributing to hypoxia susceptibility in healthy individuals.

457176,COVID-19 treatment: Combining anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapeutics using a network-based approach,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether enough primary care providers are in close proximity to where dual-eligible beneficiaries live to provide the capacity needed for integrated care models. STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data analysis using dual-eligible enrollment data and health care workforce data. METHODS: We determined the density of dual-eligible beneficiaries per 1000 population in 2017 for each of 3142 US counties. County-level supply of primary care physicians (PCPs), primary care nurse practitioners, and physician assistants was determined. RESULTS: One-third of the 791 counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries had PCP shortages. Counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries and the fewest primary care clinicians of any type were concentrated in Southeastern states. These areas also had some of the highest coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks within their states. CONCLUSIONS: States in the Southeastern region of the United States with some of the most restrictive scope-of-practice laws have an inadequate supply of primary care providers to serve a high concentration of dual-eligible beneficiaries. The fragmented care of the dually eligible population leads to extremely high costs, prompting policy makers to consider integrated delivery models that emphasize primary care. However, primary care workforce shortages will be an enduring challenge without scope-of-practice reforms.","Xu, W. Y.; Retchin, S. M.; Buerhaus, P.",American Journal of Managed Care,,238

459304,The Untold Toll - The Pandemic's Effects on Patients without Covid-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire globe with overwhelming speed and impact. The pandemic is both highly threatening and poorly understood, typical of deeply distressing conditions. Stress associated with uncertain recommendations from authorities, fear of illness and contagion for oneself and one's loved ones, extended periods of isolation, moral conflicts, financial instability, perception of discrimination and/or stigma, and ongoing loss and grief imperil mental health and resilience among the general population and high-risk groups. Health care workers (HCWs) face additional challenges that increase their vulnerability to distress and burnout. Bolstering resilience among HCWs can allow them to continue working with the intensity and focus their jobs require, which in turn supports the overall functioning of the health care system. Given their training in understanding wellness, distress, and psychotherapeutic treatment, mental health clinicians are well positioned to respond to this need. By studying the lessons from past and present experiences with public health emergencies and by incorporating principles from psychotherapeutic literature and training, clinicians can help facilitate an informed and effective response. The goal of this article is to discuss the development of a resilience coaching model that is rooted in principles from psychotherapeutic literature and practice to support psychological well-being among hospital-based HCWs. This model, developed to support the authors' health care colleagues working in a Toronto hospital, is generalizable, can be adapted for use by any mental health clinician, and makes explicit how previous training in psychotherapy may be applied to coaching and supporting frontline HCWs.","Rosen, Benjamin; Preisman, Mary; Hunter, Jonathan; Maunder, Robert",Am J Psychother,,238

459765,Balancing evidence and frontline experience in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: current position of the Italian Society of Anti-infective Therapy (SITA) and the Italian Society of Pulmonology (SIP),2020,"INTRODUCTION: We examined differences in negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 specifically, by smoking status in a large sample of adults in the UK. METHOD: Data were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions. RESULTS: Relative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Current smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities. IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that without intervention, smokers will be less likely than non-smokers to take up the offer of a Covid-19 vaccine when offered. Targeted policy action may be required to ensure low uptake of Covid-19 vaccination programmes does not compound health inequalities between smokers and non-smokers.","Jackson, Sarah E; Paul, Elise; Brown, Jamie; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Nicotine tob. res,,238
459873,"New onset ascites, abdominal pain, and eosinophilia in a patient treated with nivolumab for poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma",2020,"BACKGROUND: Hydrogen peroxide and ozone have been used as chemical decontamination agents for N95 masks during supply shortages. If left behind on the masks, the residues of both chemicals represent a potential health hazard by skin contact and respiratory exposure. AIM: Characterization of hydrogen peroxide and ozone residues on mask surfaces after chemical decontamination. METHODS: Various N95 masks were decontaminated using two commercial systems employing either aerosol spray or vaporization of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ozone. Following the decontamination, the masks were aired out to eliminate moisture and potential chemical residues. The residual hydrogen peroxide and ozone were monitored in the gas phase above the mask surface, and hydrogen peroxide residue directly on mask surfaces using a colorimetric assay. FINDINGS: After decontamination, hydrogen peroxide and ozone were detectable in the gas phase in the vicinity of masks even after 5 h of aeration. Hydrogen peroxide was also detected on all studied masks, and levels up to 56 mg per mask were observed after 0.5 h of aeration. All residues gradually decreased with aeration, likely due to decomposition and vaporization. CONCLUSION: Hydrogen peroxide and ozone were present on N95 masks after decontamination.

The low socioeconomic standard group (LSS) included 51 humans, 30 females (F) and 21 males (M). The high socioeconomic standard group (HSS) included 55 subjects, 24 F and 31 M. Of the 30 LSSF, 6 were immunoglobulin M (IgM), 21 immunoglobulin G (IgG), and 6 double positive. Of the 21 LSSM, 5 were IgM, 12 IgG, and 5 double positive. Of the 24 HSSF, 6 were IgM, 11 IgG, and 5 double positive. Of the 31 HSSM, 6 were IgM, 14 IgG, and 4 double positive. Of the 51 LSS humans, 26 were symptomatic (S) and 25 asymptomatic (AS). Of the 26 S, 20 were IgG and 8 IgM/IgG double positive. Of the 25 AS, 13 were IgG and 3 IgM/IgG double positive. Of the 55 HSS humans, 38 were S and 17 AS. Of the 38S, 24 were IgG and 11 IgM positive of whom, 9 were double positive. Of the 17 AS, one was IgG and one IgM positive. The IgM prevalence was higher among the HSS humans. The IgG prevalence was significantly higher among the LSS humans. In the two different socioeconomic standards, the prevalence of either IgM or IgG was higher among F. An inverse correlation was observed between age and the anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibodies prevalence except for LSSF-IgG and LSSM-IgM.

Herein we describe the relationship between the demographics, clinical characteristics, and molecular investigations and the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibodies. METHODS: Three hundred and four participants, living in Gauteng, South Africa, were screened for COVID-19 antibodies between September 12, and December 12, 2020. Indications for serological testing included previous infection (n = 45, 14.80%), World Health Organization (WHO) symptoms (n = 122, 40.13%), positive household contact (n = 40, 13.16%), and/or positive close non-household contact (n = 80, 26.32%). RESULTS: There were 58 (19.08%) positive rapid antibody tests. Risk factors associated with a positive rapid antibody test included WHO symptoms, namely fever/chills (odds ratio [OR] 3.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50 to 8.19), loss of taste or smell (OR 8.66, 95% CI 3.27 to 22.94), and the presence of a household contact (OR 3.66, 95% CI 1.59 to 8.40).

460833,COVID-19 Bergamo effect and vaccination strategy,2021,"Purpose: This paper studies the impact of social distancing causing crises (SDCC) such as pandemics in its early stages on e-tailers demand and supply side operations and provides a conceptual framework for adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: A grounded theory-based approach has been used, wherein journal papers and news articles are the key data sources. Standard qualitative methodology, including open, axial and selective coding has been followed. Findings: The study provides second order themes derived from first-order categories, the theoretical dimensions and their interrelationships on how e-tailers need to adapt to variations in online buying behaviour, manage manpower shortage and daily necessities inventory shortage, during SDCC. Panic buying emerges as a key disrupting factor as it has multiple repercussions on demand and supply side operations of e-tailers. Research limitations/implications: Exploratory qualitative research such as this is helpful in early development of a research stream and paves the way for future quantitative studies. Practical implications: This study makes a valuable contribution on e-tailers adaptation to SDCC with significant managerial implications. There are social, economic and policy implications too. For academicians, this study provides a conceptual framework and serves as a springboard for future research. Originality/value: The study is unique as perhaps it is one of the first to study e-tailers adaptation to SDCC. It contributes to a body of the literature which is currently scarce but expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Halan, D.",International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management,,238

Despite current efforts, developing safe and effective treatments remains a major challenge. Moreover, new strains of the virus are likely to emerge in the future. To prevent future pandemics, several drugs with various mechanisms of action are required. Drug discovery efforts against the virus fall into two main categories: (a) monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein of the virus and blocking it from entry; (b) small molecule inhibitors targeting key proteins of the virus, interfering with replication and translation of the virus. In this study, we are presenting a computational investigation of a potential drug candidate that targets SARS-CoV-2 protease, a viral protein critical for replication and translation of the virus.","Chitsaz, Mohsen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09125v2.pdf,238
463499,Missing Funding Information,2020,"Pre-existing heart failure (HF) in diagnosed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a close to two-fold increased mortality rate compared to COVID-19 patients without prior HF history. Moreover, based both on biomarker as well as imaging findings, widespread endothelial and cardiac injury seems to be present in many patients presenting with COVID-19, associated with adverse outcomes including new onset HF. Systematic echocardiographic studies in patients with COVID-19 indicate that the most common cardiac pathology is right ventricular (RV) dilatation (39%) over and above both left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). In addition, myocardial injury, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is observed in some 55% to 70% of patients recently recovered from COVID-19 even in those who didn't get very sick during the acute illness. These observations seem to indicate a potentially rather high risk of clinical HF emerging in patients post-COVID-19, warranting close long-term monitoring of patients during recovery. On the other hand, given the established adverse prognostic role that pre-existing HF plays as a comorbidity in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, it not only seems important in the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that all patients with known HF should proactively be well controlled and treated according to current guidelines, but also additionally be considered for priority vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 infection if not yet vaccinated.","Standl, Eberhard; Schnell, Oliver",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,238

Local, population-level, real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness is accumulating. We assessed vaccine effectiveness for community-dwelling New York City (NYC) residents using a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design, leveraging a period (January 12-March 9, 2021) when [≥]65-year-olds were vaccine-eligible but younger persons, excluding essential workers, were not. MethodsWe constructed segmented, negative binomial regression models of age-specific COVID-19 hospitalization rates among 45-84-year-old NYC residents during a post-vaccination program implementation period (February 21-April 17, 2021), with a discontinuity at age 65 years. The relationship between age and hospitalization rates in an unvaccinated population was incorporated using a pre-implementation period (December 20, 2020-February 13, 2021). We calculated the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the interaction between implementation period (pre or post) and age-based eligibility (45-64 or 65-84 years). Analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity and borough of residence. Similar analyses were conducted for COVID-19 deaths. ResultsHospitalization rates among 65-84-year-olds decreased from pre- to post-implementation periods (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97), controlling for trends among 45-64-year-olds. Accordingly, an estimated 721 (95% CI: 126-1,241) hospitalizations were averted. Residents just above the eligibility threshold (65-66-year-olds) had lower hospitalization rates than those below (63-64-year-olds). Racial/ethnic groups and boroughs with higher vaccine coverage generally experienced greater reductions in RR point estimates. Uncertainty was greater for the decrease in COVID-19 death rates (RR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.10). ConclusionThe vaccination program in NYC reduced COVID-19 hospitalizations among the initially age-eligible [≥]65-year-old population by approximately 15%. The real-world evidence of vaccine effectiveness makes it more imperative to improve vaccine access and uptake to reduce inequities in COVID-19 outcomes.","Greene, Sharon K.; Levin-Rector, Alison; McGibbon, Emily; Baumgartner, Jennifer; Devinney, Katelynn; Ternier, Alexandra; Sell, Jessica; Kahn, Rebecca; Kishore, Nishant",,,238

There are no widely available licensed therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2, highlighting an urgent need for effective interventions. The virus enters host cells through binding of a receptor-binding domain within its trimeric spike glycoprotein to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In this article, we describe the generation and characterization of a panel of murine mAbs directed against the receptor-binding domain. One mAb, 2B04, neutralized wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with remarkable potency (half-maximal inhibitory concentration of <2 ng/ml). In a murine model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2B04 protected challenged animals from weight loss, reduced lung viral load, and blocked systemic dissemination. Thus, 2B04 is a promising candidate for an effective antiviral that can be used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Alsoussi, Wafaa B; Turner, Jackson S; Case, James B; Zhao, Haiyan; Schmitz, Aaron J; Zhou, Julian Q; Chen, Rita E; Lei, Tingting; Rizk, Amena A; McIntire, Katherine M; Winkler, Emma S; Fox, Julie M; Kafai, Natasha M; Thackray, Larissa B; Hassan, Ahmed O; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Watson, Corey T; Kleinstein, Steven H; Fremont, Daved H; Diamond, Michael S; Ellebedy, Ali H",J Immunol,,238
465753,The Paradoxical Effects of COVID-19 on Cancer Care: Current Context and Potential Lasting Impacts,2020,"Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. It affects 2% to 8% of pregnancies worldwide and causes significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Hypertension and proteinuria are the cornerstone of the disease, though systemic organ dysfunction may ensue. The clinical syndrome begins with abnormal placentation with subsequent release of antiangiogenic markers, mediated primarily by soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng). High levels of sFlt-1 and sEng result in endothelial dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and immune dysregulation, which can negatively impact every maternal organ system and the fetus. This review comprehensively examines the pathogenesis of preeclampsia with a specific focus on the mechanisms underlying the clinical features. Delivery is the only definitive treatment. Low-dose aspirin is recommended for prophylaxis in high-risk populations. Other treatment options are limited. Additional research is needed to clarify the pathophysiology, and thus, identify potential therapeutic targets for improved treatment and, ultimately, outcomes of this prevalent disease.","Ives, Christopher W; Sinkey, Rachel; Rajapreyar, Indranee; Tita, Alan T N; Oparil, Suzanne",J Am Coll Cardiol,,238

Therefore, surgeons must inform patients about the expected functional and qualitative recovery of shoulder function after surgery. METHODS: The present study included a prospective cohort of 66 patients (85 neck dissection sides) who underwent neck dissection between December 2015 and July 2017 at a single institution. The active shoulder abduction angles of the affected side and the patient-reported shoulder-specific quality-of-life recovery score of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) questionnaire were examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. Additionally, the association between these outcomes and risk factors for shoulder impairment were investigated. RESULTS: The average active shoulder abduction angles were significantly improved at 3 and 6 months postoperatively compared with 1 month postoperatively (96.5 ± 4.3° at 1 month versus 110.1 ± 4.7° at 3 months, p = 0.035, and versus 142.0 ± 4.6° at 6 months, p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients who were unable to abduct their shoulders by 150° or more was significantly lower at 6 months postoperatively (41.5%) compared with 1 month postoperatively (82.4%, p < 0.0001). The WORC score significantly improved from 60.4 ± 2.4% at 1 month postoperatively to 67.9 ± 2.6% at 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.036). Multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative radiotherapy was a significant risk factor for shoulder impairment at 3 and 6 months postoperatively (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027, respectively), and that level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were significant risk factors for a worse shoulder outcome at 6 and 9 months postoperatively (respective p values for level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were p = 0.049 and p = 0.030 at 6 months postoperatively, and p = 0.016 and p = 0.013 at 9 months postoperatively). CONCLUSION: Satisfactory functional and qualitative recovery of shoulder function was achieved at 6 months after neck dissection. Postoperative radiotherapy was a predictor of poor shoulder function in the early postoperative period; both level V dissection and head and neck irradiation were predictors of poor shoulder function at 6 and 9 months after neck dissection.","Imai, Takayuki; Sato, Yuki; Abe, Jun; Kumagai, Jun; Morita, Sinkichi; Saijo, Satoshi; Yamazaki, Tomoko; Asada, Yukinori; Matsuura, Kazuto",Auris nasus larynx,,238

DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: 3 large acute medical receiving units in NHS Lothian, Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Non-COVID-19 acute admissions (n=1682) were examined over the first 31 days after the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown policy in the UK on 23 March 2019. Patients admitted over a matched interval in the previous 5 years were used as a comparator cohort (n=14 954). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demography, biochemical markers of clinical acuity and 7-day hospital inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Non-COVID-19 acute medical admissions reduced by 44.9% across all three sites in comparison with the mean of the preceding 5 years (p<0.001). Patients arriving during this period were more likely to be male, of younger age and to arrive by emergency ambulance transport. Non-COVID-19 admissions during lockdown had a greater incidence of acute kidney injury, lactic acidaemia and an increased risk of hospital death within 7 days (4.2% vs 2.5%), which persisted after adjustment for confounders (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.41, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a significant reduction in non-COVID-19 acute medical admissions during the early weeks of lockdown.

Irrespective of clinical symptoms employees were offered a voluntary and free SARS-CoV-2 test. Furthermore, employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions and employees after risk contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients or employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharyngeal swabs were taken and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed, test results being available within 24 h. Profession, symptoms and reason for SARS-CoV-2 testing of employees were recorded. RESULTS: Between 9th March and April 30, 2020, a total of 1510 employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1185 employees took advantage of the low-threshold testing facility. One percent (n = 11) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18% being asymptomatic, 36% showing mild and 36% moderate/severe symptoms (missing 10%). Furthermore, of 56 employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions, 18% (10/56) were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. After risk contact tracking by the hospital hygiene 6 patient-to-employee transmissions were identified in 163 employees with contact to 55 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. CONCLUSION: In the absence of easily accessible public SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities in hospitals with rapid testing resources help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected employees with absent or mild symptoms, thus stopping the spread of infection in vulnerable hospital environments. High levels of professional infection prevention training and implementation of specialized wards as well as a perfectly working hospital hygiene network identifying and tracking risk contacts are of great importance in a pandemic setting.","Menting, T; Krause, K; Benz-Tettey, F; Boehringer, R; Laufer, D; Gruber, B; Crump, M; Schieferdecker, R; Reuhl, S; Kaeferstein, A; Engelhart, S; Streeck, H; Marx, B; Aldabbagh, S; Eis-Hübinger, A; Rockstroh, J K; Schwarze-Zander, C",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,238

472716,Exploration of prognostic factors for critical COVID-19 patients using a nomogram model,2021,"COVID-19, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, is a disease characterised by cough, fever and fatigue, which progresses to life-threatening lung injury in approximately 5% of patients. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell via ACE2. ACE2 is a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) which has an important counterregulatory effect on the classical ACE-dependent pathway. Several antihypertensives increase ACE2 expression or activity, leading to concern that this may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and worsen COVID-19 disease. However, ACE2 is protective against lung injury while ANG II (which is catabolised by ACE2) is associated with lung injury both in mice and humans. We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials. Here we give an overview of the RAS pathway with respect to COVID-19 and argue that strategies which manipulate this pathway might reduce the destructive lung manifestations of COVID-19 and improve patient outcomes.","Sturrock, Beattie Rh; Milne, Kate; Chevassut, Timothy Jt",,,238

473625,"Reply to ""Additional Chest Imaging Signs That Have the Potential of Being COVID-19 Imaging Markers""",2020,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence and mortality of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic show marked geographic variation. The presence of several subtypes of the coronavirus and the genetic differences in the populations could condition that variation. Thus, the objective of this study was to propose variants in genes that encode proteins related to the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells as possible targets for genetic associations studies. METHODS: The allelic frequencies of the polymorphisms in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11A, cathepsin L (CTSL), and elastase (ELANE) genes were obtained in four populations from the American, African, European, and Asian continents reported in the 1000 Genome Project. Moreover, we evaluated the potential biological effect of these variants using different web-based tools. RESULTS: In the coding sequences of these genes, we detected one probably-damaging polymorphism located in the TMPRSS2 gene (rs12329760) that produces a change of amino acid. Furthermore, forty-eight polymorphisms with possible functional consequences were detected in the non-coding sequences of the following genes: three in ACE2, seventeen in TMPRSS2, ten in TMPRSS11A, twelve in ELANE, and six in CTSL. These polymorphisms produce binding sites for transcription factors and microRNAs. The minor allele frequencies of these polymorphisms vary in each community; indeed, some of them are high in specific populations. CONCLUSION: In summary, using data of the 1000 Genome Project and web-based tools, we propose some polymorphisms, which, depending on the population, could be used for genetic association studies.","Vargas-Alarcón, Gilberto; Posadas-Sánchez, Rosalinda; Ramírez-Bello, Julian",Life Sci,,238
473917,Investigation on Using Smartphones to Obtain Treatment Decisions for Thyroid Cancer Patients Before Surgery,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infection is a fundamental tool in the public health measures taken to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the overwhelming use of SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription (RT)-PCR tests worldwide, the availability of test kits has become a major bottleneck and the need to increase testing throughput is rising. We aim to overcome these challenges by pooling samples together, and performing RNA extraction and RT-PCR in pools. METHODS: We tested the efficiency and sensitivity of pooling strategies for RNA extraction and RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. We tested 184 samples both individually and in pools to estimate the effects of pooling. We further implemented Dorfman pooling with a pool size of eight samples in large-scale clinical tests. RESULTS: We demonstrated pooling strategies that increase testing throughput while maintaining high sensitivity. A comparison of 184 samples tested individually and in pools of eight samples showed that test results were not significantly affected. Implementing the eight-sample Dorfman pooling to test 26 576 samples from asymptomatic individuals, we identified 31 (0.12%) SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, achieving a 7.3-fold increase in throughput. DISCUSSION: Pooling approaches for SARS-CoV-2 testing allow a drastic increase in throughput while maintaining clinical sensitivity. We report the successful large-scale pooled screening of asymptomatic populations.","Ben-Ami, R; Klochendler, A; Seidel, M; Sido, T; Gurel-Gurevich, O; Yassour, M; Meshorer, E; Benedek, G; Fogel, I; Oiknine-Djian, E; Gertler, A; Rotstein, Z; Lavi, B; Dor, Y; Wolf, D G; Salton, M; Drier, Y",Clin Microbiol Infect,,238

Such inhibition may operate on the whole-language and/or item-specific level. In this study, we examined these two levels of control in parallel, by introducing a novel element into the traditional cued language switching paradigm: half of the stimuli were univalent (each required naming in the same language every time it appeared), and the other half were bivalent (each required naming in different languages on different trials). Contrasting switch and stay trials provided an index for whole-language inhibition, while contrasting bivalent and univalent stimuli provided an index for item-specific inhibition. We then investigated the involvement of domain-general brain mechanisms in these two levels of language control. Neuroimaging studies report activation of the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), a key region in the executive control brain network, during language switching tasks. However, it is unclear whether or not the pre-SMA plays a causal role in language control, and at which level it exerts control. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to transiently disrupt the pre-SMA, we observed an essential role of this brain region in general speech execution, while evidence for its specific involvement in each level of inhibition remains inconclusive.","Zhu, Judy D; Sowman, Paul F",,,238

In contrast to time series classification (TSC), which predicts a categorical class label, TSR predicts a numerical value. This task generalizes forecasting, relaxing the requirement that the value predicted be a future value of the input series or primarily depend on more recent values. In this paper, we motivate and introduce this task, and benchmark possible solutions to tackling it on a novel archive of 19 TSR datasets which we have assembled. Our results show that the state-of-the-art TSC model Rocket, when adapted for regression, performs the best overall compared to other TSC models and state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models such as XGBoost, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression.More importantly, we show that much research is needed in this field to improve the accuracy of ML models.","Tan, Chang Wei; Bergmeir, Christoph; Petitjean, Francois; Webb, Geoffrey I.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12672v1.pdf,238

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era. METHODS: We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. RESULTS: The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]). HRSV was the predominant virus involved in multiple detection and most codetections were HRSV + RV 7.1%, 95% CI [4.6; 9.9]) and HRSV + HBoV 4.5%, 95% CI [2.4; 7.3]). CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown that HRSV is the main cause of bronchiolitis in children, we also have Rhinovirus, and Bocavirus which also play a significant role.

Specifically, electrospun nanofiber scaffolds are considered an emergent technology and a promising approach that can be applied to biosensing, drug delivery, soft and hard tissue repair and regeneration, and wound healing. Several parameters control the functional scaffolds, such as fiber geometrical characteristics and alignment, architecture, etc. As it is based on nanotechnology, the concept of this approach has shown a strong evolution in terms of the forms of the materials used (aerogels, microspheres, etc.), the incorporated microorganisms used to treat diseases (cells, proteins, nuclei acids, etc.), and the manufacturing process in relation to the control of adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of the mimetic nanofibers. However, several difficulties are still considered as huge challenges for scientists to overcome in relation to scaffolds design and properties (hydrophilicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility) but also in relation to transferring biological nanofibers products into practical industrial use by way of a highly efficient bio-solution. In this article, the authors review current progress in the materials and processes used by the electrospinning technique to develop novel fibrous scaffolds with suitable design and that more closely mimic structure.

Automatic monitoring of night sky brightness (NSB) can help us to understand its regional differences and time variations of NSB effectively and to investigate the human and natural factors which lead to these changes. In this paper, the construction of Wuxi City night sky brightness monitoring network (WBMN) in China is presented. In addition to introducing the equipment and the installation of the network, a brief analysis of the data obtained from the stations will also be presented. The impact of human activities on the NSB is illustrated through its changes during the Spring Festival (lunar new year) and non-festival nights, and through a comparison study between NSB data taken from locations of different land usages. It is concluded that, while the reduction in human activities after non-festival midnights or the reduction in moon illumination near the new moon epoch led to darker night skies, brightening of the night skies may be attributed to firework displays during the nights of Spring Festival in 2019. On the other hand, the absence of firework during the Spring Festival in 2020 may explain the darker night skies. Finally, there is an evidence that the urban developments in Wuxi are degrading night sky quality.","Cui, Hengtao; Shen, Junru; Huang, Yuxuan; Shen, Xinrong; So, Chu Wing; Pun, Chun Shing Jason",J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transf,,238

Analysis of factors known to cause weight regain among postoperative bariatric patients,2020,"The Lagoon of Venice is a continuously evolving ecosystem that rapidly responds to anthropic stressors. The UNESCO World Heritage site ""Venice and its Lagoon"", is one of the top tourist destinations in the world. Mass tourism increases marine litter, water traffic emissions, solid waste, and sewage release. Plastic marine litter is not only a major aesthetic problem diminishing tourists experience of Venice, it also leaches contaminants into the seawater. Since there is a dearth in the literature regarding microplastic leachable compounds and overtourism related pollutants, the project studied the Head Space-Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) molecular fingerprint of volatile lagoon water pollutants, to gain insight into the extent of this phenomenon in August 2019. The chromatographic analyses enabled the identification of 40 analytes related to the presence of polymers in seawater, water traffic, and tourists habits. In Italy, on the 10th March 2020, the lockdown restrictions were enforced to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection; the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice came to a halt, and the ever-growing presence of tourists suddenly ceased. This situation provided a unique opportunity to analyze the environmental effects of restrictions on VOCs load in the Lagoon. 17 contaminants became not detectable after the lockdown period. The statistical analysis indicated that the amounts of many other contaminants significantly dropped. The presence of 9 analytes was not statistically influenced by the lockdown restrictions, probably because of their stronger persistence or continuous input in the environment from diverse sources. Results signify a sharp and encouraging pollution decrease at the molecular level, concomitant with the anthropogenic stress release, even if it is not possible to attribute quantitatively the VOCs load variations to specific sources (e.g., tourists' habits, urban water traffic, plastic pollution).","Cecchi, Teresa",Sci Total Environ,,238

478721,Potential Misdiagnosis between COVID-19 and Dengue Infection Using Rapid Serological Test,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic may cause a nursing shortage. Prelicensure nursing students who are exposed to high-stress COVID-19 events are related to defective career decision-making. This study validated the COVID-19 attitude scale and clarified how their attitudes about COVID-19 affected their behavioral intentions toward career decision-making. We conducted a cross-sectional study and recruited a convenience sample of 362 prelicensure nursing students from Northern and Central Taiwan. Two measurements were applied, including the Nursing Students Career Decision-making instrument and COVID-19 attitude scale. We used AMOS (version 22.0) to perform a confirmatory factor analysis. The Cronbach &#945; of the COVID-19 attitude scale was 0.74 and consisted of four factors. The most positive attitude was the nursing belief factor, and the least positive factor was emotional burden. Prelicensure nursing students' COVID-19 attitudes were significantly positively associated with their career decision-making attitudes and perceived control (ß = 0.41 and ß = 0.40, respectively; p < 0.001). All the key latent variables explained significantly 23% of the variance in the career decision-making behavioral intentions module. In conclusion, the COVID-19 attitude scale is valid. Although the prelicensure nursing students' COVID-19 attitudes had no direct effect on career decision-making intentions, they had a direct effect on career decision-making attitudes and the perceived control.","Lin, Shu-Chun; Ni, Lee-Fen; Wang, Yu-Ming; Lee, Shu Hsin; Liao, Hung-Chang; Huang, Cheng-Yi; Tseng, Ying-Chen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,238

Researchers are racing to develop treatments based on antibodies to block and/or neutralize the coronavirus in affected patients. Initially, the genetic and structural similarity of the virus to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) created the potential for understanding disease pathogenesis. Researchers have published reports of specific monoclonal antibodies against to COVID-19 (B38, H4, 47D11) and hope that this method is effective. As well as studies on patients who are plasma therapy, the patient's condition shows improvement. The evidence for these studies is very promising and demonstrates the potential of monoclonal antibody therapy as a therapeutic approach and prevention of covid-19 infection.","Jahanshahlu, Leila; Rezaei, Nima",Biomed Pharmacother,,238
479330,"Breast Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Observational Clinical Study of the Breast Surgery Clinic at Ospedale Policlinico San Martino - Genoa, Italy",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted medical research, pushing mentors and mentees to decide if COVID-19 research would be germane to the early career investigator's developing research portfolio. With COVID-19 halting hundreds of federal trials involving non-COVID-19 research, mentors and mentees must also consider the broader moral calling of contributing to COVID-19 research. At the time of writing, the National Institutes of Health had responded to the pandemic with significant funding for COVID-19 research. However, because this pandemic is a new phenomenon, few mentors have expertise in the disease and relevant established resources. As a result, many mentors are unable to provide insight on COVID-19 research to early career investigators considering a pivot toward research related to this disease. The authors suggest 4 ways for mentees and mentors to respond to the changes the pandemic has brought to research funding and opportunities: (1) Include COVID-19 research in existing portfolios to diversify intellectual opportunities and reduce funding risks; (2) negotiate the mentor-mentee relationship and roles and expectations early in project discussions-considering, as relevant, the disproportionate burden of home responsibilities often borne by early career faculty members who are women and/or from a minority group; (3) address any mentor limitations in content expertise; and (4) if the decision is to pivot to COVID-19 research, select projects with implications generalizable beyond this pandemic to other infectious outbreaks or to the redesign of health care delivery. Mentors and mentees must weigh the relevance of COVID-19 research projects to the postpandemic world and the amount of available funding against the developing interests of early career investigators. Academic medical centers nationwide must enable seasoned and early career researchers to contribute meaningfully to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 research.","Gettel, Cameron J; Venkatesh, Arjun K",Acad. med,,238

479536,203MO Changes in management for patients with lung cancer treated with radical radiotherapy during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK (COVID-RT Lung),2021,"Current SARS-CoV-2 pandemy mortality created the hypothesis that some populations may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 encodes a transmembrane serine protease which plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS2 might influence SARS-CoV2 entry into the cell. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SNPs on TMPRSS2 function and structure. In silico tools such as Ensembl, Gtex, ExPASY 2, GEPIA, CCLE, KEGG and GO were engaged to characterize TMPRSS2 and its expression profile. The functional effects of SNPs were analyzed by PolyPhen-2, PROVEN, SNAP2, SIFT and HSF. Also, Phyre2, GOR IV and PSIPRED were used to predict the secondary structure of TMPRSS2. Moreover, post-translational modification (PTM) and secretory properties were analyzed through Modpredand Phobius, respectively. Finally, miRNA profiles were investigated by PolymiRTS and miRSNPs. Out of 11,184 retrieved SNPs from dbSNP, 92 showed a different frequency between Asians and other populations. Only 21 SNPs affected the function and structure of TMPRSS2 by influencing the protein folding, PTM, splicing and miRNA function. Particularly, rs12329760 may create a de novo pocket protein. rs875393 can create a donor site, silencer and broken enhancer motifs. rs12627374 affects a wide spectrum of miRNAs profile. This study highlighted the role of TMPRSS2 SNPs and epigenetic mechanisms especially non-coding RNAs in appearance of different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 among different populations. Also, this study could pave the way to potential therapeutic implication of TMPRSS2 in designing antiviral drugs.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

482127,Statistical considerations in clinical trial design with event-free survival as the primary efficacy endpoint,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Presently, the pandemic of COVID-19 has worsened the situation worldwide and received global attention. The United States of America have the highest numbers of a patient infected by this disease followed by Brazil, Russia, India and many other countries. Moreover, lots of research is going on to find out effective vaccines or medicine, but still, no potent vaccine or drug is discovered to cure COVID-19. As a consequence, many types of research have designated that computer-based studies, such as protein-ligand interactions, structural dynamics, and chembio modeling are the finest choice due to its low cost and time-saving features. Here, oxindole derivatives have been chosen for docking because of their immense pharmacological applications like antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and so on. Molecular docking of 30 oxindole derivatives done on the crystallized structure of the protein (COVID-19 Mpro). METHODS: The process of docking, interaction, and binding the structure of ligand with protein has executed using Molegro Virtual Docker v.7.0.0 (MVD) and visualized the usage by Molegro Molecular Viewer v.7.0.0 (MMV). RESULTS: Among the 30 derivatives, the outcomes depicted better steric interaction and hydrogen bonding amongst OD-22 ligand, OD-16 ligand, OD-4 ligand, and OD-9 ligand (oxindole derivatives) with COVID-19. In addition to this, the comparative study of these four compounds with existing drugs that are under clinical trials shows comparatively good results in terms of its MolDock scores, H-bonding and steric interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, It is proposed that these four oxindole derivatives have good potential as a new drug against coronavirus as possible therapeutic agents.","Shah, Vraj R; Bhaliya, Jaydip D; Patel, Gautam M",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,,238

482234,The potential similarities of COVID-19 and autoimmune disease pathogenesis and therapeutic options: new insights approach,2020,"Face coverings have been shown to slow the spread of COVID-19, yet their use is not universal and remains controversial in the United States. Designing effective nudges for widespread adoption is important when federal mandates are politically or legally infeasible. We report the results from a survey experiment in which subjects were exposed to one of three video messages from President Trump, and then indicated their preference for wearing a mask. In the first video, the President simply recited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In the second, the President additionally emphasized that wearing a mask is optional. In the third video, the President added that he will not personally wear a mask. We find that exposure to presidential messages can increase the stated likelihood of wearing a mask-particularly among the President's supporters. We also explore experiential effects of COVID-19, and find that people (especially supporters of the President) are more likely to support wearing a mask if they know someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. These results offer guidance to policy makers and practitioners interested in understanding the factors that influence viral risk mitigation strategies.","Cherry, Todd L; James, Alexander G; Murphy, James",Journal of economic behavior and organization,,238

It can cause sepsis and septic shock leading to high morbidity, mortality, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The aim of this case-control study is to identify the risk factors associated with the nBSI development in COVID-19 hospitalised patients and its incidence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A retrospective case-control study will be performed. Cases will include nBSI episodes of adult patients (&#8805;18 years) admitted to Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Barcelona, Spain, from April to December 2020 with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Patients transferred from other hospitals will be excluded. Controls will include hospitalisation episodes of COVID-19 patients without nBSI. We will recruit a minimum of 74 nBSI episodes (cases) and 74 controls (according to sample size calculation). We will collect data on sociodemographics, clinical status at admission, hospital admission, in-hospital mortality, and exposure data (use of antivirals, glucocorticoids or immunomodulatory agents, length of hospitalisation, and use of medical devices such as intravenous catheters). A bivariate and a subsequent multivariate regression analysis will be performed to assess the independent effect of the associated risk factors after adjusting for confounders. The nBSI incidence rate will be estimated according to the number of nBSI episodes in admitted COVID-19 patients among the total person-month of follow-up. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol of this study was approved by the Ethical Committee for Drug Investigation of the Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and social policies have disrupted all aspects of community life in the United States, but the impact on people with progressive muscular dystrophies is unknown. Design/Methods: The COVID-19 and Social Policy Impact Survey was developed by muscular dystrophy experts in association with patient collaborators and advocacy groups. The survey assesses social impact;impact on disease;exercise;use of telemedicine;and effect on research. Overall stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, a validated 10-item inventory of stress. We conducted a prospective de-identified electronic survey of people with muscular dystrophy residing in the US from May 8, 2020 to May 28, 2020. An IRB-approved information letter with an embedded link to the survey was emailed to registry participants who had agreed to be contacted by email, or posted as notifications on advocacy websites. Results: Respondents (n=774: 56% FSHD;35% DM, and 9% LGMD) were mostly women and middle-aged (range 19-87 years). Rates of COVID-19 infections were low (<1%) and compliance with social distancing policies high (98%). Major challenges reported during the pandemic included: obtaining treatment (40%), managing stress (37%), social distancing (36%), and obtaining essentials (34%). Of those who reported a change in their disease, the majority reported slight worsening. Respondents reported moderate stress levels (stress score= 15.4;range= 0-35), with higher stress levels reported by women and those under age 30 years. Threequarters of participants who participated in telemedicine visits were satisfied with the encounters;however, most reported a preference for in-person visits. Conclusions: People with muscular dystrophy reported multiple challenges due to COVID-19 social policies, and moderate levels of stress. Future interventions like exercise and stress-coping strategies, including strategies specific to women or individuals < 30 years, may be important.","Lewis, L.; Eichinger, K.; Dilek, N.; Higgs, K.; Walker, M.; Palmer, D.; Cooley, J.; Johnson, N.; Tawil, A.; Statland, J.",Neurology,,238

It has caused more than 10,000,000 infections and more than 500,000 deaths in the world so far. Many scientists have tried their best to discover safe and effective drugs for the treatment of this disease; however, there are still no approved standard therapeutics or effective antiviral drugs on the market. Many new drugs are being developed, and several traditional drugs that were originally indicated or proposed for other diseases are likely to be effective in treating COVID-19, but their safety and efficacy are controversial, under study, or in clinical trial phases. Fortunately, some novel antiviral strategies, such as convalescent plasma, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, potentially offer an additional or alternative option or compassionate use for the people suffering from COVID-19, especially for critically ill patients, although their safety and efficacy are also under study. In this review, we explore the applications, possible mechanisms, and efficacy in successful cases using convalescent plasma, CRISPR, and MSC therapy for COVID-19 treatment, respectively.

This RT-LAMP assay specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 without cross-reacting with the most closely related human coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Clinical evaluation of nasal swab samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (COVID-19) patients showed that the assay could detect over 23.7 copies within 15 min with a 100% probability. Since the RT-LAMP assay can be performed with a portable battery-supported device, it is a rapid, simple, and sensitive diagnostic assay for COVID-19 that can be available at point-of-care. We also developed the RT-LAMP assay without the RNA extraction step-Direct RT-LAMP, which could detect more than 1.43 x 103 copies within 15 min with a 100% probability in clinical evaluation test. Although the Direct RT-LAMP assay was less sensitive than the standard RT-LAMP, the Direct RT-LAMP assay can be available as the rapid first screening of COVID-19 in poorly equipped areas, such as rural areas in developing countries.","Yoshikawa, Rokusuke; Abe, Haruka; Igasaki, Yui; Negishi, Saeki; Goto, Hiroaki; Yasuda, Jiro",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,238

However, commercial P4HB can only be produced by the bacterial fermentation, which limits its applications in the cerebrospinal system due to higher endotoxin restriction. Meanwhile, P4HB can be prepared via the ring-opening polymerization of Î³-butyrolactone. In this contribution, high molecular weight P4HB from chemosynthesis is electrospun into fibrous membrane, showing good mechanical properties that match the natural dura mater. Such P4HB membrane induces fast cellular migration, adhesion, and proliferation of fibroblasts in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation in rats demonstrates excellent biocompatibility of the P4HB membrane with proper biodegradation behaviors. After implantation in the rabbit dural defect model as an onlay graft, the P4HB membranes prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage and regenerate dura tissue without detecting any local or systematic infections or foreign body responses. Thus, the electrospun P4HB membranes may be particularly useful as artificial dural substitutes to induce wound closure and tissue regeneration, which will be of great benefit to neurosurgery in the future.","Ma, Huihui; Sun, Yilin; Tang, Ying; Shen, Yong; Kan, Ze; Li, Qing; Fang, Sha; Lu, Yingxi; Zhou, Xianfeng; Li, Zhibo",Macromol Biosci,,238

One such entity is takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We sought to review the various cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy reported during the COVID-19 pandemic and consolidate the information available on its clinical features, evaluation and treatment. We performed a PubMed search using the MeSH terms ""Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy"" or ""Stress Cardiomyopathy"" and ""COVID-19"", and identified 16 case reports, two case series, and one retrospective cohort study. There was a total of 24 reported patients with COVID-19 infection, who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and two patients without COVID-19 who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to the emotional stress associated with the global pandemic. The mean age of the patients was 67.19 years (SD 15.83) and 16(59.3%) were women. Chest pain was reported in only ten patients (38.46 %) and ST-elevation was seen in 11 patients (42.3%). While most patients had typical takotsubo cardiomyopathy, four patients had inverted(reverse) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, two had bi-ventricular involvement, one had median takotsubo and another had global takotsubo with apical sparing variant. Most patients had a positive outcome with complete or near-complete reversal of cardiac dysfunction at the time of discharge. Five deaths (19.23%) were reported. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare, but increasingly reported reversible cardiomyopathy that can be seen in patients with COVID-19 infection and the diagnosis must be actively sought for in these patients.","John, Kevin; Lal, Amos; Mishra, Ajay",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,238

Yet, in spite of both the critical nature of their work and the sheer size of the healthcare industry (there are over 4 million registered nurses in the United States alone), industrial-organizational (I-O) psychology as a discipline tends to largely ignore the unique aspects of the nursing profession in our research. Specifically, even before the COVID-19 crisis, it was widely acknowledged that the nursing profession was facing massive workforce shortages resulting from a dearth of individuals being trained as nurses, a rapidly aging workforce, and chronic problems with attracting and retaining nursing professionals in rural areas (Buerhaus etal., 2017;Oulton, 2006).","Harms, P.

The sources of As such as contaminated water, air, soil, but also food, can cause serious human diseases. The complex mechanism of As toxicity in the human body is associated with the generation of free radicals and the induction of oxidative damage in the cell. One effective strategy in reducing the toxic effects of As is the usage of chelating agents, which provide the formation of inert chelator-metal complexes with their further excretion from the body. This review discusses different aspects of the use of metal chelators, alone or in combination, in the treatment of As poisoning. Consideration is given to the therapeutic effect of thiol chelators such as meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonate, 2,3-dimercaptopropanol, penicillamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and other recent agents against As toxicity. The review also considers the possible role of flavonoids, trace elements, and herbal drugs as promising natural chelating and detoxifying agents.","Bjørklund, Geir; Oliinyk, Petro; Lysiuk, Roman; Rahaman, Md Shiblur; Antonyak, Halyna; Lozynska, Iryna; Lenchyk, Larysa; Peana, Massimiliano",Arch. toxicol,,238

The aim of this study was to obtain patients' evaluation of their telemedicine experience. METHODS: Patients who were candidates for telemedicine consultations were recruited based on their urological ailment, necessity for follow-up and comorbidity. New referrals including patients with suspicion of cancer were not candidates for telemedicine. In total, 548 patients had their appointment altered during the period from 13 March to 30 April 2020. Postal questionnaires were sent to 548 patients and 300 (54.7%) replied. RESULTS: In total, 280 patient answered, 224 (80%) men and 56 (20%) women, mean age 69 years (range 18-91) of whom 180 (64.3%) had a benign and 100 (35.7%) a malignant diagnosis. Twenty (6.7%) respondents did not remember their telephone consultation and were therefore excluded. Telephone consultation satisfaction was reported by 230 (85.0%) patients, but they would not prefer video consultations over telephone consultations, and only 102 (36.4%) would prefer telephone consultations in the future. Patients' age, sex and distance to the hospital did not seem to be associated with telephone consultation satisfaction (age p = 0.17; sex p = 0.99; distance p = 0.27, respectively). In total, 226 (80.7%) were medically assessed as being at risk for COVID, but 74 (26.4%) subjectively evaluated themselves as being at risk. CONCLUSIONS: In general (85.0%), urological patients were satisfied with telephone consultations.","Heeno, Emma; Biesenbach, Irmelin; Englund, Charlotte; Lund, Martin; Toft, Anja; Lund, Lars",Scand J Urol,,238

491015,"Delirium in older patients with COVID-19: prevalence, risk factors and clinical relevance",2021,"BACKGROUND: The disruption by the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate medical education allowed for assessment of virtual curricular innovations. One of the difficulties encountered in the virtual curriculum is the teaching of clinical competencies that would traditionally require students to undergo in-person simulations and patient encounters. We implemented a novel informed consent activity module, with standardized patients, to improve self-efficacy in communication within our core surgery clerkship. STUDY DESIGN: All medical students who participated in the virtual surgery clerkship were recruited to participate in a retrospective survey study regarding the novel informed consent module. These questions evaluated their perceived competence in 4 domains relating to informed consent: identifying the key elements, describing common challenges, applying the New Mexico Clinical Communication Scale (NMCCS), and documenting. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 90 students participated in the study (38% of the cohort). Respondents to the survey reported that their self-efficacy in communication skills related to informed consent improved as a result of their participation in the activity in each of the 4 domains surveyed (p < 0.01), with the majority of students identifying as satisfactory or above in each domain post-module. Students generally viewed the virtual informed consent activity positively, but noted that it was not the same as an in-person clinical experience. CONCLUSIONS: A virtual module of communication skills training, using standardized patients and faculty, improved students' belief in their self-efficacy in obtaining informed consent. This communication module can be useful in a virtual or mixed curricular structure for both current and future medical students.","Pang, Joyce H; Finlay, Esme; Fortner, Sally; Pickett, Bradley; Wang, Ming-Li",J Am Coll Surg,,238

492024,Management of Follow-Up With Preterm Infants During the Outbreak in China,2021,"Cardiovascular disease is a frequent complication and the most common cause of death in patients with CKD. Despite landmark medical advancements, mortality due to cardiovascular disease is still 20 times higher in CKD patients than in the general population, which is mainly due to the high prevalence of risk factors in this group. Indeed, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, CKD patients are exposed to nontraditional ones, which include metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory alterations. The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought novel challenges for both cardiologists and nephrologists alike. Emerging evidence indicates that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increases the risk of cardiovascular events and that several aspects of the disease may synergize with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients. A better understanding of these mechanisms is pivotal for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular events in this context, and we believe that additional clinical and experimental studies are needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients with COVID-19. In this review, we provide a summary of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients, discussing their interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection and focusing on CO-VID-19-related cardiovascular complications that may severely affect short- and long-term outcomes in this high-risk population.","Podestà, Manuel Alfredo; Valli, Federica; Galassi, Andrea; Cassia, Matthias A; Ciceri, Paola; Barbieri, Lucia; Carugo, Stefano; Cozzolino, Mario",Blood Purif,,238

This study aimed to evaluate longitudinal change patterns of key laboratory tests in patients with COVID-19, and identify independent prognostic factors by examining the associations between laboratory findings and outcomes of patients. This multicenter study included 56 patients with COVID-19 treated in Jilin Province, China, from January 21, 2020 to March 5, 2020. The laboratory findings, epidemiological characteristics and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records. The average value of eosinophils and carbon dioxide combining power continued to significantly increase, while the average value of cardiac troponin I and mean platelet volume decreased throughout the course of the disease. The average value of lymphocytes approached the lower limit of the reference interval for the first 5 days and then rose slowly thereafter. The average value of thrombocytocrit peaked on day 7 and slowly declined thereafter. The average value of mean corpuscular volume and serum sodium showed an upward trend from day 8 and day 15, respectively. Age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase, platelet count and globulin level were included in the final model to predict the probability of recovery. The above parameters were verified in 24 patients with COVID-19 in another area of Jilin Province. The risk stratification and management of patients with COVID-19 could be improved according to the temporal trajectories of laboratory tests.","Tian, Suyan; Zhu, Xuetong; Sun, Xuejuan; Wang, Jinmei; Zhou, Qi; Wang, Chi; Chen, Li; Li, Shanji; Xu, Jiancheng",Virol Sin,,238

Most of the world has adopted Virtual Classes (VCs) to sustain teaching and learning. While prior research about such e-learning technologies has been focusing on the initial adoption, this research investigates the factors influencing the students’ desire and intention to continue using VCs, especially after the crisis subsides. This study extends the literature by developing a model that integrates pre-and post-adoption constructs and incorporates technological characteristics, namely, task technology fit, convenience, and compatibility into the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) to study the post-adoption Continuance Intention (CI) of VCs. The model is empirically validated using the partial least squares–structural equation modelling method and proved to have a reasonable description power (R2=62%) in terms of students’ CI. The survey empirical data is also supported by interviews with some students. The results support all the hypothesized relationships and confirm that the integration of technical characteristics in the ECM provides an appropriate framework to explain students’ intention to continue using VCs, which forms a good base for practitioners to consider a wide range of technological features for preparing applications. Yet, the model still requires to be extended with other stakeholders, including teachers, and other constructs like personal, psychological, social, and environmental factors. © 2021 The Authors.","Ibrahim, Y.; Hidayat-Ur-Rehman, I.",International Journal of Advanced and Applied Sciences,,238
493181,Integrative Medicine Demonstrates Advantage in COVID-19 Treatment,2020,"Obesity continues to be a growing public health challenge worldwide with significant health and economic impacts. However, much of what is known about the economic impacts of obesity comes from high-income countries and is not readily comparable. Since 2019, RTI International and World Obesity Federation have worked together to estimate current and future economic impacts of obesity across heterogenous contexts globally. This poster will provide an overview of the context and need for this work, explain the methodology employed, discuss the results and their implications, and describe our plans for future analysis. We employed a cost-of-illness approach to estimate both direct and indirect cost of overweight and obesity from a societal perspective. We included 28 obesity related diseases with evidence of high BMI risk linkages as identified by the Global Burden of Disease Study. Direct medical costs were estimated using the obesity attributable fraction of health expenditure. Direct nonmedical costs include travel expenses for inpatient and outpatient care, time costs for inpatient care and caregiver costs. Indirect costs include the cost of premature mortality, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Our findings demonstrate that the economic impacts of obesity are substantial across countries, irrespective of economic or geographic context, and will increase over time if current trends continue. The estimated GDP loss from obesity is on par with economic losses due to tobacco in many countries. As we await the pending publication of the results for these initial eight countries, we have turned our attention to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed overweight and obesity as behind only old age as the leading predictor of poorer COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalization, admission to intensive care, and death. We are adapting our analysis of the projected economic impacts of obesity to include the impacts of COVID-19 on people living with obesity. Our analysis will include different scenarios to account for vaccine access and quality of care. Quantifying the economic impact of obesity can help stakeholders understand the importance of addressing obesity through systemic solutions and provide a crucial tool for advocates to push policy makers into action.","Spencer, G.; Okunogbe, A.; Nugent, R.",Obesity Facts,,238

Cleavage of the S protein at the S1/S2 and/or S2' site(s) is associated with viral entry, which can occur at either the cell plasma membrane (early pathway) or the endosomal membrane (late pathway), depending on the cell type. Previous studies show that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique insert at the S1/S2 site that can be cleaved by furin, which appears to expand viral tropism to cells with suitable protease and receptor expression. Here, we utilize viral pseudoparticles and protease inhibitors to study the impact of the S1/S2 cleavage on infectivity. Our results demonstrate that S1/S2 cleavage is essential for early pathway entry into Calu-3 cells, a model lung epithelial cell line, but not for late pathway entry into Vero E6 cells, a model cell line. The S1/S2 cleavage was found to be processed by other proteases beyond furin. Using bioinformatic tools, we also analyze the presence of a furin S1/S2 site in related CoVs and offer thoughts on the origin of the insertion of the furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.","Tang, Tiffany; Jaimes, Javier A; Bidon, Miya K; Straus, Marco R; Daniel, Susan; Whittaker, Gary R",ACS Infect Dis,,238

The differences in the rapid transmission and severity of human coronaviruses are due to the genetic composition of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 contains genes encoding non-structural proteins (NSPs), structural proteins, and accessory proteins. The NSPs are mainly involved in replication of the virus within the host and inhibition of the host defence system. Structural proteins are involved in viral entry and attachment to host cells, preservation of the core virion and elicit the majority of the immune response. The functions of the accessory proteins are largely unknown. Most focus has been given to structural proteins, especially the spike protein as the strongest vaccine candidate. However, the recent emergence of spike variants and their ability to rapidly transmit and escape neutralisation by vaccine-induced antibodies has threatened the global community. Meanwhile, recent studies of accessory proteins reveal their importance in viral pathogenesis. Hence, proper understanding of the functions of all unknown viral proteins is crucial to devise alternate antiviral strategies.","Dhakal, S.; MacReadie, I.",Microbiology Australia,,238
495801,Using handheld dermoscopes for videodermoscopy on large screens,2020,"During the bearing service, a series of microstructural evolutions will arise inside the material, such as the appearance of feature microstructures. The essential reason for the microstructural evolution is the cumulative effect of cyclic stress. The Hertz Contact formula is usually adopted to calculate the internal stress, and there is a correlation between the shape and distribution of the feature microstructure and the stress distribution. But it is insufficient to explain the relationship between the morphology of feature microstructures and the rolling direction, such as specific angles in butterfly and white etching bands. The rolling phenomenon will cause the asymmetry of stress distribution in the material, which is the source of the rolling friction coefficient. Moreover, slipping or microslip will produce additional stress components, which also cause the asymmetry of the stress field. However, there is no experimental or theoretical explanation for the relationship between the asymmetry of the stress field and the feature microstructure. According to the current theory, the appearance of feature microstructures is caused by stress with or without rolling. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the formation mechanism: whether feature microstructures will appear in the uniaxial cyclic compression stress field without rolling. In this paper, uniaxial cyclic compressive stress was loaded into a plate-ball system and a cylinder system. The characteristics of microstructural change of bearing steel (GCr15) were studied. It was found that the hardness of the material increased after the cyclic compressive load, and the inclusions interacted with the matrix material. In the local microregion a white etching area was found, although the scale is very small. No large-scale feature microstructures appeared. Other phenomena in the experiment are also described and analyzed. For example, the production of oil film in the contact area and the changing law of alternating load.","Zheng, Xiaomeng; Zhang, Yongzhen; Du, Sanming",,,238

We then analyzed coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients exhibiting less severe and more severe symptoms. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata14.0 software. A total of 3,952 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 25 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Patients with severe symptoms exhibited higher levels of D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen (FIB) than patients with less severe symptoms (SMD 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97, I2 56.9%; SMD 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-0.64, I2 79.4%; and SMD 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0.53, I2 42.4%, respectively).

It addresses the topic using a two-fold distinction between the use of remote hearings in domestic and in cross-border cases, on one hand, and the use of such of remote technology for conducting interviews of the suspect or accused in the pre-trial stages or at trial hearings, on the other hand. Recognising that these distinctive settings impact differently upon the seriousness of the interference with the fair trial rights and the rights of defence of the suspect or accused, and also upon the circumstances that must be weighed in order to assess whether restrictions are proportionate, adequate and necessary, the European Criminal Bar Association assesses whether the use of remote technologies in those different settings is acceptable and outlines proposals for further action in the field.","Ramos, Vânia Costa Anagnostakis Alexis Barletta Amedeo Tehver Jaanus Canestrini Nicola",New Journal of European Criminal Law,,238

498785,The emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis,2020,"Many countries are currently gearing up to use smart-phone apps to perform contact tracing as part of the effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent resurgences of the disease after the initial outbreak. With the announcement of the Apple/Google partnership to introduce contact-tracing functionality to iOS and Android, it seems likely that this will be adopted in many countries. An important part of the functionality of the app will be to decide whether a person should be advised to self-isolate, be tested or end isolation. However, the privacy preserving nature of the Apple/Google contact tracing algorithm means that centralised curation of these decisions is not possible so each phone must use its own""risk model""to inform decisions. Ideally, the risk model should use Bayesian inference to decide the best course of action given the test results of the user and those of other users. Here we present a decentralised algorithm that estimates the Bayesian posterior probability of viral transmission events and evaluates when a user should be notified, tested or released from isolation while preserving user privacy. The algorithm also allows the disease models on the phones to learn from everyone's contact-tracing data and will allow Epidemiologists to better understand the dynamics of the disease. The algorithm is a message passing algorithm, based on belief propagation, so each smart-phone can be used to execute a small part of the algorithm without releasing any sensitive information. In this way, the network of all participating smart-phones forms a distributed computation device that performs Bayesian inference, informs each user when they should start/end isolation or be tested and learns about the disease from user's data.","Tang, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05086v1.pdf,238

501139,The Rise of New Coronavirus Infection-(COVID-19): A Recent Update,2020,"The year 2020 witnessed a heavy death toll due to COVID-19, calling for a global emergency. The continuous ongoing research and clinical trials paved the way for vaccines. But, the vaccine efficacy in the long run is still questionable due to the mutating coronavirus, which makes drug re-positioning a reasonable alternative. COVID-19 has hence fast-paced drug re-positioning for the treatment of COVID-19 and its symptoms. This work builds computational models using matrix completion techniques to predict drug-virus association for drug re-positioning. The aim is to assist clinicians with a tool for selecting prospective antiviral treatments. Since the virus is known to mutate fast, the tool is likely to help clinicians in selecting the right set of antivirals for the mutated isolate. The main contribution of this work is a manually curated database publicly shared, comprising of existing associations between viruses and their corresponding antivirals. The database gathers similarity information using the chemical structure of drugs and the genomic structure of viruses. Along with this database, we make available a set of state-of-the-art computational drug re-positioning tools based on matrix completion. The tools are first analysed on a standard set of experimental protocols for drug target interactions. The best performing ones are applied for the task of re-positioning antivirals for COVID-19. These tools select six drugs out of which four are currently under various stages of trial, namely Remdesivir (as a cure), Ribavarin (in combination with others for cure), Umifenovir (as a prophylactic and cure) and Sofosbuvir (as a cure). Another unanimous prediction is Tenofovir alafenamide, which is a novel Tenofovir prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety when compared to its original counterpart (older version) Tenofovir disoproxil. Both are under trail, the former as a cure and the latter as a prophylactic. These results establish that the computational methods are in sync with the state-of-practice. We also demonstrate how the drugs to be used against the virus would vary as SARS-Cov-2 mutates over time by predicting the drugs for the mutated strains, suggesting the importance of such a tool in drug prediction. We believe this work would open up possibilities for applying machine learning models to clinical research for drug-virus association prediction and other similar biological problems.","Mongia, Aanchal; Saha, Sanjay Kr; Chouzenoux, Emilie; Majumdar, Angshul",Sci Rep,,238

AIMS: To investigate the impact of lithium exposure on early fetal growth. METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included all singleton pregnancies of women using lithium and referred for advanced fetal ultrasound scanning between 1994 and 2018 to the University Medical Centers in Leiden and Rotterdam, the Netherlands (n=119). The Generation R study, a population-based cohort, served as a non-exposed control population from the same geographic region (n=8184). Fetal head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and transcerebellar diameter were measured by ultrasound at 18-22 weeks of gestation. RESULTS: Lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an average increase in head circumference of 1.77 mm (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 3.01), in abdominal circumference of 5.54 mm (95% confidence interval: 3.95, 7.12) and in femur length of 0.59 mm (95% confidence interval: 0.22, 0.96) at 18-22 weeks gestation. Furthermore, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an average increase in birth weight of 142.43 grams (95% confidence interval: 58.01, 226.89), whereas it was associated with an average decrease of 1.41 weeks in gestational duration (95% confidence interval: -1.78, -1.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lithium use during pregnancy was associated with increased fetal growth parameters at 18-22 weeks gestational age and increased birth weight. Further research is needed to evaluate both short- and long-term implications, as well as the mechanisms driving this difference in growth.","Poels, Eline Mp; Sterrenburg, Karin; Wierdsma, André I; Wesseloo, Richard; Beerthuizen, Annemerle; van Dijke, Laura; Lau, Condon; Hoogendijk, Witte Jg; Marroun, Hanan El; van Kamp, Inge L; Bijma, Hilmar H; Bergink, Veerle",J Psychopharmacol,,238

Currently, there is no indication as to whether individuals who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 should be vaccinated, or whether they should receive 1 or 2 vaccine doses.METHODSWe tested the antibody response developed after administration of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in 124 health care professionals, of whom 57 had a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure with or without symptoms.RESULTSPostvaccine antibodies in SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals increased exponentially within 5 to 18 days after the first dose compared to naive subjects (P < 0.0001). In a multivariate linear regression (LR) model we showed that the antibody response depended on the IgG prevaccine titer and on the exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, IgG reached a plateau after the second dose, and those who voluntarily refrained from receiving the second dose (n = 7) retained their antibody response. Gastrointestinal symptoms, muscle pain, and fever markedly positively correlated with increased IgG responses. By contrast, all asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic and unexposed individuals showed an important increase after the second dose.CONCLUSIONOne vaccine dose is sufficient in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-exposed subjects to reach a high titer of antibodies, suggesting no need for a second dose, particularly in light of current vaccine shortage.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT04387929.FUNDINGDolce & Gabbana and the Italian Ministry of Health (Ricerca corrente).","Levi, Riccardo; Azzolini, Elena; Pozzi, Chiara; Ubaldi, Leonardo; Lagioia, Michele; Mantovani, Alberto; Rescigno, Maria",J. clin. invest,,238

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with HNSCC treated with radiotherapy +/- concurrent chemotherapy. Pretreatment metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were measured in a 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography using a liver dependent standardized uptake value threshold. Cox regression analyses were performed to find associations with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: High values of MTV (>37 ml) were independently associated with a worse DFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-7.84) and OS (HR = 3.27; 95% CI, 1.41-7.57).

507120,COVID-19 in patients with HIV - Authors' reply,2020,"BACKGROUND: Transition to digital pathology usually takes months or years to be completed. We were familiarizing ourselves with digital pathology solutions at the time when the COVID-19 outbreak forced us to embark on an abrupt transition to digital pathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantitatively describe how the abrupt transition to digital pathology might affect the quality of diagnoses, model possible causes by probabilistic modeling, and qualitatively gauge the perception of this abrupt transition. METHODS: A total of 17 pathologists and residents participated in this study; these participants reviewed 25 additional test cases from the archives and completed a final psychologic survey. For each case, participants performed several different diagnostic tasks, and their results were recorded and compared with the original diagnoses performed using the gold standard method (ie, conventional microscopy). We performed Bayesian data analysis with probabilistic modeling. RESULTS: The overall analysis, comprising 1345 different items, resulted in a 9% (117/1345) error rate in using digital slides. The task of differentiating a neoplastic process from a nonneoplastic one accounted for an error rate of 10.7% (42/392), whereas the distinction of a malignant process from a benign one accounted for an error rate of 4.2% (11/258). Apart from residents, senior pathologists generated most discrepancies (7.9%, 13/164). Our model showed that these differences among career levels persisted even after adjusting for other factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in line with previous findings, emphasizing that the duration of transition (ie, lengthy or abrupt) might not influence the diagnostic performance. Moreover, our findings highlight that senior pathologists may be limited by a digital gap, which may negatively affect their performance with digital pathology. These results can guide the process of digital transition in the field of pathology.","Giaretto, Simone; Renne, Salvatore Lorenzo; Rahal, Daoud; Bossi, Paola; Colombo, Piergiuseppe; Spaggiari, Paola; Manara, Sofia; Sollai, Mauro; Fiamengo, Barbara; Brambilla, Tatiana; Fernandes, Bethania; Rao, Stefania; Elamin, Abubaker; Valeri, Marina; De Carlo, Camilla; Belsito, Vincenzo; Lancellotti, Cesare; Cieri, Miriam; Cagini, Angelo; Terracciano, Luigi; Roncalli, Massimo; Di Tommaso, Luca",J Med Internet Res,,238
507121,COVID-19 in patients with HIV - Authors' reply,2020,"The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a global public health emergency. The pandemic is causing substantial morbidity, mortality and significant economic loss. Currently, no approved treatments for COVID-19 are available, and it is likely to take at least 12-18 months to develop a new vaccine. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new therapeutics that can be progressed to clinical development as soon as possible. Repurposing regulatory agencyapproved drugs and experimental drugs with known safety profiles can provide important repositories of compounds that can be fast-tracked to clinical development. Globally, over 500 clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been registered, and over 150 have been initiated, including some backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This review is intended as a guide to research into small-molecule therapies to treat COVID-19; it discusses the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle and identifies promising viral therapeutic targets, reports on a number of promising pre-approved small-molecule drugs with reference to over 150 clinical trials worldwide, and offers a perspective on the future of the field.","Laws, Mark; Surani, Yasmin M; Hasan, Md Mahbub; Chen, Yiyuan; Jin, Peiqin; AlAdhami, Taha; Chowdhury, Madiha; Imran, Aqeel; Psaltis, Ioannis; Jamshidi, Shirin; Nahar, Kazi S; Rahman, Khondaker Miraz",Curr. med. chem,,238

507257,An overview of COVID-19,2020,"The C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1, fractalkine receptor) is associated with neoplastic transformation, inflammation, neurodegenerative diseases and aging, and the small molecule inhibitor KAND567 targeting CX3CR1 (CX3CR1i) is evaluated in clinical trials for acute systemic inflammation upon SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we identify a hitherto unknown role of CX3CR1 in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway mediated repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in replicating cells. FA pathway activation triggers CX3CR1 nuclear localization which facilitates assembly of the key FA protein FANCD2 into foci. Interfering with CX3CR1 function upon ICL-induction results in inability of replicating cells to progress from S phase, replication fork stalling and impaired chromatin recruitment of key FA pathway factors. Consistent with defective FA repair, CX3CR1i results in increased levels of residual cisplatin-DNA adducts and decreased cell survival. Importantly, CX3CR1i synergizes with platinum agents in a nonreversible manner in proliferation assays including platinum resistant models. Taken together, our results reveal an unanticipated interplay between CX3CR1 and the FA pathway and show for the first time that a clinical-phase small molecule inhibitor targeting CX3CR1 might show benefit in improving responses to DNA crosslinking chemotherapeutics.","Lehto, Jemina; Huguet Ninou, Anna; Chioureas, Dimitrios; Jonkers, Jos; Gustafsson, Nina M S",,,238

508462,Aerosol Treatments During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Personal Journey,2020,"Multiple wearable devices for cardiovascular self-monitoring have been proposed over the years, with growing evidence showing their effectiveness in the detection of pathologies that would otherwise be unnoticed through standard routine exams. In particular, Electrocardiography (ECG) has been an important tool for such purpose. However, wearables have known limitations, chief among which are the need for a voluntary action so that the ECG trace can be taken, battery lifetime, and abandonment. To effectively address these, novel solutions are needed, which has recently paved the way for ""invisible"" (aka ""off-the-person"") sensing approaches. In this article we describe the design and experimental evaluation of a system for invisible ECG monitoring at home. For this purpose, a new sensor design was proposed, novel materials have been explored, and a proof-of-concept data collection system was created in the form of a toilet seat, enabling ECG measurements as an extension of the regular use of sanitary facilities, without requiring body-worn devices. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, measurements were performed using our system and a gold standard equipment, involving 10 healthy subjects. For the acquisition of the ECG signals on the toilet seat, polymeric electrodes with different textures were produced and tested. According to the results obtained, some of the textures did not allow the acquisition of signals in all users. However, a pyramidal texture showed the best results in relation to heart rate and ECG waveform morphology. For a texture that has shown 0% signal loss, the mean heart rate difference between the reference and experimental device was - 1.778 ± 4.654 Beats per minute (BPM); in terms of ECG waveform, the best cases present a Pearson correlation coefficient above 0.99.","Dos Santos Silva, Aline; Almeida, Hugo; da Silva, Hugo Plácido; Oliveira, António",Sci Rep,,238
508602,Anti-cancer Therapy Leads to Increased Cardiovascular Susceptibility to COVID-19,2021,"Bacillus Calmette­Guérin (BCG) is considered to be a successful biotherapy for treating bladder cancer (BCa). However, the underlying mechanisms of BCG have not been completely clarified, to date. The role of macrophages in BCG therapy for BCa has still not been determined in vivo. In the present study, the role and potential mechanism of BCG (0.25, 1.25 and 6.25 µg/mouse; intravenous) immunotherapy for BCa was investigated in a NOD/scid IL2Rg­/­ (NSI) mouse model by targeting macrophages in vivo. Notably, it was observed that NSI mice with T24 BCa cells displayed high levels of the macrophage marker CD11b+ F4/80+ after injection via the tail vein of live BCG, as well as a significant reduction in tumor volume. The levels of the inflammatory and macrophage maturation cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor­&#945;, interleukin (IL)­1ß, IL­6, IL­12P70, TNF superfamily member 11 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, were significantly increased in the serum and the tumor supernatant compared to that in normal control subjects. Furthermore, BCG promoted the expression of the pro­differential genes Spi­1 proto­oncogene, early growth response protein 1, nuclear factor (NF)­&#954;B and proto­oncogene c­Fos in bone marrow. In conclusion, these observations indicate that the injection of live BCG can target macrophages against bladder tumor growth in vivo. The mechanism is likely related to the promotion of macrophage maturation, immune activation and increased numbers of macrophages infiltrating the bladder tumor.","Tan, Qing-Long; Zhou, Chang-Yuan; Cheng, Lin; Luo, Min; Liu, Chun-Ping; Xu, Wen-Xing; Zhang, Xian; Zeng, Xing",Mol Med Rep,,238
508796,COVID aerosol barrier intubation box - Boon or bane?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection is associated with an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. Statins, given their anti-inflammatory properties, may reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to determine the association between statin use prior to hospitalization and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records of patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 infection from March 1, 2020 to April 24, 2020. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to study the association of pre-admission statin use with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 255 patients, 116 (45.5%) patients were on statins prior to admission and 139 (54.5%) were not. The statin group had a higher proportion of end stage renal disease (ESRD) (13.8% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.001), diabetes mellitus (63.8% vs. 35.2%, p<0.001), hypertension (87.9% vs. 61.1%, p < 0.001) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (33.6% vs. 5%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, we found a statistically significant decrease in the odds of in-hospital mortality in patients on statins before admission (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03- 0.61, p = 0.008). In the subgroup analysis, statins were associated with a decrease in mortality in those with CAD (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.0003-0.92 p = 0.045) and those without CAD (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.005-0.43, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that statins are associated with reduced in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19, regardless of CAD status. More comprehensive epidemiological and molecular studies are needed to establish the role of statins in COVID-19.","Chacko, Shireen R; DeJoy, Robert; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Albano, Jeri; Peterson, Eric; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gu, Fahad; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Rangaswami, Janani; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel; Benzaquen, Sadia; Gupta, Ena",Am. j. med. sci,,238

The mortality rate and follow-up periods in patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged widely. Antivirals, including remdesivir and convalescent plasma, have shown no definitive mortality benefit in this population despite positive results in other COVID-19 patients. Dexamethasone was associated with an absolute reduction in 28-day mortality by 12.3% (95% CI, 6.3 to 17.6), after adjusting for age. Reduced mortality has been demonstrated with tocilizumab use alongside corticosteroids. Evidence is inconclusive for therapeutic anticoagulation, and further studies are needed to determine the comparative benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation.Expert opinion: Significant variation and high mortality rates in mechanically ventilated patients necessitate more standardized outcome measurements, increased consideration of risk factors to reduce intubation, and improved treatment practices. Anticoagulation and dexamethasone should be incorporated in the treatment of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, while more rigorous studies are required for other potential treatments.","Tsikala Vafea, Maria; Zhang, Raina; Kalligeros, Markos; Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Expert Rev Med Devices,,238

The most frequent thyroid hormonal findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly in individuals with severe disease, are similar to those present in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome and require no intervention. Subacute thyroiditis has also been reported during COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism during the COVID-19 pandemic may follow usual practice; however, should avoid frequent laboratory tests in patients with previous controlled disease. Well-controlled hypo and hyperthyroidism are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during the pandemic should be preferably treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), bearing in mind the possibility of rare side effects with these medications, particularly agranulocytosis, which requires immediate intervention. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism (radioiodine therapy or surgery) may be considered in those cases that protective protocols can be followed to avoid COVID-19 contamination or once the pandemic is over. In patients with moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) not at risk of visual loss, glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive doses should be avoided, while in those with severe GO without COVID-19 and at risk of vision loss, intravenous glucocorticoid is the therapeutic choice. Considering that most of the thyroid cancer cases are low risk and associated with an excellent prognosis, surgical procedures could and should be postponed safely during the pandemic period. Additionally, when indicated, radioiodine therapy could also be safely postponed as long as it is possible.","Martins, João Roberto M; Villagelin, Danilo G P; Carvalho, Gisah A; Vaisman, Fernanda; Teixeira, Patrícia F S; Scheffel, Rafael S; Sgarbi, José A",Arch. endocrinol. metab.

As a specific concern, there is now compelling evidence demonstrating a causal relationship between exposure to airborne pollutants and the onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD). As such, reducing air pollution as a means to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality should be a global health priority. This review provides an overview of the cardiovascular effects of air pollution and uses two major events of 2020-the Australian bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic lockdown-to illustrate the relationship between air pollution and CVD. The bushfires highlight the substantial human and economic costs associated with elevations in air pollution. Conversely, the COVID-19-related lockdowns demonstrated that stringent measures are effective at reducing airborne pollutants, which in turn resulted in a potential reduction in cardiovascular events. Perhaps one positive to come out of 2020 will be the recognition that tough measures are effective at reducing air pollution and that these measures have the potential to stop thousands of deaths from CVD.","Wolhuter, Kathryn; Arora, Manish; Kovacic, Jason C",Bioessays,,238

However, it is still unclear whether expression levels of these factors could reflect disease severity. Here, a case-control study was conducted with 213 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals where cases were defined as COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress requiring oxygen support (N = 38) and controls were those with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease who did not need oxygen therapy along the entire clinical course (N = 175). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were evaluated in nasopharyngeal swab samples by RT-qPCR and logistic regression analyzes were applied to estimate associations with respiratory outcomes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels positively correlated with age, which was also strongly associated with respiratory distress. Increased nasopharyngeal ACE2 levels showed a protective effect against this outcome (adjOR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.09-0.91), while TMPRSS2/ACE2 ratio was associated with risk (adjOR = 4.28; 95% CI 1.36-13.48). On stepwise regression, TMPRSS2/ACE2 ratio outperformed ACE2 to model COVID-19 severity. When nasopharyngeal swabs were compared to bronchoalveolar lavages in an independent cohort of COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation, similar expression levels of these genes were observed. These data suggest nasopharyngeal TMPRSS2/ACE2 as a promising candidate for further prediction models on COVID-19.","Rossi, Átila Duque; de Araújo, João Locke Ferreira; de Almeida, Tailah Bernardo; Ribeiro-Alves, Marcelo; de Almeida Velozo, Camila; Almeida, Jéssica Maciel de; de Carvalho Leitão, Isabela; Ferreira, Sâmila Natiane; da Silva Oliveira, Jéssica; Alves, Hugo José; Scheid, Helena Toledo; Faffe, Débora Souza; Galliez, Rafael Mello; de Ávila, Renata Eliane; Resende, Gustavo Gomes; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; da Costa Ferreira Júnior, Orlando; Castiñeiras, Terezinha Marta P P; Souza, Renan Pedra; Tanuri, Amilcar; Aguiar, Renato Santana de; Barroso, Shana Priscila Coutinho; Cardoso, Cynthia Chester",Sci Rep,,238

513177,How COVID-19 will boost remote exercise-based treatment in Parkinson's disease: a narrative review,2021,"Extensive testing lies at the heart of any strategy to effectively combat the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. In recent months, the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based antibody tests has gained a lot of attention. These tests can potentially be used to assess SARS-COV-2 immunity status in individuals (e.g., essential health care personnel). They can also be used as a screening tool to identify people that had COVID-19 asymptomatically, thus getting a better estimate of the true spread of the disease, gain important insights on disease severity, and to better evaluate the effectiveness of policy measures implemented to combat the pandemic. But the usefulness of these tests depends not only on the quality of the test but also, critically, on how far disease has already spread in the population. For example, when only very few people in a population are infected, a positive test result has a high chance of being a false positive. As a consequence, the spread of the disease in a population as well as individuals' immunity status may be systematically misinterpreted. SARS-COV-2 infection rates vary greatly across both time and space. In many places, the infection rates are very low but can quickly skyrocket when the virus spreads unchecked. Here, we present two tools, natural frequency trees and positive and negative predictive value graphs, that allow one to assess the usefulness of antibody testing for a specific context at a glance. These tools should be used to support individual doctor-patient consultation for assessing individual immunity status as well as to inform policy discussions on testing initiatives.","Keller, Niklas; Jenny, Mirjam A",MDM Policy Pract,,238

515479,COVID-19 and Malignancy: Exploration of the possible genetic and epigenetic interlinks and overview of the vaccination scenario,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The oldest-old population (80 years or older) has the highest lethality from COVID-19. There is little information on the clinical presentation and specific prognostic factors for this group. This trial evaluated the clinical presentation and prognostic factors of severe disease and mortality in the oldest-old population. METHODS: This is an ambispective cohort study of oldest-old patients hospitalized for respiratory infection associated with COVID-19 and with a positive test by RT-PCR. The clinical presentation and the factors associated with severe disease and mortality were evaluated (logistic regression). All patients were followed up until discharge or death. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients (59.2% female) were included. The most frequent symptoms were fever (68.9%), dyspnoea (60.2%), and cough (39.8%), and 11.7% presented confusion. Fifty-nine patients (57.3%) presented severe disease, and 59 died, with 43 patients (41.7%) presenting both of these. In the multivariate analysis, female sex (odds ratio [OR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.13-0.73, p 0.0074) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.21-5.37, p 0.0139) were associated with severe disease, and serum sodium was associated with mortality (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.18-8.26, p 0.0222). No chronic disease or pharmacological treatment was associated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The typical presenting symptoms of respiratory infection in COVID-19 are less frequent in the oldest-old population. Male sex and LDH level are associated with severe disease, and the serum sodium level is associated with mortality in this population.","Gálvez-Barrón, César; Arroyo-Huidobro, Marta; Minarro, Antonio; Añaños, Gemma; Chamero, Antonio; Martín, Mireia; Gris, Clara; Avalos, Jose L; Capielo, Anna M; Ventosa, Ester; Tremosa, Gemma; Rodríguez-Molinero, Alejandro",Gerontology,,238

518062,Gender differences in COVID-19 patients with arterial hypertension,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has led to dramatic changes globally in persons' everyday lives. To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries at a national scale. METHODS: In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19; as of March 23, 2020, eleven of the fifty states had issued stay-at-home orders. The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the U.S. allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states. The current manuscript examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020 across each state and Washington D.C. Specifically, the current manuscript examines differential change in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states. Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23. Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders. Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.","Jacobson, Nicholas; Lekkas, Damien; Price, George; Heinz, Michael V; Song, Minkeun; O039,; Malley, A James; Barr, Paul J",,,238

(Special Issue: The pharmacology of COVID-19.),2020,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the predictive utility of the D-dimer assay among patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 syndrome for unprovoked lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. DESIGN: Prospective observational study with retrospective data analysis. SETTING: Academic medical center surgical ICU. PATIENTS: Seventy-two intubated patients with critical illness from coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic anticoagulation after imaging diagnosis of the first three deep venous thrombosis cases was confirmed; therapeutic anticoagulation as prophylaxis thereafter to all subsequent ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 were screened for deep venous thrombosis after ICU admission with 102 duplex ultrasound examinations, with 12 cases (16.7%) of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis identified. There were no differences between groups with respect to age, renal function, or biomarkers except for D-dimer (median, 12,858 ng/mL [interquartile range, 3,176-30,770 ng/mL] for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis vs 2,087 ng/mL [interquartile range, 638-3,735 ng/mL] for no evidence of deep venous thrombosis; p < 0.0001). Clinical screening tools (Wells score and Dutch Primary Care Rule) had no utility. The C-statistic for D-dimer concentration was 0.874 ± 0.065. At the model-predicted cutoff value of 3,000 ng/mL, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 51.1%, positive predictive value was 21.8%, and negative predictive value was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis is prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019 disease and can be present on ICU admission. Screening has been recommended in the context of the pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable background milieu. D-dimer concentrations are elevated in nearly all coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and the test appears reliable for screening for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis at or above a concentration of 3,000 ng/mL (more than 13-fold above the normal range). Full anticoagulation is indicated if the diagnosis is confirmed, and therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered for prophylaxis, as all coronavirus disease 2019 patients are at increased risk.","Gibson, Cameron J; Alqunaibit, Dalia; Smith, Kira E; Bronstein, Matthew; Eachempati, Soumitra R; Kelly, Anton G; Lee, Christina; Minneman, Jennifer A; Narayan, Mayur; Shou, Jian; Villegas, Cassandra V; Winchell, Robert J; Barie, Philip S",Crit Care Med,,238

Objectives: To characterize new BSIs in PWID receiving treatment for infective endocarditis, to determine the clinical factors associated with their development, and to determine whether new BSIs and treatment setting are associated with mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was performed at 3 tertiary care hospitals in London, Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 2007, to March 31, 2018. Participants included a consecutive sample of all PWID 18 years or older admitted with infective endocarditis. Data were analyzed from April 1, 2007, to June 29, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: New BSIs and factors associated with their development, treatment setting of infective endocarditis episodes (ie, inpatient vs outpatient), and 90-day mortality. Results: The analysis identified 420 unique episodes of infective endocarditis in 309 PWID (mean [SD] patient age, 35.7 [9.7] years; 213 episodes [50.7%] involving male patients), with 82 (19.5%) complicated by new BSIs. There were 138 independent new BSIs, of which 68 (49.3%) were polymicrobial and 266 were unique isolates. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli (143 of 266 [53.8%]) and Candida species (75 of 266 [28.2%]) were the most common microorganisms. Ongoing inpatient IVDU was documented by a physician in 194 infective endocarditis episodes (46.2%), and 127 of these (65.5%) were confirmed by urine toxicology results. Multivariable time-dependent Cox regression demonstrated that previous infective endocarditis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.20-2.98), inpatient treatment (HR, 4.49; 95% CI, 2.30-8.76), and physician-documented inpatient IVDU (HR, 5.07; 95% CI, 2.68-9.60) were associated with a significantly higher rate of new BSIs, whereas inpatient addiction treatment was associated with a significantly lower rate (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.88). New BSIs were not significantly associated with 90-day mortality (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.78-4.02); significant factors associated with mortality included inpatient infective endocarditis treatment (HR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.53-7.53), intensive care unit admission (HR, 9.51; 95% CI, 4.91-18.42), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.03-3.03), whereas right-sided infective endocarditis was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.67). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, new BSIs were common in PWID receiving parenteral treatment for infective endocarditis. Discharging patients to outpatient treatment was not associated with an increase in new BSI incidence or mortality; carefully selected PWID may therefore be considered for such treatment.","Tan, Charlie; Shojaei, Esfandiar; Wiener, Joshua; Shah, Meera; Koivu, Sharon; Silverman, Michael",JAMA Netw Open,,238

523262,European regulators urged to crack down on missing clinical trial results,2021,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented threat to the international community and raised major concerns in terms of public health safety. Although our current understanding of the complexity of COVID-19 pathogenesis remains limited, the infection is largely mediated by the interaction of viral spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The functional importance of ACE2 in different demographic and comorbid conditions may explain the significant variation in incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in vulnerable groups, and highlights its candidacy as a potential therapeutic target. We provide evidence supporting the idea that differences in incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection may be related to ACE2. Emerging data based on the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among those with established high levels of ACE2 expression strongly support our hypothesis. Considering the burden of COVID-19 infection in these vulnerable groups and the impact of the potential therapeutic and preventive measures that would result from adopting ACE2-driven anti-viral strategies, our hypothesis may expedite global efforts to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Kaseb, Ahmed O; Mohamed, Yehia I; Malek, Alexandre E; Raad, Issam I; Altameemi, Lina; Li, Dan; Kaseb, Omar A; Kaseb, Safa A; Selim, Abdelhafez; Ma, Qing",,,238

We compared response to NAC for T4 BCa in the U.S. and Nigeria to direct future interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional retrospective analysis included all non-metastatic T4 BCa patients treated from 2010-2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, U.S.) and Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (Ile Ife, Nigeria). Pathologic complete response (pCR) and survival were compared and factors contributing to disparities evaluated. RESULTS: 308 patients met inclusion criteria: 157 (51%) in the U.S. and 151 (49%) in Nigeria. All U.S. patients received NAC and surgery compared with 93 (62%) Nigerian patients. 56/93 (60%) Nigerian patients completed their prescribed course of NAC. In Nigeria, older age and higher socioeconomic status were associated with treatment receipt. Fewer patients in Nigeria had immunohistochemistry performed (100% U.S. vs. 18% Nigeria). Of those with available receptor subtype, 18% (28/157) of U.S. patients were triple negative vs. 39% (9/23) of Nigerian patients. Overall pCR was seen in 27% (42/155) of U.S. patients and 5% (4/76) of Nigerian patients. Five-year survival was significantly shorter in Nigeria vs. the U.S. (61% vs. 72%). However, among the subset of patients who received multimodality therapy, including NAC and surgery with curative intent, 5-year survival (67% vs. 72%) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (48% vs. 61%) did not significantly differ between countries. CONCLUSION: Addressing health system, socioeconomic, and psychosocial barriers is necessary for administration of complete NAC to improve BCa outcomes in Nigeria. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This cross-sectional retrospective analysis of T4 breast cancer patients in Nigeria and the U.S. found a significant difference in pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5% Nigeria vs. 27% U.S.). Five-year survival was shorter in Nigeria, but in patients receiving multimodality treatment, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery with curative intent, 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival did not differ between countries. Capacity-building efforts in Nigeria should focus on access to pathology services to direct systemic therapy, and promoting receipt of complete chemotherapy to improve outcomes.","Romanoff, Anya; Olasehinde, Olalekan; Goldman, Debra A; Alatise, Olusegun I; Constable, Jeremy; Monu, Ngozi; Knapp, Gregory C; Odujoko, Oluwole; Onabanjo, Emmanuella; Adisa, Adewale O; Arowolo, Adeolu O; Omisore, Adeleye D; Famurewa, Olusola C; Anderson, Benjamin O; Gemignani, Mary L; Kingham, T Peter",Oncologist,,238

The control group received placebo/placebo. The primary outcome was days alive and discharged from hospital within 14 days (DAOH14). RESULTS: After randomisation of 117 patients, at the first planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping enrolment due to futility, based on pre-specified criteria. Consequently, the trial was terminated on February 1, 2021. A total of 61 patients received the combined intervention and 56 patients received placebo. In the intervention group, patients had a median of 9.0 DAOH14 (IQR, 3–11) versus. 9.0 DAOH14 (IQR, 7–10) in the placebo group (p=0.90). The primary safety outcome, death from all causes on day 30, occurred for 1 patient in the intervention group versus. 2 patients receiving placebo (p=0.52), and readmittance or death within 30 days occurred for 9 patients in the intervention group versus. 6 patients receiving placebo (p=0.57). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine did not improve survival or length of hospitalisation in patients with COVID-19.","Sivapalan, Pradeesh; Suppli Ulrik, Charlotte; Sophie Lapperre, Therese; Dahlin Bojesen, Rasmus; Eklöf, Josefin; Browatzki, Andrea; Torgny Wilcke, Jon; Gottlieb, Vibeke; Julius Håkansson, Kjell Erik; Tidemandsen, Casper; Tupper, Oliver; Meteran, Howraman; Bergsøe, Christina; Brøndum, Eva; Bodtger, Uffe; Bech Rasmussen, Daniel; Graff Jensen, Sidse; Pedersen, Lars; Jordan, Alexander; Priemé, Helene; Søborg, Christian; Steffensen, Ida E.; Høgsberg, Dorthe; Wirenfeldt Klausen, Tobias; Steen Frydland, Martin; Lange, Peter; Sverrild, Asger; Ghanizada, Muhzda; Krag Knop, Filip; Biering-Sørensen, Tor; Lundgren, Jens D.; Stæhr Jensen,, Jens-Ulrik",Eur Respir J,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00752-2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083403/,238
589974,A Standardized Prospective Memory Evaluation of the Effects of COVID-19 Confinement on Young Students,2021-08-30,"Infants with congenital heart disease are at risk of neurodevelopmental impairments, the origins of which are currently unclear. This study aimed to characterize the relationship between neonatal brain development, cerebral oxygen delivery and neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with congenital heart disease. A cohort of infants with serious or critical congenital heart disease (N = 66; N = 62 born ≥37 weeks) underwent brain MRI before surgery on a 3T scanner situated on the neonatal unit. T2-weighted images were segmented into brain regions using a neonatal-specific algorithm. We generated normative curves of typical volumetric brain development using a data-driven technique applied to 219 healthy infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). Atypicality indices, representing the degree of positive or negative deviation of a regional volume from the normative mean for a given gestational age, sex and postnatal age, were calculated for each infant with congenital heart disease. Phase contrast angiography was acquired in 53 infants with congenital heart disease and cerebral oxygen delivery was calculated. Cognitive and motor abilities were assessed at 22 months (N = 46) using the Bayley scales of Infant and Toddler Development–Third Edition. We assessed the relationship between atypicality indices, cerebral oxygen delivery and cognitive and motor outcome. Additionally, we examined whether cerebral oxygen delivery was associated with neurodevelopmental outcome through the mediating effect of brain volume. Negative atypicality indices in deep grey matter were associated with both reduced neonatal cerebral oxygen delivery and poorer cognitive abilities at 22 months across the whole sample. In infants with congenital heart disease born ≥37 weeks, negative cortical grey matter and total tissue volume atypicality indices, in addition to deep grey matter structures, were associated with poorer cognition. There was a significant indirect relationship between cerebral oxygen delivery and cognition through the mediating effect of negative deep grey matter atypicality indices across the whole sample. In infants born ≥37 weeks, cortical grey matter and total tissue volume atypicality indices were also mediators of this relationship. In summary, lower cognitive abilities in toddlers with congenital heart disease were associated with smaller grey matter volumes before cardiac surgery. The aetiology of poor cognition may encompass poor cerebral oxygen delivery leading to impaired grey matter growth. Interventions to improve cerebral oxygen delivery may promote early brain growth and improve cognitive outcomes in infants with congenital heart disease.","Bonthrone, Alexandra F; Dimitrova, Ralica; Chew, Andrew; Kelly, Christopher J; Cordero-Grande, Lucilio; Carney, Olivia; Egloff, Alexia; Hughes, Emer; Vecchiato, Katy; Simpson, John; Hajnal, Joseph V; Pushparajah, Kuberan; Victor, Suresh; Nosarti, Chiara; Rutherford, Mary A; Edwards, A David; O’Muircheartaigh, Jonathan; Counsell, Serena J",Brain Commun,https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcab046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33860226/,238

Here, we summarize the clinical and epidemiological features of this increased incidence of photokeratitis and share advice in using health education to prevent it. We collected data from patients diagnosed with photokeratitis from October 7, 2019 to December 1, 2019, and from February 17, 2020 to April 12, 2020, and compared the frequency of onset, site of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, reason for exposure, exposure time, and recovery time. We also implemented and evaluated multiple measures of public health education to prevent increased disease. After the COVID-19 outbreak, the frequency of onset of photokeratitis increased significantly, especially among young women. The main reason for UVR exposure changed from welding to disinfection. The incidence sites varied, and the exposure time was longer. As a result, patients needed a longer time to recover. Positive health education was an useful and convenient measure to prevent the disease. While the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, more attention should be paid to public health and implement positive measures to prevent photokeratitis.","Wang, YingMing; Lou, Jing; Ji, Ye; Wang, ZhenYu",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128883/,238

Yet, the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 remain mostly vague. Many virulence factors and immune mechanisms contribute to the deteriorating effects on the organism during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both humoral and cellular immune responses are involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, where the principal and effective immune response towards viral infection is the cell-mediated immunity. The clinical picture of COVID-19, which includes immune memory and reinfection, remains unclear and unpredictable. However, many hopes are put in developing an effective vaccine against the virus, and different therapeutic options have been implemented to find effective, even though not specific, treatment to the disease. We can assume that the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the individual's immune system determines the onset and development of the disease significantly.","Velikova, Tsvetelina Veselinova; Kotsev, Stanislav Vasilev; Georgiev, Daniel Stefanov; Batselova, Hristiana Momchilova",World J Biol Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024515/; https://doi.org/10.4331/wjbc.v11.i2.14,238

The presence of ambulatory hypoxia may help risk-stratify hospitalized patients with COVID-19. If sufficient lead-time exists between development of ambulatory hypoxia and other outcome measures, interventions might be initiated earlier. Objective: To determine the association of ambulatory hypoxia with the eventual need for nasal cannula or advanced oxygenation therapies (defined as use of high flow nasal cannula, Bi-PAP, ventilator, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). Design: Retrospective, observational study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to October 30, 2020. Setting: Ten hospitals in an integrated academic medical system (Northwestern Medicine) in the Chicagoland area. Participants: Adult patients (age > 18) hospitalized for COVID-19 who had ambulatory oximetry measured. Intervention(s) / Exposure(s): Ambulatory oximetry measurement. Main outcomes and measures: The association of ambulatory hypoxia with subsequent use of nasal cannula and advanced oxygen therapies and the time between ambulatory hypoxia and need for these oxygen therapies. Patients who had ambulatory oximetry measurements after use of nasal cannula or advanced oxygen therapies were excluded. Results: Of 531 patients with ambulatory oximetry measured, 132 (24.9%) had ambulatory hypoxia. Presence of ambulatory hypoxia was strongly associated with subsequent use of nasal cannula (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.8 - 8.4) and advanced oxygen therapy (IRR 7.7, 95% CI 3.4 - 17.5). Ambulatory hypoxia measurement preceded nasal cannula use by a median 12.5 hours [IQR 3.25, 29.25] and advanced oxygenation therapies by 54 hours [IQR 25, 82]. Conclusion and Relevance: Ambulatory hypoxia is associated with moderate to severe COVID-19. It may serve as an early, non-invasive physiologic marker for the likelihood of developing moderate to severe disease and help clinicians triage patients and initiate earlier interventions.","Bhasin, A.; Bregger, M.; Kluk, M.; Park, P.; Feinglass, J.; Barsuk, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.14.20248209; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248209v1?rss=1,238

The goal of this study was to analyze the vitamin D status of a cancer patient cohort from our clinic in the Franconian region, Germany. METHODS: 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were available for 116 patients included in prospective trials in our clinic. Associations of vitamin D with anthropometric and blood parameters were investigated using Kendall's τ correlation coefficients and linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (49.1%) were vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL), and 92.2% did not meet the recommended vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL. There was a strong negative association between vitamin D and leukocyte count (τ = −0.173, p = 0.007) and C-reactive protein concentration (τ = −0.172, p = 0.007). In linear regression, the most important variables for predicting vitamin D levels were (in order of decreasing importance) season, fat mass index, platelet, and leukocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: Despite appeals towards medical societies to target widespread vitamin D deficiency in Germany more than 10 years ago, our data indicate that these have been without avail.

Here, we analyzed viral release, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cytokine production in a retrospective series of 427 RTqPCR+ nasopharyngeal swabs collected in COVID-19 patients harbouring either non-B.1.1.7 or B.1.17 variants. We utilized a novel rapid assay, based on S-Fuse-T reporter cells, to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2. With both non-B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.7 variants, viral titers were highly variable, ranging from 0 to >106 infectious units, and correlated with viral RNA levels. Lateral flow antigenic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were positive in 96% of the samples harbouring infectious virus. About 67 % of individuals carried detectable infectious virus within the first two days after onset of symptoms. This proportion decreased overtime, and viable virus was detected up to 14 days. Samples containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG or IgA did not generally harbour infectious virus. The proportion of individuals displaying viable virus or being RDT-positive was not higher with B.1.1.7 than with non- B.1.1.7 variants. Ct values were slightly but not significantly lower with B.1.1.7. The variant was characterized by a fast decrease of infectivity overtime and a marked release of 17 cytokines (including IFN-b, IP-10, IL-10 and TRAIL). Our results highlight differences between non-B.1.1.7 and B.1.1.7 variants.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) were exposed to a high risk of occupational infection, partially due to insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies. This study aimed to describe the practices, availability, training, confidence in PPE use and the adverse effects due to extended PPE use, as reported by HCWs in Italy. We also aimed to provide a comparison between Italian data and those from other countries. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of a previously published international study, the PPE-SAFE Survey, conducted in April 2020. Data were analysed from the original study database. RESULTS: We analysed the responses from 380 healthcare workers based in Italy, out of the 2711 respondents to the international survey. Among the Italian respondents, FFP2 and FFP3 respirators or equivalent were the most used masks for routine tasks (respectively 188/380, 50%; and 163/380, 43%). The median time of wearing PPE without taking a break was 5 h [interquartile range (IQR) 4–6], with statistically significant difference from other countries [median 4 h (IQR 2–5) p < 0.0001]. In Italy, 249 out of 380 (65%) HCWs had never performed a formal fit test for a N95 mask or equivalent and 91/380 (24%) never had a partner for donning and doffing procedures. Most of the respondents (299/380, 79%) had received formal training in PPE use at any time. CONCLUSION: Most of the surveyed Italian HCWs reported working at above usual capacity, long shifts with PPE without breaks and routine use in intensive care unit of aerosol protection (e.g. FFP2/FFP3), hazmat suits and face shields/visors. The correct adherence to safety procedures (e.g. donning/doffing in pairs, performing fit test) has substantial scope for improvement in the future.","Ippolito, Mariachiara; Ramanan, Mahesh; Bellina, Davide; Catalisano, Giulia; Iozzo, Pasquale; Di Guardo, Andrea; Moscarelli, Alessandra; Grasselli, Giacomo; Giarratano, Antonino; Bassetti, Matteo; Tabah, Alexis; Cortegiani, Andrea",Ther Adv Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1177/2049936121998562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33717482/,238

The aim of our study is to relate the fundamental clinical and analytical performance of SARS‐CoV‐2 (RT‐PCR) commercial kits. A total of 94 clinical samples were selected. Generally, 400 µl of each respiratory specimen was subjected to extraction using ExiPrep 96 Viral RNA Kit. All kits master mix preparation, cycling protocol, thermocycler, and results interpretation were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions of use and recommendations. The performance of the kits was comparable except for the LYRA kit as it was less sensitive (F = 67, p < .001). Overall, four kits scored a sensitivity of 100% including: BGI, IQ Real, Sansure, and RADI. For specificity, all the tested kits scored above 95%. The performance of these commercial kits by gene target showed no significant change in CT values which indicates that kits disparities are mainly linked to the oligonucleotide of the gene target. We believe that most of the commercially available RT‐PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine diagnosis of patients with SARS‐CoV‐2.

594656,Hepatic complications of COVID‐19 and its treatment,2020-05-21,"BACKGROUND: Cats with feline calicivirus (FCV)-related symptoms are commonly presented to veterinary practitioners. Various clinical manifestations have been attributed to FCV, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. Additionally, healthy cats can shed FCV. The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of FCV in cats with FCV-related symptoms and in healthy cats in Switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with URTD-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and FCV infection. RESULTS: Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in 24 veterinary practices from 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy cats originating from 19 cantons of Switzerland. The samples were tested for FCV using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qPCR. Within the two populations (FCV-suspect/healthy), the observed PCR prevalences were: FCV 45 %/8 %, FHV-1 20 %/9 %, C. felis 8 %/1 %, B. bronchiseptica 4 %/2 %, M. felis 47 %/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %/14 %. Based on multivariable regression models amongst FCV-suspect cats (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]), co-infection with M. felis (1.75 [0.97; 3.14]), group housing (2.11 [1.02; 4.34]) and intact reproductive status (1.80 [0.99; 3.28]) were found to be risk factors for FCV infection. In healthy cats, intact reproductive status (22.2 [1.85; 266.7]) and group housing (46.4 [5.70; 377.7]) were found to be associated with FCV infection. Based on an univariable approach, FCV-suspect cats were found to be significantly less often FCV-positive when vaccinated (0.48 [0.24; 0.94]). Oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of URTD were significantly associated with FCV infection (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FCV was detected in less than half of the cats that were judged FCV-suspect by veterinary practitioners. For a clinical diagnosis, FCV-related symptoms should be revisited. FCV infection was present in some healthy cats, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in FCV epidemiology. To reduce FCV-related problems in multi-cat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.

The most-read COVID-19 information in China was summarized, and the factors that influence information dissemination were studied to understand the characteristics that affect its dissemination. Moreover, this was conducted in order to identify how to effectively disseminate COVID-19 information and to provide suggestions on how to manage public opinion and information governance during a pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on a WeChat official account. We collected all COVID-19–related information, starting with the first report about COVID-19 from the People’s Daily and ending with the last piece of information about lifting the first-level emergency response in 34 Chinese provinces. A descriptive analysis was then conducted on this information, as well as on Qingbo Big Data’s dissemination index. Multiple linear regression was utilized to study the factors that affected information dissemination based on various characteristics and the dissemination index. RESULTS: From January 19 to May 2, 2020, the People’s Daily released 1984 pieces of information; 1621 were related to COVID-19, which mainly included headline news items, items with emotional content, and issues related to the pandemic’s development. By analyzing the dissemination index, seven information dissemination peaks were discerned. Among the three dimensions of COVID-19 information—media salience, content, and format—eight factors affected the spread of COVID-19 information. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of pandemic-related information have varying dissemination power. To effectively disseminate information and prevent the spread of COVID-19, we should identify the factors that affect this dissemination. We should then disseminate the types of information the public is most concerned about, use information to educate people to improve their health literacy, and improve public opinion and information governance.","Fan, Zina; Yin, Wenqiang; Zhang, Han; Wang, Dandan; Fan, Chengxin; Chen, Zhongming; Hu, Jinwei; Ma, Dongping; Guo, Hongwei",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34129515/; https://doi.org/10.2196/28563,238

We describe a rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreak among 116 LTCF residents in Rhode Island, USA. Overall, 111 (95.6%) residents tested positive and, of these, 48 (43.2%) died. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (84.7%) and cardiovascular disease (84.7%). A small percentage (9%) of residents were asymptomatic, while 33.3% of residents were pre-symptomatic, with progression to symptoms within a median of three days following the positive test. While typical symptoms of fever (80.2%) and cough (43.2%) were prevalent, shortness of breath (14.4%) was rarely found despite common hypoxemia (95.5%). The majority of patients demonstrated atypical symptoms with the most common being loss of appetite (61.3%), lethargy (42.3%), diarrhea (37.8%), and fatigue (32.4%). Many residents had increased agitation (38.7%) and anxiety (5.4%), potentially due to the restriction measures or the underlying mental illness. The fever curve was characterized by an intermittent low-grade fever, often the first presenting symptom. Mortality was associated with a disease course beginning with a loss of appetite and lethargy, as well as one more often involving fever greater than 38 °C, loss of appetite, altered mental status, diarrhea, and respiratory distress. Interestingly, no differences in age or comorbidities were noted between survivors and non-survivors. Taking demographic factors into account, treatment with anticoagulation was still associated with reduced mortality (adjusted OR 0.16; 95% C.I. 0.06–0.39; p < 0.001). Overall, the clinical features of the disease in this population can be subtle and the symptoms are commonly atypical. However, clinical decline among those who did not survive was often rapid with patients expiring within 10 days from disease detection. Further studies are needed to better explain the variability in clinical course of COVID-19 among LTCF residents, specifically the factors affecting mortality, the differences observed in symptom presentation, and rate of clinical decline.","Atalla, Eleftheria; Zhang, Raina; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylona, Evangelia K.; Tsikala-Vafea, Maria; Kalagara, Saisanjana; Henseler, Laura; Chan, Philip A.; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374131/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10010008,238
595397,Care for Patients with Stroke During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Suggestions for Preventing Secondary Stroke,2020-07-22,"The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) generates the mental representations that are the foundation of abstract thought, and provides top-down regulation of emotion through projections to the medial PFC and cingulate cortices. Physiological recordings from dlPFC Delay cells have shown that the generation of mental representations during working memory relies on NMDAR neurotransmission, with surprisingly little contribution from AMPAR. Systemic administration of low “antidepressant” doses of the NMDAR antagonist, ketamine, erodes these representations and reduces dlPFC Delay cell firing. In contrast to the dlPFC, V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depends on AMPAR, with much less contribution from NMDAR. Similarly, neurons in the dlPFC that respond to sensory events (cue cells, response feedback cells) rely on AMPAR, and systemic ketamine increases their firing. Insults to NMDAR transmission, and the impaired ability for dlPFC to generate mental representations, may contribute to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, e.g., from genetic insults that weaken NMDAR transmission, or from blockade of NMDAR by kynurenic acid. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid in dlPFC may also contribute to cognitive deficits in other disorders with pronounced neuroinflammation (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), or peripheral infections where kynurenine can enter brain (e.g., delirium from sepsis, “brain fog” in COVID19). Much less is known about NMDAR actions in the primate cingulate cortices. However, NMDAR neurotransmission appears to process the affective and visceral responses to pain and other aversive experiences mediated by the cingulate cortices, which may contribute to sustained alterations in mood state. We hypothesize that the very rapid, antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine may involve the disruption of NMDAR-generated aversive mood states by the anterior and subgenual cingulate cortices, providing a “foot in the door” to allow the subsequent return of top-down regulation by higher PFC areas. Thus, the detrimental vs. therapeutic effects of NMDAR blockade may be circuit dependent.","Yang, Shengtao; Seo, Hyojung; Wang, Min; Arnsten, Amy F.

METHODS: Gil Medical Center, a tertiary hospital in Incheon, has operated a special response team since January 21, 2020. All visitors were assessed for body temperature and respiratory symptoms, and screened for recent overseas travel. Suspected COVID-19 patients were taken to a screening clinic. All febrile patients with or without respiratory symptoms were taken to a respiratory safety clinic. An isolation ward, which consisted of 10 negative-pressure rooms, was used to treat confirmed cases. More than 120 beds were prepared for the outbreak, and patients with pneumonia were preemptively isolated. RESULTS: By May 5, 480 960 visitors were assessed at the control station, 3350 patients visited the triage center, and 1794 were treated in the respiratory safety clinic. Seventeen confirmed cases were admitted to the negative isolation ward, and 350 patients with pneumonia were preemptively isolated. A total of 2977 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction tests were performed. CONCLUSIONS: While tertiary hospitals play an important role in treating both COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients, hospital staff have to protect themselves from unexpected in-hospital transmission. A multifaceted response must be undertaken to protect tertiary hospitals and their staff during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Shi, Hye Jin; Lee, Jae Back; Choi, Min Kyung; Jang, Young-Rock; Cho, Yong-Kyun; Eom, Joong Sik",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32624085/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.199,238

While vaccine candidates were rapidly developed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), immunization campaigns remain an obstacle to achieving herd immunity. Dissolvable microneedle patches are advantageous for many possible reasons: improved immunogenicity; dose-sparing effects; expected low manufacturing cost; elimination of sharps; reduction of vaccine wastage; no need for reconstitution; simplified supply chain, with reduction of cold chain supply through increased thermostability; ease of use, reducing the need for healthcare providers; and greater acceptability compared to traditional hypodermic injections.

We applied a computational drug repositioning pipeline to SARS-CoV-2 differential gene expression signatures derived from publicly available data. We utilized three independent published studies to acquire or generate lists of differentially expressed genes between control and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples. Using a rank-based pattern matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic, the signatures were queried against drug profiles from Connectivity Map (CMap). We validated sixteen of our top predicted hits in live SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assays in either Calu-3 or 293T-ACE2 cells. Validation experiments in human cell lines showed that 11 of the 16 compounds tested to date (including clofazimine, haloperidol and others) had measurable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.

596522,Severe warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia in COVID-19 managed with least incompatible RBC product and glucocorticoids,2021-02-18,"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes corona virus disease (COVID-19). The most standard diagnostic method is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on a nasopharyngeal and/or an oropharyngeal swab. The high occurrence of false-negative results due to the non-presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the oropharyngeal environment renders this sampling method not ideal. Therefore, a new sampling device is desirable. This proof-of-principle study investigated the possibility to train machine-learning classifiers with an electronic nose (Aeonose) to differentiate between COVID-19-positive and negative persons based on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analysis. METHODS: Between April and June 2020, participants were invited for breath analysis when a swab for RT-PCR was collected. If the RT-PCR resulted negative, the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was checked to confirm the negative result. All participants breathed through the Aeonose for five minutes. This device contains metal-oxide sensors that change in conductivity upon reaction with VOCs in exhaled breath. These conductivity changes are input data for machine learning and used for pattern recognition. The result is a value between − 1 and + 1, indicating the infection probability. RESULTS: 219 participants were included, 57 of which COVID-19 positive. A sensitivity of 0.86 and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.92 were found. Adding clinical variables to machine-learning classifier via multivariate logistic regression analysis, the NPV improved to 0.96. CONCLUSIONS: The Aeonose can distinguish COVID-19 positive from negative participants based on VOC patterns in exhaled breath with a high NPV. The Aeonose might be a promising, non-invasive, and low-cost triage tool for excluding SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients elected for surgery.","Wintjens, Anne G. W. E.; Hintzen, Kim F.

Cost-effectiveness analysis for new antiseizure medications typically requires health state utilities (HSUs) that reflect the burden of a given condition. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate HSUs, with a focus on valuing the impact of seizure type and seizure frequency on health-related quality of life (HRQL) for patients with TSC and their caregivers. METHODS: A targeted literature review and qualitative research with healthcare professionals and caregivers informed the development of health state vignettes describing the experience of living with TSC or caring for a child with TSC. Vignettes were evaluated in interviews with the UK general population using the time trade-off (TTO) method. RESULTS: Sixteen vignettes were developed describing patient HRQL (n = 8) and caregiver HRQL (n = 8). Two hundred interviews were conducted via online video calls due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. Two hundred participants evaluated the patient (n = 100) and caregiver (n = 100) health state vignettes. Estimated utility scores varied consistently according to seizure type and seizure frequency. Patient TTO utility scores ranged between −0.234 (highest seizure frequency and multiple seizure types) and 0.725 (seizure-free state). Caregiver TTO utility scores ranged from 0.221 to 0.905. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the substantial burden of living with TSC and caring for a child with TSC. Patient and caregiver burden was greater for generalised versus focal seizures. The burden was greatest for a combination of both seizure types and worsened with increasing seizure frequency.

Coronaviruses such as the 2003 SARS-CoV showed an increased risk of transmission during cooler days. We sought to analyse the effects of ambient temperature on SARS-COV-2 transmission and deaths related to the virus. Methods The world population of COVID-19 cases and attributable deaths from the 23rd January 2020 to 11th April 2020 were analysed. Temperature 5 days before cases and 23 days prior to deaths (to account for the time lag of incubation period and time from symptoms to death) was compared to the average temperature experienced by the world population. Results The total number of cases during this period was 1,605,788 and total number of deaths was 103,471. The median temperature at the time of COVID-19 infection was 9.12C (10-90th percentile 4.29-17.97C) whilst the median temperature of the world population for the same period was 9.61C warmer at 18.73C (10-90th percentile 4.09-28.49C) with a notional p-value = 5.1 x10-11. The median temperature at the time of a COVID-19 death was 9.72C (10-90th percentile 5.39-14.11C) whilst the median temperature of the world population was 7.55C warmer at 17.27C (10-90th percentile 2.57C-27.76C) with a notional p-value = 1.1 x10-10. 80% of all COVID-19 related cases and deaths occurred between 4.29C and 17.97C.

603301,"Complete post-mortem data in a fatal case of COVID-19: clinical, radiological and pathological correlations",2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has already claimed considerable lives. There are major concerns in Africa due to existing high prevalence rates for both infectious and non-infectious diseases and limited resources in terms of personnel, beds and equipment. Alongside this, concerns that lockdown and other measures will have on prevention and management of other infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are an increasing issue with rising morbidity and mortality rates. The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that a lack of nets and treatment could result in up to 18 million additional cases of malaria and up to 30,000 additional deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: Document current prevalence and mortality rates from COVID-19 alongside economic and other measures to reduce its spread and impact across Africa. In addition, suggested ways forward among all key stakeholder groups. OUR APPROACH: Contextualise the findings from a wide range of publications including internet-based publications coupled with input from senior-level personnel. ONGOING ACTIVITIES: Prevalence and mortality rates are currently lower in Africa than among several Western countries and the USA. This could be due to a number of factors including early instigation of lockdown and border closures, the younger age of the population, lack of robust reporting systems and as yet unidentified genetic and other factors. Innovation is accelerating to address concerns with available equipment. There are ongoing steps to address the level of misinformation and its consequences including fines. There are also ongoing initiatives across Africa to start addressing the unintended consequences of COVID-19 activities including lockdown measures and their impact on NCDs including the likely rise in mental health disorders, exacerbated by increasing stigma associated with COVID-19. Strategies include extending prescription lengths, telemedicine and encouraging vaccination. However, these need to be accelerated to prevent increased morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: There are multiple activities across Africa to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and address misinformation, which can have catastrophic consequences, assisted by the WHO and others, which appear to be working in a number of countries. Research is ongoing to clarify the unintended consequences given ongoing concerns to guide future activities. Countries are learning from each other.","Ogunleye, Olayinka O.; Basu, Debashis; Mueller, Debjani; Sneddon, Jacqueline; Seaton, R.

MethodsWe performed an international web-based self-reported questionnaire survey. Participants completed the questionnaires every week for 12 weeks. The questionnaire elicited responses regarding the development of COVID-19 and details of the PPE used. ResultsAll 483 participants were included in the analysis. Participants had a mean age of 42.3 years and comprised 68.3% males. The geographic distribution of the study population was Asia (89.2%), Europe (2.9%), North and South America (4.8%), Oceania (0.6%), and Africa (1.5%). The most common endoscopy-related role of the participants was endoscopist (78.7%), and 74.5% had > 10 years of experience. Fourteen participants had performed 83 endoscopic procedures in patients positive for COVID-19. During the mean follow-up period of 4.95 weeks, there were no cases of COVID-19 when treating COVID-19 positive patients. The most common PPE used by participants treating patients with COVID-19 was a surgical mask plus N95 mask plus face shield, goggles, cap, long-sleeved isolation gown, and single pair of gloves. The most common PPE used by participants treating patients without COVID-19 was a surgical mask, no face shield but goggles, cap, long-sleeved isolation gown, and single pair of gloves during all endoscopic procedures. ConclusionsThe risk of COVID-19 transmission during any endoscopic procedure was low in clinical practice.","Niikura, Ryota; Fujishiro, Mitsuhiro; Nakai, Yousuke; Matsuda, Koji; Kawahara, Takuya; Yamada, Atsuo; Tsuji, Yosuke; Hayakawa, Yoku; Koike, Kazuhiko",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.01.20240853v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.20240853,238
604966,COVID-19: Exhaled virus detected by Face Mask Sampling provides new links to disease severity and potential infectivity.,2020-08-21,"Contact tracing is a strategy implemented to minimize the spread of communicable diseases (1,2). Prompt contact tracing, testing, and self-quarantine can reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (3,4). Community engagement is important to encourage participation in and cooperation with SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing (5). Substantial investments have been made to scale up contact tracing for COVID-19 in the United States. During June 1-July 12, 2020, the incidence of COVID-19 cases in North Carolina increased 183%, from seven to 19 per 100,000 persons per day* (6). To assess local COVID-19 contact tracing implementation, data from two counties in North Carolina were analyzed during a period of high incidence. Health department staff members investigated 5,514 (77%) persons with COVID-19 in Mecklenburg County and 584 (99%) in Randolph Counties. No contacts were reported for 48% of cases in Mecklenburg and for 35% in Randolph. Among contacts provided, 25% in Mecklenburg and 48% in Randolph could not be reached by telephone and were classified as nonresponsive after at least one attempt on 3 consecutive days of failed attempts. The median interval from specimen collection from the index patient to notification of identified contacts was 6 days in both counties. Despite aggressive efforts by health department staff members to perform case investigations and contact tracing, many persons with COVID-19 did not report contacts, and many contacts were not reached. These findings indicate that improved timeliness of contact tracing, community engagement, and increased use of community-wide mitigation are needed to interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Lash, R.

In this context, wearing personal protective equipment is very important, especially in hospital environments and situations involving healthcare, since the degree of exposure is notably higher among the subgroup of healthcare professionals. The aim of this article is to propose a roadmap for the sequence of personal protective equipment use for surgical procedures during the coronavirus pandemic. The recommendations were based on Brazil’s public health policy and World Health Organization guidelines. Five roadmaps for PPE sequences are presented for the most commonly performed procedures: fitting central venous catheters; fitting catheters requiring radioscopy; open surgeries; diagnostic and therapeutic angiography, and dressings.","Carvalho, Ana Alyra Garcia; Aidar, Ana Laura e Silva; dos Santos, Brena Costa; Kuramoto, Danielle Akemi Bergara; Pereda, Mariana Raffo; Correia, Rebeca Mangabeira; Nakano, Luis Carlos Uta; Amorim, Jorge Eduardo",J. vasc. bras,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34211534/; https://doi.org/10.1590/1677-5449.200044,238

Obligatory e-sick leave was implemented, followed by e-prescriptions and e-referrals. Therefore, it is worth considering the introduction of a complete electronic health record (EHR) that can be accessed by doctors and patients. The main aim of the study is to find out whether patients want to have access to their EHRs and if they would agree to pay for such a service. The research was based on three surveys conducted among 1000 Polish adults in 2007, 2012, and 2018. The sample collection was carried out by the national opinion poll agency, with the use of computer-assisted telephone interviews. Over 60% of respondents were interested in the possibility of accessing EHRs in general, and almost 50% of them were ready to pay for it. Nevertheless, when analyzing all the year-on-year trends, they were subject to a gradual decrease. The youngest age group was the one most interested in EHRs, while the group comprising respondents in middle age was the one most willing to pay for it. There is still great potential in implementing EHRs on a bigger scale.","Bujnowska-Fedak, Maria Magdalena; Wysoczański, Łukasz",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854345/,238

This study analyzed both patients’ and doctors’ acceptance of an orthopedic telemedical consultation (OTC) and compared the results of OTC examinations to the results of live consultation (LC) to identify discrepancies. METHODS: The study was carried out in an orthopedic department of a German hospital between 2019 and 2020. After written informed consent was obtained, patients voluntarily presented for follow-up by OTC and LC. The experience with and attitudes toward OTC among both patients and doctors was evaluated (using Likert scale-scored and open questions, 26 to 28 items). The results of the OTC and LC examinations were compared using a 12-item checklist. The data were analyzed by quantitative and qualitative statistics. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were included, each of whom completed an OTC and an LC. The OTC was rated as pleasant, and the experience was rated as very satisfying (average rating on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating strong agreement: doctors: 1.2; patients: 1.3). Various technical and organizational challenges were identified. Compared to LC, OTC showed no significant differences in patient history or in inspection, palpation, or active range of motion results. Only for the functional or passive joint assessment did LC show significantly higher suitability (p < 0.05) than OTC. Recommendations for further procedures did not differ significantly between OTC and LC. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high acceptance and the objective benefits of OTC and the similarity of clinical results with LC, OTC is recommendable for orthopedic follow-up examinations. To better assess joint functionality, meaningful digital alternatives for established examination methods should be further investigated.

Such an event would necessitate a large-scale evacuation, with implications for the trajectory of the pandemic. Here we model how a hypothetical hurricane evacuation from four counties in southeast Florida would affect COVID-19 case levels. We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates. Ultimately, the number of excess COVID-19 cases produced by the evacuation depends on the ability of destination counties to meet evacuee needs while minimizing virus exposure through public health directives.","Pei, Sen; Dahl, Kristina A.; Yamana, Teresa K.; Licker, Rachel; Shaman, Jeffrey",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.07.20170555v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170555,238

During the second wave of COVID-19 in Ontario, the urban core of the Greater Toronto Area (Toronto and Peel) were the first regions in the province to enter the highest restriction tier (""lockdown"") on November 23, 2020, which closed restaurants to in-person dining and limited non-essential businesses, including shopping malls, to curbside pickup. The peripheral regions of the Greater Toronto Area (York, Durham, Halton) would not enter lockdown until later the following month. In this analysis, we examine whether the implementation of differentially timed restrictions in a highly interconnected metropolitan area led to increased interregional travel, potentially driving further transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We used anonymized smartphone data to estimate the number of visits by residents of regions in the urban core to shopping malls and restaurants in peripheral regions in the week before compared to the week after the November 23 lockdown. Results: Residents of Toronto and Peel took fewer trips to shopping malls and restaurants in the week following lockdown. This was entirely driven by reductions in visits within the locked down regions themselves, as there was a significant increase in trips to shopping malls in peripheral regions by these residents in the same period (Toronto: +40.7%, Peel: +65.5%). Visits to restaurants in peripheral regions also increased slightly (Toronto: +6.3%, Peel: +11.8%). Discussion: Heterogeneous restrictions may undermine lockdowns in the urban core as well as driving residents from zones of higher transmission to zones of lower transmission. These concerns are likely generalizable to other major metropolitan areas, which often comprise interconnected but administratively independent regions.","Soucy, J.-P. R.; Ghasemi, A.; Sturrock, S.

Methodologically, a distinctive feature of CM is its systems theory, which is also the difference between CM and WM. Since the birth of CM, it has taken the human body as a whole from the key concepts of “qi, blood, yin-yang, viscera (Zang-Fu), and meridian and channel”, rather than a single cell or a particular organ. WM evolves from the Western philosophic way of thinking and merely uses natural sciences as the foundation. The development of WM is based on human structures, or anatomy, and therefore, research of WM is also based on the way of thinking of decomposing the whole human body into several independent parts, which is the impetus of promoting the development of WM. The core of CM includes the holistic view and the dialectical view. Chinese herbal medicines contain various components and treat a disease from multiple targets and links. Therefore, Chinese herbal medicines treat a diseased state by regulating and mobilizing the whole body rather than just regulating a single factor, since the diseased state is not only a problem in a local part of the body but a local reflection of imbalance of the whole body.","Sun, Da-zhi; Li, Shao-dan; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Yin; Mei, Rong; Yang, Ming-hui",Chin J Integr Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-013-1435-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23975136/,238

A number of pre-existing common clinical conditions were reported to represent risk factors for more severe COVID-19 outcomes. Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare vascular heritable disorders, characterized by complications secondary to visceral Arterio-Venous Malformations. The impact of HHT, as well as for many Rare Diseases (RDs) on infection susceptibility profile and clinical adverse outcome risk is an unresolved issue. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives were: to assess the clinical features and outcomes of HHT patients infected with COVID-19; to compare the relative infection risk in these patients with the Italian general population throughout the first pandemic wave; to investigate the factors potentially associated with severe COVID-19 outcome in HHT patients, and the possible impact of COVID-19 infection on HHT-related symptoms/complications. Finally, we aimed to estimate how the lockdown-associated wearing of personal protective equipment/individual protection devices could affect HHT-related telangiectasia bleeding frequency. METHODS: The study is a nation-wide questionnaire-based survey, with a multi-Center retrospective cross-sectional design, addressed to the whole Italian HHT population. COVID-19 cases, occurring throughout the first pandemic wave, were collected by a questionnaire-based semi-structured interview. Only the cases ascertained by laboratory confirmation (molecular/serological) were included for epidemiological estimates. Information concerning eventual SarS-Cov-2 infection, as well as regarding HHT-related manifestations and HHT-unrelated co-morbidities were collected by the questionnaire. Prevalence data were compared to Italian general population in the same period. RESULTS: The survey disclosed 9/296 (3.04%) COVID-19 cases, 8/9 of them being resident in Lombardy, the main epidemic epicenter. Pneumonia was reported by 4/9 patients, which prompted hospital admission and intensive care management in 2 cases. No fatal outcome was recorded. After careful refinement of epidemiological analysis, the survey evidenced overlapping infection risk in HHT compared to general population. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection profile parallels geographical distribution of epidemic foci. COVID-19 in HHT patients can lead to highly variable clinical profile, likely overlapping with that of general population. The HHT disease does not seem to involve a different approach in terms of hospital admission and access to intensive care with respect to general population.","Suppressa, Patrizia; Pagella, Fabio; Lenato, Gennaro Mariano; Gaetani, Eleonora; Serio, Ilaria; Masala, Maristella Salvatora; Spinozzi, Giuseppe; Lizzio, Roberta; Matti, Elina; De Silvestri, Annalisa; Passali, Giulio Cesare; Aguglia, Maria; Crocione, Claudia; Sabbà, Carlo",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-02000-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496900/,238

As such, their induction downstream of germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is a hallmark of the host antiviral response. The acknowledgment that several PAMPs, not just of viral origin, may induce IFN, pinpoints at these molecules as a first line of host defense against a number of invading pathogens. Acting in both autocrine and paracrine manner, IFN interferes with viral replication by inducing hundreds of different IFN-stimulated genes with both direct anti-pathogenic as well as immunomodulatory activities, therefore functioning as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. On the other hand an inverse interference to escape the IFN system is largely exploited by pathogens through a number of tactics and tricks aimed at evading, inhibiting or manipulating the IFN pathway, that result in progression of infection or establishment of chronic disease. In this review we discuss the interplay between the IFN system and some selected clinically important and challenging viruses and bacteria, highlighting the wide array of pathogen-triggered molecular mechanisms involved in evasion strategies.","Coccia, Eliana M.; Battistini, Angela",Semin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25869307/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044532315000135; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044532315000135; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smim.2015.03.005,238

This directly impacts the student engagement and immersion that are necessary for conceptual and procedural understanding for scientific experimentation. While online and remote laboratories have potential to address the aforementioned challenges, theoretical perspectives of laboratory learning outcomes are critical to enhance their impact and are sparsely examined in the literature. Using Transactional Distance Theory (TDT), this paper addresses the gap through a case study on Universal Testing Machine (UTM).

Advancements in diabetes technologies can assist PCPs in providing personalised care that addresses each patient’s individual needs. Diabetes technologies fall into two major categories: devices for glycaemic self-monitoring and insulin delivery systems. Monitoring technologies encompass self-measured blood glucose (SMBG), where blood glucose is intermittently measured by a finger prick blood sample, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, which use an interstitial sensor and are capable of giving real-time information. Studies show people using real-time CGM have better glucose control compared to SMBG. CGM allows for new parameters including time in range (the time spent within the desired target glucose range), which is an increasingly relevant real-time metric of glycaemic control. Insulin pens have increased the ease of administration of insulin and connected pens that can calculate and capture data on dosing are becoming available. There are a number of websites, software programs, and applications that can help PCPs and patients to integrate diabetes technology into their diabetes management schedules. In this article, we summarise these technologies and provide practical information to inform PCPs about utility in their clinical practice. The guiding principle is that use of technology should be individualised based on a patient’s needs, desires, and availability of devices. Diabetes technology can help patients improve their clinical outcomes and achieve the quality of life they desire by decreasing disease burden. KEY MESSAGES: It is important to understand the role that diabetes technologies can play in primary care to help deliver high-quality care, taking into account patient and community resources. Diabetes technologies fall into two major categories: devices for glycaemic self-monitoring and insulin delivery systems. Modern self-measured blood glucose devices are simple to use and can help guide decision making for self-management plans to improve clinical outcomes, but cannot provide “live” data and may under- or overestimate blood glucose; patients’ monitoring technique and compliance should be reviewed regularly. Importantly, before a patient is provided with monitoring technology, they must receive suitably structured education in its use and interpretation. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is now standard of care for people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes on meal-time (prandial) insulin. Real-time CGM can tell both the patient and the healthcare provider when glucose is in the normal range, and when they are experiencing hyper- or hypoglycaemia. Using CGM data, changes in lifestyle, eating habits, and medications, including insulin, can help the patient to stay in a normal glycaemic range (70–180 mg/dL). Real-time CGM allows for creation of an ambulatory glucose profile and monitoring of time in range (the time spent within target blood glucose of 70–180 mg/dL), which ideally should be at least 70%; avoiding time above range (>180 mg/dL) is associated with reduced diabetes complications and avoiding time below range (<70 mg/dL) will prevent hypoglycaemia. Insulin pens are simpler to use than syringes, and connected pens capture information on insulin dose and injection timing. There are a number of websites, software programs and applications that can help primary care providers and patients to integrate diabetes technology into their diabetes management schedules. The guiding principle is that use of technology should be individualised based on a patient’s needs, desires, skill level, and availability of devices.","Bode, Bruce; King, Aaron; Russell-Jones, David; Billings, Liana K.",Annals of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2021.1931427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184589/,238

This study defines the contribution of interleukin (IL)-21, a regulator of T and B cell function, to central nervous system (CNS) immunity. IL-21 receptor deficiency did not affect peripheral T cell activation or trafficking, but dampened granzyme B, gamma interferon and IL-10 expression by CNS T cells and reduced serum and intrathecal humoral responses. Viral control was already lost prior to humoral CNS responses, but demyelination remained comparable. These data demonstrate a critical role of IL-21 in regulating CNS immunity, sustaining viral persistence and preventing mortality.","Phares, Timothy W.; DiSano, Krista D.; Hinton, David R.; Hwang, Mihyun; Zajac, Allan J.; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.",Journal of Neuroimmunology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3796038?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2013.07.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572813002087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23992866/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165572813002087,238

The use of powered air-purifying respirators, filtering facepiece particles (FFP) 2–3 masks, protective suits, disposable sterile surgical gowns, and two pairs of sterile gloves as a part of a protocol seemed effective and feasible for trained healthcare workers and allow all the complex activities connected with the positioning of the ECMO support to be completed effectively. The simulation training on donning and doffing procedures and the presence of a dedicated team member to verify the compliance with the safety procedure effectively reassured operators and likely reduced the risk of self-contamination. From 1 March to 31 December 2020, we used the procedure in 35 severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients and one acute respiratory failure caused by neoplastic total tracheal obstruction, all positive to COVID-19, to be connected to veno-venous ECMO in peripheral hospitals and centralized for ECMO management. This preliminary experience seems to confirm that the use of ECMO during COVID-19 outbreaks is feasible and the risks associated with its positioning and management are sustainable for the health-care workers and safe for patients.","Montrucchio, Giorgia; Sales, Gabriele; Urbino, Rosario; Simonetti, Umberto; Bonetto, Chiara; Cura Stura, Erik; Simonato, Erika; Fuoco, Giovanni; Fanelli, Vito; Brazzi, Luca",Membranes (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes11050334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33946566/,238

In total, 580 individuals were presented with a questionnaire. A significant proportion of individuals had chronic medical disorders, e.g. diabetes mellitus (132, 22.8%) and hypertension (147, 25.3%). Pilgrims had a low level of education and a low employment rate. Sixty (10.3%) were treated with statins for hypercholesterolemia. Four hundred and fourty-seven pilgrims were presented a questionnaire on returning home. A total of 74 travellers (16.6%) experienced fever during their stay in Saudi Arabia (67 attended a doctor) and 271 (60.6%) had cough (259 attended a doctor); 70 travellers with cough were febrile (25.9%). Seventy per cent of the travellers who suffered cough episodes developed their first symptoms within 3 days, suggesting a human to human transmission of the responsible pathogen, with short incubation time as evidenced by a bimodal distribution of cough in two peaks at a 24 h interval. None of demographical and socioeconomic characteristics, underlying diseases or vaccination against influenza significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Diabetes correlated with an increased risk of febrile cough (OR = 2.02 (1.05–3.89)) as well as unemployment (OR = 2.22 (0.91–5.53)). Use of statins had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough and/or fever during the pilgrimage. This result suggests that while treatment with a statin has been demonstrated to reduce the mortality from severe sepsis associated with respiratory tract infections, it probably does not play a role in the outcome of regular febrile cough episodes as observed in the cohort studied here.","Gautret, P.; Yong, W.; Soula, G.; Gaudart, J.; Delmont, J.; Dia, A.; Parola, P.; Brouqui, P.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19416305/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02816.x; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X14603943; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14603943,238
614071,The blood supply management amid the COVID-19 outbreak,2020-04-25,"The dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell tropism and host range. To study the quasispecies features and the intra-host evolution of SARS-CoV-2, we collected nine confirmed patients and sequenced the haplotypes of spike gene using a single-molecule real-time platform. Fourteen samples were extracted from sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or stool, which in total produced 283,655 high-quality circular consensus sequences. We observed a stable quasispecies structure that one master mutant (mean abundance â¼0.70), followed by numerous minor mutants (mean abundance â¼1.21 × 10-3). Under high selective pressure, minor mutants may obtain a fitness advantage and become the master ones. The later predominant substitution D614G existed in the minor mutants of more than one early patient. An epidemic variant had a possibility to be independently originated from multiple hosts. The mutant spectrums covered â¼85% amino acid variations of public genomes (GISAID; frequency ≥ 0.1) and likely provided an advantage mutation pool for the current/future epidemic variants. Notably, 32 of 35 collected antibody escape substitutions were preexistent in the early quasispecies. Virus populations in different tissues/organs revealed potentially independent replications. The quasispecies complexity of sputum samples was significantly lower than that of nasopharyngeal swabs (P = 0.02). Evolution analysis revealed that three continuous S2 domains (HR1, CH, and CD) had undergone a positive selection. Cell fusion-related domains may play a crucial role in adapting to the intrahost immune system. Our findings suggested that future epidemiologic investigations and clinical interventions should consider the quasispecies information that has missed by routine single consensus genome. IMPORTANCE RNA virus population in a host does not consist of a consensus single haplotype but rather an ensemble of related sequences termed quasispecies. The dynamics of quasispecies afford SARS-CoV-2 a great ability on genetic fitness during intrahost evolution. The process is likely achieved by changing the genetic characteristics of key functional genes, such as the spike glycoprotein. Previous studies have applied the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to evaluate the quasispecies of SARS-CoV-2, and results indicated a low genetic diversity of the spike gene. However, the NGS platform cannot directly obtain the full haplotypes without assembling, and it is also difficult to predict the extremely low-frequency variations. Therefore, we introduced a single-molecule real-time technology to directly obtain the haplotypes of the RNA population and further study the quasispecies features and intrahost evolution of the spike gene.","Sun, Fengming; Wang, Xiuhua; Tan, Shun; Dan, Yunjie; Lu, Yanqiu; Zhang, Juan; Xu, Junli; Tan, Zhaoxia; Xiang, Xiaomei; Zhou, Yi; He, Weiwei; Wan, Xing; Zhang, Wei; Chen, Yaokai; Tan, Wenting; Deng, Guohong",Microbiol Spectr,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00261-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346744/,238

This study aims to investigate if inserting theophylline, when ion‐paired to the polyamine transporter substrate spermine, into a cyclodextrin (CD), to form a triplex, could direct the bronchodilator to the lungs selectively after intravenous administration. NMR demonstrates that upon the formation of the triplex spermine protruded from the CD cavity and this results in energy‐dependent uptake in A549 cells (1.8‐fold enhancement), which persists for more than 20 min. In vivo, the triplex produces a 2.4‐fold and 2.2‐fold increase in theophylline in the lungs 20 min after injection in rats and mice, respectively (p < 0.05). The lung targeting is selective with no increase in uptake into the brain or the heart where the side‐effects of theophylline are treatment‐limiting.

However, whether abused women from non-Western cultures experience similar post-traumatic responses to intimate partner violence is less documented. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this paper were (1) to review the literature for information about post-traumatic stress disorder among Chinese women survivors of intimate partner violence; (2) to provide a synthesis of the literature on post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women; and (3) to identify implications for practice and to suggest directions for research relating to post-traumatic stress disorder among abused Chinese women. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature. DATA SOURCES: Following a systematic search for relevant literature in computerized databases and manual searches of English and Chinese language publications, five papers reporting on four studies conducted in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and the United States were included in the review. REVIEW METHODS: Abstracts meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by two of the authors and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Full papers for selected abstracts were then retrieved and assessed independently by the same reviewers. RESULTS: The present literature review revealed a paucity of information relating to post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms or diagnoses in abused Chinese women. Nevertheless, a link between post-traumatic stress disorder and intimate partner violence was demonstrated by the reviewed papers. CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be exercised when making comparison of the findings across the four studies because of the inherent methodological differences. Also, as the assessment tools have not been validated for culture-bound interpretation of trauma and symptom manifestation, comparisons of findings for Chinese women to women in Western literature should be undertaken with due consideration.

A common denominator, hyperinsulinaemia, provides a plausible mechanism of action, underlying CVD, hypertension and strokes, all conditions typified with thrombi. The underlying science provides a theoretical management algorithm for the frontline practitioners. Vitamin D activation requires magnesium. Hyperinsulinaemia promotes: magnesium depletion via increased renal excretion, reduced intracellular levels, lowers vitamin D status via sequestration into adipocytes and hydroxylation activation inhibition. Hyperinsulinaemia mediates thrombi development via: fibrinolysis inhibition, anticoagulation production dysregulation, increasing reactive oxygen species, decreased antioxidant capacity via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion, haem oxidation and catabolism, producing carbon monoxide, increasing deep vein thrombosis risk and pulmonary emboli. Increased haem-synthesis demand upregulates carbon dioxide production, decreasing oxygen saturation capacity. Hyperinsulinaemia decreases cholesterol sulfurylation to cholesterol sulfate, as low vitamin D regulation due to magnesium depletion and/or vitamin D sequestration and/or diminished activation capacity decreases sulfotransferase enzyme SULT2B1b activity, consequently decreasing plasma membrane negative charge between red blood cells, platelets and endothelial cells, thus increasing agglutination and thrombosis. Patients with COVID-19 admitted with hyperglycaemia and/or hyperinsulinaemia should be placed on a restricted refined carbohydrate diet, with limited use of intravenous dextrose solutions. Degree/level of restriction is determined by serial testing of blood glucose, insulin and ketones. Supplemental magnesium, vitamin D and zinc should be administered. By implementing refined carbohydrate restriction, three primary risk factors, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia and hypertension, that increase inflammation, coagulation and thrombosis risk are rapidly managed.","Cooper, Isabella D; Crofts, Catherine A P; DiNicolantonio, James J; Malhotra, Aseem; Elliott, Bradley; Kyriakidou, Yvoni; Brookler, Kenneth H",Open Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938758/; https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2020-001356,238

However, the effects on mood (in)stability of bipolar disorder (BD) patients and the comparison to pre-COVID-19 symptom severity levels are unknown. METHOD: Between April and September, 2020, symptoms and well-being were assessed in the Bipolar Netherlands Cohort (BINCO) study of recently diagnosed patients with BD I and II. The questionnaire contained questions regarding manic and depressive symptoms (YMRS and ASRM, QIDS), worry (PSWQ), stress (PSS), loneliness, sleep, fear for COVID-19, positive coping, and substance use. As manic, depressive and stress symptoms levels were assessed pre-COVID-19, their trajectories during the lockdown restrictions were estimated using mixed models. RESULTS: Of the 70 invited BD patients, 36 (51%) responded at least once (mean age of 36.7 years, 54% female, and 31% BD type 1) to the COVID-19 assessments. There was a significant increase (X2 = 17.06; p = .004) in (hypo)manic symptoms from baseline during the first COVID-19 wave, with a decrease thereafter. Fear of COVID-19 (X2 = 18.01; p = .003) and positive coping (X2 = 12.44; p = .03) were the highest at the start of the pandemic and decreased thereafter.

615742,1586P Assessment of side effects of radiation therapy in patients with COVID-19 treated for early-stage breast cancer,2021-09-30,"The novel coronavirus disease (2019-nCoV) has been affecting global health since the end of 2019, and there is no sign that the epidemic is abating. Targeting the interaction between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used as the primary method to screen a library of 960 compounds. A compound 02B05 (demethylzeylasteral, CAS number: 107316-88-1) that had high affinities for S-RBD and ACE2 was discovered, and binding affinities (K(D), μM) of 02B05-ACE2 and 02B05-S-RBD were 1.736 and 1.039 μM, respectively. The results of a competition experiment showed that 02B05 could effectively block the binding of S-RBD to ACE2 protein. Furthermore, pseudovirus infection assay revealed that 02B05 could inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into 293T cells to a certain extent at nontoxic concentration. The compoundobtained in this study serve as references for the design of drugs which have potential in the treatment of COVID-19 and can thus accelerate the process of developing effective drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Zhu, Zhi-Ling; Qiu, Xiao-Dan; Wu, Shuo; Liu, Yi-Tong; Zhao, Ting; Sun, Zhong-Hao; Li, Zhuo-Rong; Shan, Guang-Zhi",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26010057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374387/,238
615850,The impact of COVID-19 preventative measures on airborne/droplet-transmitted infectious diseases in Taiwan,2020-11-26,"Background: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) has been repeatedly described in COVID-19 and may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 associated hypercoagulability. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We hypothesized that endothelial damage may lead to substantially increased concentrations of Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subsequent relative deficiency of ADAMTS13. Methods: A prospective controlled trial was performed on 75 patients with COVID-19 of mild to critical severity and 10 healthy controls. VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ADAMTS13 and VWF multimer formation were analyzed in a German hemostaseologic laboratory. Results: VWF:Ag was 4.8 times higher in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.0001), whereas ADAMTS13 activities were not significantly different (p=0.24). The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in COVID-19 than in the control group (24.4{+/-}20.5 vs. 79.7{+/-}33.2, p<0.0001). Fourteen patients (18.7%) undercut a critical ratio of 10 as described in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Gel analysis of multimers resembled the TTP constellation with loss of the largest multimers in 75% and a smeary triplet pattern in 39% of the patients. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio decreased continuously from mild to critical disease (ANOVA p=0.026). Moreover, it differed significantly between surviving patients and those who died from COVID-19 (p=0.001) yielding an AUC of 0.232 in ROC curve analysis. Conclusion: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial increase in VWF levels, which can exceed the ADAMTS13 processing capacity resulting in the formation of large VWF multimers identical to TTP. The ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio is an independent predictor of severity of disease and mortality. These findings render further support to perform studies on the use of plasma exchange in COVID-19 and to include VWF and ADAMTS13 in the diagnostic workup.","Doevelaar, A. A.

616530,Autoimmune anti-DNA and anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies predict development of severe COVID-19,2021-09-09,"There is a need to develop better methods for epitope mapping and/or identification of antibody-recognizing motifs. Here, we describe improved biosynthetic peptide (BSP) method using a newly developed plasmid pXXGST-3 as vector, which has a viral E7 gene in the cloning sites of pXXGST-1. It is crucial to employ pXXGST-3 instead of pXXGST-1, since it makes use of the BSP method simpler and easier to perform, and more cost-effective for epitope mapping. These merits are embodied in two aspects: i) convenient recovery of double enzyme-digested product due to the existence of 315 bp inserted between BamH I and Sal I sites, and thus greatly reducing the production of self-ligation clones, and ii) no longer requiring control protein when screening recombinant (r-) clones expressing 8/18mer peptides by running polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protocol involves the following core steps: (i) design of plus and minus strands of DNA fragments encoding overlapping 8/18mer peptides; (ii) chemical synthesis of the designed DNA fragments; (iii) development of r-clones using pXXGST-3 vector expressing each 8/18mer peptide fused with truncated GST188 protein; (iv) screening r-clones by running the cell pellets from each induced clone on SDS-PAGE gel followed by sequencing of inserted DNA fragments for each verified r-clone; and (v) Western blotting with either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies. This improved GST188-BSP method provides a powerful alternative tool for epitope mapping.","Xu, Wan-Xiang; Wang, Jian; Tang, Hai-Ping; Chen, Ling-Han; Lian, Wen-Bo; Zhan, Jian-Min; Gupta, Satish K.; Ji, Chao-Neng; Gu, Shao-Hua; Xie, Yi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29023483/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0186097,238

As herpesviruses commonly reactivate in the oropharynx, we have hypothesized that oropharyngeal shedding of herpesviruses will increase after vaccination. METHODS: Immune-competent Adults, excluding those using topical steroids or manifesting symptomatic herpesvirus infection, were sampled before BNT162b2 vaccination and one week after. Herpesviruses 1–7 shedding was tested with a multiplexed PCR. RESULTS: In 103 paired samples the prevalence of herpesviruses was similar before and after vaccination: HSV1, 3.9% vs. 5.8% (p = 0.75); HSV2, 0% vs. 1% (p = not applicable, NA); VZV, 0% vs. 0% (p = NA); EBV, 14.6% vs. 17.5% (p = 0.63); CMV, 0% vs. 0% (p = NA); HHV6, 4.9% vs. 7.8% (p = 0.55); HHV7, 71.8% vs. 72.8% (p = 1); any herpesvirus, 73.8% vs. 74.8% (p = 1).

Smith in Scudder, 1882 (Crustacea: Amphipoda) are prevalent scavengers of the benthopelagic community from bathyal to hadal depths. While a well-studied genus, molecular systematic studies have uncovered cryptic speciation and multiple undescribed lineages. Here, we apply an integrative taxonomic approach and describe the tenth species, Eurythenes atacamensis sp. nov., based on specimens from the 2018 Atacamex and RV Sonne SO261 Expeditions to the southern sector of the Peru-Chile Trench, the Atacama Trench (24–⁠21°S). Eurythenes atacamensis sp. nov. is a large species, max. observed length 83.2 mm, possesses diagnostic features, including a short gnathopod 1 palm and a chelate gnathopod 2 palm, and a distinct genetic lineage based on a 16S rRNA and COI phylogeny. This species is a dominant bait-attending fauna with an extensive bathymetric range, spanning from 4974 to 8081 m. The RV Sonne SO261 specimens were recovered along a 10-station transect from abyssal to hadal depths and further examined for demographic and bathymetric-related patterns. Ontogenetic vertical stratification was evident across the trench axis, with only juveniles present at abyssal depths (4974–6025 m). Total length-depth analysis revealed that the size of females was unrelated to depth, whereas juveniles followed a sigmoidal relationship with a step-up in size at depths >7200 m. Thus, these bathymetric trends suggest that juveniles and females employ differing ecological strategies in subduction trench environments. This study highlights that even dominant and ecologically important species are still being discovered within the abyssal and hadal environments. Continued systematic expeditions will lead to an improved understanding of the eco-evolutionary drivers of speciation in the world’s largest ecosystem.","Weston, Johanna N.

This study aimed at evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of University Students and determining the prevalence of anxiety and depression. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study utilized an online questionnaire sent to students in the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, Delta State University after ethical approval. The Generalized Anxiety and Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were analyzed using Statistical Package of Social Sciences and expressed using descriptive statistics and percentages. An independent t-test was used to determine the gender differences in the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores while Pearson’s correlation test was used to evaluate the association between these scores with age. RESULTS: The 259 respondents comprised 118, 45.6% males and 141, 54.4% females with an average age of 21.50±2.04 years. The majority (149, 57.5%) were aged 21-25 years. The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores did not show significant differences in age and gender. Moderate to severe anxiety and depression was established in 22.4% and 28.2% of the respondents respectively. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the prevalence of anxiety and depression due to the pandemic bears no relationship with age and gender.

In this interim report we investigated secondary attack rates (SAR) by household and subject characteristics in the Netherlands and Belgium. Methods: Households with a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 index case were enrolled <48 hours following report of the positive test result. Daily symptom follow-up, standardized nose-throat sampling at enrollment and at new-onset acute respiratory illness (ARI) and paired dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from each participant. Children 0-2 years of age were additionally requested to collect a stool sample 7 days after enrollment and at new-onset of ARI. Swabs and stool samples were tested by RT-PCR for virus detection and DBS by multiplex protein microarray for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The SAR was calculated 1) per-household as the proportion of households with [≥]1 secondary SARS-CoV-2 case and 2) per-person as the probability of infection in household members at risk. We explored differences in SARs by household and subject characteristics. Results: This analysis includes 117 households that completed follow-up between April-December 2020. Among 382 subjects, 74 secondary infections were detected, of which 13 (17.6%) were asymptomatic and 20 (27.0%) infections were detected by seroconversion only. Of cases detected by RT-PCR, 50 (67.6%) were found at enrollment. The household SAR was 44.4% (95%-CI: 35.4-53.9%) and was higher for index cases meeting the ARI case definition (52.3%; 95%-CI 41.4-62.9%) compared to mildly symptomatic (22.2%; 95%-CI: 9.4-42.7%) and asymptomatic index cases (0.0%; 95%-CI: 0.0-80.2%). The per-person SAR was 27.9% (95%-CI: 22.7-33.8%). Transmission was lowest from child to parent (9.1%; 95%-CI: 2.4-25.5%) and highest from parent to child (28.1%; 95%-CI: 19.7-38.4%) and in children 6-12 years (34.2%; 95%-CI: 20.1-51.4%). Among 141 subjects with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, seroconversion was detected in 111 (78.7%). Conclusion: We found a high household SAR, with the large majority of transmissions detected early after identification of the index case. Our findings confirm differential SAR by symptom status of the index. In almost a quarter of RT-PCR positive cases, no antibodies were detected. Other factors influencing transmission will be further explored as more data accumulate.","de Hoog, M. M.; Verberk, J.; Westerhof, I.; van Goethem, S.; Lammens, C.; Ieven, G.

This study explores how the microbiome has been portrayed in press sources popular among American and Canadian audiences. DESIGN: Content analysis. METHODS: Using the FACTIVA Database, we compiled a finalised data set of (N=830) articles from press sources popular among American and Canadian audiences which were published between 1 January 2018 and 11 October 2019 and which contained at least one of the following search terms: ‘microbiome’, ‘microbiota’, ‘gut health’, ‘healthy gut’, ‘unhealthy gut’, ‘gut bacteria’, ‘probiotic’ or ‘probiotics.’ We performed content analysis on the articles to determine how often ideas of the microbiome were presented as beneficial, in which health contexts, and whether actions could be taken to reap stated benefits. We compared this portrayal of benefits with critical portrayals of the microbiome. RESULTS: Almost all of the articles (94%) described health benefits associated with the microbiome with many (79%) describing actions which could be taken to reap stated benefits. Articles most often described health benefits in more broad, general context (34%) and most commonly outlined actions related to food/drug (45%) as well as probiotic (27%) intake. Only some articles (19%) provided microbiome-related critiques or limitations. Some of the articles (22%) were focused on highlighting specific research developments, and in these articles, critiques or limitations were more common. CONCLUSIONS: Articles discussing the microbiome published for American and Canadian audiences typically hype the microbiome’s impact and popularise gut health trends while only offering a little in the way of communicating microbiome science. Lifestyle choices including nutrition, taking probiotics, stress management and exercise are often promoted as means of reaping the microbiome-related health benefits.

Prone positioning (PP) is an intervention with proven survival benefits in moderate-to-severe and severe ARDS. It is advocated in international guidelines as an intervention in mechanically ventilated Covid-19 patients, despite very few published trials investigating its efficacy in Covid-19. There is an ongoing debate regarding the prevalence of reported mismatches between the severity of hypoxaemia and the preservation of pulmonary compliance in some patients, in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has led some to question its utility within this context. 129 proning sessions were identified in 34 consecutively prone patients admitted to the intensive care unit at a single center in the United Kingdom. Baseline characteristics of patients were consistent with previously published national and international reports and patients were ventilated in general concordance with the ARDSnet ventilation protocol. Paired analysis of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen(PaO(2)): fraction of inspired oxygen(FiO(2)) ratio (PF ratio) (n = 89) and FiO(2) (n = 129) was recorded within 3 hours of both the initiation and termination of PP and differences were assessed with the paired Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Proning improved the PF ratio by 43.5 ± 54.9 from 99.8 ± 37.5 to 151.9 ± 58.9 (43.6% increase) [p < 0.0001] and reduced FiO(2) by 0.17 ± 0.2 from 0.68 ± 0.2 to 0.51 ± 0.2 (25% decrease) [p < 0.0001]. 82% of proning maneouveres resulted in an improvement in the PF ratio.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a descriptive bibliometric study of the main trends in research on COVID-19 produced in Latin America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched in the Web of Science, Scopus, and Pubmed databases to retrieve the Latin American scientific production on COVID-19. Bibliometric indicators of production, visibility, impact, and collaboration were analyzed to assess the regional participation in studies on the subject. RESULTS: The analysis of 142 documents evidenced an exponential growth of scientific production in the period analyzed, an important level of international collaboration (51.4%) in scientific production, and the leadership of regional institutions (71%) in the research with publications in high-visibility jounals especially in Colombia, Brazil, and México. CONCLUSIONS: The results regarding the regional participation in the research on COVID-19 were relevant not only in relation to its quantity and exponential growth during the period analyzed but also in terms of its quality and excellence with a high rate of international collaboration and publications in important scientific journals, which besides their visibility, represent a considerable contribution to the research compared to the other geographical contexts.","Gregorio-Chaviano, Orlando; Limaymanta, César H.; López-Mesa, Evony K.",Biomedica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152194/; https://doi.org/10.7705/biomedica.5571,238

What is needed is a discussion that considers the subjective reality and resources as well as risks. OBJECTIVE: The study focused on the perspectives of older people. The aim was to shed light on their subjective experience of the corona pandemic. The questions were how they experienced the pandemic, the risks, consequences and protective measures, to what extent these affected their everyday life and how they dealt with it. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 12 guideline-based telephone interviews were conducted in May and June 2020 with 9 women and 3 men between 77 and 91 years of age, who lived in their own homes, had impaired health and needed help and care. The data were evaluated by structuring content analysis. RESULTS: The respondents were generally concerned about the corona pandemic but considered their own risk to be low. They saw themselves as hardly affected by the immediate consequences of the crisis or severely restricted in their everyday lives. They experienced insecurity in social life and fear of loneliness was central.

621960,The emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis,2020-08-19,"Background: Vestibular dysfunction is likely the most common complication to cochlear implantation (CI) and may, in rare cases, result in persistent severe vertigo. Literature on long-term vestibular outcomes is scarce. Objective: This paper aims to evaluate vestibular dysfunction before and after cochlear implantation, the long-term vestibular outcomes, and follows up on previous findings of 35 consecutive adult cochlear implantations evaluated by a battery of vestibular tests. Methods: A prospective observational longitudinal cohort study was conducted on 35 CI recipients implanted between 2018 and 2019; last follow-up was conducted in 2021. At the CI work-up (T0) and two postoperative follow-ups (T1 and T2), 4 and 14 months following implantation, respectively, all patients had their vestibular function evaluated. Evaluation with a vestibular test battery, involving video head impulse test (vHIT), cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP), caloric irrigation test, and dizziness handicap inventory (DHI), were performed at all evaluations. Results: vHIT testing showed that 3 of 35 ears had abnormal vHIT gain preoperatively, which increased insignificantly to 4 of 35 at the last follow-up (p = 0.651). The mean gain in implanted ears decreased insignificantly from 0.93 to 0.89 (p = 0.164) from T0 to T2. Preoperatively, 3 CI ears had correction saccades, which increased to 11 at T2 (p = 0.017). Mean unilateral weakness increased from 19 to 40% from T0 to T2 (p < 0.005), and the total number of patients with either hypofunctioning or areflexic semicircular canals increased significantly from 7 to 17 (p < 0.005). Twenty-nine percent of CI ears showed cVEMP responses at T0, which decreased to 14% (p = 0.148) at T2. DHI total mean scores increased slightly from 10.9 to 12.8 from T0 to T1 and remained at 13.0 at T2 (p = 0.368). DHI scores worsened in 6 of 27 patients and improved in 4 of 27 subjects from T0 to T2. Conclusion: This study reports significant deterioration in vestibular function 14 months after cochlear implantation, in a wide range of vestibular tests. vHIT, caloric irrigation, and cVEMP all measured an overall worsening of vestibular function at short-term postoperative follow-up. No significant deterioration or improvement was measured at the last postoperative follow-up; thus, vestibular outcomes reached a plateau. Despite vestibular dysfunction, most of the patients report less or unchanged vestibular symptoms.","Rasmussen, Kasper Møller Boje; West, Niels; Tian, Luchen; Cayé-Thomasen, Per",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456848/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.686681,238

In this study, we assessed the effects of different drugs and cardiac injury on QTc interval prolongation in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The study cohort consisted of 395 confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Wuhan Union Hospital West Campus. All hospitalized patients were treated with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), quinolones, interferon, Arbidol, or Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD) and received at least 1 electrocardiogram after drug administration. Fifty one (12.9%) patients exhibited QTc prolongation (QTc ≥ 470 ms). QTc interval prolongation was associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality (both P < .001). Administration of CQ/HCQ (odds ratio [OR], 2.759; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.318–5.775; P = .007), LPV/r (OR, 2.342; 95% CI, 1.152–4.760; P = .019), and quinolones (OR, 2.268; 95% CI, 1.171–4.392; P = .015) increased the risk of QTc prolongation. In contrast, the administration of Arbidol, interferon, or QPD did not increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Notably, patients treated with QPD had a shorter QTc duration than those without QPD treatment (412.10 [384.39–433.77] vs 420.86 [388.19–459.58]; P = .042). The QTc interval was positively correlated with the levels of cardiac biomarkers (creatine kinase-MB fraction [rho = 0.14, P = .016], high-sensitivity troponin I [rho = .22, P < .001], and B-type natriuretic peptide [rho = 0.27, P < .001]). In conclusion, QTc prolongation was associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. The risk of QTc prolongation was higher in patients receiving CQ/HCQ, LPV/r, and quinolones. QPD had less significant effects on QTc prolongation than other antiviral agents.","Ding, Jiaxing; Liu, Wei; Guan, Hongquan; Feng, Yu; Bao, Yintu; Li, Huili; Wang, Xuehua; Zhou, Zihua; Chen, Zhijian",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260531/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026538,238

This infection is highly contagiousness, has a high morbidity, and is capable of evolving into a potentially lethal form of interstitial pneumonia. Numerous countries shut-down various activities that were considered “not essential.” Dental treatment was in this category and, at the time of writing, only non-deferrable emergencies are still allowed in many countries. Therefore, follow-up visits of ongoing active therapies (e.g., orthodontic treatment) must be handled taking special precautions. This literature review aims at reducing in-office appointments by providing an overview of the technologies available and their reliability in the long-distance monitoring of patients, i.e., teledentistry. Methods: A literature review was made according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Randomized clinical trials, cross sectional, observational, and case-control studies were evaluated with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool for quality assessment and study limitations. Results: A primary search found 80 articles, 69/80 were excluded as non-relevant on the basis of: the abstract, title, study design, bias, and/or lack of relevance. Twelve articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Conclusions: Teleorthodontics can manage most emergencies, reassuring and following patients remotely. The aim set by dental teleassistance was met as it reduced patients’ office visits whilst maintaining regular monitoring, without compromising the results. Although our preliminary findings should be further investigated to objectively evaluate the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and long-term results, we are confident that teleassistance in orthodontics will have a role to play in the near future.","Maspero, Cinzia; Abate, Andrea; Cavagnetto, Davide; El Morsi, Mohamed; Fama, Andrea; Farronato, Marco",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32560322/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9061891,238

We discuss the impact of these factors on the CFR estimates for Germany, Italy, France, and Spain for the COVID-19 pandemic from early March to mid-April, 2020. We found that, first, a large proportion of the difference in CFRs can be attributed to different age structures of the cases. Second, lags of 5-10 days between day of case report and death should be used, since these provide the most constant estimates. Third, for France, Italy, and Spain, intensive care beds occupied by COVID-19 patients were positively associated with fatality risks of hospitalized cases.

However, often the available data are not sufficient to identify the model parameters and hence infer the unobserved dynamics. Here, we develop a general framework for building a trustworthy data-driven epidemiological model, consisting of a workflow that integrates data acquisition and event timeline, model development, identifiability analysis, sensitivity analysis, model calibration, model robustness analysis, and projection with uncertainties in different scenarios. In particular, we apply this framework to propose a modified susceptible–exposed–infectious–recovered (SEIR) model, including new compartments and model vaccination in order to project the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in New York City (NYC). We find that we can uniquely estimate the model parameters and accurately project the daily new infection cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, in agreement with the available data from NYC’s government’s website.

Sal-06mAb belonging to IgG1 isotype demonstrated broad cross-reactivity to standard and isolated strains of genus Salmonella and others such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Proteus mirabilis. Cross-reactivity across several bacterial genera indicated that the epitopes reactive to Sal-06mAb are conserved among these members. Neutralizing effects of Sal-06mAb on Salmonella growth and survival was evaluated in vitro using bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity with and without complement and bacterial invasion inhibition assay. Sal-06mAb demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect on the growth of S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 strain which is both time and concentration (of mAb) dependent. It was also found that the bacterial growth inhibition was complement independent. When the bacterial cells were preincubated with Sal-06mAb, it reduced the adherence and invasion of bacterial cells into A549 epithelial cell line. This was confirmed by CFU count analysis, phase contrast, and fluorescence microscopy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging confirmed the antimicrobial effects of Sal-06mAb on S. typhimurium ATCC 14028. The development of broadly reactive and cross protective Sal-06mAb opens new possibilities for immunotherapy of sepsis caused by Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae members.","Reddy, Prakash Narayana; Makam, Shivakiran Sathyanarayan; Kota, Rohini Krishna; Yatung, Gyati; Urs, Radhika Madam; Batra, Harshvardhan; Tuteja, Urmil",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31997109/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-020-10394-5,238
624006,COVID-19 lungs in post-mortem computed tomography,2021-02-15,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, has recently been associated with a myriad of hematologic derangements; in particular, an unusually high incidence of venous thromboembolism has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. It is postulated that either the cytokine storm induced by the viral infection or endothelial damage caused by viral binding to the ACE-2 receptor may activate a cascade leading to a hypercoaguable state. Although pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis have been well described in patients with COVID-19 infection, there is a paucity of literature on cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cVST) associated with COVID-19 infection. cVST is an uncommon etiology of stroke and has a higher occurrence in women and young people. We report a series of three patients at our institution with confirmed COVID-19 infection and venous sinus thrombosis, two of whom were male and one female. These cases fall outside the typical demographic of patients with cVST, potentially attributable to COVID-19 induced hypercoaguability. This illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for cVST in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly those with unexplained cerebral hemorrhage, or infarcts with an atypical pattern for arterial occlusive disease.","Dakay, Katarina; Cooper, Jared; Bloomfield, Jessica; Overby, Philip; Mayer, Stephan A.; Nuoman, Rolla; Sahni, Ramandeep; Gulko, Edwin; Kaur, Gurmeen; Santarelli, Justin; Gandhi, Chirag D.; Al-Mufti, Fawaz",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2020.105434; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1052305720308521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190109/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1052305720308521,238
624447,An overview of COVID-19,2020-05-08,"INTRODUCTION: There have been reports of increased prevalence in psychiatric conditions in non-veteran survivors of COVID-19. To date, however, no known study has examined the prevalence, risk and protective factors of psychiatric conditions among US military veterans who survived COVID-19. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 2019 to 2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 US veterans. Prepandemic and 1-year peripandemic risk and protective factors associated with positive screens for peripandemic internalising (major depressive, generalised anxiety and/or posttraumatic stress disorders) and externalising psychiatric disorders (alcohol and/or drug use disorders) and suicidal ideation were examined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 233 veterans (8.6%) reported having been infected with COVID-19. Relative to veterans who were not infected, veterans who were infected were more likely to screen positive for internalising disorders (20.5% vs 13.9%, p=0.005), externalising disorders (23.2% vs 14.8%, p=0.001) and current suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 7.6%, p=0.015) at peripandemic. Multivariable analyses revealed that greater prepandemic psychiatric symptom severity and COVID-related stressors were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic internalising disorders, while prepandemic trauma burden was protective. Prepandemic suicidal ideation, greater loneliness and lower household income were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic suicidal ideation, whereas prepandemic community integration was protective. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation are prevalent in veterans who have survived COVID-19. Veterans with greater prepandemic psychiatric and substance use problems, COVID-related stressors and fewer psychosocial resources may be at increased risk of these outcomes.","Na, Peter; Tsai, J; Harpaz-Rotem, I; Pietrzak, R",BMJ Mil Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035155/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-001846,238
624490,Immune mediating molecules and pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated neurological disease,2021-06-04,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Dendritic cells (DCs)-based cancer vaccines have not succeeded in generating significant clinical responses despite their capacity to induce host anti-tumor CD8 T cell immunity, and one major hurdle is tumor-mediated immunosuppression. Exosomes are nano-sized inert membrane vesicles derived from the endocytic pathway that play a critical role in intercellular communication. DC-derived exosomes (DCexos) additionally carried MHC class I/II (MHCI/II) often complexed with antigens and co-stimulatory molecules, thus capable of priming antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Indeed, vaccines with DCexos have been shown to exhibit better anti-tumor efficacy in eradicating tumors compared to DC vaccines in pre-clinical models. Coupled with their resistance to tumor immunosuppression, DCexo-based cancer vaccines have been heralded as the superior alternative cell-free therapeutic vaccines over DC vaccines, and have now been tested in multiple clinical trials. In this review, current studies of DCexo cancer vaccines as well as potential future directions will be discussed. ABSTRACT: As the initiators of adaptive immune responses, DCs play a central role in regulating the balance between CD8 T cell immunity versus tolerance to tumor antigens. Exploiting their function to potentiate host anti-tumor immunity, DC-based vaccines have been one of most promising and widely used cancer immunotherapies. However, DC-based cancer vaccines have not achieved the promised success in clinical trials, with one of the major obstacles being tumor-mediated immunosuppression. A recent discovery on the critical role of type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) play in cross-priming tumor-specific CD8 T cells and determining the anti-tumor efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, however, has highlighted the need to further develop and refine DC-based vaccines either as monotherapies or in combination with other therapies. DC-derived exosomes (DCexos) have been heralded as a promising alternative to DC-based vaccines, as DCexos are more resistance to tumor-mediated suppression and DCexo vaccines have exhibited better anti-tumor efficacy in pre-clinical animal models. However, DCexo vaccines have only achieved limited clinical efficacy and failed to induce tumor-specific T cell responses in clinical trials. The lack of clinical efficacy might be partly due to the fact that all current clinical trials used peptide-loaded DCexos from monocyte-derived DCs. In this review, we will focus on the perspective of expanding current DCexo research to move DCexo cancer vaccines forward clinically to realize their potential in cancer immunotherapy.","Yao, Yi; Fu, Chunmei; Zhou, Li; Mi, Qing-Sheng; Jiang, Aimin",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359569/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13153667,238
625124,Spinal Cord Injury From an Epidural Abscess as a Serious Complication of COVID-19 Infection,2020-11-04,"OBJECTIVE: Preliminary findings suggest a relationship between lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and incidence and severity of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between vitamin D status at admission and different markers of inflammation, coagulation, and sepsis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective study on 137 consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and available data on serum 25(OH)D levels, who were admitted to our Institution between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: survivors (n = 78; 57%) and non-survivors (n = 59; 43%). RESULTS: At admission, all patients showed hypovitaminosis D. Median total serum 25(OH)D levels at admission were significantly higher in survivors than non-survivors (12 ng/mL vs 8 ng/mL; p < 0.01). Non-survivors exhibited significantly higher median levels of white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), D-dimer, fibrinogen, and procalcitonin (PCT) compared to survivors at three different time points during hospitalization. In a multivariate analysis performed by a logistic regression model, serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly inversely associated with risk of COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; p = 0.01). According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, hsCRP, NLR, ferritin, and D-dimer were the best predictive biomarkers for poor prognosis of COVID-19, whereas IL-6, PCT, fibrinogen, 25(OH)D, WBC count, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) may serve as supportive biomarkers for worse clinical course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: We found a markedly high prevalence (100%) of hypovitaminosis D in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, suggesting a possible role of low vitamin D status in increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent hospitalization. The inverse association between serum 25(OH)D levels and risk of in-hospital mortality observed in our cohort suggests that a lower vitamin D status upon admission may represent a modifiable and independent risk factor for poor prognosis in COVID-19.","Infante, Marco; Buoso, Andrea; Pieri, Massimo; Lupisella, Santina; Nuccetelli, Marzia; Bernardini, Sergio; Fabbri, Andrea; Iannetta, Marco; Andreoni, Massimo; Colizzi, Vittorio; Morello, Maria",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2021.1877580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600292/,238

Aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins in decreasing several sepsis biomarker concentrations. 26 sepsis patients were enrolled in this observational cohort study and Nitric Oxide, Endocan, Pentraxin and presepsin serum levels were measured during their first 3 days of ICU stay. The use of intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins did not influence the temporal evolution of SOFA, Nitric Oxide, Endocan, Pentraxin and Presepsin in the first 3 days of ICU stay in a statistically significant manner, even if Presepsin decreased of 25% from day 1 to day 2 in the Pentaglobin group. It seems possible that Pentaglobin infusion reduces the Presepsin level in a more effective way if it were administered to a younger population (p = 0.012). In conclusion, age modifies the response of Presepsin to Pentaglobin and is a critical variable when investigating the effect of intravenous IgM-enriched immunoglobulins on sepsis.","Scarpati, Giuliana; Baldassarre, Daniela; Tripepi, Giovanni; Boffardi, Massimo; Piazza, Ornella",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.717349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34566642/,238

However, there are still important gaps to know a great number of characteristics of this disease. Among these, some potential ways of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and the different reasons for the severity of the disease in different people. Various studies have suggested that certain air pollutants could be increasing the transmission of the coronavirus, as well as the risks of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. In the present preliminary case-study conducted in Tarragona Province (Catalonia, Spain), we studied the potential association of COVID-19 with PM(10), NO(2) and O(3), as well as the differences in the incidence and lethality of this disease. This Province is divided into two “health regions”: Camp de Tarragona, with an important industrial complex, and Terres de l’Ebre, with a great agricultural component. In spite of the notable limitations of the current study, our preliminary findings indicate that the industrialized/urban areas of Tarragona Province show a higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19 than the agricultural/rural zones. These – and previous – results would highlight the importance of conducting specific investigations focused on directly assessing whether air pollutants such as particulate matter can act as carriers of the SARS-CoV-2.

The manuscript covers approaches to the synthesis of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone derivatives: modification of the C5 position of the basic core; synthesis of the target compounds in the one-pot or multistage reactions or transformation of other related heterocycles. The most prominent pharmacological profiles of 5-ene derivatives of different 4-thiazolidinone subtypes belonging to hit-, lead-compounds, drug-candidates and drugs as well as the most studied targets have been discussed. Currently target compounds (especially 5-en-rhodanines) are assigned as frequent hitters or pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) within high-throughput screening campaigns. Nevertheless, the crucial impact of the presence/nature of C5 substituent (namely 5-ene) on the pharmacological effects of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones was confirmed by the numerous listed findings from the original articles. The main directions for active 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones optimization have been shown: i) complication of the fragment in the C5 position; ii) introduction of the substituents in the N3 position (especially fragments with carboxylic group or its derivatives); iii) annealing in complex heterocyclic systems; iv) combination with other pharmacologically attractive fragments within hybrid pharmacophore approach. Moreover, the utilization of 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones in the synthesis of complex compounds with potent pharmacological application is described. The chemical transformations cover mainly the reactions which involve the exocyclic double bond in C5 position of the main core and correspond to the abovementioned direction of the 5-ene-4-thiazolidinone modification.","Kaminskyy, Danylo; Kryshchyshyn, Anna; Lesyk, Roman",Eur J Med Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28987611/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.09.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523417307456; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523417307456,238

Data Synthesis COVID-19 mainly invades the lungs, causing its serious damage. Studies found that COVID-19 induced the renin-angiotensin system imbalance, inflammatory storm, hypoxemia and stress response et al, all contributed to hypertension and serious myocardial damage in the process of virus pathogenesis, even increasing mortality in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions In the process of management of COVID-19 infections, close attention should be paid on both lung and cardiovascular damage, especially on those with only symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. Early identification, timely and effective treatments, maintenance of hemodynamics and electrophysiological stability are of great significance on effective treatment and long-term prognosis. The pandemic of COVID-19 has been taking lives worldwide. It caused by a novel coronavirus which human being are lack of defensive function in whole population. It targets human’s lung and causes serious damage of lungs. Based on early reports, for people with underlying heart issues, the concerns are serious. It appears people over 65 with coronary heart diseases or hypertension is more likely to be infected and to develop more severe symptoms.

628049,How did we take care of our older cancer patients during the first COVID-19 wave? The French experience,2021-04-06,"INTRODUCTION: Care home residents are at high risk of dying from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Regular testing, producing rapid and reliable results is important in this population because infections spread quickly, and presentations are often atypical or asymptomatic. This study evaluated current testing pathways in care homes to explore the role of point-of-care tests (POCTs). METHODS: A total of 10 staff from eight care homes, purposively sampled to reflect care organisational attributes that influence outbreak severity, underwent a semi-structured remote videoconference interview. Transcripts were analysed using process mapping tools and framework analysis focussing on perceptions about, gaps within and needs arising from current pathways. RESULTS: Four main steps were identified in testing: infection prevention, preparatory steps, swabbing procedure and management of residents. Infection prevention was particularly challenging for mobile residents with cognitive impairment. Swabbing and preparatory steps were resource-intensive, requiring additional staff resource. Swabbing required flexibility and staff who were familiar to the resident. Frequent approaches to residents were needed to ensure they would participate at a suitable time. After-test management varied between sites. Several homes reported deviating from government guidance to take more cautious approaches, which they perceived to be more robust. CONCLUSION: Swab-based testing is organisationally complex and resource-intensive in care homes. It needs to be flexible to meet the needs of residents and provide care homes with rapid information to support care decisions. POCT could help address gaps but the complexity of the setting means that each technology must be evaluated in context before widespread adoption in care homes.","Micocci, Massimo; Gordon, Adam L; Allen, A Joy; Hicks, Timothy; Kierkegaard, Patrick; McLister, Anna; Walne, Simon; Hayward, Gail; Buckle, Peter",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33481986/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab015,238

By comparing noise from recordings with completely static artificial eyes to noise from recordings where the artificial eyes are worn by humans, we show that very small head movements increase levels and colouring of the noise in data recorded from all five eye trackers in this study. This increase of noise levels is seen not only in the gaze signal, but also in the P and CR signals of the eye trackers that provide these camera image features. The P and CR signals of the SMI eye trackers correlate strongly during small head movements, but less so or not at all when the head is completely still, indicating that head movements are registered by the P and CR images in the eye camera. By recording with artificial eyes, we can also show that the pupil size artefact has no major role in increasing and colouring noise. Our findings add to and replicate the observation by Niehorster et al., (2021) that lowpass filters in video-based P–CR eye trackers colour the data. Irrespective of source, filters or head movements, coloured noise can be confused for oculomotor drift. We also find that usage of the default head restriction in the EyeLink 1000+, the EyeLink II and the HiSpeed240 result in noisier data compared to less head restriction. Researchers investigating data quality in eye trackers should consider not using the Gen 2 artificial eye from SR Research / EyeLink. Data recorded with this artificial eye are much noisier than data recorded with other artificial eyes, on average 2.2–14.5 times worse for the five eye trackers.","Holmqvist, Kenneth; Örbom, Saga Lee; Zemblys, Raimondas",Behav Res Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357538/; https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01648-9,238
628810,Macular vessel density in patients recovered from COVID-19 disease,2021-03-27,"In malaria-endemic regions, people often get exposed to various pathogens simultaneously, generating co-infection scenarios. In such scenarios, overlapping symptoms pose serious diagnostic challenges. The delayed diagnosis may lead to an increase in disease severity and catastrophic events. Recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected various areas globally, including malaria-endemic regions. The Plasmodium and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection and its effect on the health are yet unexplored. We present a case report of a previously healthy, middle-aged individual from the malaria-endemic area who suffered SARS-CoV-2 and Plasmodium falciparum co-infection. The patient developed severe disease indications in the short time period. The patient showed neurological symptoms, altered hematological as well as liver-test parameters, and subsequent death in a narrow time-span. We hereby discuss the various aspects of this case regarding treatment and hematological parameters. Further, we have put forward perspectives related to the mechanism behind severity and neurological symptoms in this fatal parasite-virus co-infection case. In malaria-endemic regions, due to overlapping symptoms, suspected COVID-19 patients should also be monitored for diagnosis of malaria without any delay. The SARS-CoV-2 and Plasmodium co-infection could increase the disease severity in a short time span. In treatment, dexamethasone may not help in severe case having malaria as well as COVID-19 positive status and needs further exploration.","Indari, Omkar; Baral, Budhadev; Muduli, Kartik; Prasad Mohanty, Ambika; Swain, Natabar; Kumar Mohakud, Nirmal; Chandra Jha, Hem",Biosaf Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bsheal.2021.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969285/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590053621000392; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590053621000392?v=s5,238

METHODS: Patients were identified upon presentation to the emergency department with symptoms of chest pain/discomfort. In all study patients, we excluded past and current COVID-19. Routine clinical and laboratory investigations for common etiologies of myocarditis were performed. Laboratory tests also included troponin and C-reactive protein levels. The diagnosis of myocarditis was established after cardiac MRI. FINDINGS: Five patients presented after the second and one after the first dose of the vaccine. All patients were males with a median age of 23 years. Myocarditis was diagnosed in all patients, there was no evidence of COVID-19 infection. Laboratory assays excluded concomitant infection; autoimmune disorder was considered unlikely. All patients responded to the BNT162b2 vaccine. The clinical course was mild in all six patients.

DESIGN: This pragmatic trial compares an asynchronous form of CBT-CP that uses interactive voice response (IVR) to allow patients to participate from their home (IVR CBT-CP) with synchronous CBT-CP delivered by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinician. Veterans (n=764; 50% male) with chronic musculoskeletal pain throughout nine VA medical centers will participate. The primary outcome is pain interference after treatment (4 months). Secondary outcomes, including pain intensity, depression symptom severity, sleep, self-efficacy, and global impression of change, are also measured after treatment. Where possible, outcomes are collected via electronic health record extraction, with remaining measures collected via IVR calls to maintain blinding. Quantitative and qualitative process evaluation metrics will be collected to evaluate factors related to implementation. A budget impact analysis will be performed. SUMMARY: This pragmatic trial compares the outcomes, cost, and implementation of two forms of CBT-CP as delivered in the real-world setting. Findings from the trial can be used to guide future policy and implementation efforts related to these interventions and their use in the health system. If one of the interventions emerges as superior, resources can be directed to this modality. If both treatments are effective, patient preferences and health care system factors will take precedence when making referrals.

Information on respiratory viruses in non-severe CAP cases is scarce. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of respiratory viruses among non-severe CAP cases. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study conducted in Salvador, Brazil. Out of 820 children aged 2–59 months with non-severe CAP diagnosed by pediatricians (respiratory complaints and radiographic pulmonary infiltrate/consolidation), recruited in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01200706), nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were obtained from 774 (94.4%) patients and tested for 16 respiratory viruses by PCRs. RESULTS: Viruses were detected in 708 (91.5%; 95%CI: 89.3–93.3) cases, out of which 491 (69.4%; 95%CI: 65.9–72.7) harbored multiple viruses. Rhinovirus (46.1%; 95%CI: 42.6–49.6), adenovirus (38.4%; 95%CI: 35.0–41.8), and enterovirus (26.5%; 95%CI: 23.5–29.7) were the most commonly found viruses. The most frequent combination comprised rhinovirus plus adenovirus. No difference was found in the frequency of RSVA (16.1% vs. 14.6%; P = 0.6), RSVB (10.9% vs. 13.2%; P = 0.4) influenza (Flu) A (6.3% vs. 5.1%; P = 0.5), FluB (4.5% vs. 1.8%; P = 0.09), parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1 (5.1% vs. 2.8%; P = 0.2), or PIV4 (7.7% vs. 4.1%; P = 0.08), when children with multiple or sole virus detection were compared. Conversely, rhinovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus, PIV2, PIV3, metapneumovirus, coronavirus OC43, NL63, 229E were significantly more frequent among cases with multiple virus detection. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses were detected in over 90% of the cases, out of which 70% had multiple viruses. Several viruses are more commonly found in multiple virus detection whereas other viruses are similarly found in sole and in multiple virus detection.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Amanda C.; Vilas-Boas, Ana-Luisa; Fontoura, Maria-Socorro H.; Vuorinen, Tytti; Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.",J Clin Virol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653218301537; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653218301537; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2018.06.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29908521/,238
629101,Modulation of Gut Microbiota for the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19,2021-06-29,"The multifunctional nucleocapsid (N) protein in SARS-CoV-2 binds the ~30 kb viral RNA genome to aid its packaging into the 80–90nm membrane-enveloped virion. The N protein is composed of N-terminal RNA-binding and C-terminal dimerization domains that are flanked by three intrinsically disordered regions. Here we demonstrate that a centrally located 40 amino acid intrinsically disordered domain drives phase separation of N protein when bound to RNA, with the morphology of the resulting condensates affected by inclusion in the RNA of the putative SARS-CoV-2 packaging signal. The SARS-CoV-2 M protein, normally embedded in the virion membrane with its C-terminus extending into the virion core, independently induces N protein phase separation that is dependent on the N protein’s C-terminal dimerization domain and disordered region. Three-component mixtures of N+M+RNA form condensates with mutually exclusive compartments containing N+M or N+RNA, including spherical annular structures in which the M protein coats the outside of an N+RNA condensate. These findings support a model in which phase separation of the N protein with both the viral genomic RNA and the SARS-CoV-2 M protein facilitates RNA packaging and virion assembly.","Lu, Shan; Ye, Qiaozhen; Singh, Digvijay; Villa, Elizabeth; Cleveland, Don W.; Corbett, Kevin D.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766587/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.30.228023,238
629662,Colchicine and Cardiovascular Outcomes: a Critical Appraisal of Recent Studies,2021-05-10,"Background: The progress of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacts the health of communities around the world, with unique impacts on colleges and universities. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic people is thought to be the underlying cause of a large proportion of new infections. However, the local prevalence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 is influenced by local public health restrictions and the community setting. Objectives: This study has three main objectives. First, we looked to establish the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection on a university campus in California. Second, we sought to assess the changes in viral prevalence associated with the shifting community conditions related to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Third, we aimed to compare the performance of CRISPR- and PCR-based assays for large-scale virus surveillance sampling in COVID-19 asymptomatic persons. Methods: We enrolled 1,808 asymptomatic persons for self-collection of oropharyngeal (OP) samples to undergo SARS-CoV-2 testing. We compared viral prevalence in samples obtained in two time periods: May 28th-June 11th; June 23rd-July 2nd. We detected viral genomes in these samples using two assays: CREST, a CRISPR-based method recently developed at UCSB, and the RT-qPCR test recommended by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Results: Of the 1,808 participants, 1,805 were affiliates of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and 1,306 were students. None of the tests performed on the 732 samples collected between late May to early June were positive. In contrast, tests performed on the 1076 samples collected between late June to early July, revealed nine positive cases. This change in prevalence met statistical significance, p = 0.013. One sample was positive by RT-qPCR at the threshold of detection, but negative by both CREST and CLIA-confirmation testing. With this single exception, there was perfect concordance in both positive and negative results obtained by RT-qPCR and CREST. The estimated prevalence of the virus, calculated using the confirmed cases, was 0.74%. The average age of our sample population was 28.33 (18-75) years, and the average age of the positive cases was 21.7 years (19-30). Conclusions: Our study revealed that there were no COVID-19 cases in our study population in May/June. Using the same methods, we demonstrated a substantial shift in prevalence approximately one month later, which coincided with changes in community restrictions and public interactions. This increase in prevalence, in a young and asymptomatic population which would not have otherwise accessed COVID-19 testing, indicated the leading wave of a local outbreak, and coincided with rising case counts in the surrounding county and the state of California. Our results substantiate that large, population-level asymptomatic screening using self-collection may be a feasible and instructive aspect of the public health approach within large campus communities, and the almost perfect concordance between CRISPR- and PCR-based assays indicate expanded options for surveillance testing","Rauch, J.

On March 16, 2020, the Austrian government imposed restrictions and subsequently the Austrian Medical Association recommended minimizing screening examinations in compliance with government restrictions. The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of this recommendation on the number of colonoscopies performed weekly and detection of non-advanced adenomas, advanced adenomas (AA) and colorectal cancer (CRC) and to calculate how many undetected adenomas could have developed into CRC. Methods We analyzed the number of colonoscopies and pathological findings within a quality assured national colorectal cancer screening program before the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, (t) 2019 to September 1, 2019, Period 1) and compared those rates to months during which access to colonoscopy was limited (March 1, 2020 and September 1, 2020, Period 2) with a Wilcoxon-rank-test and a chi-square test. Results A total of 29,199 screening colonoscopies were performed during Period 1 and 24,010 during Period 2. The mean rate of colonoscopies per week during Period 1 was significantly higher than during Period 2 (808,35 [SD = 163,75] versus 594,50 [SD = 282,24], P = 0.005). A total of 4,498 non-advanced adenomas were detected during Period 1 versus 3,562 during Period 2 ( P < 0.001). In total 1,317 AAs and 140 CRCs were detected during Period 1 versus 919 AAs and 106 CRCs during Period 2. These rates did not differ significantly ( P = 0.2 and P = 0.9). Conclusions During the COVID-19 crisis, the number of colonoscopies performed per week was significantly lower compared to the year before, but there was no difference in the detection of CRCs and AAs.","Hinterberger, Anna; Jiricka, Lena; Waldmann, Elisabeth A.; Penz, Daniela; Majcher, Barbara; Asaturi, Arno; Szymanska, Aleksandra; Rockenbauer, Lisa; Ferlitsch, Arnulf; Trauner, Michael H.; Ferlitsch, Monika",Endosc Int Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466353/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1497-1123,238

METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based study including 99 468 previously diagnosed, treated hypertensives enrolled in the UK Biobank. Hypertension control was defined as systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg. RESULTS: Median age was 62.3 years (IQR 57.3 to 66.0), 45.9% female, 92.0% white, 40.1% obese, 9.3% current smokers and 19.4% had prior cardiovascular disease. 38.1% (95% CI 37.8% to 38.4%) were controlled. In multivariable logistic regression, associations with lack of hypertension control included: older age (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.64 for 60–69 years compared with age 40–50 years), higher alcohol use (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.64, for consuming >30 units per week compared with none), black ethnicity (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.82 compared with white), obesity (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.76 compared with normal body mass index). The strongest positive association with control was having ≥3 comorbidities (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.23). Comorbidities associated with control included cardiovascular disease (OR 2.11, 95% CI 2.04 to 2.19), migraines (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.81), diabetes (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.36) and depression (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.34). CONCLUSIONS: In one of the largest population-based analyses of middle-aged adults with measured blood pressure, the majority of treated hypertensives were uncontrolled. Risk factors for hypertension were associated with a lower probability of control. Having a comorbidity was associated with higher probability of control, possibly due to more frequent interaction with the healthcare system and/or appropriate management of those at greater cardiovascular risk.","Tapela, Neo; Collister, Jennifer; Clifton, Lei; Turnbull, Iain; Rahimi, Kazem; Hunter, David J",Open Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707223/; https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2020-001461,238
630624,COVID‐19: a major cause of cachexia and sarcopenia?,2020-06-09,"In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible—or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.","Wang, Minjin; Zhou, Yanbing; Zong, Zhiyong; Liang, Zongan; Cao, Yu; Tang, Hong; Song, Bin; Huang, Zixing; Kang, Yan; Feng, Ping; Ying, Binwu; Li, Weimin",Precis Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330209/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa002,238

This study sought to analyze the efficacy of JAK-inhibitors to ameliorate the outcomes of Covid-19 sufferer. Research design and methods: Using specific keywords, we comprehensively go through the potential articles on ClinicalTrials.gov, Europe PMC, and PubMed sources until June 2(nd), 2021. All published studies on JAK-inhibitors and Covid-19 were collected. RESULTS: There were 14 studies with 4,363 Covid-19 patients contained in the meta-analysis.

631496,Von Willebrand factor: A key glycoprotein involved in thrombo-inflammatory complications of COVID-19,2021-10-01,"The traditional cable-based geophone network is an inefficient way of seismic data transmission owing to the related cost and weight. The future of oil and gas exploration technology demands large-scale seismic acquisition, versatility, flexibility, scalability, and automation. On the one hand, a typical seismic survey can pile up a massive amount of raw seismic data per day. On the other hand, the need for wireless seismic data transmission remains immense. Moving from pre-wired to wireless geophones faces major challenges given the enormous amount of data that needs to be transmitted from geophones to the on-site data collection center. The most important factor that has been ignored in the previous studies for the realization of wireless seismic data transmission is wireless channel effects. While transmitting the seismic data wirelessly, impairments like interference, multi-path fading, and channel noise need to be considered. Therefore, in this work, a novel amalgamation of blind channel identification and deep neural networks is proposed. As a geophone already is responsible for transmitting a tremendous amount of data under tight timing constraints, the proposed setup eschews sending any additional training signals for the purpose of mitigating the channel effects. Note that the deep neural network is trained only on synthetic seismic data without the need to use real data in the training process. Experiments show that the proposed method gives promising results when applied to the real/field data set.","Iqbal, Naveed; Lawal, Abdulmajid; Zerguine, Azzedine",Sensors,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577311/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186105,238

Thus, it has become rather likely that one will find a homolog with known 3D structure when searching a sequence database with an arbitrary query sequence. Depending on the extent of similarity, such neighbor relationships may allow one to infer biological function and to identify functional sites such as binding motifs or catalytic centers. Entrez's 3D-structure database, the Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), provides easy access to the richness of 3D structure data and its large potential for functional annotation. Entrez's search engine offers several tools to assist biologist users: (i) links between databases, such as between protein sequences and structures, (ii) pre-computed sequence and structure neighbors, (iii) visualization of structure and sequence/structure alignment. Here, we describe an annotation service that combines some of these tools automatically, Entrez's ‘Related Structure’ links. For all proteins in Entrez, similar sequences with known 3D structure are detected by BLAST and alignments are recorded.

The morbidity is increasing due to lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs. Herein, we have identified potential drugs that target the 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), the main protease that is pivotal for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Computational molecular modeling was used to screen 3987 FDA approved drugs, and 47 drugs were selected to study their inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 specific 3CLpro enzyme in vitro. Our results indicate that boceprevir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, tipranavir, ivermectin, and micafungin exhibited inhibitory effect towards 3CLpro enzymatic activity. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies showed that ivermectin may require homodimeric form of 3CLpro enzyme for its inhibitory activity. In summary, these molecules could be useful to develop highly specific therapeutically viable drugs to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication either alone or in combination with drugs specific for other SARS-CoV-2 viral targets.","Mody, Vicky; Ho, Joanna; Wills, Savannah; Mawri, Ahmed; Lawson, Latasha; Ebert, Maximilian C.

Five months into the outbreak there is an impressive number of studies reporting antibody kinetics and RNA shedding dynamics, but extensive variation in detection assays, study group demographics, and laboratory protocols has presented a challenge for inferring the true biological patterns. Here, we combine existing data on SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and RNA kinetics using a formal quantitative approach that enables integration of 3,214 data points from 516 individuals, published in 22 studies. This allows us to determine the mean values and distributions of IgG and IgM seroconversion times and titer kinetics, and to characterize how antibody and RNA detection probabilities change during the early phase of infection. We observe extensive variation in antibody response patterns and RNA detection patterns, explained by both individual heterogeneity and protocol differences such as targeted antigen and sample type. These results provide a robust reference for clinical management of individual patients, and a foundation for the mathematical models and serological surveys that underpin public health policies.","Borremans, B.; Gamble, A.; Prager, K.

We seek to contribute to the debate and facilitate informed dialogue about vaccine assessment using visualization, as able to support both deliberation by technical committees about the substance of evaluation and communication of the underlying rationale to non-experts. METHODS: We present two visualizations, an Individual Risk Plot (IRP), and a Population Impact Plot (PIP), both showing the beneficiary population on one axis and the degree of individual benefit and cost of an individual dose on the second axis. We sketch out such graphs for 10 vaccines belonging to the UK routine childhood immunization schedule and present our own analysis for the rotavirus and meningitis B vaccines. RESULTS: While the IRPs help classify diseases by morbidity and mortality, the PIPs display the health and economic loss averted after introducing a vaccine, allowing further comparisons.

In response to the pandemic, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health (D-HH) and its Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) closed non-essential in-person services on March 17, 2020 and began reopening on April 27, 2020. We examined outpatient telehealth utilization at D-HH and NCCC in the peri-pandemic period and compared utilization to the Academic Medical Center (AMC) overall and to other service lines. Methods: Weekly outpatient volumes, percentage telehealth, percentage video versus audio-only, and percentage of new patients were examined for D-HH, for the AMC, and for selected AMC-based service lines from January 1 to October 31, 2020. Results: Compared with the AMC overall and with five other primarily non-surgical specialties, oncology was lower in the (1) proportion of outpatient visits performed via telehealth (example week 7/12/20: oncology = 11%; AMC = 21%; mean of 5 other specialties = 38%) and (2) percentage of telehealth involving video versus audio-only (7/12/20: oncology = 19%; AMC = 58%; mean of 5 others = 60%). Oncology more closely resembled the surgical specialty of orthopedics (7/12/20: 2% telehealth; 10% of telehealth involved video). Oncology also demonstrated (1) a high proportion of outpatient visits involving procedures (oncology = 22%; orthopedics = 12%) and (2) no difference between telehealth and in-person visits in terms of the percentage involving new patients. Conclusions: During the peri-pandemic period, our oncology service demonstrated a lower than average incorporation of telehealth overall into their outpatient practice and a lower proportion of telehealth performed by video. Further understanding these results and the drivers behind them will be integral for redesigning outpatient oncology care with optimal integration of telehealth.","Curtis, Kevin; Alford-Teaster, Jennifer; Lowry, Mary; Mackwood, Matthew; Snide, Jennifer; Tosteson, Tor; Tosteson, Anna",Telemed. j. e. health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287089/; https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0556,238

And its immunomodulatory therapy,2020-06-15,"Background: Access to health services and adequate care is influenced by sex, ethnicity, socio-economic position (SEP) and burden of co-morbidities. However, it is unknown whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. Methods: Participants were from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2001, 1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). A web and telephone-based survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received during the UK COVID-19 national lockdown. Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study-design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, keyworker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts and meta-regression evaluated the effect of age as a moderator. Findings: 14891 participants were included. Females (OR 1.40, 95% confidence interval [1.27,1.55]) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84 [1.65-2.05]) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR approx. 2.00, all p<0.002). Age was not independently associated with either outcome in meta-regression. SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Interpretation: The UK government's lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly females, ethnic-minorities and those with chronic illnesses. Public health authorities need to implement urgent policies to ensure equitable access to health and care for all in preparation for a second wave.","Topriceanu, C.-C.; Wong, A.; Moon, J.

This study assessed administrator and resident perceptions of rule implementation during its initial year in the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA). Assessment included nine focus groups (n = 69) with residents and in-depth interviews with administrators (n = 7) and residents (n = 26) from 14 DCHA communities (family = 7 and senior/disabled = 7). Semi-structured discussion guides based on the multi-level socio-ecological framework captured dialogue that was recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded inductively. Emerging major themes for each socio-ecological framework level included: (1) Individual: the rule was supported due to perceived health benefits, with stronger support among non-smokers; (2) Interpersonal: limiting secondhand smoke exposure was perceived as a positive for vulnerable residents; (3) Organizational: communication, signage, and cessation support was perceived as a need; (4) Community: residents perceived mobility, disability, weather, and safety-related issues as barriers; and (5) Public Policy: lease amendments were perceived as enablers of rule implementation but expressed confusion about violations and enforcement. A majority of administrators and residents reported favorable implications of the mandated HUD rule. The novel application of a socio-ecological framework, however, detected implementation nuances that required improvements on multiple levels, including more signage, cessation support, clarification of enforcement roles, and addressing safety concerns.","Horn, Kimberly; Johnson, Sallie Beth; Patiño, Sofía Rincón-Gallardo; Krost, Kevin; Gray, Tiffany; Dearfield, Craig; Du, Chenguang; Bernat, Debra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501498/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178908,238

SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell and assembles a multisubunit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex of viral nonstructural proteins that plays a substantial role in the transcription and replication of the viral genome. Therefore, RdRp is among the most suitable targets in RNA viruses. Our aim was to investigate the FDA approved antiviral drugs having potential to inhibit the viral replication. The methodology adopted was virtual screening and docking of FDA-approved antiviral drugs into the RdRp protein. Top hits were selected and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to understand the dynamics of RdRp in complex with these drugs. The antiviral activity of the drugs against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells. Notably, both remdesivir (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) 6.6 μM, 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC(50)) > 100 µM, selectivity index (SI) = 15) and ledipasvir (EC50 34.6 μM, CC(50) > 100 µM, SI > 2.9) exerted antiviral action.

Several studies have shown the efficacy of masks at curbing droplet dispersion in lab settings. Using individual response data from the Imperial College London-YouGov personal measures survey, this study investigates reported mask use and its association with the spread of COVID-19. Methods We examine the association of reported mask-wearing in a population within a country with the growth rate of active cases COVID-19 cases. The analysis uses country-wide data from weekly surveys of individuals mask-wearing behavior in public places, as well as other concurrently implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions, mobility changes, new cases of COVID-19 data and other control variables. The mask-wearing data were obtained from the Imperial College-YouGov multi-country survey of peoples personal habits before and during COVID-19. Because mask-wearing showed substantial variation across countries and over time, we use a reduced form econometric model to relate population-wide changes in mask-wearing to the growth rate in COVID-19. Results The results indicate that reported mask-wearing could play an important role in mitigating the growth of COVID-19. Widespread mask-wearing within a country associates with an expected 7% (95% CI: 3.94%-9.99%) decline in the growth rate of daily active cases of COVID-19 in the country. This daily decline equates to an expected 88.5% drop in the growth of daily active cases over a 30-day period when compared to zero percent mask-wearing, all else held equal. The decline in daily growth rate due to the combined effect of reported mask-wearing, reduced social mobility, and non-pharmaceutical interventions averages 28.1% (95% CI: 24.2%-32%). These estimates remain robust across multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Face mask usage as a preventative measure against the transmission of COVID-19 varies widely across countries. This observational study uses data from 24 countries and finds that reported face mask usage associates with a decline in new COVID-19 cases. Even though the model controls for a large variety of variables that affect spread, and we run a number of robustness checks, it remains possible that some of the decline associated with face masks is related to confounding variables not included in the model. In summary, due to the confounding variables and the variations in the type of mask and its usage, randomized control trials of mask usage in populations are needed to determine the true effect of mask wearing on mitigating the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases.","Aravindakshan, A.; Boehnke, J.; Gholami, E.; Nayak, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.11.20192971v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.20192971,238

Cells expressing Ia antigen were of a perivascular type and parenchymal ramified microglia. In the first few weeks after nerve lesions we observed a gradual increase in the number of Ia-immunoreactive cells starting with an initial appearance of Ia-positive perivascular cells which were succeeded by increasing numbers of Ia-positive ramified microglia. In long-term animals Ia expression was almost exclusively found in microglia. We propose (a) the existence of a population of immunocompetent perivascular cells normally present in adult rat brain that can be stimulated to express Ia antigen, and (b) the existence of a subpopulation of ramified microglia that arises through transformation of Ia-positive perivascular cells in the adult under pathological conditions.","Streit, Wolfgang J.; Graeber, Manuel B.; Kreutzberg, Georg W.",Experimental Neurology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0014488689901118; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014488689901118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2753113/,238

638210,COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines has the potential to induce nasal neutralizing antibodies,2021,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 has the respiratory tract as the main target of infection, and patients present mainly dyspnea, pneumonia, dry cough, and fever. Nevertheless, organs outside the respiratory tract had been reported in recent studies, including the gastrointestinal tract and liver. The host innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through their pattern recognition receptor (PRRs). Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) is a pattern recognition receptor recognizing ssRNA (SARS-CoV-2 is an ssRNA). Polymorphisms are characterized by two or more alternative forms of a distinct phenotype in the same population. Polymorphisms in tlrs genes can negatively influence the immune response to infectious diseases. There are several references in the literature to non-synonymous single nucleotide (rs) polymorphisms related to several genes. Some of them are important for the innate immunity, as rs 179008 (tlr-7), rs3775291 (tlr3), rs8177374 (tir domain-containing adaptor protein, tirap), rs1024611 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, mcp-1) and rs61942233 (2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthase-3, oas-3). CASE PRESENTATION: We identified a 5-year-old-male child with gastrointestinal symptoms and fever presenting acholic stool and jaundice, who was positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA, and IgG and presenting the Gln11Leu rs 179008 in tlr-7. The child presented high levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, gamma-glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and was negative for serological tests for hepatitis A, B, C, E, HIV 1 and 2, herpes virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and negative for RTqPCR for Influenza A and B, RSV and SARS-CoV-2. We also investigated other SNPs in the tlr-3 (rs3775291), tirap (rs8177374), mcp-1 (rs1024611), and oas-3 (rs61942233) genes, and no mutation was detected. After an interview with the child's caregivers, any possible accidental ingestion of drugs or hepatotoxic substances was ruled out. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of a SARS-CoV-2 caused hepatitis in a male child that has the tlr-7 Gln11Leu rs 179008, which could impair an efficient initial immune response. The knowledge of the patient's immune deficiency could improve the treatment to correct this deficiency with specific medications.","Pessoa, Natália Lima; Bentes, Aline Almeida; de Carvalho, Andrea Lucchesi; de Souza Silva, Thaís Bárbara; Alves, Pedro Augusto; de Sousa Reis, Erik Vinicius; Rodrigues, Tayse Andrade; Kroon, Erna Geessien; Campos, Marco Antônio",Virol J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01656-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482844/,238

Imaging findings include ground-glass opacities and patchy consolidation on CT scan. Mortality is higher in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and COPD. Elderly patients are more susceptible to severe disease and death, while children seem to have lower rates of infection and lower mortality. Diagnostic criteria and the identification of persons under investigation have evolved as more data has emerged. However, the approach to diagnosis is still very variable from region to region, country to country, and even among different hospitals in the same city. The importance of a clinical pathway to implement the most effective and relevant diagnostic strategy is of critical importance to establish the control of this virus that is responsible for more and more deaths each day.","Xu, Guogang; Yang, Yongshi; Du, Yingzhen; Peng, Fujun; Hu, Peng; Wang, Runsheng; Yin, Ming; Li, Tianzhi; Tu, Lei; Sun, Jinlyu; Jiang, Taijiao; Chang, Christopher",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328954/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-020-08792-8,238

Methods A cross-sectional representative sample of 485 US residents was collected in mid-April 2020. Participants were asked about (a) perceptions of COVID-19 risk, (b) demographic factors known to be associated with increased COVID-19 risk, and (c) the impact of COVID-19 on different life domains. We used a three-step hierarchical linear regression model to assess the differential contribution of the factors listed above on perceived COVID-19 risk. Results The final model accounted for 16% of variability in perceived risk, F(18,458) = 4.8, p < .001. Participants who were White reported twice as much perceived risk as participants of color (B = −2.1, 95% CI[−3.4,-0.8]. Higher perceived risk was observed among those who reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their sleep (B = 1.5, 95% CI[0.8,2.1]) or work (B = 0.7, 95%CI[0.1,1.3]). The number of cases per capita in their state of residence, age, or proximity to someone with a COVID-19 diagnosis were not found to meaningfully predict perceived risk. Conclusions Perceived risk was not found to be associated with known demographic risk factors, except that the effect of race/ethnicity was in the opposite direction of existing evidence. Perception of COVID-19 risk was associated with the perceived personal impact of the pandemic.","Seehuus, Martin; Stanton, Amelia M.; Handy, Ariel B.; Haik, Amanda K.; Gorman, Rebecca; Clifton, Jessica",J Psychosom Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110299; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022399920308618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33242704/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399920308618?v=s5,238

639998,Are Serum Interleukin 6 and Surfactant Protein D Levels Associated with the Clinical Course of COVID-19?,2020-09-12,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major public health emergency with obvious characteristics of human-to-human transmission, and there are infective asymptomatic carriers. Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important. Features in chest computed tomography (CT) can facilitate identifying newly infected individuals. However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case. CASE SUMMARY: A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization. She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 × 10(9)/L and 1.04 × 10(9)/L, respectively. CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture. On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated. On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Differential diagnosis of lung contusion and COVID-19 must be emphasized. Both conditions require effective prompt actions, especially COVID-19.","Chen, Li-Ru; Chen, Zheng-Xin; Liu, Yang-Chun; Peng, Lei; Zhang, Ye; Xu, Quan; Lin, Qing; Tao, Yun-Ming; Wu, Hao; Yin, Sui; Hu, Ye-Ji",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368550/; https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i8.1554,238
640593,Undetectable viral load within the mastoid during cochlear implantation in a patient with COVID-19,2021-03-02,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main cause of bacterial pneumonia, a condition that currently produces significant global morbidity and mortality. The initial immune response to this bacterium occurs when the innate system recognizes common motifs expressed by many pathogens, events driven by pattern recognition receptors like the Toll-like family receptors (TLRs). In this study, lung myeloid-cell populations responsible for the innate immune response (IIR) against S. pneumoniae, and their dependence on the TLR4-signaling axis, were analyzed in TLR4(–/–) and Myeloid-Differentiation factor-88 deficient (MyD88(–/–)) mice. Neutrophils and monocyte-derived cells were recruited in infected mice 3-days post-infection. Compared to wild-type mice, there was an increased bacterial load in both these deficient mouse strains and an altered IIR, although TLR4(–/–) mice were more susceptible to bacterial infection. These mice also developed fewer alveolar macrophages, weaker neutrophil infiltration, less Ly6C(high) monocyte differentiation and a disrupted classical and non-classical monocyte profile. The pro-inflammatory cytokine profile (CXCL1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) was also severely affected by the lack of TLR4 and no induction of Th1 was observed in these mice. The respiratory burst (ROS production) after infection was profoundly dampened in TLR4(–/–) and MyD88(–/–) mice. These data demonstrate the complex dynamics of myeloid populations and a key role of the TLR4-signaling axis in the IIR to S. pneumoniae, which involves both the MyD88 and TRIF (Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β) dependent pathways.","Sánchez-Tarjuelo, Rodrigo; Cortegano, Isabel; Manosalva, Juliana; Rodríguez, Mercedes; Ruíz, Carolina; Alía, Mario; Prado, María Carmen; Cano, Eva M.; Ferrándiz, María José; de la Campa, Adela G.; Gaspar, María Luisa; de Andrés, Belén",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.02120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042124/,238

This study was carried out on 293 patients with COVID‐19, who were hospitalized at Imam Hassan hospital (Bojnourd, Iran). We collected demographic data, clinical characteristics, values of serum biochemical parameters in the first week of admission, and clinical outcomes from electronic medical records. We also measured serum levels of zinc, 25(OH)D, and vitamin B12 within 3 days of admission. Of the 293 hospitalized, the median age was 53 years, and 147 (50.17%) were female. Thirty‐seven patients (12.62%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and forty‐two (14.32%) died. We found that the serum levels of zinc, vitamin B12, and 25(OH)D were lower in patients who died than those who were admitted to ICU or non‐ICU and survived; however, these differences were not statistically significant for vitamin B12 and 25(OH)D (p > 0.05). The serum concentrations of zinc, vitamin B12, and 25(OH)D at the time of admission did not affect the length of hospital stay in patients with COVID‐19. In general, it seems that serum levels of 25(OH)D, vitamin B12, and especially zinc at the time of admission can affect clinical outcomes in COVID‐19 patients.","Shakeri, Habibesadat; Azimian, Amir; Ghasemzadeh‐Moghaddam, Hamed; Safdari, Mohammadreza; Haresabadi, Mehdi; Daneshmand, Tahereh; Namdar Ahmadabad, Hasan",J Med Virol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406674/,238

641687,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Parkinson's Disease: A Tale of Fears and Sorrows!,2021-04-06,"BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in influenza vaccination among underserved minority older adults are a public health problem. Understanding the factors that impact influenza vaccination behaviors among underserved older African-Americans could lead to more effective communication and delivery strategies. AIMS: We aimed to investigate rate and factors associated with seasonal influenza vaccination among underserved African-American older adults. We were particularly interested in the roles of demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and continuity and patient satisfaction with medical care, as well as physical and mental health status. METHODS: This community-based cross-sectional study recruited 620 African-American older adults residing in South Los Angeles, one of the most under-resources areas within Los Angeles County, with a population of over one million. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to document independent correlates of influenza vaccination. RESULTS: One out of three underserved African-American older adults aged 65 years and older residing in South Los Angeles had never been vaccinated against the influenza. Only 49% of participants reported being vaccinated within the 12 months prior to the interview. One out of five participants admitted that their health care provider recommended influenza vaccination. However, only 45% followed their provider's recommendations. Multivariate logistic regression shows that old-old (≥75 years), participants who lived alone, those with a lower level of continuity of care and satisfaction with the accessibility, availability, and quality of care, and participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. As expected, participants who indicated that their physician had advised them to obtain a flu vaccination were more likely to be vaccinated. Our data shows that only gender was associated with self-report of being advised to have a flu shot. Discussion. One of the most striking aspects of this study is that no association between influenza vaccination and being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other major chronic condition was detected. Our study confirmed that both continuity of care and satisfaction with access, availability, and quality of medical care are strongly associated with current influenza vaccinations. We documented that participants with a higher number of depression symptoms were less likely to be vaccinated. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the role that culturally acceptable and accessible usual source of care van play as a gatekeeper to facilitate and implement flu vaccination among underserved minority older adults. Consistent disparities in influenza vaccine uptake among underserved African-American older adults, coupled with a disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, places them at high risk for undesired outcomes associated with influenza. As depression is more chronic/disabling and is less likely to be treated in African-Americans, there is a need to screen and treat depression as a strategy to enhance preventive care management such as vaccination of underserved African-American older adults. Quantification of associations between lower vaccine uptake and both depression symptoms as well as living alone should enable health professionals target underserved African-American older adults who are isolated and suffer from depression to reduce vaccine-related inequalities.","Bazargan, Mohsen; Wisseh, Cheryl; Adinkrah, Edward; Ameli, Hoorolnesa; Santana, Delia; Cobb, Sharon; Assari, Shervin",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2160894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224975/,238

The goal is to develop a more harmonized approach to data, with potential to improve clinical trial conduct through enhanced data quality collected at reduced cost and inconvenience for patients. On completion of the original LY.12 randomized clinical trial in lymphoma (NCT00078949), participants were invited to enrol in the Long-term Innovative Follow-up Extension (LIFE) component. Those consenting to do so provided comprehensive identifying information to facilitate linkage with their administrative data. We prospectively designed a global assessment of this innovative approach to clinical trial follow-up including rates of REB approval and patient consent. The pre-specified benchmark for patient acceptability was 80%. Of 16 REBs who reviewed the research protocol, 14 (89%) provided approval; two in Quebec declined due to small patient numbers. Of 140 patients invited to participate, 115 (82%, 95% CI 76 to 88%) from across 9 Canadian provinces provided consent and their full name, date of birth, health insurance number and postal code to facilitate linkage with their administrative data for long-term follow-up. Linkage of clinical trial and administrative data is feasible and acceptable. Further collaborative work including many stakeholders is required to develop an optimized secure approach to research. A more coordinated national approach to health data could facilitate more rapid testing and identification of new effective treatments across multiple jurisdictions and diseases from diabetes to COVID-19.","Hay, Annette E; Mittmann, Nicole; Crump, Michael; Cheung, Matthew C; Sleeth, Jessica; Needham, Judy; Broekhoven, Mike; Djurfeldt, Marina; Shepherd, Lois E; Meyer, Ralph M; Chen, Bingshu E; Pater, Joseph L",Curr Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol28020111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33800281/,238

This is the first case-control study to assess balance objectively and quantitatively in Covid-19 disease. Methods: Thirty-seven patients who recovered from Covid-19 disease and 30 healthy controls were compared using Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP), Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials(VEMP) and Video Head Impulse Test (v-HIT). Results: On CDP, the composite and visual general scores of the patients were significantly lower than controls (p<0.01). The v-HIT gains of the patients significantly decreased in the vertical semicircular canals compared to controls (p<0.01).There was a significant difference between the patients and controls regarding the absence of o-VEMPs (p<0.01) while the amplitudes and latencies were similar between the groups (p>0.05). Decreased P1/N1 amplitudes and elongated N1 latencies were found on c-VEMP testing (p<0.05). Anosmia, taste disorder and gender were not associated with subjective and objective test results (p>0.05). Conclusion: The Covid-19 disease can cause dizziness rather that incapacitating vertigo. Dizziness can be seen in almost one-fifth of the adult covid19 out-patients, which may be due to involvement of vestibular and visual systems,ortheir central connections. The squeals created in the balance related systems may be irreversible as they have persisted after the recovery of the patients. It is also plausible to anticipate more severe condition in the older patients who were treated in the intensive care units.

The target population was individuals aged 21 years or older living in the State of Kuwait. The study included 679 respondents; 57.9% were females, and 67.7% were Kuwaiti nationals. Both genders reported an increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, and carbohydrates, and a decreased consumption of fish and sugary drinks. Compared to males, females reported eating more during the outbreak than their pre-pandemic eating behaviors (32.3% vs. 35.9%, p < 0.05). Approximately one-third of respondents (33.1%) reported performing less than 30 min of physical activity or exercise in a week, and 36.4% of respondents rated their quality of sleep as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’.

Governments across the globe have been implementing preventive measures towards curbing the spread and impact of the virus. These measures have continued to interfere with the general lifestyle of the people. Hence, this study was aimed at examining the socio-demographic predictors of adherence to prescribed recommendations and the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown among Nigerian social media users. Methods: This research implemented a cross-sectional survey using an online Google-based questionnaire to elicit required information from potential respondents via social media channels such as WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram and Facebook. An external link to the questionnaire was shared among Nigerian social media users between 1(st) and 31(st) April 2020, and a total of 1,131 respondents participated in the survey. The explanatory and outcome variables were displayed by frequency and percentage distribution while chi-square analysis was used to show the relationship between the explanatory and outcome variables at 5% level of significant. Results: The study showed that 99% of the respondents reported to have been following some of the prescribed recommendations, however, only 40.4% of the respondents followed all the recommendations. More than three fifths (63.4%) of the respondents also reported having experienced stressed during the lockdown. Only respondents’ professional background (p<0.05) was a predictor of psychological impact of lockdown, other selected socio-demographic characteristics were not predictors of the outcome variables as p>0.05 Conclusion: We concluded that majority of Nigerian social media users were complying to the prescribed recommendations and that younger age group, female respondents and respondents who are more educated had higher proportion of psychological impacts of lockdown, while the medical/scientific background is the only socio-demographic predictor of psychological impacts of COVID-19 lockdown.","Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi; Olagunju, Olalekan; Babalola, Tesleem; Saeed, Balsam Qubais",J Public Health Res,https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2020.1864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282791/,238

METHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter survey of PED medical director(s) from selected children’s hospitals recruited through a long established national research network. The questionnaire was developed by physicians with expertise in pediatric emergency medicine, disaster readiness, human factors, and survey development. Thirty-five children’s hospitals were identified for recruitment through an established national research network. RESULTS: We report on survey responses from 25 (71%) of 35 PEDs, of which 64% were located within academic children's hospitals. All PEDs witnessed decreases in non–COVID-19 patients, 60% had COVID-19–dedicated units, and 32% changed their unit pediatric patient age to include adult patients. All PEDs implemented changes to their staffing model, with the most common change impacting their physician staffing (80%) and triaging model (76%). All PEDs conducted training for appropriate donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), and 62% reported shortages in PPE. The majority implemented changes in the airway management protocols (84%) and cardiac arrest management in COVID patients (76%). The most common training modalities were video/teleconference (84%) and simulation-based training (72%). The most common learning objectives were team dynamics (60%), and PPE and individual procedural skills (56%). CONCLUSIONS: This national survey provides insight into PED preparedness efforts, training innovations, and practice changes implemented during the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric emergency departments implemented broad strategies including modifications to staffing, workflow, and clinical practice while using video/teleconference and simulation as preferred training modalities. Further research is needed to advance the level of preparedness and support deep learning about which preparedness actions were effective for future pandemics.","Auerbach, Marc A.; Abulebda, Kamal; Bona, Anna Mary; Falvo, Lauren; Hughes, Patrick G.; Wagner, Michael; Barach, Paul R.; Ahmed, Rami A.",Pediatr Emerg Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394945/; https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002307,238

In this study, the urological interventions applied with appropriate infrastructure and protocols during the pandemic in the pandemic hospital that is carrying out the COVID-19 struggle are analyzed. METHODS: Urological interventions were reviewed in the 5-week period between March 11 and April 16. The distribution of outpatient and interventional procedures was determined by weeks concurrently along with the COVID-19 patient workload, and data in the country, subgroups were further analyzed. Patients intervened were divided into four groups as Emergency, High, Intermediate, and Low Priority cases according to the EAU recommendations. The COVID-19-related findings were recorded; staff and patient effects were reported. RESULTS: Of the 160 interventions, 65 were minimally invasive or open surgical intervention, 95 were non-surgical outpatient intervention, and the outpatient admission was 777. According to the priority level, 33 cases had emergency and high priority, 32 intermediate and low priority. COVID-19 quarantine and follow-up were performed at least 1 week in 22 (33.8%) operated patients at the last week, 43 (66.2%) patients who were operated in the previous 4 weeks followed up at least 2 weeks.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with SARS-COV2 between March-1-2020 and January-31-2021 to identify the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by smoking status. RESULTS: We identified 10216 SARS-COV2-positive patients with complete documentation of smoking habits. Within 14 days of a SARS-COV2 positive test, 1150 (11.2%) patients were admitted and 188 (1.8%) died. Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized from COVID-19 than current or never smokers (21.2% former smokers; 7.3% current smokers; 10.4% never smokers, p<0.0001). In univariable analysis, former smokers had higher odds of hospitalization from COVID-19 than never smokers (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.94-2.74). This association remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age, race and gender (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.06-1.55), but became non-significant when analysis included Body Mass Index, previous hospitalization and number of comorbidities (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.86-1.29). In contrast, current smokers were less likely than never smokers to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized and died from COVID-19 than current or never smokers. This effect is mediated via age and comorbidities in former smokers.","Puebla Neira, Daniel; Watts, Abigail; Seashore, Justin; Polychronopoulou, Efstathia; Kuo, Yong-Fang; Sharma, Gulshan",Respir Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611121001207?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915414/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106414; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611121001207,238
644907,Excessive waitlists and delays to treatment with low-dose-rate brachytherapy predict an increased risk of recurrence and metastases in intermediate-risk prostatic carcinoma,2021-07-01,"Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the common infections in hospitalized patients. Early and prompt diagnosis of HAP is important because it aids in the appropriate selection of antibiotics and decreases the mortality and morbidity of patients. The investigation on serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels in pediatric patients is limited. Herein we aimed to evaluate the role of PCT in the early diagnosis of children with bacterial HAP. The study enrolled 264 children (< 14 years old) who were radiographically detected by pulmonary condensation chest X-rays. The HAP patients were stratified by patterns of microbiological detection of pathogens. Baseline white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil proportion, PCT, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on admission. The laboratory findings and microbiological findings were analyzed and compared among groups. The median PCT concentration of patients with typical bacterial pathogens (3.95 ± 3.75 ng/mL) was significantly higher than the one of the patients with other pathogen types (median lower than 1.20 ng/mL). Correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation between PCT concentrations and the main inflammation makers including WBC count, neutrophil proportion, and CRP. PCT level was significantly decreased to 0.86 ± 1.46 ng/mL in post-treatment patients (p < 0.001). This cohort study with 264 pediatric HAP patients demonstrated the reliability of PCT level as a biomarker in patients with typical bacterial pathogens. Specifically, PCT cutoffs of 2 ng/mL accurately identified HAP children with typical bacterial pathogens. This finding suggested that PCT may serve as a reliable biomarker for the early diagnosis and treatment indicator of children with HAP.","Wang, Wenlong; Zhu, Yitang; Yin, Linlin; Deng, Yaoyao; Chu, Guoxian; Liu, Supin",Mol Cell Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-020-03902-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32990893/,238

Twenty-four conventional 5-day-old suckling piglets were randomly divided into four groups and were inoculated orally, intranasally (I.N.), intramuscularly (I.M.) with PEDV or DMEM (mock). Pigs were monitored daily for clinical signs and fecal viral load. Blood samples were collected at 7, 14, 21 days post infection (dpi) and subjected for the analyses of serum antibody production, T cell and natural killer (NK) cell frequencies, NK cytotoxicity and serum cytokine levels. Oral inoculation led to higher levels of PEDV-specific IgA antibodies in both serum and gut mucosal sites than did other routes of inoculation. Intranasal inoculation elicited significantly higher titers of virus-specific IgG antibodies in serum. PEDV-infected pigs regardless of inoculation routes had significantly lower NK cell frequencies than those of the control pigs at 14 dpi. The orally inoculated pigs had significantly higher CD3+CD8+ T cell frequencies as compared to I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs at 14 dpi, while there was no significant difference among orally, I.N. or I.M. inoculated pigs and control pigs in CD3+CD4+ T cell frequencies in peripheral blood. PEDV-infected and control pigs had low, but detectable NK cell activities at 14 and 21 dpi, however, NK cell activities were barely detectable at 7 dpi whether the pigs were infected or not. Serum IL-10 levels were induced drastically in orally infected pigs at 7 dpi and then gradually declined. Serum IL-12 levels followed a similar pattern while the fold-change was much lower. In conclusion, oral inoculation may generate more comprehensive immune responses.","Zhou, Yingshan; Chen, Cong; Chen, Yunlu; Liu, Ziqi; Zheng, Jingyou; Wang, Tingjun; Luo, Hao; Liu, Yajie; Shan, Ying; Fang, Weihuan; Li, Xiaoliang",Veterinary Microbiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113518310228; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593385/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2018.11.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113518310228,238

Disease threats to wild snow leopards have not been investigated.Methods and Results: Between 2008 and 2015, twenty snow leopards in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia were captured and immobilised for health screening and radio-collaring. Blood samples and external parasites were collected for pathogen analyses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), microscopic agglutination test (MAT), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. The animals showed no clinical signs of disease, however, serum antibodies to significant zoonotic pathogens were detected. These pathogens included, Coxiella burnetii, (25% prevalence), Leptospira spp., (20%), and Toxoplasma gondii (20%). Ticks collected from snow leopards contained potentially zoonotic bacteria from the genera Bacillus, Bacteroides, Campylobacter, Coxiella, Rickettsia, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.Conclusions: The zoonotic pathogens identified in this study, in the short-term did not appear to cause illness in the snow leopards, but have caused illness in other wild felids. Therefore, surveillance for pathogens should be implemented to monitor for potential longer- term disease impacts on this snow leopard population.","Esson, Carol; Skerratt, Lee F.; Berger, Lee; Malmsten, Jonas; Strand, Tanja; Lundkvist, Åke; Järhult, Josef D.; Michaux, Johan; Mijiddorj, Tserennadmid Nadia; Bayrakçısmith, Rana; Mishra, Charudutt; Johansson, Örjan",Infect Ecol Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2019.1604063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31231481/,238

We formulate a modified susceptible exposed infectious recovered compartmental model considering asymptomatic individuals. Rapid testing is intended to trace the existence of asymptomatic infected individuals among the population. This asymptomatic class is categorized into two subclasses: detected and undetected asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, the model considers the limitations of medical resources to treat an infected individual in a hospital. The model shows two types of equilibrium point: COVID-19 free and COVID-19 endemic. The COVID-19-free equilibrium point is locally and asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is less than unity. In contrast, COVID-19-endemic equilibrium always exists when [Formula: see text]. The model can also show a backward bifurcation at [Formula: see text] whenever the treatment saturation parameter, which describes the hospital capacity, is larger than a specific threshold. To justify the model parameters, we use the incidence data from the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. The data pertain to infected individuals who self-isolate in their homes and visit the hospital for further treatment. Our numerical experiments indicate that strict social distancing has the potential to succeed in reducing and delaying the time of an outbreak. However, if the strict social distancing policy is relaxed, a massive rapid-test intervention should be conducted to avoid a large-scale outbreak in the future.","Aldila, Dipo; Khoshnaw, Sarbaz H.A.; Safitri, Egi; Anwar, Yusril Rais; Bakry, Aanisah R.Q.; Samiadji, Brenda M.; Anugerah, Demas A.; Alfarizi GH, M.

This study describes clinical and imaging characteristics of patients with COVID-19 infection who presented with intracranial bleeding in a European multicenter cohort. Methods: This is a multicenter retrospective, observational case series including 18 consecutive patients with COVID-19 infection and intracranial hemorrhage. Data were collected from February to May 2020 at five designated European special care centers for COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Intracranial bleeding was diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) of the brain within one month of the date of COVID-19 diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic findings, therapy and outcomes in COVID-19 patients presenting with intracranial bleeding were analyzed. Results: Eighteen patients had evidence of acute intracranial bleeding within 11 days (IQR 9–29) of admission. Six patients had parenchymal hemorrhage (33.3%), 11 had subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (61.1%), and one patient had subdural hemorrhage (5.6%). Three patients presented with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (16.7%). Conclusion: This study represents the largest case series of patients with intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed with COVID-19 based on key European countries with geospatial hotspots of SARS-CoV-2.

A system dynamic model was developed to investigate interactions between household water use behaviors (toilet flushing, clothes washing, bathing/showering, and cleaning) and associated greenhouse gas emissions and environmental costs. Six hundred and fifty face-to-face interviews were conducted in 12 districts of Taipei. The results showed that the respondents’ individual attributes were not significantly related to water use behaviors. The highest volume of water was used for cleaning (27.7 %), followed by clothes washing (26.2 %), bathing/showering (26.1 %), and toilet flushing (20.0 %). Five water management scenarios with 5 %–20 % reductions in water volume from different water use behaviors were simulated. The maximum reduction in water use (6.27 t) was found in the fifth scenario (20 % reduction), which reflected the priority the respondents gave to save water if its price increased. 27.2 % of respondents had water saving appliances; 20.5 % and 16.4 % of the appliances were toilets and shower heads, respectively. The environmental cost of GHG emissions associated with water use behavior was US$0.001/t, causing an 8% increase in water price. A better understanding of household water use behaviors is needed to develop bottom-up strategies or measures for sustainable water management.

Using the framework, we were able to generate various types of online CCS learning sessions for implementation in a short period of time due to the recent Covid-19 pandemic. Importantly we learnt a few lessons post-implementation from both students and faculty perspective that will be used for planning and delivery of future sessions. In summary, the framework was useful for creating or redesigning CCS sessions which were disrupted during the pandemic, however post-implementation experience suggests the framework can also be used for future solutions in online CCS learning as healthcare systems and delivery are increasingly decentralised and widely distributed.","Nadarajah, Vishna Devi; Sow, Chew Fei; Syed Aznal, Sharifah Sulaiha; Montagu, Adam; Boursicot, Katharine; Er, Hui Meng",J Med Educ Curric Dev,https://doi.org/10.1177/2382120520970894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283046/,238

METHODS: A retrospective study of transports for respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 was performed. All transports were by a single critical care transport team. The team was already trained in advanced mechanical ventilation, blood gas interpretation, and management of shock. Guidance from the Centers of Disease Control was followed regarding use of personal protective equipment (PPE). RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled. Average patient age was 47 (standard deviation (SD) 12) years old. Average APACHE II and SOFA scores were 10 (SD 4) and 24 (SD 7), respectively. Average transport distance and time were 18 miles (SD 9) and 25 (SD 11) minutes, respectively. Nineteen patients were intubated, 9 of whom required advanced ventilation. Two patients were transported prone. One patient experienced unintentional extubation upon transfer from the stretcher to the destination facility bed. The patient was re-intubated without event.

652096,Covid‐19 in patients with hematological and solid cancers at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in Germany,2020-09-15,"Background: Public health efforts to determine population infection rates from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been hampered by limitations in testing capabilities and the large shares of mild and asymptomatic cases. We developed a methodology that corrects observed positive test rates for non-random sampling to estimate population infection rates across U.S. states from March 31 to April 7. Methods We adapted a sample selection model that corrects for non-random testing to estimate population infection rates. The methodology compares how the observed positive case rate vary with changes in the size of the tested population, and applies this gradient to infer total population infection rates. Model identification requires that variation in testing rates be uncorrelated with changes in underlying disease prevalence. To this end, we relied on data on day-to-day changes in completed tests across U.S. states for the period March 31 to April 7, which were primarily influenced by immediate supply-side constraints. We used this methodology to construct predicted infection rates across each state over the sample period. We also assessed the sensitivity of the results to controls for state-specific daily trends in infection rates. Results The median population infection rate over the period March 31 to April 7 was 0.9% (IQR 0.64 1.77). The three states with the highest prevalence over the sample period were New York (8.5%), New Jersey (7.6%), and Louisiana (6.7%). Estimates from models that control for state-specific daily trends in infection rates were virtually identical to the baseline findings. The estimates imply a nationwide average of 12 population infections per diagnosed case. We found a negative bivariate relationship (corr. = -0.51) between total per capita state testing and the ratio of population infections per diagnosed case. Interpretation The effectiveness of the public health response to the coronavirus pandemic will depend on timely information on infection rates across different regions. With increasingly available high frequency data on COVID-19 testing, our methodology could be used to estimate population infection rates for a range of countries and subnational districts. In the United States, we found widespread undiagnosed COVID-19 infection. Expansion of rapid diagnostic and serological testing will be critical in preventing recurrent unobserved community transmission and identifying the large numbers individuals who may have some level of viral immunity.","Benatia, D.; Godefroy, R.; Lewis, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.20072942; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072942v1?rss=1,238

652238,Analysis of 4 imaging features in patients with COVID-19,2020-07-23,"Host antiviral genes are important regulators of antiviral immunity and plausible genetic determinants of immune response heterogeneity after vaccination. We genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagSNPs from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and measles virus-specific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in Caucasians and African-Americans. Genetic variants within the DDX58/RIG-I gene, including a coding polymorphism (rs3205166/Val800Val), were associated as single-SNPs (p≤0.017; although these SNPs did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/FDR) and in haplotype-level analysis, with measles-specific antibody variations in Caucasians (haplotype allele p-value=0.021; haplotype global p-value=0.076). Four DDX58 polymorphisms, in high LD, demonstrated also associations (after correction for FDR) with variations in both measles-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion in Caucasians (p≤0.001, q=0.193). Two intronic OAS1 polymorphisms, including the functional OAS1 SNP rs10774671 (p=0.003), demonstrated evidence of association with a significant allele-dose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in African-Americans. Genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of ADAR genetic variants, including a non-synonymous SNP (rs2229857/Arg384Lys; p=0.01), in regulating measles virus-specific IFN-γ Elispot responses in Caucasians (haplotype global p-value=0.017). After correction FDR, 15 single-SNP associations (11 SNPs in Caucasians and 4 SNPs in African-Americans) still remained significant at the q-value<0.20. In conclusion, our findings strongly point to genetic variants/genes, involved in antiviral sensing and antiviral control, as critical determinants, differentially modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated measles vaccine in Caucasians and African-Americans.","Haralambieva, Iana H.; Ovsyannikova, Inna G.; Umlauf, Benjamin J.; Vierkant, Robert A.; Pankratz, V.

METHODS: A comparative follow-up investigation involving 148 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was performed for a month (between April and May 2020) at Qaha Hospital to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes resulting from comorbidities. Participants were divided into two clusters based on the presence of comorbidities. Group I comprised cases with comorbidities, and Group II included subjects without comorbidity. Survival distributions were outlined for the group with comorbidities after the follow-up period. RESULTS: Fever (74.3%), headache (78.4%), cough (78.4%), sore throat (78.4%), fatigue (78.4%), and shortness of breath (86.5%) were the most prevalent symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Such patients also suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome (37.8%) and pneumonia three times more than patients without comorbidities. The survival distributions were statistically significant (chi-square = 26.06, p ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSION: Multiple comorbidities in COVID-19 patients are linked to severe clinical symptoms, disease complications, and critical disease progression. The presence of one or more comorbidities worsened the survival rate of patients.","Albadawy, Reda M.; Jadoon, Bismeen A.; Mogahed, Mysara M.; Ibrahim, Mohamed E.; Essawy, Tarek S.; Amin, Ahmed M.

These microorganisms are either naturally presents in aquatic environments, or come from fecal sources. They may stay in aquatic ecosystems for a long time before contaminating a new host. Aquatic environments are subjected to high variability of physico- chemical parameters. They include a microbial community that is more or less adapted to these environmental changes. Thus, numerous interactions occur between microorganisms, which are pathogenic or not, and most of them are still unknown. This review focused on interactions between pathogen microorganisms and their environment. More specifically we addressed the question of the diversity of the sources of contamination, their contribution to the microbiological pollution of the aquatic environment, and the ability of some pathogens to survive adverse environmental conditions.","Baudart, Julia; Paniel, Nathalie",Rev Francoph Lab,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1773035X14723627; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1773035X14723627,238

Setting Mayo Clinic, a large multistate integrated health care system with over 1.5 million annual patient visits that utilizes the Epic© electronic health record (EHR) system. Methods and Results Rule-based live registries were designed in EHR system to classify patients who 1) are currently tested positive for COVID-19; 2) were tested positive but has recovered from COVID-19; 3) are suspected of COVID-19 but did not yet meet clinical diagnostic criteria,; 4) had tested negative for COVID-19; and 5) exceeded a risk score for serious complications from COVID-19. Using registries, custom dashboards and operational reports were developed to provide daily high-level summary for clinical practice use and provide up to date information used to manage individual patients impacted by COVID-19, including support of case identification, contact isolation and other care management tasks. Conclusion we developed and implemented a systematic approach for using EHR patient registries to manage the COVID-19 pandemic that proved feasible and useful for managing a large multistate group clinical practice. The key to harnessing the potential of digital surveillance tools to promote patient-centered care during COVID-19 pandemic was to use the registry data, reports and dashboards as informatics tools to inform decision-making.","Jose, Thulasee; Warner, David O.; O’Horo, John C.; Peters, Steve G.; Chaudhry, Rajeev; Binnicker, Matthew J.; Burger, Charles D.",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33521582/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542454820302575?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542454820302575; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2020.12.004,238

While minimizing human contact is effective in managing outbreaks, it causes severe economic losses. Strategies to solve this dilemma by considering the interrelation between the spread of the virus and economic activities are urgently needed to mitigate the health and economic damage. Here, we propose an abstract agent-based model of the COVID-19 outbreak that accounts for economic activities. The computational simulation of the model recapitulates the trade-off between the health and economic damage associated with voluntary restraint measures. Based on the simulation results, we discuss how the macroscopic dynamics of infection and economics emerge from individuals’ behaviours. We believe our model can serve as a platform for discussing solutions to the above-mentioned dilemma.","Kano, Takeshi; Yasui, Kotaro; Mikami, Taishi; Asally, Munehiro; Ishiguro, Akio",Proc Math Phys Eng Sci,https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2020.0604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33633491/,238

High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID‐19 have been observed among older adults and widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID‐19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN: We obtained a representative sample of original tweets containing the keywords “elderly,” “older,” and/or “boomer” plus the hashtags “#COVID19” and/or “#coronavirus.” SETTING: Tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as (1) informative, (2) personal accounts, (3) personal opinions, (4) advice seeking, (5) jokes, and (6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID‐19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS: A total of 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Overall, 72 tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone and 21.1% had content implying that the life of older adults was less valuable or downplayed the relevance of COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Most tweets related to COVID‐19 and older adults contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost one‐quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content toward older adults.","Jimenez‐Sotomayor, Maria Renee; Gomez‐Moreno, Carolina; Soto‐Perez‐de‐Celis, Enrique",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32338787/,238

Thinking about phosphodiesterase-3 as a therapeutic target,2020-12-28,"The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes pathological pulmonary symptoms. Most efforts to develop vaccines and drugs against this virus target the spike glycoprotein, particularly its S1 subunit, which is recognised by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Here we use the in-house developed tool CaverDock to perform virtual screening against spike glycoprotein using a cryogenic electron microscopy structure (PDB-ID: 6VXX) and the representative structures of five most populated clusters from a previously published molecular dynamics simulation. The dataset of ligands was obtained from the ZINC database and consists of drugs approved for clinical use worldwide. Trajectories for the passage of individual drugs through the tunnel of the spike glycoprotein homotrimer, their binding energies within the tunnel, and the duration of their contacts with the trimer’s three subunits were computed for the full dataset. Multivariate statistical methods were then used to establish structure-activity relationships and select top candidate for movement inhibition. This new protocol for the rapid screening of globally approved drugs (4359 ligands) in a multi-state protein structure (6 states) showed high robustness in the rate of finished calculations. The protocol is universal and can be applied to any target protein with an experimental tertiary structure containing protein tunnels or channels. The protocol will be implemented in the next version of CaverWeb (https://loschmidt.chemi.muni.cz/caverweb/) to make it accessible to the wider scientific community.","Pinto, Gaspar P.; Vavra, Ondrej; Marques, Sergio M.; Filipovic, Jiri; Bednar, David; Damborsky, Jiri",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021002245?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104357/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.05.043; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2001037021002245,238

This problem has not been given much attention in the field, and therefore, this article aims to provide a preliminary result in this problem domain. First, we describe the problem and define the goal of the optimisation by introducing an evaluation metric that measures the efficiency of the distribution strategies. Then, we propose two simple strategies, and a strategy that incorporates a prediction of patients’ visits utilising a standard epidemic model. The strategies were evaluated using the metric, with past statistics in Kitami City, Hokkaido, Japan, and the prediction-based strategy outperformed the other distribution strategies. We discuss the properties of the strategies and the limitations of the proposed approach. Although the problem must be generalised before the actual deployment of the suggested strategy, the preliminary result is promising in its ability to address the shortage of diagnostic capacity currently observed worldwide because of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic.","Tsuchida, Naoshi; Nakamura, Fumihiko; Matsuda, Kazunori; Saikawa, Takafumi; Okumura, Takashi",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244076/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77468-2,238
656087,Lopinavir/ritonavir: Repurposing an old drug for HIV infection in COVID-19 treatment,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of testing and tracing programs to reduce COVID-19 transmission hinges not only on widespread access to testing, but also on the public’s willingness to participate in them. To the extent that testing intentions are patterned by social determinants of health, this constitutes an understudied mechanism of disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. DESIGN: Using data from a representative household probability sample, the Person to Person Health Interview Study (n = 935), sociodemographic, economic, and psychological determinants of testing considerations were evaluated across six domains: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significant differences in testing motivations across race/ethnicity, education level, socioeconomic status, and worry about self and loved ones. Notably, Black (p<0.01) and Latino (p<0.05) respondents and those experiencing financial strain (p<0.001) were disproportionately likely to indicate that resource factors would influence their decision to get tested. Desire to reduce transmission and concern about proximity to the infected were reported among those who expressed COVID-19 worries (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Public health efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic must address social, economic, and psychological factors that enable and constrain individual behavior. Increasing access to preventative interventions and technologies, including vaccines, is unlikely to markedly reduce morbidity and mortality without effective messaging and economic support to improve uptake in vulnerable populations.","Perry, Brea L.; Aronson, Brian; Railey, Ashley F.; Ludema, Christina",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260602/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252658,238

A time series analysis of weekly mortality data including all deaths from January 2015 to December 2020 was conducted. The number of expected deaths for 2020 was estimated using an over-dispersed Poisson model that accounts for demographic changes, temporal trends, and seasonal effects in mortality. Weekly excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the number of observed deaths and the expected deaths. Regional differences in Indigenous mortality were investigated. A significant increase in Indigenous mortality was observed from April 1 to December 31, 2020. An estimated 1149 (95% CI 1018–1281) excess deaths was found among Indigenous Brazilians in 2020, representing a 34.8% increase from the expected deaths for this population. The overall increase in non-Indigenous mortality was 18.1%. The Indigenous population living in the Brazilian Amazon area was the earliest-affected Indigenous group, with one of the highest proportional increases in mortality. Disparities in excess mortality revealed a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among Indigenous Brazilians compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. Findings highlight the importance of implementing an effective emergency plan that addresses the increased vulnerability of Indigenous Peoples to COVID-19.

This technique may provide new opportunities in diagnosis and research of COVID-19. Signal amplification by reversible exchange-based hyperpolarization studies on large-sized drug candidates were carried out. We observed hyperpolarized proton signals from whole structures, due to the unprecedented long-distance polarization transfer by para-hydrogen. We also found that the optimal magnetic field for the maximum polarization transfer yield was dependent on the molecular structure. We can expect further research on the hyperpolarization of other important large molecules, isotope labeling, as well as polarization transfer on nuclei with a long spin relaxation time.

Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak.

We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.","Letko, Michael; Munster, Vincent",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32511294/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.22.915660,238
661328,Theory: Treatments for Prolonged ICU Patients May Provide New Therapeutic Avenues for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS),2021-05-07,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Alternatively spliced tissue factor (asTF) is a naturally occurring isoform of tissue factor (TF) generated via the omission of exon 5 during the processing of TF’s primary transcript. In human and mouse, asTF protein features a unique C-terminus that lacks a transmembrane domain, rendering it soluble. asTF protein is able to associate with a subset on integrins on cell surfaces, which can trigger outside-in signaling programs in a variety of cell types. In this review, we discuss recent findings on asTF’s proto-oncogenic effects, regulatory mechanisms enabling asTF’s biosynthesis, and asTF’s potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. ABSTRACT: In human and mouse, alternative splicing of tissue factor’s primary transcript yields two mRNA species: one features all six TF exons and encodes full-length tissue factor (flTF), and the other lacks exon 5 and encodes alternatively spliced tissue factor (asTF). flTF, which is oftentimes referred to as “TF”, is an integral membrane glycoprotein due to the presence of an alpha-helical domain in its C-terminus, while asTF is soluble due to the frameshift resulting from the joining of exon 4 directly to exon 6. In this review, we focus on asTF—the more recently discovered isoform of TF that appears to significantly contribute to the pathobiology of several solid malignancies. There is currently a consensus in the field that asTF, while dispensable to normal hemostasis, can activate a subset of integrins on benign and malignant cells and promote outside-in signaling eliciting angiogenesis; cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; and monocyte recruitment. We provide a general overview of the pioneering, as well as more recent, asTF research; discuss the current concepts of how asTF contributes to cancer progression; and open a conversation about the emerging utility of asTF as a biomarker and a therapeutic target.","Matiash, Kateryna; Lewis, Clayton S.; Bogdanov, Vladimir Y.",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572880/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13184652,238

Methods To provide a better understanding of the importance of abnormal laboratory findings in COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis, we searched the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science medical databases and selected 19 articles (totaling 2,988 patients, 484 of whom [16.1%] had severe disease) that reported panels of laboratory examinations in patients with COVID-19. Results Although in vitro diagnostics, primarily using PCR- and ELISA-based methods, efficiently contribute to the etiological identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we suggest that laboratory medicine may also be of significant assistance when differentiating between severe and non-severe COVID-19. Conclusion When we wrote this article, our ability to provide a definitive conclusion may have been adversely affected by some limitations, such as the low sample size, differently applied methods, dissimilar reference ranges, non-synchronized representations of results, and variety of the patients’ panels. Despite the limitations, the analysis of the current scientific literature demonstrates the value of laboratory parameters as simple, rapid, and cost-effective biomarkers in COVID-19 patients.","Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh; Bashash, Davood; Fateh, Fatemeh; Abolghasemi, Hassan",Clinica Chimica Acta,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32798514/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898120304125; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.08.019; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898120304125?v=s5,238

MethodsThirty-two days of data that were shared by China National Health Commission and China Weather Net were collected using standard forms. The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of ""Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan"" makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearmans analysis. ResultsThe mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P < 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P < 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with AT both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012). ConclusionsOur findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.","Cai, Yuwen; Huang, Tianlun; Liu, Xin; Xu, Gaosi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.26.20028472,238

Given that various wild bird species have been implicated as sources of transmission, in this study we genotypically and pathotypically characterized 23 NDV isolates collected from chickens, ducks, and pigeons in live bird markets (LBMs) in South China as part of an H7N9 surveillance program during December 2013–February 2014. To simulate the natural transmission of different kinds of animals in LBMs, we selected three representative NDVs—namely, GM, YF18, and GZ289—isolated from different birds to evaluate the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in chickens, ducks, and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate the replication and shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated the chickens, ducks, and pigeons with 10(6) EID(50) of each virus via intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hour after infection, the naïve contact groups were housed with those inoculated with each of the viruses as a means to monitor contact transmission. Our results indicated that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBMs in South China's Guangdong Province and that NDV from different birds have different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. We therefore propose the continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs to support the prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially chickens, and highlight the need for studies of the virus–host relationship.","Kang, Yinfeng; Xiang, Bin; Yuan, Runyu; Zhao, Xiaqiong; Feng, Minsha; Gao, Pei; Li, Yanling; Li, Yulian; Ning, Zhangyong; Ren, Tao",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26903997/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00119,238

For this study, we deployed an online survey to explore men’s motivations for donating and their attitudes toward anonymity and donating for specific groups. METHOD: The study’s sample comprised men who were eligible to donate sperm (N = 282). The relationships between these factors and participants’ psychological and sociodemographic characteristics were also explored. RESULTS: The results mostly indicated altruistic reasons for donating, positive attitudes toward anonymity, and a greater willingness to donate to infertile women. Overall, sexual orientation was not associated with the participants’ attitudes and motivations. Age, education level, conscientiousness, empathic concern, and conservative and religious values were associated with the participants’ motivations and attitudes toward sperm donation. CONCLUSION: Recruitment campaigns should therefore consider the specific motivations, attitudes, and psychosocial characteristics of potential sperm donors. Indeed, parenthood is a universal right, so sperm donation should be encouraged, regardless of recipients’ fertility status. Clear information about the identifiability of sperm donors should also be provided.","Areias, João; Gato, Jorge; Moura-Ramos, Mariana",Sex Res Social Policy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-020-00531-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527001/,238
663853,Antiviral therapy and immunotherapy of COVID-19,2021,"Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the principal etiologic agent of SARS. We analyzed serum samples obtained from 623 patients with SARS in Beijing, to determine whether infection with SARS-CoV can elicit neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Methods. We developed a highly sensitive and safe neutralization assay using the SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus and used this assay to determine the titers of the NAbs in serum samples from patients with SARS. Results. We found that 85.9% of serum samples contained NAbs against SARS-CoV and that most of the NAb activities could be attributed to immunoglobulin G. The NAbs became detectable first at 5–10 days after the onset of symptoms, and their levels peaked at 20–30 days and then were sustained for >150 days. The serum samples could neutralize the pseudotype particles bearing the spike glycoproteins from different SARS-CoV strains, suggesting that the NAbs to SARS-CoV were broadly reactive. Conclusions. NAbs to SARS-CoV are broadly elicited in patients with SARS and, according to their kinetics, may correlate with viral load during the early stages of the disease. These results suggest that it is possible to develop effective vaccines against SARS and that NAbs provide a potential strategy for treating patients with SARS.","Yuchun, Nie; Guangwen, Wang; Xuanling, Shi; Hong, Zhang; Yan, Qiu; Zhongping, He; Wei, Wang; Gewei, Lian; Xiaolei, Yin; Liying, Du; Lili, Ren; Jianwei, Wang; Xiong, He; Taisheng, Li; Hongkui, Deng; Mingxiao, Ding",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15319862/,238

We aim to equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with mathematical model-based quantification of implemented public health measures and estimation of the trend of COVID-19 in Ontario to inform future actions in terms of outbreak control and de-escalation of social distancing. Our estimates confirm that (1) social distancing measures have helped mitigate transmission by reducing daily infection contact rate, but the disease transmission probability per contact remains as high as 0.145 and case detection rate was so low that the effective reproduction number remained higher than the threshold for disease control until the closure of non-essential business in the Province; (2) improvement in case detection rate and closure of non-essential business had resulted in further reduction of the effective control number to under the threshold. We predict the number of confirmed cases according to different control efficacies including a combination of reducing further contact rates and transmission probability per contact. We show that improved case detection rate plays a decisive role to reduce the effective reproduction number, and there is still much room in terms of improving personal protection measures to compensate for the strict social distancing measures.","Wu, Jianhong; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Nah, Kyeongah; McCarthy, Zachary",J Math Ind,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13362-020-00083-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501416/,238
664098,Effect of coronavirus infection on the human heart: A scoping review,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a drastic effect on the global community. Blood products are precious resources especially in the African context and this has been especially compounded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Concurrent to this during the Covid-19 level 5 lockdown in South Africa from 26 March – 30 April 2020, a decrease in trauma admissions to state hospitals was noted. The aim of this data collection was to assess whether lowered blood product issuance was seen during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. METHOD: Areas at Tygerberg Hospital with trauma patients were identified, namely: the A1W intensive care unit (Surgical ICU), Trauma Front Room (Trauma Admissions), Trauma Resuscitation unit (Trauma Resus Area) and J7(Trauma Ward). Data of blood product issuance (red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma) for these 4 areas was provided by the Western Cape Blood Service for the period 26 March-30 April 2018, 2019 and 2020. This included the stage 5 Covid-19 South African lockdown, as well as Easter for all three years which is traditionally associated with raised trauma admissions. This data was quantitative. RESULTS: 201 products were issued in 2018 versus 103 for the same period in 2020 for the 4 trauma areas in Tygerberg Hospital. The surgical ICU received the most products over 3 years with 183 of the product issuances. DISCUSSION: As expected there was a significant decrease in blood product (red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma) issuance during the 2020 period which paralleled the lowered trauma numbers. This represented a significant cost saving of over R150 000 despite increased yearly costs for blood products over the same period. This data collection did not consider the reasoning for these blood transfusions or the clinical appropriateness thereof.

The inaugural class of applicants participating in virtual interviews were surveyed concerning their preferences and suggestions for future application cycles. METHODS: A survey was distributed to 349 individuals who applied for an integrated plastic surgery residency position at three institutions during the 2020–21 application cycle. Responses were analyzed to determine the most popular attributes of virtual interviews. RESULTS: Response rate was 44%. Eighty-six percent of applicants valued having time to consider their interview offers before scheduling; however, nearly one-third felt the instructions provided by programs lacked clarity and did not abide by the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons guidelines. Eighty-two percent of applicants valued having a preinterview social, and most preferred smaller breakout rooms organized by themes. A short interview day (less than three hours) was associated with less applicant familiarity with the program, its people, and its location when compared with medium (three to seven hours) and long (more than seven hours) interview days (P < 0.001 for all). Eighty percent of applicants preferred an interview day where they were placed into interview rooms by a program coordinator.

664657,SEVERE COVID-19 IS MARKED BY DYSREGULATED SERUM LEVELS OF CARBOXYPEPTIDASE A3 AND SEROTONIN,2021-02-03,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 4.7 million infections greatly challenging healthcare workers (HCW) and medical institutions worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown to significantly impact mental and physical health of HCW. Thus, implementation of testing facilities supporting HCW are urgently needed. METHODS: A low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facility was introduced at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, in March 2020. Irrespective of clinical symptoms employees were offered a voluntary and free SARS-CoV-2 test. Furthermore, employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions and employees after risk contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected patients or employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharyngeal swabs were taken and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed, test results being available within 24 hours. Profession, symptoms and reason for SARS-CoV-2 testing of employees were recorded. RESULTS: Between 9th March and 30th April 2020, a total of 1,510 employees were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1,185 employees took advantage of the low-threshold testing facility. One percent (n=11) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18% being asymptomatic, 36% showing mild and 36% moderate/severe symptoms (missing 10%). Furthermore, of 56 employees returning from SARS-CoV-2 risk regions, 18% (10/56) were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive. After risk contact tracking by the hospital hygiene 6 patient-to-employee transmissions were identified in 163 employees with contact to 55 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. CONCLUSION: In the absence of easily accessible public SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities low-threshold SARS-CoV-2 testing facilities in hospitals with rapid testing resources help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infected employees with absent or mild symptoms, thus stopping the spread of infection in vulnerable hospital environments. High levels of professional infection prevention training and implementation of specialized wards as well as a perfectly working hospital hygiene network identifying and tracking risk contacts are of great importance in a pandemic setting.","Menting, T.; Krause, K.; Benz-Tettey, F.; Boehringer, R.; Laufer, D.; Gruber, B.; Crump, M.; Schieferdecker, R.; Reuhl, S.; Kaeferstein, A.; Engelhart, S.; Streeck, H.; Marx, B.; Aldabbagh, S.; Eis-Hübinger, A.; Rockstroh, J.K.; Schwarze-Zander, C.",Int J Hyg Environ Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S143846392030599X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33137564/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113653; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S143846392030599X,238

The disease has been spreading very rapidly and few months after the identification of the first infected, shortage of hospital resources quickly became a problem. In this work we investigate whether artificial intelligence working with chest X-ray (CXR) scans and clinical data can be used as a possible tool for the early identification of patients at risk of severe outcome, like intensive care or death. Indeed, further to induce lower radiation dose than computed tomography (CT), CXR is a simpler and faster radiological technique, being also more widespread. In this respect, we present three approaches that use features extracted from CXR images, either handcrafted or automatically learnt by convolutional neuronal networks, which are then integrated with the clinical data. As a further contribution, this work introduces a repository that collects data from 820 patients enrolled in six Italian hospitals in spring 2020 during the first COVID-19 emergency. The dataset includes CXR images, several clinical attributes and clinical outcomes. Exhaustive evaluation shows promising performance both in 10-fold and leave-one-centre-out cross-validation, suggesting that clinical data and images have the potential to provide useful information for the management of patients and hospital resources.","Soda, Paolo; D’Amico, Natascha Claudia; Tessadori, Jacopo; Valbusa, Giovanni; Guarrasi, Valerio; Bortolotto, Chandra; Akbar, Muhammad Usman; Sicilia, Rosa; Cordelli, Ermanno; Fazzini, Deborah; Cellina, Michaela; Oliva, Giancarlo; Callea, Giovanni; Panella, Silvia; Cariati, Maurizio; Cozzi, Diletta; Miele, Vittorio; Stellato, Elvira; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Castorani, Giulia; Simeone, Annalisa; Preda, Lorenzo; Iannello, Giulio; Del Bue, Alessio; Tedoldi, Fabio; Alí, Marco; Sona, Diego; Papa, Sergio",Med Image Anal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1361841521002619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34492574/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521002619?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2021.102216,238

Newly apprehended knowledge on thoracic imaging abnormalities and the growing clinical experience on the evolution of this disease make the radiographic follow-up of hospitalized patients relevant. The value of consecutive bedside lung ultrasonography in the follow-up of hospitalized patients with SARS CoV-2 pneumonia and its correlation with other clinical and laboratory markers needs to be evaluated. Methods: We assessed 39 patients [age: 64 y(60.1 - 68.7)] with confirmed SARS CoV-2 pneumonia. 24 patients were hospitalized until the follow-up test, 9 were discharged early and 6 required a transfer to critical care unit. Two ultrasound scans of the lung were performed on day 1 and 4 of patients´ hospitalization. Primary endpoint was the magnitude of association between a global lung ultrasound score (LUS) and clinical and laboratory markers. Secondary endpoint was the association between the evolution of LUS with the corresponded changes in clinical and laboratory outcomes during hospitalization period. Results: LUS score on admission was higher among the deteriorating patients and significantly (p=0.038-0.0001) correlated (Spearman’s rho) with the levels of C-reactive protein (0.58), lymphocytes (-0.33), SpO2 (-0.48) and oxygen supplementation (0.48) upon admission. The increase in LUS score between the two scans was significantly correlated (0.544, p=0.006) with longer hospital stay. Conclusion: Lung ultrasound assessment can be a useful as an imaging modality for SARS CoV-2 patients.

Ideally, small groups of HCWs engage in TECHS together to help support team resilience. In implementing TECHS in a group, it is important to ensure participation is optional and to review expectations for confidentiality. The purpose of TECHS is to address the emotional needs of HCWs related to the pandemic and to offer a long overdue evidence-informed program that addresses the fourth aim of healthcare, improving the work life of HCWs.

Energetics calculations showed that the impact of substitutions on the thermodynamic stability of the proteome follows a universal bi-Gaussian distribution. Detailed results are presented for potential drug discovery targets and the four structural proteins that comprise the virion, highlighting substitutions with the potential to impact protein structure, enzyme activity, and protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interfaces. Characterizing the evolution of the virus in three dimensions provides testable insights into viral protein function and should aid in structure-based drug discovery efforts as well as the prospective identification of amino acid substitutions with potential for drug resistance.","Lubin, Joseph H; Zardecki, Christine; Dolan, Elliott M; Lu, Changpeng; Shen, Zhuofan; Dutta, Shuchismita; Westbrook, John D; Hudson, Brian P; Goodsell, David S; Williams, Jonathan K; Voigt, Maria; Sarma, Vidur; Xie, Lingjun; Venkatachalam, Thejasvi; Arnold, Steven; Alvarado, Luz Helena Alfaro; Catalfano, Kevin; Khan, Aaliyah; McCarthy, Erika; Staggers, Sophia; Tinsley, Brea; Trudeau, Alan; Singh, Jitendra; Whitmore, Lindsey; Zheng, Helen; Benedek, Matthew; Currier, Jenna; Dresel, Mark; Duvvuru, Ashish; Dyszel, Britney; Fingar, Emily; Hennen, Elizabeth M; Kirsch, Michael; Khan, Ali A; Labrie-Cleary, Charlotte; Laporte, Stephanie; Lenkeit, Evan; Martin, Kailey; Orellana, Marilyn; de la Campa, Melanie Ortiz-Alvarez; Paredes, Isaac; Wheeler, Baleigh; Rupert, Allison; Sam, Andrew; See, Katherine; Zapata, Santiago Soto; Craig, Paul A; Hall, Bonnie L; Jiang, Jennifer; Koeppe, Julia R; Mills, Stephen A; Pikaart, Michael J; Roberts, Rebecca; Bromberg, Yana; Hoyer, J Steen; Duffy, Siobain; Tischfield, Jay; Ruiz, Francesc X; Arnold, Eddy; Baum, Jean; Sandberg, Jesse; Brannigan, Grace; Khare, Sagar D; Burley, Stephen K",Proteins,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580920/; https://doi.org/10.1002/prot.26250,238
667000,What the oncologist needs to know about COVID-19 infection in cancer patients,2020-04-23,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in enormous morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet no medications to date are proven to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Famotidine is commonly used for gastric acid suppression but also has recently gained attention as an antiviral that may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Objective: To determine whether famotidine use is associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 initially hospitalized to a non-intensive care setting. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Inpatients at a single academic medical center. Participants: Consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from February 25 to April 13, 2020. Measurements: Famotidine use (exposure); intubation or death (primary outcome) Results: 1,620 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were analyzed including 84 (5.1%) who received famotidine within 24 hours of hospital admission. There were no differences between famotidine users and non-users in age, body mass index, or comorbidities including diabetes or hypertension. 340 (21%) patients met the study composite outcome of death or intubation. Use of famotidine was associated with reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.81) and also with reduced risk for death alone (aHR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11-0.78). Proton pump inhibitors, which also suppress gastric acid, were not associated with reduced risk for death or intubation. In patients without COVID-19 hospitalized during the same time period, no association was observed between use of famotidine and death or intubation. Limitations: Retrospective analysis; non-randomized exposure. Conclusion: Famotidine use is associated with reduced risk of intubation or death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine whether famotidine therapy improves outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Freedberg, D. E.; Conigliaro, J.; Sobieszczyk, M.

Targeting the formation and action of angiotensin II (Ang II), the main RAS peptide, has been the key therapeutic target for last three decades. ACE‐related carboxypeptidase (ACE2), a monocarboxypeptidase that had been discovered 20 years ago, is one of the catalytically most potent enzymes known to degrade Ang II to Ang‐(1‐7), a peptide that is increasingly accepted to have organ ‐protective properties that oppose and counterbalance those of Ang II. In addition to its role as a RAS enzyme ACE2 is the main receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2. In this review, we discuss various strategies that have been used to achieve amplification of ACE2 activity including the potential therapeutic potential of soluble recombinant ACE2 protein and novel shorter ACE2 variants.","Marquez, Alonso; Wysocki, Jan; Pandit, Jay; Batlle, Daniel",Acta Physiol (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32469114/; https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13513,238

Therefore, offering an accurate automatic diagnostic system is very important. This paper proposed an accurate COVID-19 system by testing various deep learning models for x-ray/computed tomography (CT) medical images. A deep preprocessing procedure was done with two filters and segmentation to increase classification results. According to the results obtained, 99.94% of accuracy, 98.70% of sensitivity, and 100% of specificity scores were obtained by the Xception model in the x-ray dataset and the InceptionV3 model for CT scan images. The compared results have demonstrated that the proposed model is proven to be more successful than the deep learning algorithms in previous studies. Moreover, it has the ability to automatically notify the examination results to the patients, the health authority, and the community after taking any x-ray or CT images.","Mahmood, Ahlam Fadhil; Mahmood, Saja Waleed",The Review of scientific instruments,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0059829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34470404/,238

There is only observational evidence supporting the use of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) as a topical wound solution on VLU and some limited randomised evidence for the effect of a prescribed regimen of exercise. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Factorial4VLU trial is a pragmatic, blinded, factorial randomised controlled trial, with 380 participants receiving either a prescribed exercise regimen compared with usual care and either active HOCl wound solution or placebo wound solution at each dressing change for up to 24 weeks. All participants will receive compression therapy. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with healed VLU at 12 weeks after randomisation as adjudicated by blinded review of ulcer photographs. Secondary outcomes are proportion healed at 24 weeks, time to healing, estimated change in ulcer area, change in 2-Minute Walk Test, change in health-related quality of life, incidence of infection and incidence of all-cause adverse events. If either of the interventions shows a statistically significant positive difference on healing outcomes, cost-effectiveness will be modelled using a health service perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Factorial4VLU trial received ethical approval from the Northern B Health and Disability Ethics Committee.

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential associations of SMA with the susceptibility to and prognostication of COVID-19 need to be clarified. We documented an SMA case who contracted COVID-19 but only developed mild-to-moderate clinical and radiological manifestations of pneumonia, which were relieved by a combined antiviral and supportive treatment. We then reviewed a cohort of patients with SMA who had been living in the Hubei province since November 2019, among which the only 1 out of 56 was diagnosed with COVID-19 (1.79%, 1/56). Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to delineate the potential genetic crosstalk between SMN1 (mutation of which leads to SMA) and COVID-19/lung injury-associated pathways. Protein-protein interaction analysis by STRING suggested that loss-of-function of SMN1 might modulate COVID-19 pathogenesis through CFTR, CXCL8, TNF and ACE. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis also revealed a link between SMN1 and ACE2, despite low-confidence protein-protein interactions as suggested by STRING. This bioinformatic analysis could give hint on why SMA might not necessarily lead to poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Li, Zheng; Li, Xingye; Shen, Jianxiong; Tan, Haining; Rong, Tianhua; Lin, Youxi; Feng, Erwei; Chen, Zhengguang; Jiao, Yang; Liu, Gang; Zhang, Lin; Vai Chan, Matthew Tai; Kei Wu, William Ka",Brief Bioinform,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190150/,238

Understanding disease pathology and the factors that drive severe and fatal clinical outcomes is of special relevance. Studying the role of the respiratory microbiota in COVID-19 is particularly important since it is known that the respiratory microbiota interacts with the host immune system, contributing to clinical outcomes in chronic and acute respiratory diseases. Here, we characterized the microbiota in the respiratory tract of patients with mild, severe, or fatal COVID-19, and compared with healthy controls and patients with non-COVID-19-pneumonia. We comparatively studied the microbial composition, diversity, and microbiota structure across study groups and correlated the results with clinical data. We found differences in diversity and abundance of bacteria between groups, higher levels of dysbiosis in the respiratory microbiota of COVID-19 patients (regardless of severity level), differences in diversity structure among mild, severe, and fatal COVID-19, and the presence of specific bacteria that correlated with clinical variables associated with increased mortality risk. Our data suggest that host-related and environmental factors could be affecting the respiratory microbiota before SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially compromising the immunological response of the host against disease and promoting secondary bacterial infections. For instance, the high levels of dysbiosis coupled with low microbial structural complexity in the respiratory microbiota of COVID-19 patients, possibly resulted from antibiotic uptake and comorbidities, could have consequences for the host and microbial community level. Altogether, our findings identify the respiratory microbiota as a potential factor associated with COVID-19 severity.","Hernandez-Teran, A.; Mejia-Nepomuceno, F.; Herrera, M.

Four main patterns of senior civic participation are identified: adopting consultative or co-decisional participatory approaches in policy design or policy implementation. The four are represented to varying degrees at different geographical levels (national, regional, local), with different actor configurations (appointed, elected/nominated, corporate representation), and with varying degree of institutionalization (temporary/permanent). Case studies illustrate approaches taken to enhance the quality and effectiveness of public services for senior citizens.

METHODS: IRB approval was obtained to allow a retrospective review of adult patients who presented to the Emergency Department with a complaint of fever, cough, dyspnea or hypoxia and had a chest X-ray between 12 March 2020 and 26 March 2020. The initial chest X-ray was graded on a scale of 0–3 with grade 0 representing no alveolar opacities, grade 1: < 1/3 alveolar opacities of the lung, Grade 2: 1/3 to 2/3 lung with alveolar opacities and grade 3: > 2/3 alveolar opacities of the lung. Past medical history of diabetes and hypertension, initial oxygen saturation, COVID-19 testing results, intubation, and outcome were also collected. RESULTS: Four hundred ten patient chest X-rays were reviewed. Oxygen saturation and X-ray grade were both significantly associated with the length of stay in hospital, the hazard ratio (HR) of discharge was 1.05 (95% CI [1.01, 1.09], p = 0.017) and 0.61 (95% CI [0.51, 0.73], p < 0.001), respectively.

Objective To characterize the first‐wave epidemiologic features of influenza‐like illness (ILI) associated with the novel pandemic A/H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] virus. Methods We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to assess risk factors and non‐parametric and/or parametric distributions to estimate attack rates, secondary attack rates (SAR), duration of illness, and serial interval during a laboratory‐confirmed community outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09 clustered around on‐reserve residents and households of an elementary school in rural British Columbia, Canada, in late April/early May 2009. ILI details were collected as part of outbreak investigation by community telephone survey in early June 2009. Results Overall, 92/408 (23%) of participants developed ILI and 36/408 (9%) experienced medically attended ILI (MAILI). The overall SAR in households was 22%: highest among participants 1–4 years of age (yoa) (50%) followed by <1 yoa (38%), 5–8 yoa (20%), 10–19 yoa (13%), 20–49 yoa (20%), and 50–64 yoa (0%). The median serial interval was estimated at 3·5 days (95% CI: 2·1–5·1). In multivariable GLMM analysis, having a chronic condition (OR: 2·58; 95% CI: 1·1–6·04), younger age [1–8 yoa: OR: 4·63; 95% CI: 2·25–9·52; 9–19 yoa: OR: 1·95; 95% CI: 0·97–3·9 (referent: ≥20 yoa)] and receipt of 2008–2009 influenza vaccine (OR: 2·68; 95% CI: 1·37–5·25) were associated with increased risk of ILI. Median duration of illness was 9 days, longer among those with chronic conditions (21 days). Median time to seeking care after developing illness was 4·5 days. On‐reserve participants had higher chronic conditions, household density, ILI, MAILI, and SAR. Conclusions During a community outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09‐related illness, we identified substantial clinical ILI attack rates exceeding 20% with secondary household attack rates as high as 50% in young children.

671020,Neuropathological Features of Covid-19,2020-06-12,"Background: Asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics. Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures. Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures. Methods: Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= to 37.5C, cough, shortness of breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as an assumed baseline. We then calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment. Results: We estimate that, during March 2020, the median percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged from 2.38% (Bangladesh) to 99.6% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 17.8 times (France) larger than reported. Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each country. Despite low case detection in some countries, our results that adjust for this still suggest that all countries have had only a small fraction of their populations infected as of July 2020. Conclusions: We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations, our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.","Golding, N.; Russell, T.

To facilitate the evaluation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, we generated a publicly accessible database of epitopes predicted to bind any class I HLA protein across the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA-A*02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To enable evaluation of epitopes across individuals with a variety of HLA haplotypes, we computed the predicted binding affinities between 9-mer peptides derived from the annotated SARS-CoV-2 peptidome across 9,360 MHC class I HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles. There were 6,748 unique combinations of peptides and HLA alleles (pMHCs) with a predicted binding affinity of less than 500nM, including 1,103 unique peptides and 1,022 HLA alleles, spanning 11 annotated superfamilies. These peptides were derived from all 11 proteins spanning the SARS-CoV-2 peptidome, including peptides that have previously been validated experimentally. We also show evidence that these previously validated epitopes may be relevant in other HLA contexts.

673399,Effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy to improve mortality of COVID-19,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Biological networks are important for elucidating disease etiology due to their ability to model complex high dimensional data and biological systems. Proteomics provides a critical data source for such models, but currently lacks robust de novo methods for network construction, which could bring important insights in systems biology. RESULTS: We have evaluated the construction of network models using methods derived from weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We show that approximately scale-free peptide networks, composed of statistically significant modules, are feasible and biologically meaningful using two mouse lung experiments and one human plasma experiment. Within each network, peptides derived from the same protein are shown to have a statistically higher topological overlap and concordance in abundance, which is potentially important for inferring protein abundance. The module representatives, called eigenpeptides, correlate significantly with biological phenotypes. Furthermore, within modules, we find significant enrichment for biological function and known interactions (gene ontology and protein-protein interactions). CONCLUSIONS: Biological networks are important tools in the analysis of complex systems. In this paper we evaluate the application of weighted co-expression network analysis to quantitative proteomics data. Protein co-expression networks allow novel approaches for biological interpretation, quality control, inference of protein abundance, a framework for potentially resolving degenerate peptide-protein mappings, and a biomarker signature discovery.","Gibbs, David L; Baratt, Arie; Baric, Ralph S; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Smith, Richard D; Orwoll, Eric S; Katze, Michael G; McWeeney, Shannon K",J Clin Bioinforma,https://doi.org/10.1186/2043-9113-3-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23724967/,238

Therefore, there is urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, immune evasion, and disease progression. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can block IRF3 and NF-κB activation early during virus infection. We also identify that the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins NSP1 and NSP13 can block interferon activation via distinct mechanisms. NSP1 antagonizes interferon signaling by suppressing host mRNA translation, while NSP13 downregulates interferon and NF-κB promoter signaling by limiting TBK1 and IRF3 activation, as phospho-TBK1 and phospho-IRF3 protein levels are reduced with increasing levels of NSP13 protein expression. NSP13 can also reduce NF-κB activation by both limiting NF-κB phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Last, we also show that NSP13 binds to TBK1 and downregulates IFIT1 protein expression. Collectively, these data illustrate that SARS-CoV-2 bypasses multiple innate immune activation pathways through distinct mechanisms.","Vazquez, Christine; Swanson, Sydnie E.; Negatu, Seble G.; Dittmar, Mark; Miller, Jesse; Ramage, Holly R.; Cherry, Sara; Jurado, Kellie A.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253089; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166398/,238

We investigated whether hepatic steatosis and/or fibrosis are associated with the development of incident heart failure (iHF), hospitalized HF (hHF), mortality, and CV death in both the general population and HF patients. METHODS: We analyzed 778,739 individuals without HF and 7445 patients with pre-existing HF aged 40 to 80 years who underwent a national health check-up from January 2009 to December 2012. The presence of hepatic steatosis and advanced hepatic fibrosis was determined using cutoff values for fatty liver index (FLI) and BARD score. We evaluated the association of FLI or BARD score with the development of iHF, hHF, mortality and CV death using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. RESULTS: A total of 28,524 (3.7%) individuals in the general population and 1422 (19.1%) pre-existing HF patients developed iHF and hHF respectively. In the multivariable-adjusted model, participants with an FLI ≥ 60 were at increased risk for iHF (hazard ratio [HR], 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30, 1.24-1.36), hHF (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.66), all-cause mortality (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.54-1.70), and CV mortality (HR 1.41 95% CI 1.22-1.63) in the general population and hHF (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.21-1.54) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.54 95% CI 1.24-1.92) in the HF patient group compared with an FLI < 20. Among participants with NAFLD, advanced liver fibrosis was associated with increased risk for iHF, hHF, and all-cause mortality in the general population and all-cause mortality and CV mortality in the HF patient group (all p < 0.05).

METHODS: In this interrupted time-series study, height and weight were collected from children (n=1,770 children, mean age=8.7 years, 55.3% male, 64.6% Black) and were transformed into BMI z-score in each August/September from 2017 to 2020. Mixed-effects linear regression estimated yearly BMI z-score change before the COVID-19 pandemic year (i.e., 2017–2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic year (i.e., 2019–2020). Subgroup analyses by sex, race (i.e., Black, White, other race), weight status (overweight or obese and normal weight), and grade (i.e., lower=kindergarten−2nd grade and upper=3rd−6th grade) were conducted. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, children's yearly BMI z-score change was +0.03 (95% CI= −0.10, 0.15). Change during the COVID-19 pandemic was +0.34 (95% CI=0.21, 0.47), an acceleration in BMI z-score change of +0.31 (95% CI=0.19, 0.44).

Among study participants, 76% were female, 34% were 50 years or older, 5% self-reported cancer diagnosis, and 70% had other chronic comorbidities. Participants self-reporting a cancer diagnosis had two times higher odds of getting vaccinated than healthy individuals (95% CI: 1.00–4.30). Compared to healthy participants, those self-reporting being diagnosed with cancer and those with chronic conditions other than cancer had significantly higher perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

We administered favipiravir to a 64-year-old female patient with COVID-19. Her symptoms resolved quickly after the start of treatment, with reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, but she developed a fever again on day 12. Since the fever was relieved by discontinuation of favipiravir, and based on positive results with a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, we diagnosed her with favipiravir-induced drug fever. Decrease in the serum concentration of favipiravir was observed along with resolution of the fever.

675103,Telemedicine for management of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through COVID-19 tail,2020-10-06,"Important health information including disease prevention and chronic disease self-management is increasingly packaged for digital use. The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to describe the extent of computer ownership, Internet access, and digital health information use in an ethnically diverse sample of older adults, comparing ownership, access, and use of digital health information (DHI) across ethnic groups and identifying the factors associated with them quantitatively. Significant differences in computer ownership, Internet access, and DHI use were found across ethnic groups (African American, Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic American, and European American). Logistic regression identified older age, less education, lower income, and minority group membership as significant predictors of limited DHI use. Older African Americans were one-fifth as likely to own a computer than were European Americans; Hispanic Americans were one-half as likely to have access to the Internet. We then conducted a series of focus groups which highlighted differences across ethnic groups. Participants in the African American/Afro-Caribbean group expressed frustration with lack of access to DHI but appreciation for alternative sources of information. Hispanic Americans critiqued information received from providers and drug inserts, some suggesting that a positive attitude and trust in God also contributed to getting well. European American participants evaluated various DHI websites, looking to providers for help in applying information to their personal situation. As the development and use of DHI continue, parallel efforts to increase access to DHI among economically disadvantaged and minority older adults are critical to prevent further disfranchisement.","Tappen, Ruth M.; Cooley, Mary E.; Luckmann, Roger; Panday, Somi",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415705/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-020-00931-3,238
676152,Effect of methylprednisolone in severe and critical COVID-19: Analysis of 102 cases,2020-12-06,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seen an unprecedented increase in the demand for rapid and reliable diagnostic tools, leaving many laboratories scrambling for resources. We present a fast and simple assay principle for antigen detection and demonstrate its functionality by detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs. The method is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and S protein (SP) via time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) with donor- and acceptor-labeled polyclonal anti-NP and -SP antibodies. Using recombinant proteins and cell culture-grown SARS-CoV-2, the limits of detection were established as 25 pg of NP or 20 infectious units (IU) and 875 pg of SP or 625 IU. Testing reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-positive (n = 48, with cycle threshold [C(T)] values from 11 to 30) or -negative (n = 96) nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that the assay yielded positive results for all samples with C(T) values of <25 and for a single RT-PCR-negative sample. Virus isolation from the RT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs showed a strong association between the presence of infectious virus and a positive antigen test result. The NP-based assay showed 97.4% (37/38) sensitivity and 100% (10/10) specificity in comparison with virus isolation and 77.1% (37/48) sensitivity and 99.0% (95/96) specificity in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The assay is performed in a buffer that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, and the assay is relatively simple to set up as an “in-house” test. Here, SARS-CoV-2 served as the model pathogen, but the assay principle is applicable to other viral infections, and the test format could easily be adapted to high-throughput testing.","Rusanen, Juuso; Kareinen, Lauri; Szirovicza, Leonora; Uğurlu, Hasan; Levanov, Lev; Jääskeläinen, Anu; Ahava, Maarit; Kurkela, Satu; Saksela, Kalle; Hedman, Klaus; Vapalahti, Olli; Hepojoki, Jussi",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00902-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006662/,238

Unfortunately, the development of novel nonsteroidal female contraceptive medicine has been stalled in the last couple of decades due to the lack of effective screening platforms. Drosophila utilizes conserved signaling pathways for follicle rupture, a final step in ovulation that is essential for female reproduction. Therefore, we explored the potential to use Drosophila as a model to screen compounds that could inhibit follicle rupture and be nonsteroidal contraceptive candidates. Using our ex vivo follicle rupture assay, we screened 1,172 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drugs and identified six drugs that could inhibit Drosophila follicle rupture in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we characterized the molecular actions of these drugs in the inhibition of adrenergic signaling and follicle rupture. Furthermore, we validated that three of the four drugs consistently inhibited mouse follicle rupture in vitro and that two of them did not affect progesterone production. Finally, we showed that chlorpromazine, one of the candidate drugs, can significantly inhibit mouse follicle rupture in vivo. Our work suggests that Drosophila ovulation is a valuable platform for identifying lead compounds for nonsteroidal contraceptive development and highlights the potential of these FDA-approved drugs as novel nonsteroidal contraceptive agents.","Jiang, Kewa; Zhang, Jiyang; Huang, Yuping; Wang, Yingzheng; Xiao, Shuo; Hadden, M.

METHOD: From March 3 to April 4, 2020, 694 consecutive patients from three emergency departments of a large university hospital, for which a hospitalization was planned whatever the reasons, i.e., COVID- or non-COVID-related, underwent a chest CT and one or several RT-PCR tests. Chest CTs were rated as “Surely COVID+,” “Possible COVID+,” or “COVID−” by experienced radiologists. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using the final RT-PCR test as standard of reference. The delays for CT reports and RT-PCR results were recorded and compared. RESULTS: Among the 694 patients, 287 were positive on the final RT-PCR exam. Concerning the 694 chest CT, 308 were rated as “Surely COVID+”, 34 as “Possible COVID+,” and 352 as “COVID−.” When considering only the “Surely COVID+” CT as positive, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV reached 88.9%, 90.2%, 88%, 84.1%, and 92.7%, respectively, with respect to final RT-PCR test. The mean delay for CT reports was three times shorter than for RT-PCR results (187 ± 148 min versus 573 ± 327 min, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: During COVID-19 epidemic phase, chest CT is a rapid and most probably an adequately reliable tool to refer patients requiring hospitalization to the COVID+ or COVID− hospital units, when response times for virological tests are too long. KEY POINTS: • In a large university hospital in Lyon, France, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of chest CT for COVID-19 reached 88.9%, 90.2%, 88%, 84.1%, and 92.7%, respectively, using RT-PCR as standard of reference. • The mean delay for CT reports was three times shorter than for RT-PCR results (187 ± 148 min versus 573 ± 327 min, p < 0.0001). • Due to high accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 and shorter time for CT reports than RT-PCR results, chest CT can be used to orient patients suspected to be positive towards the COVID+ unit to decrease congestion in the emergency departments.","Ducray, Victoria; Vlachomitrou, Anna Sesilia; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Si-Mohamed, Salim; Gouttard, Sylvain; Mansuy, Adeline; Wickert, Florian; Sigal, Alain; Gaymard, Alexandre; Talbot, François; Michel, Catherine; Perpoint, Thomas; Pialat, Jean-Baptiste; Rouviere, Olivier; Milot, Laurent; Cotton, François; Douek, Philippe; Rabilloud, Muriel; Boussel, Loic",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07154-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813105/,238

Most commonly, ERCPs are performed for choledocholithiasis with or without cholangitis, but improvements in technology and technique have allowed for management of pancreatic duct stones, benign and malignant strictures, and bile and pancreatic leaks. As an example of necessity driving innovation, the new disposable duodenoscopes have been introduced into practice. With the advantage of eliminating transmissible infections, they represent a paradigm shift in quality improvement within ERCP. With procedures becoming more complicated, the necessity for anesthesia involvement and safety of propofol use and general anesthesia has become better defined. The improvements in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have allowed for direct bile duct access and EUS facilitated bile duct access for ERCP. In patients with surgically altered anatomy, selective cannulation can be performed with overtube-assisted enteroscopy, laparoscopic surgery assistance, or the EUS-directed transgastric ERCP. Cholangioscopy and pancreatoscopy use has become ubiquitous with defined indications for large bile duct stones, indeterminate strictures, and hepatobiliary and pancreatic neoplasia. This review summarizes the recent advances in infection prevention, quality improvement, pancreaticobiliary access, and management of hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases.

However, the effectiveness of ECMO in patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) is unknown. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72‐year‐old woman who was a passenger of a cruise ship tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) while in quarantine on board using throat swab. Three days after admission, her condition deteriorated, and she was subsequently intubated. On day 6, VV‐ECMO was introduced. Lopinavir/ritonavir was given; continuous renal replacement therapy was also introduced. On day 10, her chest radiography and lung compliance improved. She was weaned off ECMO on day 12. CONCLUSION: Treatment of severe pneumonia in COVID‐19 by ECMO should recognize lung plasticity considering time to ECMO introduction and interstitial biomarkers. In Japan, centralization of ECMO patients has not been sufficient. Thus, we suggest nationwide centralization and further research to respond to the crisis caused by COVID‐19.","Taniguchi, Hayato; Ogawa, Fumihiro; Honzawa, Hiroshi; Yamaguchi, Keishi; Niida, Shoko; Shinohara, Mafumi; Takahashi, Kohei; Iwashita, Masayuki; Abe, Takeru; Kubo, Sousuke; Kudo, Makoto; Takeuchi, Ichiro",Acute Med Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313662/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.509,238

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the challenges facing caregivers of CWD during the pandemic, and to explore these challenges from various physical, social, psychological, and financial aspects. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was conducted in Palestine, a total of 130 caregivers of CWD completed a survey consisting of demographic and clinical characteristics questionnaire and the short version of the burden scale for family caregivers (BSFC-s) between March and May 2021. RESULTS: Most of the caregivers were mothers (76.9%), the mean age of the children was (6.09 ± 3.43 years). The majority (88.5%) of the caregivers felt physically exhausted, about (75.4%) had decreased living standards, and (86.2%) indicated that caregiving is taking their strength. A high burden score was recorded, the mean BSFC-s score was 20.17 ± 5.57. Significant differences in BSFC-s scores were recorded based on the type of disability, and child’s ability to take care of oneself, P < .05. The total scores of the BSFC-s were positively correlated with the physical, social, psychological, and financial challenges facing the caregivers (P < .001).

However, where is it origin and which animals are sensitive to cross-species transmission is unclear. The interaction of virus and cell receptor is a key determinant of host range for the novel coronavirus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is demonstrated as the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 entry mediated by ACE2 of 11 different species of animals, and discovered that ACE2 of Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bat), Felis catus (domestic cat), Canis lupus familiaris (dog), Sus scrofa (pig), Capra hircus (goat) and especially Manis javanica (Malayan pangolin) were able to render SARS-CoV-2 entry in non-susceptible cells. This is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the presume that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. However, none of the ACE2 proteins from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (greater horseshoe bat), Gallus gallus (chicken), Notechis scutatus (mainland tiger snake), Mus musculus (house mouse) rendered SARS-CoV-2 entry. Specifically, a natural isoform of Macaca mulatta (Rhesus monkey) ACE2 with a mutation of Y217N was resistance to infection, which rises the possible impact of this type of ACE2 during monkey studies of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, these results clarify that SARS-CoV-2 could engage receptors of multiple species of animals and it is a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and its intermediate hosts. IMPORTANCE In this study, we illustrated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to engage receptors of multiple species of animals. This indicated that it may be a perplexed work to track SARS-CoV-2 origin and discover its intermediate hosts. This feature of virus is considered to potentiate its diverse cross-species transmissibility. Of note, here is the first report that ACE2 of Pangolin could mediate SARS-CoV-2 entry which increases the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 may have a pangolin origin. And we also demonstrated that not all species of bat were sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. At last, it is also important to detect the expression ratio of the Y217N ACE2 to the prototype in Rhesus monkeys to be recruited for studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tang, Yan-Dong; Li, Yu-Ming; Sun, Jing; Zhang, Hong-Liang; Wang, Tong-Yun; Sun, Ming-Xia; Yang, Yue-Lin; Hu, Xiao-Liang; Zhao, Jincun; Cai, Xui-Hui",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.153916,238

It is the foundation for many protocols, including medical care systems, government recommendations, epidemic planning, etc. At this time of global COVID-19, credible data on epidemic spread can help governments make better decisions. This study's aim is to evaluate the cyclicity in the number of daily diagnosed coronavirus patients, thus allowing governments to plan how to allocate their resources more effectively. METHODS: : To assess this cycle, we consider the time series of the first and second differences in the number of registered patients in different countries. The spectral densities of the time series are calculated, and the frequencies and amplitudes of the maximum spectral peaks are estimated. RESULTS: : It is shown that two types of cycles can be distinguished in the time series of the case numbers. Cyclical fluctuations of the first type are characterized by periods from 100 to 300 days. Cyclical fluctuations of the second type are characterized by a period of about seven days. For different countries, the phases of the seven-day fluctuations coincide. It is assumed that cyclical fluctuations of the second type are associated with the weekly cycle of population activity.

679622,Peru to punish bending of clinical-trial rules,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Given that the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, a method to accurately distinguish COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is urgently needed. However, the spatial uncertainty and morphological diversity of COVID-19 lesions in the lungs, and subtle differences with respect to CAP, make differential diagnosis non-trivial. METHODS: We propose a deep represented multiple instance learning (DR-MIL) method to fulfill this task. A 3D volumetric CT scan of one patient is treated as one bag and ten CT slices are selected as the initial instances. For each instance, deep features are extracted from the pre-trained ResNet-50 with fine-tuning and represented as one deep represented instance score (DRIS). Each bag with a DRIS for each initial instance is then input into a citation k-nearest neighbor search to generate the final prediction. A total of 141 COVID-19 and 100 CAP CT scans were used. The performance of DR-MIL is compared with other potential strategies and state-of-the-art models. RESULTS: : DR-MIL displayed an accuracy of 95% and an area under curve of 0.943, which were superior to those observed for comparable methods. COVID-19 and CAP exhibited significant differences in both the DRIS and the spatial pattern of lesions (p<0.001). As a means of content-based image retrieval, DR-MIL can identify images used as key instances, references, and citers for visual interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: : DR-MIL can effectively represent the deep characteristics of COVID-19 lesions in CT images and accurately distinguish COVID-19 from CAP in a weakly supervised manner. The resulting DRIS is a useful supplement to visual interpretation of the spatial pattern of lesions when screening for COVID-19.","Qi, Shouliang; Xu, Caiwen; Li, Chen; Tian, Bin; Xia, Shuyue; Ren, Jigang; Yang, Liming; Wang, Hanlin; Yu, Hui",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0169260721004806; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721004806?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34536634/,238

All BPPV patients received a definitive diagnosis which excluded secondary BPPV. Non-BPPV cases excluded BPPV, sudden deafness, Meniere's disease, ear or craniofacial surgery, vestibular neuritis, and head trauma history.

To get the time of physical activities and recumbent positions, we asked the patient or their family from February 2020 to June 2020, and the rest of the patient's information was acquired by phone or WeChat. Data Analyses: The t-test or chi-squared test, univariate, and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed for the two groups. For each factor, odds ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Moreover, test equality of two or more receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to the physical activities, and recumbent position time; area under curve (AUC) measures were calculated with 95% CIs and compared with each other. Results: The BPPV group had unhealthy lifestyles such as poor physical activities, prolonged recumbent position time, and low rate of calcium or VD supplementation in univariate logistic regression analyses (P < 0.05). Poor physical activities and prolonged recumbent position time were independently associated with BPPV in multiple logistic regression models (OR = 18.92, 95% CI: 6.34–56.43, p = 0.00 and OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01–1.33, p < 0.04). In the comparison of ROC curves of recumbent position time and physical activities in identifying BPPV, AUCs were 0.68 (0.61–0.74), and 0.68 (0.63–0.73), respectively. Conclusion: We conclude that poor physical activities and prolonged recumbent position time may be independent risk factors for BPPV patients, but hypertension, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, hemoglobin, diabetes, serum bilirubin, CHD, and CI, may not be.","Fu, Chang-yong; Zhang, Zhen-zhong; Chen, Jin; Jaiswal, Sandip Kumar; Yan, Fu-ling",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178091/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00950,238

METHODS: Retrospective case-control study of 160 hip fractures operated upon between December 2019 and May 2020. Based on the date of declaration of national lockdown, the cohort was separated into two groups: ‘pre-COVID time’ (PCT), including 86 patients, and ‘COVID time’ (CT), consisting of 74 patients. All CT patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were stratified based on demographic characteristics. Outcome measures were 30-day complications, readmissions and mortality. A logistic regression model was run to evaluate factors associated with mortality. RESULTS: Age, female/male ratio, body mass index and American Society of Anaesthesia score were similar between both groups (p > 0.05). CT patients had a higher percentage of Charlson ≥ 5 and Rockwood Frailty Index ≥ 5 scores (p < 0.05) as well as lower UCLA and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scores (p < 0.05). This translated into a higher hemiarthroplasty/total hip arthroplasty ratio during CT (p = 0.04). Thromboembolic disease was higher during CT (p = 0.02). Readmissions (all negative for SARS-CoV-2) were similar between both groups (p = 0.34). Eight (10.8%) casualties were detected in the CT group, whereas no deaths were seen in the control group. Logistic regression showed that frailer (p = 0.006, OR 10.46, 95%CI 8.95–16.1), less active (p = 0.018, OR 2.45, 95%CI 1.45–2.72) and those with a thromboembolic event (p = 0.005, OR 30, 95%CI 11–42) had a higher risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, CT patients were less active and frailer than PCT patients, depicting an epidemiological shift that was associated with higher mortality rate.","Slullitel, Pablo A.; Lucero, Carlos M.; Soruco, Maria L.; Barla, Jorge D.; Benchimol, Javier A.; Boietti, Bruno R.; Zanotti, Gerardo; Comba, Fernando; Taype-Zamboni, Danilo R.; Carabelli, Guido S.; Piccaluga, Francisco; Sancineto, Carlos F.; Diehl, Maria; Buttaro, Martin A.",Int Orthop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772318/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04769-6,238

In order for a SARS-CoV like virus circulating in wild life for a very long time to infect the index case-patient, a number of conditions must be met, foremost among which is the encounter with humans and the presence in homo sapiens of a cellular receptor allowing the virus to bind. Recently it was shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binds to the human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This molecule is a peptidase expressed at the surface of lung epithelial cells and other tissues, that regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Humans are not equal with respect to the expression levels of the cellular ACE2. Moreover, ACE2 polymorphisms were recently described in human populations. Here we review the most recent evidence that ACE2 expression and/or polymorphism could influence both the susceptibility of people to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the outcome of the COVID-19 disease. Further exploration of the relationship between the virus, the peptidase function of ACE2 and the levels of angiotensin II in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should help to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease and the multi-organ failures observed in severe COVID-19 cases, particularly heart failure.","Devaux, Christian A.; Rolain, Jean-Marc; Raoult, Didier",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.04.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414646/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220301092?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220301092,238

This is not a common appearance for community-acquired pneumonia, but when it occurs this appearance indicates a serious infection that is likely caused by a virulent organism. Patients with a documented viral infection such as influenza who develop this pattern have most likely developed a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Multifocal air space opacities are a common appearance for hospital-acquired pneumonias, especially for patients in the intensive care setting. Fungal pneumonias should be considered when the chest x-ray is suggestive of pneumonia and cultures for bacterial infection are negative. Immune compromised patients are at high risk for aggressive fungal infections. Multifocal air space opacities are not a common appearance for tuberculosis, but it must be excluded in patients who either present with associated cavities or develop cavities. Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma is the most likely tumor to have this appearance and must be considered in an afebrile patient with a chest x-ray that looks like a multifocal pneumonia. This is a rare appearance for chronic lung diseases, but it may result from sarcoidosis, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and silicosis or coal worker’s pneumoconiosis.","Reed, James C.",Chest Radiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323498319000166; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323498319000166,238

We developed an institutional algorithm to protect operating room team members during the COVID-19 pandemic and rationally conserve personal protective equipment (PPE). STUDY DESIGN: An interventional platform (operating room, interventional suite, and endoscopy) PPE taskforce was convened by the hospital and medical school leadership and tasked with developing a common algorithm for PPE use, to be used throughout the interventional platform. In conjunction with our infectious disease experts, we developed our guidelines based on potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure, and conservation of PPE. RESULTS: A decision tree algorithm describing our institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members was created. This algorithm is based on urgency of operation, anticipated viral burden at the surgical site, opportunity for a procedure to aerosolize virus, and likelihood a patient could be infected based on symptoms and testing.

At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Development We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","Serrano-Castro, P. J.; Estivill-Torrús, G.; Cabezudo-García, P.; Reyes-Bueno, J.

This study is to examine the effect of airline transport regulation on confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease in megacities in China. METHODS: This study combines the multi-source data from the health data platform DXY, the airline data platform Airsavvi, the China Economic Internet Statistical Database and the China Railway website. The megacities whose airports have a passenger throughput of over 30 million per year (11 megacities: Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Kunming, Xi'an, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Nanjing) are included in the analysis. The regression analysis is conducted in this study. RESULTS: The curvilinear relationship between the limitation on air traffic and confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus disease is identified (coefficient of the linear term = −4.650, p-value < 0.01; coefficient of the quadratic term = 4.089, p-value < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the effectiveness of airline transport regulation in suppressing the development of this pandemic. The limitation on air traffic is found to negatively affect the confirmed cases in China's megacities. However, such effect marginally recedes as the strength of limitation intensifies. It suggests that comprehensive policy intervention is in need and air traffic can be one of important determinants that affect the epidemic development.","Li, Jiannan; Huang, Chulan; Wang, Zhaoguo; Yuan, Bocong; Peng, Fei",J Transp Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2020.100959; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214140520301638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33020730/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140520301638,238

Higher antioxidant activity was found in baby leaves, followed by adult leaves and inflorescences. A phenolic fraction of the plant was enriched using adsorbent resin column chromatography (Diaion(TM) HP20LX, and Relite EXA90). Antitumoral effects were observed with the enriched fractions in breast (MCF-7) and pancreatic (AsPC-1) cancer cell lines, being more pronounced in the latter. To improve protection and membrane absorption rates of phenolic compounds, nano-phytosomes and cholesterol-conjugated phytosomes coated with natural polymers were loaded with the enriched fraction. The particles were characterized, and their physiochemical properties were evaluated and compared. All samples presented anionic charge and nanometer size in relation to the inner layer and micrometer size regarding the external layers. In addition, the molecular arrangement of phenolics within both types of phytosomes were studied for the first time by molecular docking. Polarity and molecular size were key factors on the molecular arrangement of the lipid bilayer. In conclusion, G. tinctoria showed to be an interesting source of nutrients and phenolic compounds with anti-tumoral potential.

However, preventing the contamination of HCWs and the environment during PPE removal crucially requires improved strategies. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of three PPE ensembles, namely, Hospital Authority (HA) Standard Ebola PPE set (PPE1), Dupont Tyvek Model, style 1422A (PPE2), and HA isolation gown for routine patient care and performing aerosol-generating procedures (PPE3) to prevent EVD transmission by measuring the degree of contamination of HCWs and the environment. METHODS: A total of 59 participants randomly performed PPE donning and doffing. The trial consisted of PPE donning, applying fluorescent solution on the PPE surface, PPE doffing of participants, and estimation of the degree of contamination as indicated by the number of fluorescent stains on the working clothes and environment. Protocol deviations during PPE donning and doffing were monitored. RESULTS: PPE2 and PPE3 presented higher contamination risks than PPE1. Environmental contaminations such as those originating from rubbish bin covers, chairs, faucets, and sinks were detected. Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing, with PPE1 presenting the lowest overall deviation rate (%) among the three PPE ensembles (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Contamination of the subjects’ working clothes and surrounding environment occurred frequently during PPE doffing. Procedure deviations were observed during PPE donning and doffing. Although PPE1 presented a lower contamination risk than PPE2 and PPE3 during doffing and protocol deviations, the design of PPE1 can still be further improved. Future directions should focus on designing a high-coverage-area PPE with simple ergonomic features and on evaluating the doffing procedure to minimise the risk of recontamination. Regular training for users should be emphasised to minimise protocol deviations, and in turn, guarantee the best protection to HCWs.

The risk and protective factors associated with high compliance to these preventive measures are critical to enhancing pandemic preparedness. OBJECTIVE: This survey aims to assess differences in mental health, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of preventive measures for COVID-19 amongst healthcare professionals (HCP) and non-healthcare professionals. DESIGN: Multi-national cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May-June 2020. SETTING: Multi-national survey was distributed across 36 countries through social media, word-of-mouth, and electronic mail. PARTICIPANTS: Participants ≥21 years working in healthcare and non-healthcare related professions. MAIN OUTCOME: Risk factors determining the difference in KAP towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures during COVID-19 amongst HCP and non-HCP. RESULTS: HCP were significantly more knowledgeable on personal hygiene (AdjOR 1.45, 95% CI -1.14 to 1.83) and social distancing (AdjOR 1.31, 95% CI -1.06 to 1.61) compared to non-HCP. They were more likely to have a positive attitude towards personal hygiene and 1.5 times more willing to participate in the contact tracing app. There was high compliance towards personal hygiene and social distancing measures amongst HCP. HCP with high compliance were 1.8 times more likely to flourish and more likely to have a high sense of emotional (AdjOR 1.94, 95% CI (1.44 to 2.61), social (AdjOR 2.07, 95% CI -1.55 to 2.78), and psychological (AdjOR 2.13, 95% CI (1.59–2.85) well-being. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: While healthcare professionals were more knowledgeable, had more positive attitudes, their higher sense of total well-being was seen to be more critical to enhance compliance.

Nanozymes can catalyze the same reactions as performed by enzymes in nature. In contrast the intrinsic shortcomings of natural enzymes such as high manufacturing cost, low operational stability, production complexity, harsh catalytic conditions and difficulties of recycling, did not limit their wide applications. The broad interest in enzymatic nanomaterial relies on their outstanding properties such as stability, high activity, and rigidity to harsh environments, long-term storage and easy preparation, which make them a convenient substitute instead of the native enzyme. These abilities make the nanozymes suitable for multiple applications in sensing and imaging, tissue engineering, environmental protection, satisfactory tumor diagnostic and therapeutic, because of distinguished properties compared with other artificial enzymes such as high biocompatibility, low toxicity, size dependent catalytic activities, large surface area for further bioconjugation or modification and also smart response to external stimuli. This review summarizes and highlights latest progress in applications of metal and metal oxide nanomaterials with enzyme/multienzyme mimicking activities. We cover the applications of sensing, cancer therapy, water treatment and anti-bacterial efficacy. We also put forward the current challenges and prospects in this research area, hoping to extension of this emerging field.

688122,Eicosanoid signaling as a therapeutic target in middle-aged mice with severe COVID-19,2021-04-21,"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly infectious and contagious viral disease of chickens caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to the genus Coronavirus and family Coronaviridae. It can affect all age groups of birds. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of innate immune pattern recognition receptors that have a key role in immune response and defense against various infections.The TLRs are essential for initiation of innate immune responses and in the development of adaptive immune responses. An in ovo model was employed to study the antiviral activity of TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN) on replication of IBV. It was hypothesized that optimum dose and specific timing of TLR ligands may reduce viral load of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). Further, the mechanism involved in the TLR-mediated antiviral response in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of ECEs was investigated. The ECEs of 9–11 days old were treated with different doses (high, intermediate and low) of TLR-2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR-4 (LPS) and TLR-21 (CpG ODN) ligands. In addition, to know the timing of TLR ligand treatment, six time intervals were analyzed viz. 36, 24 and 12 h prior to infection, time of infection (co-administration of TLR ligands and avian IBV) and 12 and 24 h post-IBV infection. For studying the relative expression of immuno-stimulatory genes (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-1β, iNOS and OAS) in CAM, TLR ligands were administered through intra-allantoicroute and CAM were collected at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment. The results demonstrated that intermediate dose of all the three TLR ligands significantly reduced virus titers and used in the present study. However, the LPS reduced virus titer pre- and post-IBV infection but Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced only pre-IBV infection. Further analysis showed that TLR ligands induced IFN-γ, IL-1β and IFN stimulated genes viz. iNOS and OAS genes in CAM. The present study pointed towards the novel opportunities for rational design of LPS as immuno-stimulatory agent in chickens with reference to IBV. It may be speculated that in ovo administration of these TLR ligands may enhance resistance against viral infection in neonatal chicken and may contribute towards the development of more effective and safer vaccines including in ovo vaccines.","Sharma, Bal Krishan; Kakker, Naresh Kumar; Bhadouriya, Sakshi; Chhabra, Rajesh",Mol Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.02.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161589019306418; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589019306418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065987/,238
688248,Heparin-Related Major Bleeding in Covid-19-Positive Patient: Perspective from the Outbreak,2020-05-28,"Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and specific ethnicities (Black and Hispanic) have been reported to be common comorbidities and possible risk factors for the severity of both COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza infections. Thus, it is important to understand why these four risk factors are common to both COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza infections, and whether a common mechanism exists. Respiratory failure is the most important pathology that contributes to the severity of both COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza infections. Additionally, obesity has been reported to be a risk factor for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a serious clinical manifestation of both COVID-19 and H1N1 infections. Obesity is a risk factor for hypertension. Most of the previous studies showing hypertension as a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 and H1N1 infections were either not based on multiple logistic regression analyses or did not include obesity or BMI as an explanatory variable in their multiple logistic regression models. Moreover, similar attention is needed when specifying patients with diabetes or of specific ethnicities (Black and Hispanic) as potentially more vulnerable to either infection, because obesity also correlates with diabetes, and is more prevalent in these ethnicities. Notably, a retrospective cohort study has shown that obesity or high BMI are predictive risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of age, diabetes, and hypertension. Associations between hypertension, diabetes, ethnicities and severity of COVID-19 and H1N1 infections may be confounded by obesity to a considerable extent. This article is protected by copyright.

688297,A longitudinal clinical and MRI evaluation of the treatment with erenumab,2020-08-26,"At present, routine dermatology practices stay mostly disrupted worldwide owing to the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic. However, dermatology services need to be resumed in future and dermatologists especially in developing countries face a mammoth task of devising plans to tackle the upcoming surge of patients while still maintaining the precautions to avoid risk of infection to health care workers and our patients. Teledermatology practice is a viable alternative and there is need of starting functioning teledermatology centers at primary health care centers and training health care workers in telemedicine. Several steps like increasing the working hours of outpatient clinics, posting dermatologists and health staffs in shifts, encouraging online registration and payment, providing time slots to patients should be taken to prevent overcrowding at outpatient departments in hospitals of developing countries like India where the usual patient turnover during summers maybe around 600 to 800 per day. Once diagnosed by the dermatologist, a subsequent meticulous use of teledermatology can limit the number of follow‐up visits. To avoid student gatherings, the undergraduate and postgraduate teaching schedule should be replaced by online or virtual teaching in form of webinars and video conferencing. Above all, intense upgradation of health care infrastructure, recruitment, training of new health care staffs on mass level and huge investment in health care sector is required in all the developing countries.","Kumar, Sheetanshu; Bishnoi, Anuradha; Vinay, Keshavamurthy",Dermatol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32347612/; https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.13472,238
688892,Plasma Exchange for COVID-19 Thrombo-Inflammatory Disease,2020-11-05,"Purpose Amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, traditional teaching methodology took a back foot. However, an urgent need for training health care worker (HCW) on preventive measures for COVID-19 infection was the need of the hour. Keeping in mind the precautionary measures required to combat COVID-19 infection, the only promising option for training was by adopting an online learning method. This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of video-based training using online platforms for infection prevention and control (IPC) training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A quasi-experimental study, with only one experimental group comprising of HCWs, was undertaken to assess the effect of intervention which included video-assisted teaching-learning regarding IPC measures with a special focus on COVID-19 at a tertiary care Institute in North India. Online sessions were conducted on Do’s and Don’ts, Hand Hygiene, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning and disinfection, and bio-medical waste (BMW) management with the help of pre-recorded videos which was pre-validated. The session was followed by online interaction with participants by a single resource person. Pre-test and post-test were conducted through google forms before commencement and at the end of the online session respectively. The data were analyzed in terms of descriptive frequencies and percentages of different domains to describe the pre- and post-test knowledge. Results A total of 576 participants were included in the study. There was a statistically significant gain in scores of all questions related to cleaning and disinfection; and BMW. No significant change was observed in knowledge regarding the sequence of doffing (p-value: 0.94). The result of pairwise comparisons pre-test and post-test scores showed that intervention through video-assisted teaching-learning resulted in improvement of knowledge which was found to be statistically significant (p-value < 0.001). Conclusion Video-assisted teaching-learning through virtual platforms effectively trained health personnel on infection prevention and control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video-assisted training can successfully be handled by a single resource person to impart the knowledge and skill to the trainee. Virtual teaching and learning is a feasible and efficient method to deliver training to HCWs on infection control practices and this methodology may be adopted in the future for several other training in manpower crunch situations, similar restrictive circumstances as posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Rakesh; Mohanty, Aroop; Singh, Vanya; S, Vishwas A; Gupta, Puneet K; Jelly, Prasuna; Gupta, Pratima; Rao, Shalinee",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34094747/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14785,238

689767,Role of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Understudied Populations,2021,"Aptamers can control the biological functions of enzymes, thereby facilitating the development of novel biosensors. While aptamers that inhibit catalytic reactions of enzymes were found and used as signal transducers to sense target molecules in biosensors, no aptamers that amplify enzymatic activity have been identified. In this study, we report G-quadruplex (G4)-forming DNA aptamers that upregulate the peroxidase activity in myoglobin specifically for luminol. Using in vitro selection, one G4-forming aptamer that enhanced chemiluminescence from luminol by myoglobin's peroxidase activity was discovered. Through our strategy—in silico maturation, which is a genetic algorithm-aided sequence manipulation method, the enhancing activity of the aptamer was improved by introducing mutations to the aptamer sequences. The best aptamer conserved the parallel G4 property with over 300-times higher luminol chemiluminescence from peroxidase activity more than myoglobin alone at an optimal pH of 5.0. Furthermore, using hemin and hemin-binding aptamers, we demonstrated that the binding property of the G4 aptamers to heme in myoglobin might be necessary to exert the enhancing effect. Structure determination for one of the aptamers revealed a parallel-type G4 structure with propeller-like loops, which might be useful for a rational design of aptasensors utilizing the G4 aptamer-myoglobin pair.","Tsukakoshi, Kaori; Yamagishi, Yasuko; Kanazashi, Mana; Nakama, Kenta; Oshikawa, Daiki; Savory, Nasa; Matsugami, Akimasa; Hayashi, Fumiaki; Lee, Jinhee; Saito, Taiki; Sode, Koji; Khunathai, Kanjana; Kuno, Hitoshi; Ikebukuro, Kazunori",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095949/; https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab388,238

This study aimed to explore the lived experience of physicians and nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 in Jordan. An interpretative phenomenology approach was used, and sampling was purposively performed. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews using an online meeting platform (Zoom(®)). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed. The data were obtained from 26 physicians and nurses caring for patients with COVID-19. The mean age of the participants was 29.41 years (SD = 2.72). Six main themes and 17 subthemes were identified: (i) emotional reactions; (ii) preparation; (iii) source of support; (iv) extreme workload; (v) occupational challenges, and (vi) work-related concerns. The results showed that nurses and physicians caring for COVID-19 patients in Jordan were experiencing mental and emotional distress and were practicing under inadequate work conditions. This distress could be multifactorial with personal, organizational, or cultural origins. Our findings may guide policymakers to consider the potential factors that significantly affect working environment in healthcare settings, the physical and mental wellbeing of HCWs, and the required professional training that can help in enhancing resilience and coping strategies amidst crises.","Khatatbeh, Moawiah; Alhalaiqa, Fadwa; Khasawneh, Aws; Al-Tammemi, Ala’a B.; Khatatbeh, Haitham; Alhassoun, Sameera; Al Omari, Omar",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501587/,238
690680,Consensus statement and recommendations on the treatment of COVID-19: 2021 update.,2021-09-03,"BACKGROUND: Since the first diagnosed case of infection with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), there has been a rapid spread of the disease with an increasing number of cases confirmed every day, as well as a rising death toll. An association has been reported between acute kidney injury (AKI) and mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our study was conducted to explore possible risk factors of AKI as well as whether AKI was a risk factor for worse outcome, especially mortality among patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: We included all hospital admissions with confirmed or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 from January 29 to February 25, 2020. We collected demographic and epidemiological information, past medical history, symptoms, laboratory tests, treatments, and outcome data from electronic medical records. A total of 492 patients with diagnosed or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 were included in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of AKI was 7.32%. Among the factors associated with AKI, males versus females (aOR 2.73), chronic kidney disease (aOR 42.2), hypertension (aOR 2.82), increased leucocytes (aOR 6.08), and diuretic use (aOR 7.89) were identified as independent risk factors for AKI among patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. There was a significant difference in hospital fees and death in patients with and without AKI (p < 0.05). The mortality rate in patients with AKI was 63.9%. CONCLUSIONS: AKI was widespread among patients with COVID-19. The risk factors of AKI in COVID-19 patients included sex, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, infection, and diuretic use. AKI may be associated with a worse outcome, especially mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Dai, Yujie; Liu, Zhifen; Du, Xingguo; Wei, Honglan; Wu, Yang; Li, Hua; Tian, Ming; Li, Chengxu; Song, Xiaohong; Wu, Weicong; Cai, Yuan; Yu, Yikai; Hu, Shaoxian; Dong, Junwu",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6655185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506027/,238
