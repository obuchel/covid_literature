200882,Virtual visitation: Conceptualization and metrics for digital twinning of large interactive social events,2021,"AIM To obtain the information of ligand-receptor binding between the S protein of SARS-CoV and CD13, identify the possible interacting domains or motifs related to binding sites, and provide clues for studying the functions of SARS proteins and designing anti-SARS drugs and vaccines. METHODS On the basis of comparative genomics, the homology search, phylogenetic analyses, and multi-sequence alignment were used to predict CD13 related interacting domains and binding sites in the S protein of SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling and docking simulation methods were employed to address the interaction feature between CD13 and S protein of SARS-CoV in validating the bioinformatics predictions. RESULTS Possible binding sites in the SARS-CoV S protein to CD13 have been mapped out by using bioinformatics analysis tools. The binding for one protein-protein interaction pair (D757-R761 motif of the SARS-CoV S protein to P585-A653 domain of CD13) has been simulated by molecular modeling and docking simulation methods. CONCLUSION CD13 may be a possible receptor of the SARS-CoV S protein, which may be associated with the SARS infection. This study also provides a possible strategy for mapping the possible binding receptors of the proteins in a genome.","Yu, Xiao-Jing; Luo, Cheng; Lin, Jian-Cheng; Hao, Pei; He, You-Yu; Guo, Zong-Ming; Qin, Lei; Su, Jiong; Liu, Bo-Shu; Huang, Yin; Nan, Peng; Li, Chuan-Song; Xiong, Bin; Luo, Xiao-Min; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Pei, Gang; Chen, Kai-Xian; Shen, Xu; Shen, Jian-Hua; Zou, Jian-Ping; He, Wei-Zhong; Shi, Tie-Liu; Zhong, Yang; Jiang, Hua-Liang; Li, Yi-Xue",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12791172/,946
220877,Modelling for ethical concerns for traceability in time of pandemic “do no harm” or “better safe than sorry!”,2021,"The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in December 2019 and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. This sparked a plethora of investigations into diagnostics and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, as well as treatments for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with a high mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a data monitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB). DMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitment requiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use of complex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In this paper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspects of setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trials with more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs. Furthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatments for COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding the presentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use of external data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulation study motivated by clinical trials in COVID-19.","Mütze, Tobias; Friede, Tim",Contemp Clin Trials,,946
224471,Stakeholder and value orientation in digital social innovation: Designing a digital donation concept to support homeless neighbors,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has significantly affected the lives of many people across North Carolina and the United States. Similar to the rest of the country, the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the state indicates health disparities among Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals, the presence of hotspots, or counties with high numbers of infected persons, and clusters of transmission among congregate living facilities. There have been many advances in diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2 and therapies for hospitalized patients nationwide. Public health strategies have included widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2, optimal management of cases, contact tracing efforts, and a phased reopening of sectors/activities in North Carolina with masks and physical distancing to minimize spread of the virus. In this issue, several authors, researchers, and public health leaders discuss the challenges that North Carolinians have experienced with respect to COVID-19 and several factors that are likely contributing to the health disparities among racial/ethnic minorities who have had the highest number of cases and deaths from SARS-CoV-2. Additional strategies also reported in this issue include the use of strike teams and mobile units to reach populations at high risk for infection and severe illness. Promoting individual and population-level strategies for minimizing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially among the most vulnerable, and consistent public health messaging based on science are critical as we face the new year and continued uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic.","Seña, Arlene C; Weber, David J",N C Med J,,946

This study provides genomic evidence of multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) introductions into Sri Lanka and virus evolution during circulation. Whole-genome sequences of four SARS-CoV-2 strains obtained from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive patients reported in Sri Lanka during March 2020 were compared with sequences from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and North America. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequence of the sample of the first local patient collected on 10 March, who contacted tourists from Italy, was clustered with SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from Italy, Germany, France and Mexico. Subsequently, the sequence of the isolate obtained on 19 March also clustered in the same group with the samples collected in March and April from Belgium, France, India and South Africa. The other two strains of SARS-CoV-2 were segregated from the main cluster, and the sample collected from 16 March clustered with England and the sample collected on 30 March showed the highest genetic divergence to the isolate of Wuhan, China. Here we report the first molecular epidemiological study conducted on circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Sri Lanka. The finding provides the robustness of molecular epidemiological tools and their application in tracing possible exposure in disease transmission during the pandemic.","Satharasinghe, Dilan Amila; Parakatawella, Parakatawella Mudiyanselage Shalini Daupadi Kumari; Premarathne, Jayasekara Mudiyanselage Krishanthi Jayarukshi Kumari; Jayasooriya, L J P Anura P; Prathapasinghe, Gamika A; Yeap, Swee Keong",Epidemiol Infect,,946

284622,A link communities analysis of the UK instagram covid-19 searchable metadiscourse,2021,"Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease- as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.","Hindes, Jason; Bianco, Simone; Schwartz, Ira B",PLoS One,,946

473827,Collaborative innovation (or Not?!) when product performance is critical,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the current worldwide pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was first diagnosed in Iceland at the end of February. However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7% and 13.7%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result, as compared with 0.8% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer females than males received positive results both in targeted testing (11.0% vs. 16.7%) and in population screening (0.6% vs. 0.9%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected participants that was determined through population screening remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening. CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The proportion of infected persons identified through population screening did not change substantially during the screening period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of containment efforts.

491622,Ubiquitous and comprehensive healthcare: Expanding technologies and systems to enable new delivery models,2021,"Face-to-face outreach and in-person training have traditionally been key strategies in reaching agricultural producers, workers, and communities with safety and health information, but the COVID-19 pandemic has forced outreach educators to be creative and find alternative ways to reach, communicate, and share such information. In this commentary, we describe our use of social media to reach Latino/a cattle feedyard workers with COVID-19 related information. As a result of our effort, we reached over 54,000 people and demonstrated there is an audience for Spanish-language agricultural safety and health information. Social media can be a cost-effective method for virtual outreach in this new normal. We should look at this time as an opportunity to learn more about how our stakeholders obtain information and about how best we can connect with them. Although our outreach methods may be changing, our goal is not - we will continue to work to improve the safety and health of those who work in agriculture.","Ramos, Athena K; Duysen, Ellen; Carvajal-Suarez, Marcela; Trinidad, Natalia",J Agromedicine,,946
634575,Reducing costs and infections related to hospitalisation for TB,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a range of extra-respiratory signs and symptoms. One such manifestation is delirium, an acute confusional state occurring in 60-70% of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases. Delirium is also a common clinical syndrome following planned orthopedic surgery. This investigation initially explored the underlying role of metabolism in delirium-susceptibility in this setting. Metabolomics profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood taken prior to surgery found significant concentration differences of several amino acids, acylcarnitines and polyamines were observed in delirium-prone patients. Phenethylamine (PEA) concentrations in delirium-prone patients was significantly lower in CSF than in blood, whilst in age- and gender-matched controls the opposite was observed (adjusted p values: 1.8x10-6 (control) and 1.788x10-10 (delirium)). PEA is metabolised by monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), a putative enzyme target for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and depression. Our computational structural comparisons of MAOB and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 found high similarity, specifically within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. MAOB structural alignment to ACE2 was 51% overall, but this was over 95% in the ACE2-spike protein binding region. Thus, it is possible that the spike protein interacts with MAOB on a molecular level. A previously published metabolomic dataset of control subjects and patients with either mild or severe COVID-19 was then analysed. Major concentration differences in some metabolites attributed to altered MAO activity were detected. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 influences MAOB activity, which is one potential cause for the many observed neurological and platelet based complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Cuperlovic-Culf, M.; Cunningham, E.
